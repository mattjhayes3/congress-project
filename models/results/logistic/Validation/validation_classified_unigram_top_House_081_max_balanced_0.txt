laying the cornerstone of the new chamber which replaced it at the close of the war the prime minister said the enemy may have thought that by destroying our chamber they were delivering a blow against democracy but the house of commons is not a building it is a living fellowship renewed through the ages changing in its membership but always in essence the same in that same spirit it may be as truly said that the house of representatives is not merely an agency created by the constitution a conclave of divergent schools of political and economic thought it is a living fellowship of many men of many minds but all of them always desiring the greatest good for the greatest number willing to make any sacrifice to insure the perpetuity of our form of government and the welfare and prosperity of those for whom it provides it is to that concept of the house that i wish to address myself today on a question which affects the nation more vitally than any similar question which has come before the house since the adoption of our budgetary system in 1921 it affects not merely this session of congress but all succeeding sessions for generations yet to come it affects retrenchments not merely of the two or three billion dollars cut from this years estimates but amounts which through future years will aggregate sums so vast as to challenge the comprehension of the human mind it involves considerations of such farreaching consequence as to forcibly recall the many governments and dynasties notably the stuarts of england and the bourbons of france which have been wrecked on the rocks of national insolvency it naturally follows that a question of such import should be considered in the light of the general welfare rather than considerations of personal interest and party advantage the first question should be not how does it affect me or how does it benefit my party but how does it affect the nation and the country and generations yet unborn judged by that criterion the omnibus appropriation billthe consideration of all annual appropriations simultaneously in one bill rather than in a dozen separate and unrelated bills reported from time to time over a period of several monthsoffers the most practical and efficient method of handling the annual budget and the national fiscal program and judged by our experience this session in the adoption of the omnibus bill there is no legitimate reason which can be advanced against it conversely no defensible reason can be submitted against the consideration of all appropriations in one bill these are sweeping statements but they are justified by the literal facts and i have asked for an hour today with a view to yielding to anyone who may have any doubts or any suggestions in this connection at the conclusion of my remarks i shall be glad to entertain any question as to any advantage in the adoption of the onepackage bill or any disadvantage accruing from its operation the annual appropriations deal primarily with questions of business and economics rather than politics and every effort has been made in the consolidation of the several appropriation bills to divorce and disassociate questions of procedure from politics and partisanship from the beginning every step in the improved procedure has been submitted to the two ranking minority members of the committee the gentleman from new york and the gentleman from massachusetts both of whom participated actively in the effort of the house to achieve a workable legislative budget and every recommendation made by them has been adopted in the conference between the subcommittees of the senate appropriations committeeincluding senator bridges and senator fergusonand the house appropriations committee the minority members of both senate and house committees participated in the discussion and when the conference adjourned no disagreement was expressed on the part of any of the democratic or republican senators or representatives present on the procedure which has been followed up to this time it is not a party measure and neither party can possibly gain or lose any political advantage through its adoption except by making it an instrument for carrying out more completely and more effectively their platform pledges of economy and better administration that the consolidation of appropriation bills and the simultaneous consideration of budget recommendations does mean retrenchment and the better allocation of the funds appropriated there can be no doubt in commenting on this phase of the procedure the baltimore evening sun said editorially following the passage of the bill with just one bill it is harder to increase appropriations and easier to cut them in view of the state of the federal finances these are important advantages indeed the experience of the house this session although laboring under exceptional difficulties shows conclusively that the handling of the annual appropriations in one bill speaking categorically first permits an earlier report of appropriations to the house all annual appropriations were reported to the house thisyear on march 21 the earliest date in the history of the committee the foreign aid appropriations were not included because of lack of legislative authority but would have been included at that date had there been authorization second contributes to a more thorough consideration and processing of estimates and appropriations under the old system each member of the committee served on from two to four bills and the committee staffs were similarly handicapped with the result that time and attention were divided proportionately under the new system each member of the committee and each member of the staff give their undivided attention to one chapter of the bill with the result that each bill is studied in greater detail and more thoroughly processed than ever before the effect of this intensive study is reflected in the few changes made when the bill was passed by the committee and the house third consolidation protects the bill against amendments increasing appropriations or adding new appropriations this year for the first time we were able to defeat amendments adding to amounts carried by the bill which in every former session we have been compelled to accept thereby increasing the bill by millions of dollars for example this is the first year we have been able to fight off amendments increasing appropriations for civil functions the pork barrel section of the bill this year the bill as messaged to the senate carried practically no important increases except the committee amendments for national defense fourth the consideration of all appropriations in one bill tends to keep members on the floor under the old system large bills were frequently passed with a scant two dozen members present and proponents of increases in appropriations by timing their attendance could put through amendments which would not have been agreed to with more members present in fact one of the few objections voiced against the omnibus bill is that it irks members by keeping them on the floor i think there will be general agreement that the taxpayers would rather irk the members a little during the consideration of the one bill than to pay the additional taxes due to the absence of members in the pursuit of their official duties elsewhere fifth the plan unquestionably retrenches expenditures the bill as it passed the house was far below the budget estimates and was millions of dollars below what it would have been had the departmental appropriations been reported to the house in a dozen separate bills the washington post editorially emphasized the retrenchment effected by the bill it remains to be seen what the senate will do but the house appropriations committee certainly succeeded in reducing overall appropriations quite substantially the great advantage of a onepackage appropriations bill is that it puts pressure on the appropriations committee to reduce expenditures and produce a more balanced spending program it gives members of congress an opportunity to obtain a comprehensive view of the spending side of the budget picture that tends to curb enthusiasm for new spending projects the delay and confusion resulting from the manhandling of the omnibus appropriation bill by the house does not discredit its value as a legislative tool it merely emphasizes the fact that procedural reforms cannot succeed if congress persists in following unsound legislative practices as a matter of fact the last two amendments intended to decrease expenditures carried by the bill would not have been possible except for the omnibus plan of consideration and the vote in favor of them would not have been so overwhelming had not this plan of operation been in use at the time as the rochester timesunion said as the bill left the house it provided for spending 41 000 000 000 in the year beginning july 1 the presidents budget called for 2 000 000 000 more half the reduction was made by the appropriations committee before the legion was organized but the letters and coupons strengthened committee members to defend the cuts made by the bill itself but a billion dollars is still an enormous amount of money and representative john taber deserves the thanks of all for devising means of saving that much balked by unrecorded teller votes through weeks of debate in trimming specific items he won in the end by his plan ordering cuts of from 2 to 20 percent on the various agencies spending for such things as travel employment transportation communications printing and the like yet the legion of obstinate men and women was bipartisan in the best sense and it should be noted here too that the end obtained was made possible by the fact that representative clarence cannon chairman of the appropriations committee insisted upon a consolidated bill this year to include all domestic appropriations except fixed charges such a blanket cut as taber proposed would have been impossible without a consolidated bill sixth it prevents logrolling we had been told this was one of the defects of the new plan that there would be more logrolling between interests wishing to trade votes in order to add amendments increasing appropriations but in the practical operation of the plan every attempt of special interests to increase the bill was defeated and when the last roll call came on reducing the amounts appropriated in the bill the groups which had been unable to secure increases which they urged for themselves said in effect if we cannot get an increase no one shall have an increase and instead of logrolling to increase the bill they cooperated to reduce the bill our experience with the omnibus bill this session demonstrates that it effectively disposes of the old system of logrolling so prevalent in the consideration of individual departmental bills seventh the one bill visualizes at a glance the outline of national income and expenditures and centers the attention of the country on the national fiscal program it was the pitiless limelight of national attention concentrated on these final votes that offset the pleas and importunities of the pressure groups and special interests the omnibus appropriation bill has made the entire country definitely deficitconscious with all appropriations in one bill accompanied by the figures on federal income there is no escape from the responsibility for deficit spending one of the great disadvantages of the old system with a dozen or more separate bills was that each subcommittee working in its own segregated corner of the budget was spending in the dark not until the last bill was passed and sent to the president at the end of the session frequently long after the expiration of the fiscal year did anyone have any definite idea of how much had been appropriated for the year and what the relation of the various individual bills was to the fiscal program as a whole the baltimore evening sun summarized the situation very succinctly since congress usually changed the appropriations as listed in the budget when the legislators had finished with their appropriations they could only guess what total expenditures would be hence they did not know whether they had thrown the budget more out of balance than before or less with the estimates now provided a more accurate budget picture is available and that is of the utmost importance these and other advantages make the omnibus appropriation bill preferable to the old system with a multiplicity of bills and ysdbel and robert rennie in thdir syndicated column said if there is one thing about the annual budget which has long been clear to congress it is that the annual budget has not been clear to congress again the sun in a subsequent editorial further stressed the contribution of the consolidated bill in this respect the fact is that the budget is much harder to understand when there are 12 separate appropriation bills than when there is 1 bill with 12 bills each part may be understandable but nobody knows anything about the budget as a whole when congress has passed the 12 bills members of the house and senate themselves do not know they only see pieces of a jigsaw puzzle that has not been put together congressmen may have trouble understanding it all when the 12 bills are combined into 1 but both they and the public do know something about the budgetary situation when they get through with that 1 bill the omnibus bill should be continued it not only facilitates an understanding of the budgetary situation but it also facilitates cuts in appropriations as witness the fact that a blanket cut was made in the bill recently passed the very fact that a blanket cut was considered and passed in this instance shows that the new system is better suited to the needs of the present day eighth the handling of all appropriations in the omnibus bill provides for elimination of conflicts duplications and overlapping expenditures the consolidation in one bill supplies opportunity and facilities for identification of all sources of funds allocated to individual agencies some of them difficult of ready determination it was sometimes necessary to trace appropriations through a dozen or more items in a number of different bills under the old system and as a result inevitably there was from time to time provisions for expenditures which would not have been made had the subcommittee in charge of one bill had jurisdiztion of all the items which appropriated money for the activity ninth it discourages the practice of attaching irrelevant riders either in committee or by amendment from the floor too frequently legislation has been tacked on the several appropriation bills under the guise of limitations or by the admission of germane amendments in the general attention focused on the bill all such attempts were turned back and the bill went to the senate singularly free of these impositions on the budget system and covert infringements on the jurisdiction of the legislative committees of the house other advantages derived from the consolidation of appropriations into one bill could be enumerated in fact the most important has not been mentioned here and will await the final passage of the conference report in the house and senate suffice to say the bill in its passage through the house has justified every expectation and vindicated every promise it is the realization of hopes and plans on which congressional parliamentarians and economists have worked since the original adoption of the budget system in 1921 it is the practical adaptation of the idea of the legislative budget proposed in the reorganization act of 1946 on which house and senate labored futilely for 2 years now let us turn to the other side of the ledger and take up such objections as have been mentioned in opposition to the omnibus bill not one of them presents any substantial reason for returning to the old practice from which the house has been struggling to free itself and the country for the past 30 years for example it has been claimed that under the new system the senate must mark time until the bill comes over from the housethat until the omnibus bill passes the senate committees cannot start workwhereas under the old system the senate opened hearings on the first of the multiple supply bills which came over comparatively early in the session and weeks before the onepackage bill could be completed the claim is unfounded on the contrary the senate under the new system may begin work on any of the annual appropriations within a week or two after the session opens and much sooner than before under the schedule followed in handling the omnibus bill in the house the subcommittees start work on all chapters simultaneously and print and transmit to the senate committee and to the press the full hearings up to date on each agency or activity as the hearings progress as a result the senate has practically completed hearings on all chapters of the bill by the time the consolidated bill has passed the housea gain of many weeks on most of the bill over what would have been accomplished had the bill been considered piecemeal as a matter of fact the committees of the two houses are in effect sitting simul taneously thereby saving time formerly lost in waiting for individual bills again it is contended that it took too long to pass the bill of course much of the delay was avoidable under the rules the bill was privileged and was entitled to consideration within 3 days after being reported but other business was pressing for consideration at the time and although the appropriation bill was reported march 21 it could not be called up in the house until april 3a loss of 2 weeks at the start this delayed the bill past the easter holidays and it was not sent to the senate until may 10 but even at that the time required to pass it compared favorably with the time consumed in passing the divided appropriation bills in previous years calculating by days whole or in part on which the bill was considered in former years under the old system and this year as a consolidated bill the time required is tabulated as follows 1938 37 days 1939 31 days 1948 20 days 1950 21 days as will be noted the time required in the second session of the eightieth congress was 20 days and in the second session of the eightyfirst congress including all interruptions it was 21 days as compared with prewar records the time used this year was phenomenally low with ordinary good management in the subcommittees the committee and the house the omnibus bill can be messaged to the senate each year before easter with time to spare and can be passed in the senate and sent to the president in ample time to meet the deadline at the end of the fiscal yeargreatly facilitating early adjournment as the washington post very well said in its editorial of june 6 1950 the slowmoving machinery of congress is largely responsible for the fact that the omnibus bill is now hung up in the senate appropriations committee another objection sometimes made is that the concentration of the annual supply appropriations in one bill prevents the president from exercising the item veto just what the item veto has to do with either the individual bills or the omnibus bill is difficult to understand inasmuch as a constitutional amendment would be required to apply it to either or to any form of appropriation bill this is not the time or the place to take up an extraneous discussion of the disproportional advantage which the item veto would give the executive branch of the government over the legislative branch but in any event the authorization of an item veto by the chief executive would not be effected by the form of the bill such a veto could be used on an omnibus bill as well as on a divided bill and his veto power would be stronger in the former than in the latter as it would be more imperative that congress accede or see every department in the government brought to a standstill however any suggestion relative to the extension of such additional veto power of the presidency is entirely beside the point in a discussion of the operation of the omnibus bill a further criticism is that there has been lack of interest in the bill and that it has been difficult to keep a quorum on the floor that is an old complaint when efforts were being made to secure the consent of speaker cannon to the erection of the first house office building he insisted that once offices and com mittee roomswere provided for members it would be impossible to keep a quorum on the floor his predictions have been frequently vindicatedespecially during general debate on the individual appropriation bills when members burdened with committee hearings and departmental work have waited for the bells to answer roll call the adoption of the consolidated bill has effected no difference per se in this respect however under the old system general debate was not confined to the bill before the house and members usually talked on subjects foreign to the pending measure and those interested in the appropriations had no reason to neglect other business when the debate was on other and unrelated matters but under the omnibus bill all debate is confined to the bill before the house and attendance is correspondingly heavier for every instance cited to indicate a light attendance on the floor during debate on the omnibus bill more instances can be given showing a still lighter attendance during consideration of the individual bills under the old system but the most untenable of all the objections to the omnibus bill is that it is unwieldy the experience of every major nation in the world and every state in the union belies such a proposed criticism england france sweden and other leading nations have for centuries considered their budgets in onepackage bills every state in the union submits its annual budget in an omnibus bill the united states is the notable exception to the rule in any nation or any state the suggestion today that it abandon its timetried method of considering its fiscal program in one bill and resort to the piecemeal expedient of separate bills would be regarded as absurd none of them find it unwieldywhatever that means and the house did not find it unwieldy this time no one finds it unwieldy but the bureaus downtown on which the bill economizes and the lobbying interests about the capitol which do not like it because it is harder to slip through appropriations they want and more difficult to defeat appropriations which they are paid to oppose the consolidated bill is in conformity with the best business thought of the nation it is supported by the weight of public opinion it has been approved by metropolitan newspapers in every section of the country as indicated by editorials which i have previously reprinted in the congressional record here is a significant letter from the chamber of commerce of the united states"], [0.020720601081848145, 0.9792793989181519, 1, "we have called the roll this morning three times in 2 hours it is to be regretted that a deliberate and carefully organized filibuster is under way on this particular bill the time of the house is valuable and especially so just at this time not only should we be proceeding with the business of the house and conserving the time of the house but we should have some regard for the taxpayers whose money we are wasting in this filibuster it costs the taxpayers over 75 000 a day to run the house 5 days a week that means thousands of dollars for every hour we waste in unnecessary roll calls and dilatory tactics in which the gentlemen on that side of the aisle are indulging this afternoon i might add that the further effect of this filibuster is to keep the house here longer this summer there is no reason why we should not go ahead and pass this bill and get away from here before june 30 and go home and learn what the people are thinking partisan tactics like this not only delay the proceedings of the house and interfere with the consideration of this bill but also delay adjournment next june i trust we may have a little cooperation from the other side of the aisle in transacting the business of the house and the nation it is to be regretted that it will go out to the people of the united states tomorrow that there was a deliberate program here this afternoon to obstruct the orderly consideration under the rules of the house of one of the important bills of this session of congress we submit to the house today the largest peacetime appropriation bill in the history of the nationthe largest in the history of any nation since time began it is indissolubly associated with the welfare and prosperity of the people and the security and preservation of our form of government and it comes at a critical period in national postwar adjustment and international relations the bill with an amendment p roviding for foreign aid which will be offered by direction of the committee and the tabulation of permanent and indefinite eppropriations in the report sets out in full and in understandable terms the total proposed expenditures of the united states government for the fiscal year of 1951 taken in connection with the latest authoritative estimate of the national income for 1951 and the daily treasury report on the public debt we have a comprehensive picture which shows at a glance the financial condition of the federal government whether the nation is living within its income the effect of any amendment of any proposed increase or decrease in appropriations and the impact of such increase or decrease on treasury balances and the national credit for more than a century we have been passing appropriation bills and spending money without reference to any definite central fiscal program without any specific knowledge of their ultimate effect on national finances or national solvency but in this bill the nation is brought face to face with its fiscal problems and to that extent is in a better position to make its choice between unlimited appropriations and deficit spending in one respect this bill may be said to be not only an appropriation bill but a tax bill as well there was a time when we drafted the appropriation bills on the basis of the amount of revenue we had to spend we shaped the coat to the material available but we have long since ceased to consider appropriations from the point of view of what we have to spend we now make the appropriations and spend the money and taxes must be levied to conform to the appropriation bills and to supply the money we have already spent we now shape the coat according to the latest fashion or caprice and when the cloth is insufficient we simply borrow more material as a matter of course contrary to the intentions of the founders of our governmentand in contravention of every rule of scund business procedurethe house by multiplying authorizations and increasing appropriations has made the committee on ways and means a mere port of call and i am today asking the members of that great committee to cooperate with us in opposing increases in the appropriations carried in this particular bill and in discouraging the enactment of further bills authorizing new and expanded appropriations when we do not have enough money to finance the authorizations already on the statute books this bill is in effect ooth an appropriation bill and a tax bill if you make appropriations here you must levy taxes to provide the money by your action on this bill you decide whether we must increase taxes or whether we may lower them to reducc taxes you must first reduce expenditures i hope the members will have this in mind when amendments are offered to increase items in this bill this bill is the composite product of the work of 45 men and a dozen subcommittees with the most efficient staff ever mobilized on appropriations i want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the 12 chairmen and the members of their committees who wrote this bill whose names appear at the head of each section of the report i might say equal credit is due members on both sides of the table and here in the house to members on both sides of the aisle this is not a political bill the unanimity with which every subcommittee reported the respective chapters of the bill with possibly one or two exceptions indicates the unity of purpose and the hearty cooperation of all members of the subcommittees regardless of party affiliation and the care and diligence with which they have worked to bring out the best bill possible they have worked indefatigably since the beginning of the session they have held long and exhaustive hearings considering budget estimates analyzing the ustifications examining the representatives of spending agencies and all others who desired to be heard and the chapters are carried in the bill before you represent their considered and with few exceptions their unanimous judgment i want to take advantage of this opportunity to call to the attention of the congress and the country their industry and patient cooperation in presenting here what they collectively consider the best bill which can be written under current limitations the various chapters are incorporated in the bill just as the subcommittees wrote them without change or modification in any respect or in any particular the bill before you proposes appropriations in the total amount of 27 266 403 664 expenditures from that amount during the succeeding fiscal year are estimated to total 23 423 832 918 such expenditures will be augmented by expenditures from prior appropriations to the extent of 7 079 776 516 making an expenditure total for the coming year 1951 of 41 459 268 346 the estimated receipts of the government as of march 15 1950 as informally reviewed by the staff of the joint committee on internal revenue taxation amount to 37 300 000 000 the net result therefore indicates a deficit of 4 159 268 346 the committee has effected appropriation reductions by a total of 1 385 377 504 expressed in terms of expenditure the reduction is 979 489 060 a notable feature of the bill is the reduction of appropriations for 1951 below the appropriations for the current year heretofore the budget estimates have been the criterion by which we judged the degree of retrenchment the subcommittees were urged to keep the appropriations below the estimates but in formulating this bill the appropriations for the current year were made the target and subcommittees were urged to keep appropriations under those of the fiscal year j950 a new objective in appropriations and with such success that the pending bill is not only 1 385 377 504 below the 1951 estimates but it is 832 014 180 below the 1950 appropriations but this is not the full measure of the economies effected by the bill to this saving must be added the new obligations incurred by mandatory legislation enacted in the last session of congress by passing fifteen different pay and travel acts by increasing federal security veterans administration fair labor standards obligations of the government and other laws requiring direct appropriations and contract authority involving increases in expenditures the congress has arbitrarily increased the mandatory appropriations above what we had to provide last year 2 350 700 000 statutory requirements over which the committee on appropriations has no option or control when this sum is added to the amount this bill cuts from the 1950 appropriations it will be seen that the pending bill is 3 182 714 180 less than the amounts carried in the annual appropriation bill for 1950 a record never before equaled in the fiscal history of the republic but even with these exceptional savings the bill is still 4 159 268 346 in excess of the national revenues for the fiscal year and there is a natural desire throughout the country for a balanced budget the country demands that we keep appropriat us within the revenues and that is a very natural and timely request of the congress this however is not a peacetime budget the country is at war both technically and in fact no treat of peace has been signed although we have made every effort and every possible concession to bring about a formal agreement for the usual treaty marking the close of hostilities a treaty of peace is as far away today if not farther than it was in 1945 5 years ago when the last gun was fired we have no choice therefore except to maintain an alert state of preparedness a readiness for any eventuality and we are actuallv spending every day in this cold war more than we spent per day in the civil war in the spanishamerican war and in the first world war combined if permanent peace were assured if there were no threats of attack and invasion from abroad we could balance the budget very easily we could cut taxes in half we could make substantial reductions in the national debt but paraphrasing a very famous statesman gentlemen cry peace peace when there is no peace the next gale that sweeps from the north may bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms this is a war budget and no war budget was ever balanced by this or any other nation we cannot balance this budget it would be the height c folly to attempt it under pres ent international conditions but while we cannot economize at the expense of national safety and national defense we can and we must make corresponding reductions in reducible domestic expenditures the acid test in passing on demands for domestic expenditures is not whether the money would be well spentthe invariable plea for every sort of appropriation and authorization offered on this floorthe test is not whether the money will be well spent whether there is need for the expenditure the question in this national crisis is can we do without it and if that question can be answered in the affirmative on any proposal for expenditure here the proposal should be rejected that is the only thing to be considered in writing or amending this bill can we dispense with the appropriation under consideration either temporarily or permanently if we can it has no place in this bill if it is in the bill it ought to be taken out a circular letter has been issued by an organize tion registered under the antilobby act known as the council of state chambers of commerce in which it is charged that this bill was poorly and hurriedly drawn in view of the fact that the circular letter has been sent to all members of congress and distributed to the press let us examine into the facts if any supporting this statement is there any basis for such statement this bill was written by the same men who wrote these reports last year we had the same subehairmen this year we had last year we had the same committee personnel this year we had last year and the same committee staff and there was no such charge last year the men who wrote this bill the chairmen of these subcommittees are all able and experienced men they have served here for many years they have been very carefully screened before they were assigned to the committee on appropriations and the committee screened them even more carefully i think you cannot find in the house men better prepared and better qualified to write this bill why should men with more experience and a better knowledge of the eubject this year write a poorer bill this year than last year why it is absurd the charge is made with deliberate propaganda intent and is without any basis of fact whatever then this circular says the bill and repo were hurriedly done last year wes organization year we were late in getting started we started our first hearings on january 26 but this year with organization intact we began hearings on january 5 what is hurried about that mr chairman nblody suggested that last year the bill as hurried y prepared the truth about the matter is we have given more time to the hearings than usual we have heard more people than heretofore not only were all subcommittees in session longer but the whole committee met to consider this bill on monday morning at 10 oclock prepared to give 4 days to the reports from subcommittees we announced we would begin monday morning and report the bill thursday night but the subcommittees had so thoroughly processed the bill and there was such general agreement on both sides of the table in the subcommittees that when we metho one had any amendments to offer on each chapter in turn the chairman and the ranking minority member of the committee reporting the chapter were called upon there was no limitation placed upon time they were free to talk as long as they liked and any other member of the committee who desired time was recognized after debate was concluded and there was no one asking to be recognized the question was asked on each chapter is there anyone who desires to offer any amendment at any point in this chapter and we did not leave the chapter as long as anyone desired to offer amendments what is hurried about that"], [0.020791172981262207, 0.9792088270187378, 1, "few matters are of more importance to the congress and the american people today than the size of the premium that should be paid on the national life insurance policythe national defense and unfortunately it is a subject not widely understood this is not only because such vast sums are involvedit is also because the budget is always so complicated that few people have or will take the oportunity to study its details but our national defense is too important to be lightly considered and its details are so susceptible of being made understandable that we should not leave aside an opportunity to acquaint ourselves with them so i have made an analysis of the most significant items in the presidents 1950 military budget i submit it hereafter in the hope that many americans and especially all members of congress will give this very basic question the consideration it requires now to have a clear picture of the presidents 1950 military budget it is necessary first to understand the various stages through which it has passed before reaching its present total of fourteen and threequarters billions first in the national military establishment each department listed everything it felt it should have in 1950 then the cost of the listed items was totaled that was the initial bargaining point for budgetary conferences between the departments this operation finished last august produced the staggering total of some thirtyoddbillion dollars everyone knew that was far too much but it was a place to start then the senior assistants to the joint chiefs of staff generals mcnarney and richards and admiral carney got to work on the budgets of their respective departments and on the combined total by the end of september they had reduced the thiry billions to about twentythree and onehalf billions this was the second try then the presidents fifteenbillion ceiling began to take hold the joint chiefs of staff were directed to cut out some eight and onehalf billion more at this point the cutting process began to be a stern requirement it was not so serious reducing from thirty billion to twentythree and onehalf billion that six and onehalf billion came off without too much strain but cutting back eight and onchalf billion m3re was a little more in my opinion thal the joint chiefs of staff could work out and still carry out their job of providing adequately for the national defense but they did make a real effort at it as directed by the bureau of the budget by the middle of november they had come up with a budget of about seventeen and onehalf billion dollars this was the rockbottom minimum they felt that the country could provide and yet maintain a reasonable defensive posture in todays world but the president insisted upon his 15 000 000 000 ceiling so finally on december 1 the joint chiefs of staff came up with the directed figure of 15 022 000 000 later the budget reduced that some 257 000 000 so that the presidents budget finally has come to the congress with the total of 14 765 000 000 this total includes 525 000 000 for stockpiling and 830 000 000 for contingent items of pay and public works and housing so that is how the budget got to its present total it represents four careful cutting efforts the last three accomplished under pressure from the bureau of the budget now i conceive there to be nothing holy or untouchable about that final budget figure and i am confident that the nation will feel the same way it is of course the responsibility of the house and senate to take whatever action is deemed proper to get the required defenseeven if that requires increasing the budget recommendationsor even if it requires reshuffling the funds the budget proposes the responsibility of congress is greater than merely to accept or reduce the totals proposed by the bureau of the budget where do we look mainly in this country for the best judgment on what is needed for an adequate national defense the ultimate responsibility for the executive branch of the government rests of course with the president but his is not the expert military view it can never be so nor does our system so intend our top source for military judgment is the joint chiefs of staff who under the law are charged among other things with the nations strategic and logistic planning it is to these men who have risen to the top in the nations armed forces after a generation of experience and effort in military life to whom we must look and to whom the president must look for the most authoritative advice on our nationaldefense requirements this being so i have taken the presidents military budget which is compounded of a number of extramilitary considerations and contrasted that with the lowest budget recommended by the joint chiefs of staff which is exclusively military in nature by that process i believe the congress can arrive more soundly at our nationaldefense needs than if the presidents budget alone is taken as the criterion this process reveals a very interesting set of facts to which the remainder of my remarks will be devoted i am leaving aside any discussion of the costs of the office of the secretary of defense i am referring only to military items not to the overhead costs wherein the congress has in the past often found room and properly so for substantial savings to the taxpayer army consider the army first what does the budget ceiling do to the plans of the joint chiefs of staffs in respect to the army take military personnel the joint chiefs of staff in their minimum budget proposed 2 421 000 000 for military personnel costs under the fifteen billion ceiling directed by the budget the joint chiefs of staff reduced that total to 2 068 000 000a reduction of 353 000 000 the presidents budget now before the congress provides 1 983 000 000 this represents a reduction of 438 000 000 from the base figure proposed by the joint chiefs of staff and 85 000 000 less than the directed ceiling what will be the effect of this reduction the joint chiefs of staffs lowest figure before the ceiling was imposed represented an overall army strength of 800 000 the directed ceiling and the budget now before the congress will permit an active duty strength of 677 000 or 123 000 less this directed ceiling moreover is 18 200 less than the 695 200 manyear average the army had in fiscal year 1949 and 34 668 less than the 711 668 officers and enlisted men the army had on active duty on january 31 of this year now does this make any difference those charged with our national defense certainly thought so let us see what this reduction does to the armys readiness to meet an emergency we must bear in mind that the responsibilities of the army were not changed by the president he changed only the amount of money the considered judgment of the joint chiefs of staff was that 800 000 men are needed by the army in the next fiscal year to meet our defense obligations at home and abroad of course most of the armys activities with respect to overseas deployments are virtually fixed at irreducible minimums for example almost onethird of the army today is committed to occupation duties so the reduction principally affects the troops here at home in the united states this in turn materially lessens our readiness in the event of an emergency here or elsewhere in the world the armys mobile striking force upon which we must rely for immediate action in time of emergency was reduced by the bureau of the budget by two infantry divisionsfrom the seven divisions proposed by the joint chiefs of staff to fiveand of these five only one the eightysecond airborne will be a fullstrength division under the presidents budget his budget also compels a reduction in the remaining two infantry divisionsthe second infantry and the third infantry the eleventh airborne planned by the joint chiefs of staff at 60 percent strength and the second armored division planned at 80 percent strength remain at that level under the presidents budget moreover the budget eliminates a third of an armored cavalry regiment and 26 separate combat battalions most of which were antiaircraft artillery the presidents budget leaves us in all with 10 divisions at varying percentages of strength with various supporting units now i have been talking only about personnel reductions thus far what else does the presidents budget do to the army well along with this reduction in personnel the army is to be required to abandon a substantial program for modernization of equipment of the mobile striking force this is despite the fact that little has been done toward the procurement of modern equipment for those units which are scheduled for early deployment in time of emergency the army is still using equipment left over from world war ii even though great advances in research and development have occurred since then for instance the army has not been able to acquire enough new tanks it is left with many world war ii tanks they cannot stand up to the latest type tank being produced elsewhere in the world on this item the joint chiefs of staff asked 74 000 000 this would modernize 743 tanks the directed ceiling budget reduced this 32 000 000 so that only 420 could be modernized then the bureau of the budget reduced that 16 000 000 more to a total of 26 000 000 so that under the budget now before the congress only 250 such tanks can be modernized also the vitally important army program of acquiring the new skysweeper antiaircraft guns capable of delivering fire against highspeed lowflying aircraft will have to be curtailed under the presidents budget this is a newly developed weapon it is superior to any known weapon of its type i know all americans now realize very well especially from what happened in the early days of world war ii that this is the type of weapon needed very early in a war the joint chiefs of staff requested 673 of these weapons at a cost of 161 000 000 the presidents budget allocates 77 000 000 to procure 323 of them this is less than onehalf the number the joint chiefs of staff considered necessary here is a calculated risk indeed it is important that the congress be aware of it a further army item of real importance is the cut in the originally proposed civiliancomponent programreserves and national guard naturally the overall personnel reduction complicates this for it makes it far more difficult for the army to provide the approximately 12 000 instructor personnel required moreover the acquisition of the equipment necessary for even the highest priority reserve units will continue to be short by well over 50 percent and most of the lowpriority units can expect to receive little more than their training equipment now what is the meaning of this it is evidentand most important clearly this will force the army mobile striking forcethe element scheduled for immediate overseas deployment in the event of emergencyto provide initially a considerable number of troops for defensive tasks within the united states to replace the units of the civilian components originally scheduled for this duty so it is apparent that our ability to mobilize rapidly will be markedly reduced under the terms of the presidents budget it has been reduced to such an extent under the proposed budget that it looks as if we are already returning to our traditional practice of failing to maintain reasonably adequate force in time of peace these civilian components with the regulars buy the time needed for mobilization of personnel in time of emergency the proposed reduction in their strength and the consequent placing of additional tasks on the armys mobile striking force will have a most significant effect on the ability of the army to reinforce vital forward areas if they are attacked it further affects the ability of the army to seize and protect in conjunction with the other services those advance areas which are so essential for early offensive operations in any war today the army has well over a half million reserves many of them have lost interest and left the program because of lack of effective training much of this lack stems from the failure of the congress to insist upon the provision of sufficient funds equipment and facilities over and above those proposed in the various budgets since the war under the presidents 1950 budget there will be some 400 000 reserves of the army not in a drillpay status this is a paper force only its value in a military sense is certainly negligible and nearly all of these men are wartrained veterans the joint chiefs of staff asked for the placing of 421 314 reserves in a drillpay status the presidents budget provides for barely over half tlat number230 000 how on earth the congress can expect the army reserves to function properly and to maintain any esprit de corps or any willingness to continue to work for national defense voluntarily when they are not permitted to receive the pay their compatriots receive for undertaking training is more than i can understand it is axiomatic that if we do not maintain active strong reserve forces our alternative will be the maintenance of excessively strong standing forces at vast cost to the nation because as i have said previously these men with the regulars buy the time needed in an emergency here i believe the presidents budget cut is most unhealthful and shortsighted here the congress should step in and see that the services maintain adequate reserves and that the reserves are given sufficient funds to perform the job they are expected to do let me say to the house in this connection that the armed services committee plans as soon as its legislative calendar will permit to conduct a thorough inquiry into the present plight of army and air force reserves i find it difficult to understand why the nation is steadily losing this vast treasurehouse of military ability training and experience represented in these hundreds of thousands of warseasoned veterans the armed services committee plans to do something about this likewise the congress will have to move forward in this field by providing additional appropriations navy and what is the situation of the navy under the presidents budget as in the case of the army take personnel first the presidents budget establishes a navy personnel ceiling of 441 617 for the marines the presidents budget provides funds for 85 716 the presidents budget is 229 000 000 less for naval personnel than the joint chiefs of staff recommended that is the joint chiefs of staff recommended 1 766 000 000 whereas the presidents budget would allocate 1 537 000 000 for this purpose a reduction of 229 000 000 the joint chiefs of staff figure of 1 766 000 000 for naval personnel would permit a navy strength of 485 916 and a marine corps strength of 94 071 the question is of course what need exists for adding a little over 44 000 more navy personnel and a little over 8 000 more marines to the numbers proposed by the president for the answer to this we need to look to what the joint chiefs of staff recommended for the maintenance and operation of the navy they recommended 1 318 000 000 for this purpose that would provide 2 additional heavy carriers with 2 air groups 30 destroyers 24 mine craft and patrol craft and 11 auxiliaries all of which were stricken by the presidents cut of 98 000 000 from the 1 318 000 000 leaving the presidents total for navy maintenance and operation at 1 220 000 000 now what is the significance of the increase in the navy proposed by the joint chiefs of staff over the presidents budget the 25 percent additional heavy carriers in commission is a significant item it means that attack carriers available for combat operations in the initial stages of a war would come closer to minimum needswhich >iinimum needs the navy considers to be far in excess of the figure arrived at by the joint chiefs of staff the additional destr3yers and mine craft are obviously vitally relatel to the tremendous effort now being made by the navy to counter enemy submarines i know the congress is aware of the importance of this subject in view of the present type of submarines now being manufactured abroad moreover the additional numbers of these vessels recommended by the joint chiefs of staff are still far below the minimum number required during the crucial early stages of a war certainly it is not necessary for me to remind the house of the necessity for protection of coastal shipping lanes against submarine menace this should be selfevident after our experiences in the last two world wars now let me mention what i consider to be a most vital part of the navy budget i am speaking of navy aircraft the joint chiefs of staff recommended in their minimum budget 1 030 000 000 for the procurement and production procurement of new aircraft the presidents budget allots only 687 000 000 for this purposea cut of 343 000 000 this is an item demanding the most serious attention in 1950 the navy will need approximately 1 700 aircraft to keep up with attrition and obsolescence in that year this would cost about 1 300 000 000 the joint chiefs of staff recommendation was for less than this1 030 000 000 permitting the procurement of 1 361 aircraft now we come to the presidents budget for only 843 aircraft in 1950 this is almost exactly onehalf of the number needed to keep up with attrition and obsolescence of naval aircraft to put it another way the presidents budget provides only onehalf the requirement for maintaining a modern naval air arm in i earnestly hope the congress will examine this phase of the navys budget most thoroughly for in my opinion it is far insufficient for the needs of the fleet today in this era of air power with the world in a troubled state surely this is not the time to so drastically reduce the requirements of the fleet air arm there is another naval item cut by the president which requires close analysis that is the naval appropriation for research and development the presidents budget provides 36 000 000 less than the amount appropriated for 1949 the joint chiefs of staff recommended 220 000 000 for navy research and development and that figure is 19 000 000 under the 1949 appropriation i believe that in accelerated military research and development lies much of our ultimate ability to react quickly and effectively to any attack in the future and to meet any enemy with equipment and weapons superior to his own but despite the fact that the joint chiefs of staff proposed to allocate 19 000 000 less for navy research and development than was allocated in 1949 the presidents budget imposes an additional cut of 17j000 000 this makes a total reduction under the 1949 budget of 36 000 000 i consider this highly unwise and ultimately dangerous to the country this is not the place to economize this is the place to insist upon emphasis on the part of the services this is the place where it is a continuing function of the congress especially in peacetime to incite further service action rather than to discourage such action by budgetary cuts the reduction eliminates the development of two aircraft prototypesone piloted and one pilotless it also delays the development of aeronautical power plants electronics and ship developments such deductions are unwise at a time when virtually every nation in the world has thousands of scientists working day and night to produce new and more destructive weapons of war the congress should be conversant with the letter of february 2 1949 which secretary sullivan of the navy sent to the appropriations and armed services committees in that letter he pointed out that the presidents budget requires a manpower reduction of 29 500 commissioned officers and enlisted men of the navy and marine corps the inactivation of 3 attack carriers 9 light cruisers and 3 antiaircraft cruisers plus additional craft making a total of 72 vessels to be inactivated15 of which are major combatant typesreducing the active fleet strength of 755 vessels to a total strength of 731 these figures include the reactivation of 10 reserve fleet destroyers and 1 light carrier as well as 14 smaller craft and the completion of 7 new combat vessels mr sullivans letter also points out that the navy will have to reduce its operating aircraft under the presidents budget from 8 183 to 7 765a reduction of 418 aircraft and 9 air stations will have to be inactivated and three others will be placed in a maintenance status in addition there will have to be a general reduction in the scaleof activity at naval shore establishments supporting the fleet"], [0.0227547287940979, 0.9772452712059021, 1, "this congress now has a double responsibility it must move with dispatch to meet the enormous demands of our role of leadership in the free world it must furnish the men arms and money for our defense and that of free peoples everywhere the second congressional responsibility is to the citizens of this countryto maintain the standards of justicelegal and socialwhich have helped to bring this country to its position of leadership which have made it worth defending at any price it is an appeal to our recognition of that second responsibility that i make today though many important social measures have failed of enactment in the eightyfirst congress we are nearing a great achievement a broad and farreaching improvement in the structure of our socialsecurity system this measure was and is of great importance to millions of americans its enactment into law in proper form would realize one of the great hopes of the people who elected the democratic eightyfirst congress in preference to the republican eightieth unfortunately the senatehouse conference agreement has failed to produce a bill in proper form there are several faults some of them minor but at least two of such importance that i believe passage of the entire socialsecurity measure should be delayed briefly while they are corrected i speak of the omission of the houseapproved disability provisions and the addition of the socalled knowland amendment i do not believe i have to argue with this house about the wisdom of its own actions on disability we passed h r 6000 by a vote of 333 to 14 with the disability clause one of its major improvements and achievements we had provided a complete system of safeguards for this muchneeded program we had already met those arguments which later seemed so persuasive to the conservative members of the other body there are more than 2 000 000 people in this country who are permanently disabled whose inability to earn a living is even more marked than that of people who have passed the age of 65 they play a tragic role in our society people who have worked as long as they were able but who through no fault of their own are now destitute many of them are in the position of watching people over 65 but in much better health receive benefits denied them we in the house recognized that while state workmens compensation laws provide some protection when a disability is incurred at work only about 5 percent of all the nations disability cases are of workconnected origin we recognized that not only are disability benefits denied by the present social security law but that workers disabled before they reach 65 receive lower benefits when they reach that age because they have not been able to work in the meantime and pay their premiums no socialinsurance program which does not meet the needs of 95 percent of the nations disabled truly fulfills its obligations the house in near unanimity recognized that fact when it put the disability provisions in the social security bill what were the excuses presented to the other body in support of eliminating these very important sections of h r 6000 who presented them the chief argument was that private insurance could do the job the hundreds of thousands of disability cases now on local relief roles are in themselves testimony to the falseness of that contention privateinsurance plans are so expensive as to be almost prohibitive for lower and middleincome groups even more important such private insurance is not available to many of those in the middle or older age groups who need it most what was the secondary argument one so offensive to the concepts of individual dignity and responsibility in america that i wonder it should have been advanced namely that security for these people would bring about malingering i do not think i have to defend the american working man and woman to the members of this house i will only refer you to the experience of those who administered disability insurance under the railroad retirement act malingering was almost unknown who thought up these meretricious arguments and presented them to the other body two of the groups which have always fought social progress in america the private insurance companies who fought the original social security bill savagely and the american medical association the ama alone spent 369 526 in lobbying activities in the first quarter of this year pouring a large part of these funds into their open fight against disability protection under the social security bill the ama has long since stopped dealing with merits of individual proposals for better health in this country it simply declares guerrilla warfare on all such bills calling them back door approaches to socialized medicine i doubt if 333 members of this house would vote for a bill which would lead to socialized medicine i know i would not there is no reason no excuse no valid argument for the other bodys action in eliminating the disability sections of the proposed law the house should not accept their illadvised action in this matter the house and its committee on ways and means have carefully considered the matter and are entitled to have their viewpoints reflected in the conference report the knowland amendment is another case in point there is very little public knowledge of this dangerous proposal for change in our federalstate unemployment structure no public hearing has ever been held on its deceptive and potentially dangerous provisions this house has never had an adequate opportunity to consider the amendment on what appear to be its considerable demerits the knowland amendment is a rider of the worst kind technically in order but actually in violation of both the spirit and intent of the legislation to which it has been attached the social security bill originated in this house it was understood agreed on that h r 6000 should broaden coverage and improve benefits under our social security system the knowland amendment violates that understanding it only deals with the unemployment compensation systementirely outside the scope of both the studies and recommendations which produced h r 6000 but it narrows coverage instead of broadening it just exactly what is the knowland amendment what is its real object and where did it come from the answers to those three questions are the best reasons why this amendment should be stricken from the social security bill it is not only the product of questionable legislative processes it is itself bad legislation the knowland ameudment strikes directly at the key enforcement provision of federal standards for state unemployment compensation systems that provision now gives the secretary of labor authority to intervene whenever a state violates minimum federal labor standards in the administration of its own law the knowland amendment would remove that authority except when such violation comes through amendment of the state law by the state legislature most violations of federal minimum standards come through administrative decisions not changes in state laws as the sponsors of this amendment well know what would happen under the knowland amendment if state administrators should make a ruling contrary to federal law probably nothing in the first place the amendment forbids any action by the secretary of labor until the administrative decision has been tested in the highest court of the state that timeconsuming process might well be endless it would be too costly a fight for many individuals and unions to even contemplate there is still another joker a close reading of the amendment reveals that unless the state agency handling unem ployment compensation has failed to conform to the ruling of the highest state court the secretary of labor still could not intervene plainly and bluntly the state agencies and courts could together rewrite the meaning of every state unemployment compensation law in the country and not be accountable to anyone even the federal government which has the only safeguards for labor in its law the desired uniformity of laws throughout the country would disappear instead we will have created an administrative jungle a legal chaos what are the protections for labor written into federal law that could fall by the wayside with the adoptior of the knowland amendment a state cannot now deny benefits to a worker when he refuses to accept new work if the position offered is due to a strike lockout or other labor dispute take away the federal protection and you could create a strikebreaking weapon of vicious potentialities a state cannot now deny benefits if the wages hours or other conditions of work offered are substandard in the community take away the federal protection and you have a dangerous wagecutting device a state cannot now deny benefits to a worker who refuses work because he would be forced to join a company union or resign or refrain from joining a bona fide union take away that protection and you have the potential of a unionbusting weapon cf unparalleled persuasiveness if you would know how the knowland amendment will be used let us examine its source the revelation is complete the amendment was cooked up by the pacific maritime association and west coast shipowners because the secretary of labor kept them from getting away with a variation on the theme i just described it happened in 1948 the waterfront employers of washington and california had secured rulings from their state appeal boards which cut off all members of striking unions from unemployment benefits whether involved in the strike or not sounds incredible doesnt it id like to think so but thats exactly what happened men who had been unemployed long before the strike began were suddenly denied benefits when the strike began the ruling was also carried out in a carpenters strike in spokane nobody needs to see what a strikebreaking unionbusting tactic the waterfront employers had turned up the argument used to secure the ruling was as incredible as the ruling the men would have been on strike if they had been working when the strike was called and they would not have been entitled to benefits guilt by association pales in the light of such reasoning well the matter was properly called to the attention of the secretary of labor and the men got justice after the secretary had stepped in and said the administrative ruling was against federal regulations the ruling was reversed what would have happened if the knowland amendment had been in effect nothing i think the best evidence in support of that conclusion is the sponsorship of the knowland amendment by the same people who tried to pull the fast one there is however one new villain in the act a well paid fast talking lobbyist named stanley rector who bills himself as legislative director for unemployment benefit advisers inc and admits to a 20 000 a year salary plus expenses he is new to this particular plot but he is by no means a new hand in the antisocial security lobbying business he has headed the unemployment benefit advisers for some time this employerfinanced organization had its origin in wisconsin its principal function is telling employers how to keep unemployment benefits to a minimum it seems peculiar to me and i am sure it must to you that a congress busy broadening and improving our socialsecurity structure should accept the amendment of this veteran pleader for antisocialsecurity legislation if we are to do anything about the federalstate unemployment compensation structure in this congress we ought to improve it not weaken it the only real program in that field before us that has a proper background of study is president trumans proposal for an increase and standardization of maximum weekly benefits at 30 a week plus dependents allowances for at least 26 weeks it would also curb some of the harsh disqualification provisions now in effect the knowland amendment however would invalidate most of the proposed improvements before they could be made simply because of its emasculation of enforcement powers this is no time to drive an economic wedge between labor and management in this country progressive management is not supporting the knowland amendment only the most conservative and reactionary and both the leaders and rank and file of labor are properly angry and embittered at the attempt to deprive them by indirection of one of americas greatest social gains a properly functioning unemployment compensation system many of us had reason to be grateful to that system last year when it saved whole areas of thfs country from the bitterness of unrelieved poverty in the midst of nationwide prosperity most of us will be grateful again in the future if we keep our unemployment compensation system strong enough to meet any emergency let us maintain our original purpose of a broadened and improved socialsecurity measure let us preserve the content and spirit of the legislation which we set out to enact let us strike the intruder the knowland amendment from the bill let us reinstate the disability provisions and pass a measure which will bring nothing but credit to the congress which made it the law of the land"], [0.026623666286468506, 0.9733763337135315, 1, "this is the first measure before us in this eightyfirst congress on which the vote will indicate whether we believe that we can be masters of the economic situation or that we must leave our fate in the blind hands of supply and demand carlyle in one of his more acrimonious moods said any poll parrot could be an economist all you had to do to make him one was to teach him to say supply and demand the last years have proven that we can handle the economic fluctuations if we will they should also have taught us that we are all very interdependentthat the welfare of all is truly the only possibility for the longterm welfare of each some of us come from districts where rent control is of little local import in other areas it is of vital concern currently our economy is very sensitive if rents get out of hand it will mean less expenditure by the average consumer on other goods many of which have already shown a decline in sales and the chain reaction set off might well affect the entire country uncertainty such as would come from a 3months extension would add to the dangers of instability opponents of rent control argue that it will be permanent there is no foundation for this fear an article on the french situation has been given wide distribution by proponents of this idea in the first place any analogy between the economic situation in france and in the united states is fallacious i also wonder if the people quoting this article by in the words of the subtitle a distinguished frenchman know that the author was referred to by one of our outstanding conservative metropolitan dailies as the french goebbels and that it was he who introduced hitlers otto abetz to pierre laval and now lives in exile from his country rent control was inaugurated as an emergency war measure other controls have been removed as the pertinent situation became more normal and likewise rent control will be removed as soon as there is a better balance between people needing housing and housing available at a price or rent they can afford to pay the housing shortage is a fact not a dogma as the gentleman from kansas calls it the answer to rent control is not invective not general statements about free enterprise but more housing i venture to say that had this body been permitted to vote on a housing bill in the seventyninth congress or even in the eightieth we would not be debating a rentcontrol bill today the vocal groups representing the average man testified for a continuance of rent control before the committeethe labor organizations cio afl and some of the brotherhoods the veterans american legion avc disabled american veterans veterans of foreign wars and jewish war veterans a member of the committee asked a veterans representative this question suppose the eightyfirst congress does not extend and strengthen rent control what would be the sentiment among the veterans of america the reply was i think the reaction would be very much against the persons failing to do so these veteransand wage earners know what protection rent control has given them and they know the housing shortage is not yet licked they represent great numbers of tenants none of the arguments against the continuance of rent control for a short period are valid the administration can be improved and will be by the bill under discussion what are some of the arguments of the opponents of the extension of rent control first it is argued that the removal of rent control will stimulate the building industry new construction is not under control and has not been for some 2 years today rents on new construction are 75 to 100 percent above rents for comparable units and even when it was under control were 20 percent above comparable units and still we have a housing shortage it is not rent control but the high cost of building that is the primary deterrent to building more rental housing the builders know the current unreasonably high construction costs cannot last they want to sell make a profit and get out mr roy wenslick a realestate man of st louis whose studies are held in high regard by members of his profession reports that for a sixroom house between 194248 the sales price has gone up 105 percent the uncontrolled rental 75 percent rent control has not held back construction the elimination of rent control will only increase the speculative and inflationary factors what we need is continuance of rent control for a limited period and immediate housing legislation which will make possible greatly expanded production of permanent standard housing particularly rental units within the reach of middleand lowincome families it is argued that tenants are paying an unreasonably small percentage of their income for rent the national association of real estate boards quotes the 1948 survey of consumer income by the federal reserve board showing that tenants are paying on the average 12 percent of their income for rent they say that is too little that the proper figure is 20 to 25 percent it is true that in the depression years the higher figure was usual but they do not quote a further paragraph 6f this report there is not much statistical basis for the traditional thinking that the average family spends onefourth of its income for reit such a relationship probably exists only where incomes are at an abnormally low level during a depression and when at the same time rent obligations remain a relatively inflexible item in the family budget the smaller the family income the larger is the percentage spent for rent families with incomes under 2 000 per year pay 21 percent according to the report of the federal reserve board families with 5 000 per year or more pay 9 percent in other words as incomes rise the percent of income spent on rent decreases even while the dollar amount actually increases today tenants are paying the highest rents in history if controls are removed immediately rents will go up still more several witnesses suggested that the increase would be at least 50 percent rents for new construction not controlled are 75 to 100 percent higher than rents for comparable old units still under control rents for units which had not been rented for 24 months and were thus decontrolled are 89 percent above rents of comparable units a survey of 44 626 units decontrolled by the present law showed rent increases of 55 percent let us think of this in terms of the family there has been some slight decline in cost of living but in the adjustment there has also been some unemployment a rent hike just new would not only be a threat to the stability of our economy but would have severe effects on the welfare of our lowerincome families these are usually the families with many children their living quarters today are far from what we would wish as homes in which to bring up american childrenchildren who must be strong in mind and body if they are as adults to carry the great world responsibilities the american citizen must assume if we are to have peace let us be certain that we think of these homes of these children of our human investment as well as of the financial investment of the landlords the latter of course must be considered and has been opponents of rent control do not always mention such facts as that on multifamily dwellings landlords from 1941 through 1945 paid off 400 000 000 in mortgages or that the federal reserve board reports that foreclosures have been reduced 75 percent between 1940 and 1947 if small landlords had been taking the losses suggested the number of foreclosures would have increased not decreased and the condition of housing has improved the bureau of the census reported in 1940 that of 30 000 000 nonfarm dwellings 4 000 000 needed repairs while in 1947 only 2 700 000 out of 34 000 000 needed much major repairs now there have been adjustments in rents of the 17 500 000 million units the maximum number ever under control 6 000 000 units have been affected by area rent increases by decontrol or by hardship increases the housing expediter reports that 63 percent of all petitions processed that is 1 717 429 requests for adjustments have been granted an average increase of 19 9 percent in rent the small landlord may use a short form in asking for adjustment his name address the dwelling involved the maximum rent the rent requested and the grounds are listed on a printed form the bill debated here today gives him additional help from members of the rent control office specifically designated for this job and all landlords will be helped by the method prepared by the committee for arriving at a reasonable and fair rent the tenant also gets more protection under the proposed bill in improved methods of enforcement and especially in the matter of evictions there is just one more point i should like to mention many of the representatives of real estate groups insist that there is no housing shortage that the problem is one of maldistribution of rental properties because of rent control they argue single people are occupying apartments if the rents were higher they would have to double up or move into a room in somebodys home this remedy comes perilously close to a decision that single people have no right to a home no right to privacy that we must ration apartments through price now many of the single persons are employed women surely since they lack all the joy that goes with a family we should not go further and deny them a right to a small apartment home of their own this seems hardly the way to attack the housing shortage the sensible thing is to extend rent control for 15 months and meanwhile pass housing legislation which will enable both the government and private cempanies to build housing people can afford to buy or rent if we take the overall point of view of the welfare of the greatest number if we accept the realities of the economic aftermath of the war if we really want to have economic stability we will pass this bill"], [0.02727794647216797, 0.972722053527832, 1, "i join with my colleagues who look upon our federal budget today with concern the gentleman from michigan spoke apparently in support of the repeal of the excise taxes i realize that these were wartime taxes and we should take wise action in determining what is best for our entire economy with reference to excise taxes however i think the gentleman needs to recall the action of the eightieth congress and be frank enough to admit that we have the excise taxes today because they were made permanent during the eightieth congress in order to effect the eightieth congress income tax cut it is generally conceded that the incometax cut made during the eightieth congress could not have been done without the retention of the excise taxes therefore in a large measure the condition of the federal budget position today is due to the action of the eightieth congress in cutting income taxes at a time when there was little demand for such action except from those best able to pay i recognize the fact that it now appears perhaps unwise to increase taxes but we should certainly orient our thinking in terms of what is best in carrying out the services of the federal government and not make the mistakes that were made in the eightieth congress in breaking down the taxproducing methods that are so essential if we maintain the services demanded by the people of this country i am one of those who believe in protecting our federal economy by bringing into the federal service our best and most able administrators therefore must we not take action now in behalf of our national economy by extending some degree of consideration to those key men in the federal service who must have some consideration from this congress we certainly will take favorable action if we believe in good administration at the present moment it appears that there is pending before the congress for national defense a suggested appropriation of 13 000 000 i submit that we could very easily suggest some real economy in the nationaldefense program to the end that the amount of money represented by the increase in federal expenditures in this bill could easily be absorbed without injury whatsoever to the nationaldefense program thp comptroller general of the united states the honorable lindsay c warren is looked upon by all of us who know him as one of the most outstanding public servants in the federal service within recent days mr warren appeared before the subcommittee on compensation and personnel committee on post office and civil service united states senate in support of additional compensation for key personnel in the federal service i would like to quote from the statement by our able and outstanding comptroller general i served for 16 years as a member of the house of representatives throughout that period and in my present capacity as comptroller general i have been deeply concerned at the growing difficulty of attracting able men to the service of the government and keeping them there i do not intend what is said here to be taken as criticism of any officer now in the government indeed i have said many times that we have some of the finest administrators to be found anywhere rather it is my hope that something will be done to keep these men and to obtain the services of others of equal caliber the task of administering a large and farflung organization is by and large one of getting the right men for the right jobs and retaining them the necessary formula for a successful private business is to get the best men you can to run it whether at high cost or low such necessity is tenfold greater in the governmentthe biggest business in the worldwhere the stakes a e so high the operations so broad and the pitfalls so deep we cannot hope to get and retain such men if we will not pay the price right now i think it will be conceded that the rewardif it can be called thatfor public service too often is pitifully inadequate too often the compensation is trivial when compared to the job being done and what could be earned elsewhere it has driven out many of those best qualified has created hardship on those who stay at their posts through devotion to duty and operated as a deterrent to any effective injection of new blood there are both rewards and penalties for those in public office i do not advocate that the government meet salaries offered by industry because that cannot be afforded but at least the salaries should be such as to attract and keep able public men without too great a sacrifice on their part widely in the government service there are spread groups of fine employees who demand and are paid the prevailing wage scale the congress requires that the same scale be paid by those holding large government contracts i know no justification at all for denial of somewhat more nearly prevailing wages for the relatively few executives who are responsible for directing the farflung activities of the government it is obvious that some i repeat some narrowing of the widespread in executive salaries between private and public business is called for i do not plead the cause of any job holder or ask for help or benefits for anyone no matter how deserving it has been and is my policythough sometimes seeming to be a voice crying in the wildernessto speak out for the interests of the government which means for the interests of the united states as a whole government is called upon to be in a worldly sense the savior and protector of all of us our bulwark for a free economy in a troubled and confused world is it not obvious we hurt ourselves that is our country and its people when we fail to provide the wherewithal to get done the job the people demand are we not being penny wise pound foolish what are the facts i know of my own knowledge of a number of agency heads who after fine and faithful service were forced to leave for the greener pastures elsewhere abd i know of many other able men whose services the government was denied because in this competitive world the biggest business of them all could not reward them according to their worth the fact is that in some quarters the turnover has been so frequent that no sooner do we in our daily contacts get acquainted with those in charge than the are changed and new ones come in the sad part is that many leave just as they have learned to know their jobs and are in position to render service of real valueand sometimes even before some executive positions in the government have gone begging for months in my reports to congress i have called to account time and time again agencies which were poorly run inadequately staffed incompetently managed this has been done in pursuance of my duty under the law and with full knowledge that the need is for better management in the executive positions we have all said we must have better men to turn the wheels of government but here as anywhere else you get only what you pay for anyone who really seeks better government who opposes waste extravagance and inefficiency will further that cause by supporting this legislation to give the president the best human equipment to run this complicated government machine i think this bill goes farperhaps here and there not far enoughto supply that need i endorse it wholheartedly and congratulate you gentlemen for your resolution to do something to remedy a bad situation in our government there has long been a compelling need to increase the rates of compensation of heads and assistant heads of the executive departments and other officials of the government who are charged with much responsibility i sincerely feel that some action in this direction must be taken if the government is to obtain and keep the services of qualified executives the government may be able to obtain the services of persons to fill these responsible positions at the present salary rates only if it disregards the qualifications of such persons once the services of capable persons are obtained for these executive positions consideration must be given to the retention of them any appreciable turnover in topflight executives is not in the interest of the government many topflight executives will remain in these government positions where extr ordinary ability is required for a limited time only unless there is some prcvision for adequate salaries the annual salaries of top executives in outside industry in positions comparable to the positions covered in this proposed legislation range from 75 000 to 300 000 per annum"],

housing bill for the whitecollar worker and the man in the middleincome bracketwho has been urging and appealing for aid similar to that given to the lowerincome groups and those with the higher incomes if there ever was a need for legislation of this nature it is now this bill does not call for a subsidy it provides for private cooperative activit in the field of housing with federal aid through a national mortgage corporation or housing cooperatives to assure successful operation at a minimum cost the bill is an excellent one but i believe provision should be made for individual releases as well as provision for resale in the event of default by any member of the cooperative without profit every time we have passed a housing bill private industry has promised to build homes within the reach of these people but they have failed miserably to meet their requirements yes they have built homes that this group cannot affordwell beyond their reach selling for from 12 500 to 25 000 as well as apartment buildings where the rent is from 75 to 125 a month and over with the high cost of living these people cannot afford these high rents those who did take the risk of buying these highpriced homes have not been able to retain them consequently i hope when this bill comes up you will not be misled notwithstanding the opposition of the avaricious realestate manipulators and profiteering builders but that it will receive the support of a majority of you gentlemen who often express your sympathy for the needy but invariably cast your votes for the wealthy i have listened to a number of radio talks and have received many letters and telegrams from that group of lobbyists against this measure as well as rent control i hope their crocodile tears will not mislead you if you republicans and some of you southern democrats had not opposed housing bills in the past the shortage in homes would nearly be over and this bill would not be necessary exservicemen and whitecollar workers could have had homes for around 7 500 but your opposition caused such delay as to deprive these men of the opportunity and aid which they are deserving of between the man who earns from 2 400 to 3 600 a year and the man who earns that much a week or month i am for the first group we provided for lowincome housing under previous housing legislation unfortunately these homes were not priced as we had hoped for notwithstanding the many guaranties and advantages in loans we provided to the private home builders at extremely low and favorable terms unfortunately the vast majority of these homes under the present lowmortgage arrangements we granted are beyond the reach of the middleincome group as they average from 12 500 to 25 000 as i said before it is true that in some sections of the country some cheap homes have been built but without basements poorly constructed away from transportation out in the sticks without sewers and in many instances without water instead of being homes they are chicken coops i fear these make for the potential slum areas of the future with which we will have to contend consequently this bill provides for building homes through cooperatives and nonprofit organizations that can be built and should be built even in the large cities where the shortage is the greatest as well as in the suburbs at prices ranging from 8 000 to 9 000 this price range can be accomplished under this bill because through the cooperative system building materials can be acquired at wholesale prices and construction costs can be kept at a minimum personally i have not been wedded to the cooperative plan promoted in many of the large cities for the purpose of forcing tenants to buy units in apartment buildings at exorbitant prices and i have criticized them severely to my mind it was a racket this bill however will not permit any such scandalous operation this bill actually aims to provide homes for the whitecollar worker and the middleincome group through cooperatives at an interest rate approximately the same as that provided for in other homebuilding legislation enacted by congress notwithstanding what is said to the contrary the objection some raise that this interest rate is lower than provided for veterans in other housing legislation is just another smoke screen thrown up by those who are opposed to all housing legislation veterans are not excluded from this bill many veterans will take advantage of the provisions of this legislation in addition to the middleincome group mentioned above and they are the people who need a roof over their heads the most let me repeat the basic purpose of this legislation is to provide adequate livable homes of sufficient size for the average family to live comfortably and economically at monthly payments which the normal middleincome family can afford it embraces a field which has not been covered by housing legislation to date it benefits that great inbetween group in our economysolid sound and dependablewhich is usually ignored when we consider beneficial legislation such as this they represent a very vital part of our economy they have suffered long in their search for adequate housing they can be counted on to carry out their responsibilities under the cooperative plan incorporated herein they are entitled to our aid and assistance in providing the shelter they have so long cought this group is not looking for a subsidy this bill provides none interest charges for mortgage loans to cooperatives and nonprofit corporations will be sufficient to pay all costs of the national mortgage corporation for housing cooperatives set up under this bill this includes the cost of the money which the corporation borrows from the public all administrative expenses special reserves sufficient to cover losses and any general reserves which may be required the basic security for any mortgage loan is the value of the property on which it is made and the economic stability of the borrower there is every assurance that because of the cooperative requirement in this bill it will bring into membership the class of real citizen who will take pride in the landl and area in which his home is to be built and that he will exert every effort to carry out his obligation to the cooperative and promote the success of the venture and become a more valuable citizen with the cost of his home kept within his meanswith monthly payments which he knows he can definitely affordthe likelihood of defaults in rental or monthly payments will be negligible he will take pride in his possession and there will be every incentive on his part to keep his property in firstclass condition there is not the remotest likelihood that any slum areas will result from this type of home construction as is bound to result from some of the privately financed and built socalled lowcost housing in many sections of the country why the newspapers have been filled with stories throughout the land of these socalled lowincome private projects where tenants were driven out with the first heavy rainfall where local building regulations were violated in wholesale fashion where veterans and others were compelled to sue to get the return of their money due to flimsy and faulty construction and profiteering under the provisions of this bill which authorizes the housing commissioner to assist in the organization of cooperatives and in the planning construction and operation of their projects the rackets in many of the private housing projects the faulty construction and the excessive profits are fully protected against in addition the government is benefited through protection against losses on mortgage loans to these cooperatives the opposition to this bill by the private mortgage lenders and builders seems to center on the fear that operations under it will have a serious effect on their business the contrary however is true the general effect will be to increase the total market for private housing rather than take the market away from established builders whenever and wherever you build solid substantial homes in this country you are adding to the basic strength of our economy and our very existence as a nation home ownership is a pillar of strength in any nation a wellhoused contented family circle is americas most positive answer to any threat of communism or totalitarianism it is the foundation stone of true demodracy we are in this legislation endeavoring to carry out the true spirit of americanismby giving to a large segment of our population the opportunity of owning his own castle without any weight around his neckwithout the fear of ultimate loss of all he has endeavored to savewith the assurance that he and his family are to be able to live in comfort and contentment within his means and with equal opportunity with those in the higher bracket incomes to provide his children not only with the necessities of life but with some of the comforts that only a home of ones own can provide there are intangible savings to our government and to our local communities too that could well run into the millions through the elimination of brokenup homes the care of wayward children and the crimes that result therefrom and the broken spirits of those who overreach in their desire to have homes only to lose their all when they find their incomes will not permit them to carry the load they have contracted for this legislation is sound it is practical it is free enterprise in its fullest sense no one can justly criticize this form of cooperative enterprise nor can anyone sensibly oppose the true purpose embodied in this legislationto provide substantial homes at lowest possible cost to a deserving segment of our people this bill has my wholehearted support and approval and i hope it will receive the substantial support it merits as one who has ever since 1935 urged and advocated liberal housing legislation to provide homes for veterans and all needing reasonable shelter naturally i am in favor of this new cooperative aid program which i honestly feel can and will work out successfully"],

always hear such arguments when there is any movement for the protection of any great segment of the american people i think the constitution of the united states is the greatest instrument ever devised by man i think ours is the finest form of government under which man has ever lived but the constitution of the united states is not a straitjacket and the constitution bends to meet the necessities of our people those questions were all foreclosed about a year ago when the supreme court of the united states decided that an emergency still existed which would warrant the imposition of controls on rents it did not hold as some decisions have that the court could not nullify legislative findings of facts this was decided in the case of miller against woods and that was a unanimous decision of the supreme court so that question is foreclosed as to the constitutionality of this act why was the rent control act passed originally for more than 6 years the american people had been engaged in a war into which they were drawn against their will for 3 years a fighting war and before that we were the arsenal of the democracies of the world all of the efforts of our industries and all of the efforts of our people were devoted to fighting that war during that time practically no housing was built in the united states we had 12 000 000 men abroad when they came back home the emergency for housing was greater than it was while they were away the emergency still exists i do not want to favor a law that will not be just to both the landlord and the tenant but we have got to give some protection to our people i heard the gentleman from michigan talk about the dignity of the home and it is a dignity that has long existed in british law and in our law lord coke the great english jurist said that a mans house may be built of rough boards and roofed with thatch the wind may blow through it and the rains may enter it but the king cannot that is what we are trying to get for the people of americahomes it is essential that they should have homes a member this morning talked about the subversive activities that were going on in the united states they are not coming out of homes the home is the greatest pillar of our republic it is the stabilizer of our institutions and when we provide homes for the american people we are doing something to destroy sinister influences in this country no man is required to rent his house under this law no man is required to sell it but we have said to the man who has a house for sale or for rent that during the period of construction and for 30 days thereafter if it is for sale he must first offer it to a veteran and he may not sell it at a higher price than the lowest price for which he offered it to a veteran we include that same provision with reference to rental property you must offer it to a veteran for 30 days before you offer it to anybody else on a resale you must offer it to a veteran for 7 days for sale and 7 days for rent why all the turmoil and shouting about this provision that was in the last act that was in the act passed by the eightieth congress and is still in the act why was that done because the veteran was away he had been away a long time and when he came back he had to have a home and we were trying to get him one i do not think there is anything unconstitutional or unamerican about that of course nobody can make an argument that there ought to be confiscation of property both sides should be treated fairly we think in this particular bill we have accomplished that result there have been many complaints in the past that those asking for adjustments to prevent inequities and hardships have not been able to file their complaints with sufficient celerity to have justice administered in this bill there is provision made for an officer of the expediter in each defense rental area to make out the complaints just as the expert in the internal revenue department helps you make out your returns i think that will greatly facilitate the adjustment of these claims and will be a means of rendering justice to both sides we have in this bill repealed that provision where the owner or his family have lived in the property for a period of 2 years after february 1 1945 and had subsequently rented the property was thereby decontrolled that was introduced in the bill for the purpose of acquiring additional housing but we have found that in many instances the owner who owned several apartments or several houses left the one he lived in and rented it it was not under control he went into another apartment it resulted in an inequity that was so apparent and so flagrant that we repealed that provision of the law i have seen some statements in the press that we have broken faith with those who have left their residences or their apartments and rerented them it is my conception of the law that a congress does not break faith hen it repeals a law whatever rights may have been acquired under it if that were true one congress would have its hands tied because another congress had enacted laws under which interests had been acquired of course there is no merit in any such contention the expediter found that was used as a means to increase rents to the point where they were not comparable with other rents he told us in committee of the inequities and injustices that had come about we have repealed the criminal sanctions in the former law with reference to the violation of regulations by landlords and have placed in here instead a provision that where the tenant for 30 days fails to bring suit for treble damages which was provided in the previous law the expediter may bring that suit we have found that although tenants had the right to bring suit for treble damages where rents had been over the ceiling they failed to do so because of the fear of eviction by the owner so the expediter now has the authority to bring that suit and he probably in many cases will bring it if the tenant fails to do it it will be a means of compelling the landlord to comply with the regulations of the expediter as regards evictions there were certain causes for evictions stated in the law that the owner wanted to use the property for himself or his family that he wanted to take the property off the rental market that he wanted to remodel the property these were suggestions as to what he could do to get the property under that there were mass evictions in some places we have repealed those provisions and have provided that evictions shall be subject to the regulations of the expediter it is the only effective way administration of the law could be accomplished and i have no doubt that those regulations and rules will be fair and impartial i have no doubt that the expediter does want to rectify the injustices and the inequities as he has been directed to do so we hear a lot of talk about bureaucrats a bureaucrat is an administrative officer that must carry out a law there is no way to enforce laws without having those charged with their enforcement they are subject to the frailties and the fallibilities of human nature the only laws that i know of that enforce themselves are the laws of nature a man knows when he violates those what the result will be but we must have somebody to carry out the law and this is the only way that we can administer it and we must give him full and adequate powers to accomplish that purpose i know of nothing worse to the morale of our people or to our institutions than to enact a law that is not enforced or will not be enforced people have a contempt for that law which results in a contempt for all law i have heard a good deal of talk about sending this back to the states none of the governors of the states want this you do not have to send anything back to the states the states have this power the powers that the federal government has are those delegated by the people of the states the powers that were not specifically delegated were retained by the states and the people so they primarily had this power and they did not want it and they do not want it now

about the favorable action on this rule in the committee on rules has explained the bill consequently i do not think it is necessary for me to explain the rule or elaborate on the bill however i am obliged to call attention to some significant and important facts relative thereto the resolution before us was introduced on january 21 and the request for a rule was made before the committee on agriculture had a printed bill the bill came in while the committee was in session the ink was still wet at the same time the lengthy report on this resolution was brought in while the committee on rules was in session considering the rule now before us of course due to conditions which prevail in the committee on rules and due to the persistence of the gentleman from texas and i do not blame him because he claims there are some inequities as to the allocations of acreagehe expressed the desire to bring about equity and justice to those who have been discriminated against in the allocation of cotton acreages consequently i feel he performed his duty as he saw it and expressed the point of view of his constituents but right here i wish to say if there were any discrepancies or if anyone has suffered it was not due to the congress because we passed a bill last year upon the recommendation of many capable gentlemen on the committee on agriculture to allegedly alleviate the then existing inequalities now a rule has been granted upon the persistence and insistence of the gentleman from texas mr lyle i and others notwithstanding that we had pending an application for a rule for over a period of 3 years on the fepcthe fair employment practice commission bill for 4 weeks i have been endeavoring to my very utmost to secure a rule on it by everything that is right that rule had precedence but due to a coalition and a friendly understanding on the part of some of the gentlemen from the south the west and some of my republican reactionary friends who seem to cooperate and have been able to cooperate with them a rule was granted without even giving me a chance to read the bill or read the report as i said before of course one of the gentlemen said that i would not understand it anyway because it was a complicated resolution oh i did read it and examine it and i understand it and i know what it means the american people will wonder and have a right to wonder about the insincerity of the republicans who day in and day out preach economy and complain of the huge public debt and not only oppose but vote for these additional millions of dollars that will be saddled on the backs of the taxpayers however i myself understand the underlying reason it being that the ccalition between the republicans and dixiecrats is working and god help the country if it continues in force the republfcans voted with the dixiecrats for the increase of 1 400 000 acres of cotton in return for their votes against fepc that is obvious they feel they can hide or cover up the duplicity and doubledealing but i feel that notwithstanding their ingenuity and ability to distort facts they will be unable to make it stick the additional tax burden involved in this cottonacreage increase will inure to the benefit of 11 states 5 of which have alined themselves with the socalled dixiecrat partystates like alabama georgia texas arkansas and south carolina indeed we do have some big cotton planters because only in yesterdays paper i read of one cotton planter who sold his 1949 crop for 1 400 000 surely he and other large operators were not discriminated against i have been informed that the committee is working on a socalled permanent programthat this is only for the year 1950so i felt this matter should go over until they were ready to present their permanent program they demanded immediate action naturally feeling that the less the membership knew about the great cost involved in this bill the easier it would be for them to pass it it is indeed strange that these gentlemen urging and forcing this legislation which assures them six or seven times as great a price for cotton as they received under a republican administration and though they get six to seven times more for their crops today oppose at all times any wage increases to our workingmen their claim is that labor is receiving from 50 to 100 percent greater wages than before however we did force through this house the minimumwage bill oh the inconsistency i repeatwhat inconsistency and unfairness on their part though the democratic party under the leadership of franklin delano roosevelt and now under president truman through progressive legislation brought about the greatest prosperity our country has ever enjoyedespecially to the southprosperity they never dreamed could be theirsthey thrive upon opposition to the presidents program and policies for more liberal legislation and this in violation of the jeffersonian concept of equal rights to all and special privileges to none for 42 years i voted for every agricultural bill no one can justly charge me with prejudice or that i have not had the interest of the farmer and agriculture at heart or that i am prejudiced against the cotton grower why i recollect that due to the tremendous surplus of cotton which accumulated during republican regimes when cotton could not be sold at 4v2 cents or 5 cents a pound i purchased not for profit but to aid the growers 500 bales of cotton notwithstanding the fact that no cotton was grown in my district or in my state personally i feel that the department of agriculture which has done so much for the farmer these last 18 years should have beengiven an opportunity to adjust the discrepancies in allotmentstaking away from the huge operators who farm from 1 000 acres and up the small amount necessary to do justice to the operators who have been unfairly treated by the county and state organizations"], [0.031976401805877686, 0.9680235981941223, 1, "i am very pleased that my first

willingness to sacrifice its material prosperity to the end that the children who are the nextdoor neighbors of our own children shall likewise have a chance to grow in wisdom and stature and favor with god and man for the strength of the spirit has little opportunity for the production of fruit unless the strength of the body is such as to honorably use the spirit and the soul of children as

civilization under which they were born educated and reared so i am hoping that our great nation will never become so small and petty or so narrowminded that we will hesitate to spend whatever reasonable money is necessary to make the world safer for democracy because the children of the world of today are the hope of democracy for the world it is far wiser to spend money to see that the children of the world have healthy bodies and healthy minds and a chance to think clearly than not to do so it is a lot cheaper to do that no matter what it costs than it is to let the children of the world or the children in any great part of the world grow up with suspicion and hate or mistrust toward america because we have not shared or with warped minds and bodies because we have sought selfishly to shut our eyes to world responsibilities actual facts compel us to recognize that we are a world neighborhood that the condition of the health and the mind and the spirit of the children in south america or europe or africa or in china is related to the life and the spirit and the welfare of the children in america for as the childhood of china goes or as the childhood of india starves or as the childhood of europe thinks or as the childhood of russia shapes its thoughts finallythese and each of them and all together will determine more of the destiny of the world when the present children are adults than we would now like to admit and lastly let us not weaken the thinking of any part of the world toward the efficiency and the necessity of the united nations organization let us not distribute any thought anywhere in the world that the united nations organization is not of an abundant achievement for we know that it is abundantly successful with the look at the long pull of civilization the sharp compulsion or determination of the present arrangement with regard to the need of the childhood of the nations may then soon in my judgment be a constructive act in the best interests of the stability of the childhood of the world the mass of testimony given before our committee showed that the able programs carried on by the international childrens emergency fund are in the category of feeding medical the training of medical and social personnel and in the area of increasing milk production surely none of these four essentials of world progress in the area of childhood are less than absolute necessities in my judgment whenever in the world there are absolute necessities of such sustenance and such protection for the children of the world it is in these areas gentlemen that our democracy will either be perpetuated or weakened and even discontinued so i see no need of the amendment it is already covered in the text of the bill i do see the overemphasis and overexaggeration of the fact that the congress is trying to make it deliberately clear that the president of the united states is not after june 30 1950 to spend any money through this present fund regardless of the condition of the controls of the fund or the condition of the childhood of the world at that time therefore i must vote against this amendment"]], "top_incorrect":
