extension legislation at that time i said that it was ridiculous for us to permit a continuation of this unfair tax which has been a burden to the railroad industry and at the same time to propose a billiondollar subsidy for the railroad industry in the form of a governmentguaranteed loan i also want to congratulate the conferees for their keen judgment which they exercised in the elimination of the tax of 4 cents a ton on coal this has been a tremendous burden on the sick coal industry and has encouraged the use of other forms of energy i hope that this will serve as an incentive to many of

action taken by the conferees i feel it is extremely regrettable that additional tax relief was not granted in this area it seems to me that we should eliminate or substantially reduce the 10 percent tax on passenger travel telephone service and new automobiles i have consistently favored the reduction of these taxes as i felt that they were unjust and unfair this reduction would substantially aid in curtailing the present recession i have never and do not now support any sweeping taxreduction program since it does not seem practicable in light of the nations budgetary requirements however i know of no other area where a tax elimination or reduction could accomplish so much acrosstheboard relief and at the same time least disturb the governments revenue flow when a family purchases a new car they pay approximately 200 in federal excise taxes if this tax were eliminated the family would have 200 more to spend for other consumer items if a family buys 200 worth of public transportation they pay a tax of 20 if the 10percent tax on transportation were eliminated this 20 could be spent for other items such as lawn furniture or clothing and would thus help in moving goods from the

with the mounting accumulation of farm products in the hearings that followed in the house agriculture committee there was general agreement that several different approaches should be taken to facilitate use of the surpluses in a positive manner therefore in mid1954 the congress enacted with strong support in both chambers the agricultural trade development and assistance act of 1954 now more commonly referred to as public law 480 the act provided for a fourfold program for the utilization of surpluses title i authorized sales for foreign currencies to friendly countries in addition to their usual purchases for dollars title ii authorized the use of commodity credit corporation stocks to meet famine and other emergency situations abroad title iii emphasized and broadened first the previously authorized section 416 program for donation of ccc stocks to schoolchildren and the needy in this country and to american private relief agencies such as care for use in feeding needy persons abroad and second the program for bartering ccc surpluses for strategic and other materials these programs have been of great value to our farmers through the expanded outlets that they have provided for surplus products but in addition they have made a great contribution in helping to improve living standards for large numbers of people throughout the world during the first 3 years of these programs actual shipments made under them have totaled about 3 billion stated another way a little more than onequarter of total united states agricultural exports during the last 3 years were made under these programs we all appreciate i am sure that the accelerated disposals undertaken under public law 480 has been one of the major factors responsible for the gratifying increases in total agricultural exports foreign shipments increased in value about 70 percent from 195354 to 195657 and in 195657 farm product exports were valued at 4 7 billion by far the highest total in our history the title iii authority providing for donations through american relief agencies and barter does not carry any expiration date however the foreign currency sales authority under title i and the authority to meet emergency conditions abroad under title ii are now scheduled to expire on june 30 1958 yesterday i introduced a billh r 9614which will provide for an extension of these two titles until june 30 1959 my bill will increase the title i authorization by an additional 1 5 billion which will bring the cumulative authorization to 5 5 billion no increase is needed in the title ii authorization since sufficient balances are available from the current 800 million authorization to carry the program for another year i think our farmers can take pride in these programs which permit us to share our abundance with our friends in the rest of the world there can be no better way of demonstrating our good will or our desire to help people achieve a better standard of living how fortunate we are to be able to use our farm products in this manner certainly the contrast between the abundance produced under our system and the scarcities and high prices prevailing under the communist agricultural system give us strength in our relations with the free world the principal activity under the public law 480 program has taken place under title i thus far agreements have been signed with 85 countries for the movement of commodities valued at 3 3 billion included in agreements signed to date are 500 million bushels of wheat 100 million bushels of feed grains 25 million bags of rice 2 8 million bales of cotton 160 million pounds of tobacco 1 8 million pounds of fats and oilsprimarily soybean and cottonseed oil150 million pounds of dairy products and large amounts of other commodities and these items are being shipped abroad in large volume for example last year when exports totaled 4 7 billion which incidentally represents roughly 1 acre out of 5 of our cropland title i accounted for almost onefifth of these exports wheat exports last year totaled almost 550 million bushels and title i was responsible for shipments of about 200 million bushels of this amount incidentally these record exports enabled a cut in the surplus carryover wheat by about 125 million bushels last year cotton exports of 7 6 million bales were the highest in many years and as a result it was possible to reduce surplus stocks by over 3 million bales incidentally title i shipments last year were about 1 4 million bales shipments of edible oils last year were at a record level of over 1 2 billion pounds this was especially good news to soybean producers and again title i accounted for almost half of the total exports title ii has been extremely useful in giving the executive branch flexible authority to meet unforeseen situations abroad so that we can come promptly to the aid of people in distress for example this authority has been used to feed hungarian refugees following the revolt against communist oppression last year it has been used to make wheat available to the people in morocco who suffered as a result of a prolonged drought as you know last year it took us many months to consider extension of this law it is of paramount importance that the extension be provided as early as possible during the current session in order to continue these programs without interruption it is my understanding that the remaining balance of 700 million in the title i authorization will be committed by january or february therefore i would hope that the extension could be authorized no later than february or march i am strongly in favor of continuation of these programs they have been of great benefit to us at home and abroad i sincerely hope that my bill will have the
