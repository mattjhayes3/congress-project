agree that we should utilize this method under these conditions of tight money where inflation is running rampant to help finance the federal government the money market is in real trouble chaos and

which passed the house in july but i am deeply disturbed that in doing nothing more than to extend present programs for 1 additional year the congress is exercising only its most minimal responsibility in this area while ignoring the need for a much more critical examination and revision of the farm program and an extension of workable programs over a longer period of time when farmers are facing the most critical costprice squeeze of this decade with farm income down significantly from the record highs of 1966 and 1967 congress should be assuming vigorous leadership in an area which affects not just agriculture but every section and sector of our interdependent economy when the 89th congress passed the food and agriculture act of 1965 it was hailed as the best we had ever established for the first time a program had been set for 4 years so that the american farmer would be assured of continuity instead of wondering from one planting season to the next whether congress in its annual struggle over the program would maintain or cancel it and in what form but while we carried out that responsibility to bring some kind of stability to the farm program we ignored the opportunity which this 4year period gave us for a critical examination and analysis so that meaningful changes could be made when the expiration date approached instead we are doing nothing more than extending the program because we have no real evidence of how it can best be improved at least in doing this we are insuring that farmers will know what to expect for the 1970 crop year and giving congress an extra year to exercise its responsibility for revision and reform it is for that reason that i am supporting this conference report today in passing this legislation however we should make perfectly clear that the first priority task of the new administration and the new congress next year must be the development of a new longrange farm program taking the best of the present one which is after all the most successful we have ever had and making changes to eliminate the problems and make it more relevant to agriculture for the 1970s there is perhaps no clearer indication of the manner in which the congress has overlooked its responsibility on the farm program than the debate on limitation of payments there is widespread concern in this country and this congressa valid concern which i shareabout the trend toward corporate farming i feel strongly that the farm program should be designed to protect the individual family farmer against what one farm organization president has described as the factory in the field that is why i introduced legislation to eliminate the tax loopholes which benefit hobby farmers and corporations in competition with legitimate family farmers that legislation has received bipartisan support in the congress and has been endorsed by both the department of treasury and the secretary of agriculture if there was convincing evidence that an arbitrary limitation of payments would help the family farmer and reverse the trend toward corporate farming then i would have supported it as i am sure would have my four colleagues from iowa who also opposed it and i think the conference would have included it in the legislation before us today but on the contrary all of the evidence suggests that appealing as the concept of such limitations might be in actual fact as proposed during the debate on this legislation they would do more damage to the family farmer than they would help him for example a 10 000 limit on payments would put 1 5 million acres back into production and add 3 million tons of feed grains to the market it is not the large wealthy farmer who is going to suffer from the lower prices of the resulting glutted marketit will be the small farmer who is already selling his corn at a dollar a bushel or less i want to emphasize that i do support adjustments in the present program which would put an end to windfalls to corporate farmers without endangering the family farmer and i am particularly concerned that steps be taken to insure that no payments are made to keep land out of production which would not have been planted in any case it is unfortunate that after 4 years with the program we did not have the information and knowledge to make those adjustments this year and this is one aspect of the program which must have immediate consideration in the 91st congress the need for a sound voluntary farm commodity program is clear right now the american farmer is capable of producing 12 percent more than we can effectively use in the marketplace and in commodity distribution programs both in this country and abroad and historically it has been demonstrated that farmers because they are independent and dispersed cannot avoid overproduction without some kind of farm program during the hearings on this legislation testimony was received from farm organization representatives suggesting that without the feed grains program net farm income would decline by 5 billion the secretary of agriculture contended that net farm income would drop from 20 percent to 40 percent within 5 years and the only ones left to benefit from the free market then would be the corporations who were large enough to withstand those kind of losses the economic research service has conducted studies which indicate that without the farm program net income would be 36 percent lower feed grains production would be 17 percent higher and prices down 34 percent with a parallel decline in livestock prices at the rate of 5 to 6 percent for every 10 percent decline in grain prices and at the same time we woufld be building up the kind of pricedepressing surpluses which were so devastating to the farmer during the last decade those surpluses have been reduced now from the alltime high of 5 5 billion in 1960 to less than 1 billion today if we refuse to extend the farm program we insure a return to those difficult years but just by passing this legislation today we will not automatically guarantee the strength and stability of agriculture if we are going to accomplish that objective then we must not only set out to reform the feed grains program we must act on complimentary legislation in the areas of corporate farming strategic reserves and farm bargaining rights i urge the house to approve this conference report today but in doing so we must not delude ourselves that we have therefore fulfilled our responsibility to the american farmer in a very real sense we are doing little more than conducting a holding action by extending the food and agriculture act through 1970 and we must commit ourselves to much more positive and thorough action in the early days

funds would be solely under the jurisdiction and authority of each state i have introduced this legislation as a possible means to enable state and local governments to develop creative methods of solving their problems in providing schools hospitals roads health and welfare services and other increases in services necessitated by our rapidly expanding population under present tax systems the states just do not have adequate revenue sources to meet these increasing demands on their purse strings nor is there hope that they can levy many more taxes in the future property and sales taxes which contribute the bulk of state and local tax receipts have already reached the saturation point a glance at statistics on federal state and local finances reveals that state and local expenditures have increased at an even more rapid rate than federal outlays during the past decade during the period from 1956 to 1965 state and local government outlays for general governmental purposes more than doubledfrom 36 7 billion to 75 billion while those of the federal government rose by about 60 percentfrom 68 8 billion to 110 billion state and local government debt has increased just as rapidly as expenditures during this same decadefrom 48 9 billion to 99 5 billion while federal debt rose by about 17 percent from 272 8 billion to 317 9 billion the financial plight of our state and local governments has been further emphasized in a study released this week by the joint economic committee a statement accompanying this report indicates that commercial banks now hold 38 billion in state and local government obligations which is almost 40 percent of the total however if additional revenue can be made available to the states through a taxsharing plan the dependency of local governments on commercial bank loans at excessive interest rates could conceivably be eliminated under my taxsharing proposal more than 1 6 billion each year would be returned to the states for their use in fiscal year 1965 the last year for which complete figures are available florida alone would have received more than 30 9 million in revenues collected by the federal government this would have represented 3 percent of the 1 032 652 000 in individual income taxes excluding employment taxeswhich were collected in florida by the internal revenue service during the same year 53 4 billion in total individual income taxes were collected throughout the country the additional revenue making it possible for each state to devise means specifically suited to solving their individual problems would foster imaginative solutions and diversified approaches competition resulting from this diversification would bring about more efficient processes and a divergence from the often mediocre uniformity of approach to crucial problems facing our states furthermore a taxsharing plan would save the states hundreds of millions of dollars they will eventually have to invest in new tax collection machinery needed to raise more local tax revenues if such a plan is not adopted opposition to tax sharing has often been based on the premise that state and local governments might not use these federal funds wisely if they are granted with little or no federal strings attachedthat the states will only be encouraged to lower their own tax effort or curtail vital expenditure programs state legislatures however which will have the responsibility of administering the funds are now assured of proportional representation because of recent supreme court decisions and misuse of funds should be held to a minimum one cannot disregard altogether however the margin of error which will exist in any human endeavor some opponents contend that a tax sharing plan will merely shift the burden of debt that by supplementing state revenue with federal income tax revenue thereby decreasing local and state government debt we will simply be expanding the national debt it is my feeling that the additional revenue will enable local government units to more effectively meet their growing responsibilities which they have thus far not been able to do largely because of inadequate revenues it is entirely possible then that on a longterm basis federal grantprograms could become largely unnecessary and a sizable reduction in federal expenditures eventually effected at this point let me stress that priority must be given to financing our commitment in vietnam our major concern must remain the support of our troops thought must also be given to the effect which a future declaration of a state of national emergency might have after initiation of this program i feel that while immediate implementation would not be feasible this inclusive approach to state government problems is a sound one and should be given thorough consideration during this congress if conflicts arising from this proposal can be resolved now implementation should be possible by july 1 1969 earlier initiation does not seem advisable for several reasons first as i have already mentioned the vietnam conflict steadily demands increased funds further the budget for the new fiscal year 1968 beginning july 1 1967 has been in the planning stages for several months and an additional expenditure of 1 6 billion cannot be absorbed into that budget if consideration and approval can be achieved at this time ample opportunity would exist for its inclusion in the budget plans for fiscal 1969the first fiscal year of the administration chosen in 1968 the accompanying table shows the amount of

appropriated and all we can do is raise the ceiling in order to pay for the programs we previously approved and funded by sidestepping responsibility for control of the growth of federal spending the congress continues to admit its present impotency to adequately deal with the real issues that transcend the narrow debate on the debt ceiling the illogical circumstances of the present situation demands the immediate attention of the congress the public by necessity relies upon congress to continually evaluate the growing needs of a rapidly expanding economy yet we are forced to labor under an archaic and highly inefficient system which dates back to a time when the present state of the economy was still in its embryonic stages in terms of the available tools and techniques that are widely utilized in the business world the stance of congress is where it was before world war ii in the area of cash flow and commitment control furthermore control of the growth rate of federal spending cannot be accomplished in piecemeal fashion without an overall conception and understanding of commitments and appropriations debate can only be and often is fatuous squabbling a method is needed whereby congress can have the machinery to consider at one time all federal programs old and new in the light of current administrative budget proposals without being irrevocably bound by prior commitment immediate reform is imperative there is no conceivable justification for allowing the current state of affairs to continue a solution cannot possibly be so remote as to condemn the congress to perpetual servitude and permanent impotence in fact there is a solution i am introducing legislation today similar to the bill introduced by the gentleman from arkansas representative mills the bill calls for setting up a bipartisan commission of 12 members appointed by the house senate and the president this body would be given power to review all federal programs old and new and to evaluate and make recommendations for priorities in the allocation of federal funds the commission would have at its disposal all the machinery of modern systems analysis and would produce relevant evidence for a systematic ordering of every program the advantages would be tremendous with the use of computer hardware and an adapted systems approach the congress could take a more intelligent and independent posture in determining priorities and substitute a discussion on the current status of spending for the present misleading debate over debt ceilings an analysis of the bill i am introducing today appeared on the editorial page of mondays washington post i commend the post editorial to my colleagues and all other interested persons"]], "top_unsure": [[4.360079765319824e-05,

participating in this discussion some economists looking at the big picture fail to note however the continued importance of the textile and apparel industries to the new england regional economy these industries give work to 186 000 men and women12 1 percent of all manufacturing employment with an annual payroll of approximately 721 million in my own state of massachusetts they employ 96 000 with an annual payroll of 373 million when 186 000 working men and women see their jobs taken away or threatened by the growing tide of textile imports so thoroughly discussed here this afternoon it is little wonder that these men and women and their union representatives flood our desks with mail asking us to do something about this situation why should they want to turn over their jobs to hong kong where the average textile wage is 25 cents an hour or to even lower paid workers in taiwan or pakistan surely there must be a better way of assisting these developing nations than by encouraging them to engage one of our most important industries in a competitive battle on our own soil if it were only these developing countries involved however we might survive this overgenerous helping hand

objectand i shall not objectthis bill is a further attempt to establish a priority of opportunity for businesses displaced from the district of columbia waterfront to secure reestablishment in that same area public law 86736 enacted in july of 1960 provided that these displaced businesses were to be entitled to facilities at least substantially equal to those from which they were displaced the rla was to notify each displacee of an opportunity to lease a suitable piece of land in the area and the priority holder would then have 180 days within which to indicate its intent and demonstrate its capability to establish facilities within the redevelopment plans provisions however not one of these businesses has been permanently relocated and no economically feasible offer of relocation on any specific site on the waterfront has been tendered any of them under public law 86736 in short this law has not been effective h r 2529 directs the rla to use specific procedures to establish land values in the waterfront area and to make proper allowances for improvements and any public charges placed upon the land which must be assumed by the priority holder further it is provided that any valuation placed upon the land shall not exceed the maximum fair use value which is economically feasible and which will permit the reestablishment of the type of business displaced also in the event of any change in the waterfront plan or in the land price each priority holder must be notified and given at least 60 days within which to exercise his priority rights the lessee shall be charged an annual rent not less than 6 percent of the fair reuse value of the land if the cost or interest which the rla must pay in order to finance the land and improvements exceeds 6 percent however then the lease rental charged the priority holder will be adjusted in excess of the 6percent figure accordingly finally if the gross income of the business exceeds the estimated figure used as a basis for establishing the residual value of the land as the basis for the original lease the priority holder and the rla shall receive equal shares of any increased income resulting from the increased gross sales after 25 years of any such lease the land may be reappraised and a new value determined as the basis for a new rental figure it is my opinion that these provisions will be fair to all parties

have a new secretary of defense i do not question that he needs advice i do not question that the new secretary of defense is doing a superior job i do not question he needs a knowledgeable and able man as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff what i question today is not personality or person or uniform but rather the attitude the policies the philosophy and the determination of the man who would occupy a high office under the constitution congress has the exclusive power to declare waran ominous responsibility it also has the exclusive power to raise armies and navies and to provide for their regulation so this is not extraneous for us to question the policies of the man who would become the highest uniformed military authority of the united states that of course is what the chairman of the joint chiefs is and would be because of the importance even though he has no vote as the gentleman from south carolina said the importance of this position is such that the congress did provide that the chairman could not occupy that high important influential office for more than 4 years except in times of war declared by the congress today of course we consider legislation to set aside this requirement to permit the 1 additional year i think in considering this legislation we ought to consider some very hard facts that are besetting our country today fact no 1 is that the united states is not engaged in a war declared by congress instead the united states isand this is my terminology of coursebogged down in an undeclared war of gradualism on the land mass of asia fact no 2 the united states is in one of the most if not the most agonizing military plights of our entire history i wonder if anyone would question that land operations in vietnam today are confined to the territory of the country under attack with sea and air attack against the aggressor never permitted on an unlimited scale and our government has effectively prevented the government we seek to protect from engaging in land operations against the territory of the attacking nation despite an investment of over 21 000 lives and injuries to more than 100 000 other unitedstates military men and expenses approaching 100 billion despite the deployment in vietnam of over 500 000 unitedstates troops and vast sea and air armadas the end is nowhere in sight enemy forces are able to mount effective attacks even against the capital city of saigon and the imperial city of hue a military or political victory is not in prospect and is no longer even mentioned by those in authority estimates show that enemy forces from the north now number perhaps 100 000 more than in january of this year militarily we are getting nowhere fast fact no 3 general wheeler has been the highest uniformed military authority throughout the unfolding of these melancholy events that have brought us to todays unhappy military plight fact no 4 declared or not this war is the proper responsibility of the congress our gravest responsibility is to the military men in combat zones and to their families they are in uniform by act of congress they are paid and equipped by act of congress their fate weighs heavily upon the congress it seems to me the congress has the duty to determine if possible what went wrong to put our men and this nation in this plight and to explore ways to get our men and our nation extricated from it i am not saying general wheeler is to blame for the fix we are in i simply do not know but surely he could shed some light on how we got there and if he has no promising new ideas for getting us out would it not be prudent to suggest a new chairman with new ideas i am not suggesting that general wheeler is the architect of the unprecedented military policies of limitation restraint and gradualism which are the hallmarks of the vietnam war but if he has opposed these policies he has done so in muted and muffled tones"]]}
