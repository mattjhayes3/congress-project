warlike way that my insurgent friend the gentleman from kansas addressed himself to the gentleman from ohio in the early part of his interesting address but like many of the insurgent branch of the opposition the gentleman from kansas did not go far enough the gentleman from ohio called the present bill a personal victory for mr payne and president taft and said the victory was over the forces of free trade on the one hand and high protection on the other there was a little girl up in my town last week and one of her elder friends came in and said look here mary i understand that you have got a sweetheart and she blushingly refused to reply why he said now listen little girl i will give you a quarter if you will tell me what his name is and she said in a whisper why it is tommy jones and about two minutes afterwards she said now if you will give me another quarter i will tell you who my other sweetheart is now without any big bribe i am going to tell the members here tonight whom the other victory and the real victory in this fight is over your biggest victory is over the great consuming masses of this nation and your biggest victory was gained for the dishonest manufacturers of this nation now the gentleman from ohio told of the situation as it looks to a7 man on the inside looking outlooking out for what a great party wanted instead of what the great people of this nation desired now here is how it looks to a man on the outside looking in trying somewhat vainly i must admit to find something that the gentlemen on this side may commend it was not a personal victory for either mr payne or president taft it was a personal victory though somewhat unsatisfactory for the senior senator from rhode island and the dishonest manufacturers that he and his kind have always represented in that body over there applause on the democratic side j regarding the victory that you have won over the forces of free trade mr longwort11 where do you find that element existing in this house not on this side here we have got a solid democratic phalanx standing for an honest tariff on a revenue basis a tariff that would satisfy alike the honest manufacturer and the honest american workman a tariff founded on the principle that american goods not controlled by a trust should be protected by a duty equal to the difference on the cost of production here and abroad supplemented for revenue purposes by a fair corporation tax to continue in force until we are able to give this nation a fair income tax instead however the republicans have given this nation a miserable makeshifta purchased comproiseunsatisfactory alike to many of the brightest minds in the republican party and unsatisfactory in the extreme to every democrat in both branches of congress i realize that my position with regard to the tariff has been criticised by some socalled democratic members and by the new york sun believe me i do not draw my democracy from the sands of florida nor the bayous of louisiana i have not alwcays regarded the new york sun as the source of jeffersonian truth even if i db occasionally read its editorial and welledited sporting pages if i ever have a greater love for a manufacturer in my district than i have for my partys principles which god forbid and he desired a republican protective tariff i will advise him to start a factory forthwith in rhode island and then to make assurance doubly sure maintain branches in connecticut and massachusetts he will be protected well protected maybe not to the extent that the woolen manufacturers are protected but enough for the senator from rhode island has never been scant in his protection i little rhody has dominated in this tariff fight let her be given the credit on your side and incidentally the blame of 70 000 000 of americans i can hear now the cheers which will greet on your side the passage of the payne bill cheer on and on and cheer again for my republican brethren i know and so does your chief executive know that this will be the last chance that you will have to pass amid cheers any important legislation i believe the prophetic words of mr taft will ring out from the votes of the american nation in november 1910 and they will return a bigger democratic majority to the house than it has ever seen since the days of the civil war the honest manufacturers of my districtalmnost every man of them republicanasked only for a tariff equal to the difference in the cost of production here and abroad and the manufacturer who asks for more is dishonest and the party that gives more is dishonest new jersey asks nothing that she would not concede to every one of her 45 sisters and being one of the greatest manufacturing states of the union is intensely interested in the outcome here tonight but ever honest and loyal to the group of states forming this union her voice will ring out strong and clear against the wellplanned robbery of the teeming millions of this nation for the further enrichment of the favored few this is not the best bill which even a partially honest republican majority might pass i agree with the lovable and ever efficient minority leader and so well said by my friend from new york the best parliamentarian this side has ever produced that we can not expect too lunuch from that side but i ask you now in view of the fact that the beef trust is known as the meanest and most cowardly of all the many combinations fostered by republican rulei ask you comprolmising members of this once great party why did not you go the entire distance in curbing this most contemptible combination and place all mexican and canadian beef mutton pork and so forth on the free list with hides i realize that hides would have never been admitted free if you could have passed your bill without so doing i realize that the cudahys tile armours the swifts and the morrises have been good contributors to your campaign funds but for once play fair with the peopleyou have given the beef trust millions of their hardearned dollars now by placing canadian and mexican beef on the free list give the honest american workman a chanice to buy meat for himself ind his family at honest prices the beef trust has received already at your hands its pound of fleshnow i ask you in the name of american manhood to stand by the voters who made it possible for you to control this house stand by the american workman whose interests you look after so well in your party platforms stand by 20 000 000 anerican homes whether peopled by democrats or republicans forget for once if you can the dishonest dollar and legislate for the men and women of this american nation"], [0.018223226070404053, 0.981776773929596, 1, "i would not join in any way in this discussion except for the fact i find myself differing from some of my colleagues and members on this side as to what policy should be pursued in reference to some items in this tariff bill i join in the main but not all with what has just been said in regard to the south by the gentleman from alabama who has just taken his seat my father and mother were both born and raised in the district which that gentleman now represents i have found out that in these tariff questions that special interests control and are the ones who are fighting for recognition here before the ways and means committee they are the dominant factors in framing a tariff bill i want to refer for instance to the charge that the south is not doing what she ought in the way of material progress you men of the north hear me it is today as it was when calhoun hurled the doctrine of nullification the doctrine of secession against the tariff barons of this nation it is true now as it was then that the south suffers most from the heavy taxation laid upon her toilers by your system of protectivetariff legislation we are a cottonraising people that is our chief industry the man who would sacrifice the interests of the cotton raiser of the south to those interested in lumber in hides in sugar in rice in a number of articles on this tariff list in my opinion apil 5 does not represent the interests of the main body of people of the south who have suffered all these years from these unjust tariff burdens let me tell you twothirds of our cotton crop must find a market abroad you can not help us by tariff legislation except by making our burdens as light as possible consistent with the needed revenue of an economical government only by affording us an opportunity to buy what we need of manufactures at a lower price we are interested in preserving the cottonmanufacturing industry of this nation it would be a foolish policy for us to advocate anything that would destroy the cottonmanufacturing industry of this country or any other industry for that although we are dependent for twothirds of our cotton products upon the cotton industriesin foreign countries let me put this to you the gentleman from ohio the other day plainly put before this house and the country how by your protective tariff legislation you are putting 11 cents a pound in the pockets of the woolgrowers of his state you people a few years ago denied the proposition that you could create value by legislation but here you are admitting that by your high protective tariff policy you are putting 11 cents a pound in the pockets of the woolgrowers of this country now my friends suppose you go to the cotton farmer with that proposition a proposition that requires him to pay on an average nearly 100 per cent tax upon the woolen fabrics that he has got to buy are not you asking him a great deal when you require of him to support a policy by taxation that takes from his pockets his honestly earned money and puts it in the pockets of people in other parts of the country my friends the southern white man has to support and educate his own family yea more than that he has to educate a family of negro children at the same timetax himself to educate his own children tax himself to educate almost an equal number of negro children and then you conic to him with this bill in your hand and lay further tax burdens upon his back by demanding 100 per cent on wool 65 per cent or 70 per cent on cotton and on steel and many other outrageously high rates in this bill take the whole list and in heavens name can you hope to win the south under such a policy as that you may get a few lumber barons you may get a few wool barons you may get a few of our people that receive direct benefit from your legislation but my friends the great body of southern workers those who are toiling in the fields will control the south you will never get them until you come not with flattery upon your lips not with a bribe in your hands by way of paying special interests but with justice in your heart with justice in your proposition whatever it is then and not until then will you make any headway in the south and that will be when the leopard changes his spots or the ethiopian his skin my friends i know that a republican believes in special interests and he may have some respect for southern men that join the republican party in order to advance their particular special interests but i do not believe that you have any respect for a man not controlled by any of these special interests that would come over and join your protective policy and thus practically betray the interests of the great body of his own people you criticise the south let me tell you what you are doing look at the statistics of the census of 1900 look at the boys and girls from 10 to 15 years of age in the south that are working in the fields you men of chivalrous america look at the girls of the south of that tender age that are in the fields they are not all negroes i ask you to look at the statistics with reference to the white boys between 10 and 15 years of age and the white girls between 10 and 15 years of age out in the fields and yet you sneer at them because they have not made the advancement you think they should have made in education what are you doing you are by this bill taking schoolbooks out of their hands and putting them into the hands of your own children you are tearing the roofs from over the heads of these people of the south and building more substantial and palatial residences for your own people my friends that is the condition mark my word you will never win in the south until you leave flattery behind until you leave political bribery behind and come to us with a proposition involving the square deal the fair thing f~r the people of that section of the union now they say here is a bill that puts coal on the free list a gentleman a republican powerful in the councils of his party turned and said look here you have turned traitor to the south i am going to protect southern interests now my friends how does that proposition look coal is a necessary commodity in millions of homes to our people here is a proposition that puts coal on the free list practically we need it in texas we need it in every state in the union and here is a gentleman that says to the southern people stand with me to put coal on the dutiable list i want the southern people to join with meand enable me to recover my part of this special privilege my tax on coal this powerful republican says my colleagues in plunder are not fair i have heretofore helped them collect a bonus on wool iron steel cotton cloth and they deny me my bonus on coal i am outraged you men of the south help me to get my share i do not propose to lift the burdens by a little fingers weight off the backs of our consuming masses but i will continue their burdens however your lumber barons want their bonus your meat and hide barons want theirs let us barons stand together and collect what we have heretofore collected and let the consuming masses of the country bear the burden i will not join in with this delightfully just and fair programme"], [0.034784793853759766, 0.9652152061462402, 1, "there is not much argumentthat can be made in the short time accorded me but i am glad of this opportunityto announce in this presence that the proudest act of my congressional career will be when i cast my vote against the bill sent back to the house by senator aldriit of rhode island there are a few plain facts that ought to be stated on this occasion one fact is that the republican party with its platform and candidates went before the american people last year and solemnly pledged that there should be a revision of the tariff and that such revision should be downward you are here today for the purpose of breaking that pledge to the voters you do not intend to redeem it and you have never so intended such false pretense on your part makes manifest one more plain fact and that is the american people will never have revision downward until they sweep the repibliean party from controland reinstate1the genuinedemocracy charged with the power of reducing the tariff in behalf of the consumer and against the monopolies trusts and special interests and ifi mistake not the temper of the american voter he will be quick to punish treacherous conduct and make strict demand for conscientious execution of plain pledges made to confiding constituencies there was no issue submitted to the voters with more striking unanimity than the one embraced in the promises of both parties that the tariff should be revised downward if the american electorate could have foreseen this betrayal here today many new and different faces would be in this presence now and a different form throwing its shadows across the portals of the white house than the chief executive who now halts in carrying forward bold preelection promises the gentleman from ohio refers to prosperity under the dingley law in answer permit me to recall the fact that the greatest panic this country ever saw and the most vexatious times in business channels with soup houses throughout the land millions of workmen out of employment tramping the country over for work the squalor of poverty meeting our gaze on every hand in humble homes where women and helpless children were crying for bread occurred while this dingley bill was yet a law if this be his vaunted prosperity god save the mark if the gentleman from michigan and the gentleman from ohio and enough of you who talk like them will join us we will send this bill to the committee on ways and means and bring it backto the committee of the whole house where we can give it some real consideration and discuss the 847 amendments annexed by the senator from rhode island by such course the voters and their represent atives can view these new provisions and perhaps in that way reveal some of the hideous features of this senatorial product this is the only way in which the light of reason argument and fair dealing can ever touch the bill now reeking with favoritism to the special few the gentleman from pennsylvania the high priest of protection as he is called says that what the people want is speedy action yes the people would like to have speedy action but the kind of action they desire is that the bill sent here by the senate shall be speedily defeated by faithful representatives in this house and if you will but agree if you will but vote that this bill shall go to the ways and means committee and be brought back to the committee of the whole house i believe it is within safe bounds to say that the democrats are eagerly ready to remain here until the first day of the next session of congress and revise the tariff downward thus aiding you to redeem your pledge to me a pledge to the people and platforms regularly enunciated in conventions are solemn and sacred things without criticising anyone else i regard my promises to the voters and platform decrees as highly as my word to my fellowman to me they are the same i would as soon break my promise as to violate a political pledge thus scorning the performance of a platform demand a party that fails to stand il firmn and honest adherence to solemn declarations and promises as enunciated in platform pledges can not and should not be trusted by our citizenship platforms have always constituted our party creeds and should be carried out by faithful performance in spirit and letter speaking for myself alone i stand here today advocating the provisions of thedenver platform and would honorably execute every promise in my opinion it is a great platform and wisedecree in almostevery respect and true to ancient landmarks of democracy set up by our fathers in pursuance of its fiat i have voted and would again vote for free lumber this plank was wisely inserted and has my cordial sanction for several reasons which time forbidsmtue giving in detail i maintain that the denver convention acted with complete wisdom in embodying this plank in its platform another equally acceptable plank to me is the one declaring that trustcontrolled articles should be placed on the free list the democratic platforms of 1900 and 1908 contained the same declaration in this body on june 3 1900 every democrat in accordance with my recollection voted for an amendment making good this pledge on march 29 1909 the gentleman from kentucky announced in a speech his intention of offering an amendment to this effect and when the motion to recommit was offered by the democrats such an amendment was embodied in it as a part thereof practically every democrat voted for it and so now i subscribe to such doctrine as wise patriotic and democratic if i had it in my power it would appear in every democratic platform and lawuntil there would not be a tariff wall remnant or shadow thereof behind which a trust tariff baron or special favorite could hide or seek shelter the denver delegation have my thanks and gratitude for that brave promise to the people in pursuance thereof striking a vital blow to the steel trust i would vote for free iron ore agricultural implements and everything touched and controlled by the sordid hand of monopoly and trusts here protected by the pending bill in this tariff contest wherever the platform holds out hope and promise to an oppressed people i would follow and redeem our plighted word it shall be chart and gulide the republican party will not do so today there were ten faithful ones in another body and their action will challenge the attention of the country in years to come their course will find ample support the time will swiftly come when the american people will demand that words of promise shall be faithfully kept and party perfidy speedily punished for my part i feel that when i have denounced the paynealdrich bill and voted against it i have kept the faith and done the republic the greatest service within my power as a representative"], [0.03484976291656494, 0.9651502370834351,

undertake to run this government for 300 000 000 a year less than it is run for this is a plea of guilty to the charge of extravagance and incompetency which the democratic party has preferred against the republican party in the last three national campaigns it is a fair and frank admission that 300 000 000 a year an enormous sum of the peoples money is wasted by the reckless management of the party in power that appropriations exceed the needed amounts for the government by this great sum that the party in power annually appropriates this amount more than it ought to in other words 30 per cent of all the appropriations is absolutely thrown away this sum is equivalent to three and onethird dollars for every individual large and small old and young in the republic the appropriations of the sixtieth congress by their enormity shocked the public and angered the people at the last session of that congress there was appropriated to defray the annual operating expenses of the government for the year ending june 30 1910 the enormous sum of 1 044 014 298 23 this is a sum equal to 12 50 for every person in the republic a sum which is more than equal to 1 per minute for every minute of time which has elapsed since christ was born up to the present hour 1 for every minute of time of the one thousand nine hundred and ten years constituting the entire christian era it is already known that this years appropriations will exceed that of any former year in the history of the government how large no one can tell until the labors of this session are ended no other nation on earth is so expensive if the state and municipal governments in this country were equally as expensive the people could not maintain the burden of sustaining them and would not tolerate them to exist this evil of extravagance is growing and the republican party has clearly demonstrated that it is powerless to stop or curb it it is committed to the policy of extravagance and all efforts upon its part to control it are futile true its leaders preach economy but by their votes here in this house practice and encourage extravagance it can not change the policy to which it has been so long committed and all attempts upon its part are in vain one of the reasons alleged by leading republicans for its inability to economize in public expenditures is that the methods employed in the public offices are antequated and it is impossible to get the officials in them to adopt uptodate methods so that economy and better results would ensue and more efficient service be rendered it is in my judgment the best argument that could be made for a change of the party in power in order that new methods and uptodate officials should be installed it is asserted that these offices are conducted as they were forty years ago and the system of that period is the one used now this only strengthens the charge that the departments are behind the times and new men should be put in charge who would inaugurate new methods to improve and facilitate the public service save the large amounts now wasted and produce better results for the people a public office is a public trust and should be administered for the public benefit but under republican rule a public office is treated as if it were a private sinecure the bill under consideration is to appropriate money for the postoffice department for the coming fiscal year the amount proposed to be appropriated by it is in round numbers 240 000 000 an enormous sum an increase over last years appropriation for this department of 5 119 825 it was confessed that the amount appropriated last year was extravagant a sum much larger than was needed if properly managed but instead of reducing the amount for the coming year it is increased it is a notorious fact that this department of the government service is run at a loss instead of at a profit that it costs more to run it than it earns and yet it is a business department and ought not only to be selfsustaining but earn a large surplus for the government every year other businesses similar in character do so and if this department was conducted upon a business basis and run in a business manner it would do so the various express companies do a competing business with it and earn as the public well knows enormous dividends for their stockholders the president in his annual message informs the country that it costs the government 9 cents per pound to transport secondclass mail matter such as newspapers magazines and periodicals and this produces a deficit yet it is a wellknown fact that express companies carrying such freight for 21 cents per pound are able to declare enormous dividends on their capital stock if express companies can do this why can not the government the difference is that the former is conducted on a business basis and the latter as a political machine operated to keep the republican party in power and ignores the application of business principles in its management to adopt the presidents recommendation in this matter would be adding additional tax on intelligence as it would increase the price of newspapers magazines and periodicals which the reader would have to pay in other words it would tend to diminish their circulation by increasing their cost for one i am opposed to the proposed increase and shall vote against it knowledge should circulate freely and cheaply in order that the standard of intelligence of the people from year to year may improve by applying strict business methods to this department and less political manipulation the deficit can be overcome and the necessity for raising the cost of postage avoided this government is paying the railroads too much for carrying the mails a suin far in excess of what it should pay and a much larger sum than a business institution would pay for similar service and this is the cause of the deficit in this department for the last seven years the government has paid as the records show the following amounts for this service including which this bill carries an appropriation for the coming fiscal year 1905 39 698 000 1906 40 900 000 1907 4 000 000 1908 4 660 000 1909 45 250 000 1910 46 568 000 1911 4 620 000 total 306 696 000 this enormous amount is paid by the government to the railroads alone for carrying the mail a sum much larger yes more than double than the amount the express companies pay for carrying a similar amount of like matter this could be reduced in the interest of economy and in the interest of the promotion of the general welfare of the people but another and more serious complaint can be justly made against the business methods of this department in the rental of postoffice cars from the various railroads of the country in addition to paying the railroads for carrying the mails there has been paid by the postoffice department forthe rental of such cars in1909 4 800 000 1910 4 800 000 and it is proposed by this bill for the coming fiscal year to pay them the sum of 5 047 000 as rental for such postoffice cars for these cars the entire cost of construction and equipment does not exceed 7 000 each and this sum makes the rental paid on each car per year used 3 575 10 the average lifetime of these cars as shown by experience in the service is ten years one of them therefore earns for the railroad company during its time of service 35 751 and the companies are paid that amount for its use as rental by the government a most splendid investment more than 50 per cent profit per year such methods are sufficient to wreck any business institution such reckless extravagance and utter disregard of public welfare demands rebuke is there surprise that the postoffice department is not selfsustaining under such business methods would it not be better to practice economy and practical business sense in this branch of the service by reducing these enormous charges to a reasonable basis instead of increasing the rates on secondclass postal matter here is an example of extravagance and waste which should be corrected it is said that nearly everything in the postoffice department is controlled by executive order if this be true then there should be a timely executive order made which would cancel these contracts and direct new ones which would be in keeping with good sound business principles and common justice to the american people if the business of this department is under executive orders as claimed another matter at this time might be suggested with propriety which would relieve this department of much work and save much time which could be profitably employed by the postmastergeneral in looking after the business of his office and also relieve the president of much embarrassment and work and that is an order that all postmasters hereafter at the national presidential election be selected by a vote of the patrons of the several postoffices of the country such an order would be approved by the people and hailed as a muchneeded reform in this country there is no good reason why the people of this country should not be permitted to select their postmasters by ballot say who they want to hold the office and handle their mail they are better qualified to select them than some man a thousand miles away who is not acquainted with either the applicant or the patrons but to do this would weaken the great political machine which is operhted in behalf of the party in power this is a reform coming at no distant day and its advent will encourage all believers in good local selfgovernment it would have a great tendency to purify the department service reduce the expense of operating the office and lighten the duties now performed in that department the amount paid by the government to the railroads in another branch of the service is a flagrant example of official extravagance and mismanagement which demands the attention of the country at this time in the last eleven years the government has paid for transporting the army and its supplies enormous sums in proportion to the number of enlisted men and the amount paid them for service i submit for consideration the

the men who carried the musket and faced the enemy the men who stood ready and willing for battie did not receive onehalf as much for their patriotic service as did the railroads for carrying them and

1910 inclusive has been 1 218 303 092 93 there can be no doubt of extravagance in this department five times as much has been appropriated to maintain the navy as there was to pay the officers and men engaged in the naval service during the last twelve years this condition requires public attention and demands reformation in the last three national campaigns it is a notorious fact that the railroads were very active in behalf of the republican party their officers employed coercive methods to make their employees vote the republican ticket by stating that if the republican party was not successful they would not be able to continue in business sir whether or not this liberal patronage of the government was the cause of such highhanded coercion i do not know but i do know it was a strong inducement for such coercive conduct but sir extravagance does not exist alone in the three departments mentioned but has invaded and exists in every department of the national government congress about three years ago appointed a commission to investigate the subject of foreign immigration to this country it traveled nearly all over the world on a junket at the expense of the government and has cost the people of this country 657 000 and has not reported yet the result of its work only its expense and has had 125 000 more appropriated to complete its work thereby entailing

talks economy but votes for extravagance it promises to lighten the burdens but increases the load under which the citizens groan it raises the rate and widens the inequalities of federal taxation it

minnesota that we have no idea how much this work is going to cost the gentleman takes a narrow and an unpatriotic view of the matter i do not want to bring this question of gratitude to our heroic dead to the low level of what it will cost we do know approximately however how much it will cost the secretary of the navy tells us about how much it will cost and in my judgment it will not cost anything like the amount of money this bill appropriates i know that it could have been done years ago shortly after the war for a few hundred thousand dollars but whether it will cost more or less i challenge any member here to get up on the floor of this house and say he will measure the patriotism of america in vulgar dollars and cents we appropriate millions of dollars every year to build battle ships and we send them forth in war and peace to all the world laden with the human freight of patriotic america but we quibble about costs and we split hairs on economy when it comes to a question of doing simple justice to the brave and heroic men who sacrifice their lives for the glory of their country every patriotic sailor who went to his eternal home on the fatal night of the 15th of february 1898 when the battle ship maine was destroyed was a hero who sacrificed his life for the glory and the greatness of his country just as much as if he had met death facing a foe in the shock of battle i am with the brave sailors of america i am with the bereft families of the dead in their sorrow and in their distress i want the congress of the united states to treat thern fairly and justly and hence i say that the most important aspect of this matter looming above the question of commerce and navigation towering high above the doubt or the truth of history is this sentiment of a nations gratitude that demands in the name of patriotism that the remains of the heroic sailors who gave up their lives in the cause of the country shall be brought home and buried with naval honors beside their sleeping comrades ia arlington cemetery i have a number of leading editorials from prominent newspapers in this country appealing to congress to do something in this matter i shall insert some of them in the record but we delay i know the feeling that pervades the minds of many people in spainthat we are afraid i know how we are sneered at by many people in cuba they say we think more of dollars than we do of patriotism i know the sentiment that prevails in every spanishamerican veteran camp in this countrythat we will legislate millions for war but neglect to legislate a dollar for humanity and patriotism sir the human interest in this matter has appealed to me for years i place man above the dollar i put the patriotism of ma on the highest plane of human endeavor it is the loftiest sentiment that pervades the human heart destroy it and the pillars of the republic will crumble forget it and our free institutions will pass away and be gone forever during the

combining their forces to control the election of federal senators through their sinister influence in state legislatures fortysix united states senators can prevent the enactment of a good law or the repeal of a bad law the united states senate is the most powerful legislative body in the world and its members should be elected by the people of the country just the same as the representatives in

labor against any competition whatever with the pauper labor of europe since the 15th of march vhen this special session of congress convened both the senate and the house have been laboring over the tariff we have heard it constantly declared by republican leaders that this tariff must be adjusted on protection lines the interest of the manufacturer has been exploited in glowing termshis profits in what lie sells must be preserved to him by a high tariff the great body of consumers have not received a passing thought hides they say must bear a high duty because it would be cruel to take a part of the fat profits from the tanneries and the beef trust which would be the result of putting hides on the free list president taft is making a brave strong fight to give cheaper shoes to the working people and the thousands of shopgirls who toil for their daily wages by putting hides on the free list and greatly reducing the duties on leather the clothing of the people made of wool and cotton is still burdened with enormous duties but in the midst of all this great strife and struggle between the consumers of this country and the special class interests that the republican party stands for i have not heard one word of encouragement hope or succor offered in behalf of the american laborer in the matter of relief from the oppressive burdens of foreign immigration that more vitally affects the prosperity and contentment of the laboring people of our coumtry than the misleading and deceptive duties of the tariff as to the difference between the cost of production at home and abroad it is known to us all that many laborers in our country are out of employment the republicans flippantly tell us that great business interests are disturbed on account of the tariff being considerei at washington what a sh1am and a hoax these men who are eager to get work have been irregularly employedmost of the time out of worksince the republican panic commenced in 1907 if we desire to uphold the interests of the american laborer let us protect him against the evil and disastrous effects of pauper immigration tle immigration annually to our shores is today the greatest menace to the labor interests of our country let us regulate along that line if we are honest and sincere about helping american labor of course the great corporations encourage this immigration it means cheap labor and larger profits to their great combinations i believe that our govermnent will yet and that very soon have to make the experiment of making such drastic regulations as will practically stop temporarily at least immigration to this country and thereby give american laborers time to catch up just as long as foreign laborers come to our country in a manner unrestricted and accept a daily wage much less than our home labor just so long we will have large numbers of our own people unemployed together with strikes and other disturbances let us protect our american labor against the pauper foreign crusaders and talk less about the difference between the cost of labor at home and abroad the protracted discussion on this tariff bill has demonstrated to the country that the boasted claim of the republican party of loyalty and friendship for the american laborer is a glaringly false pretense and an empty mockery nearly all the duties imposed for the aid of our great home industries are prohibitive thus enabling the american beneficiary to realize enormous profits frequently amounting to more than 100 per cent in excess of the wages paid labor for production this is charged up as a reasonable profit for the manufacturer it is contended with much force and plausibility in view of such unequal disproportionate division of profits between the manufacturer aud the laborer that our labor is the cheapest in the world i mean by that that the product of the american laborer brings more money to the pockets of his employer sells for more money in the markets of the world than the products of the labor of any other country the american laborer for thrift energy and skill has no equal in any foreign land greater profits are realized from the toil of our laboring people in our protected manufacturing and other industrial interests than ever recorded in any period of the worlds history the trouble is under the theory of protection as represented in the paynealdrich bill that we are now laboring o1 and every other tariff law made by the republican party since the close of the civil war there is an unjust and unrighteous division of the results or profits of labor between the laborer and the employer if these things be true then congress at least should see to it that the laboring people of our country ought to be safeguarded against the hordes of criminal pauper immigrants that come to our shores annually i believe that one of the niost desirable reforms is to increase the head tax on the inmigrant under the law existing it is only 4 it is well established that this head tax is not paid by the immigrant but is paid by the steamship company that brings him over the imlmigrant is not even informed about this head tax yet we are advised that the expenditures of the immigrant fund annually exceed the receipts from the payment of head taxes by several millions by such a paltry head tax of 4 we are not only doing injustice to the laborer of our country but we are filling the pockets of foreign steamship companies that never contribute a dollar to the expenses of our government it is these foreign steamship companies that are the most active procurers and agents in drumming up the worthless idle pauper class of foreigners to transport them to our country it is well known that many cities cheerfully pay the passage of all idle dependent pauper in order to get rid of him i have had occasion before to express my opinion on this subject in the fiftyninth congress i introduced the following bill a bill to amend the immigration laws of the united states be it enacted etc tlat the head money collected from alien passengers under the act of march 3 1903 to regulate the immigration of aliens shall be 20 instead of 2 as provided in said act sec 2 that this act shall take effect ninety days after its passage observation o1 all the line of prepared statistics as to the insanity criminals and paupers among these immigrants as compared to our native people convinces me now that the amount prescribed as head tax in my bill was right and if such had been the law great benefit would have come to our country why when we realize the fact that quite 42 per cent of the inmates of our insane asylums are of foreign birth not to say anything as to how many are inmates of our penal and charitable institutions then we realize the true situation i do not wish to be understood as saying or believing that all immigrants are undesirable citizens but i do declare from the appalling statistics of insanity crime and pauperism among the immigrants that reach our country some method ought to be devised to prevent such a class from coming here our deportation laws ought to be amended by striking out the words from causes existing prior to landing that is a broad open device to keep any of the unworthy class from being sent back to tile country they came from take one of that class who has violated our penal laws or is an inmate of one of our charitable institutions how can you legally establish the fact that he became a public charge or an inmate of a penal institution from causes existing prior to landing i admit that valuable amendments have been made in the last few years to our immigration laws and experience demonstrates that other amendments are needed let us have a genuine deportation provision practicable and easily enforced our present ain should be to prevent the undesirable class of immigrants from ever landing this is the specific remedy let us refuse to give any ship engaged in the transportation of immigrants clearance papers at any of our ports if guilty of a failure to comply with all the stipulations conditions and requirements prescribed by our government before

maintenance of the speakers automobile although be it remembered that his speaker salary is 12 000 per year and when this item of 2 500 was under debate the speaker vacated the chair took the floor in its defense and ridiculed the idea of economy in the fight which the democrats and insurgent republicans were making against it and in the course of his remarks he took occasion to ridicule and laugh at the acts of hon james williams exmember of congress and exgovernor of the state of indiananow deceasedwith whom the speaker said he served in the fortythird congress and in his criticism of blue

were served in the cloakrooms and received universal applause on that side of the housedemocratic sideand universal applause on bringing about a great national issue when he held up the fan and said great heavens fans furnished from the contingent fund of the house i it is not my purpose to enter upon a defense of blue jeans williams he needs none he was one of indianas great men along by the

the men who believed that a public office was a public trust and that a public officer was a public servant and along these lines he lived his life and now that he has gone to his reward the speaker may doubt his policy of economy as being the part of wisdom but he can not doubt his consistency and if there was a blue jeans williams occupying the white house and one at the head of every department of the government i am absolutely sure that the people would not be asked for 175 000 to enable them to learn the road to economy and i am equally sure that if blue jeans williams had been

556 07 3 214 96 198 97 or 1 640 000 000 more during the last four years of roosevelts administration than the last four years of clevelands nearly 105 per cent more today than fourteen years ago although the population has only increased during this time about 32 per cent when people double their expenditures either their wealth has correspondingly increased or they are going in debt our national wealth increased approximately 20 per cent in the last four years over the first four years so it will be readily seen that our national increased expenditures are not properly chargeable to our increase in wealth by this showing the republicans expended 1 640 000 000 more under roosevelt than cleveland which reduced to a mathematical certainty means that instead of uselessly squandering 300 000 000 the real misappropriation has been 410 000 000 per year evidently senator aldrich knew what he was talking about and this accounts for the demand upon the part of the president for 175 000 to enable him to call to his aid some of the great captains of industry to tell him how to economize with the peoples money in the language of horace greeley who said the way to resume is to resume the way to economize is to economizestop spending so much money i would not cripple any arm of the government by refusing to appropriate the necessary money with which to administer it i would appropriate every dollar that may be necessary for this purpose but not one dollar more the everlasting increase in federal officeholders together with the continued increase of their salaries is one of the greatest evils now afflicting the country and many of these increases in federal offices in my judgment is worse than useless if the government would inaugurate the motto of a full days pay for a full days work and make all live up to it in my judgment this would obviate the necessity of so many new additional officeholders the trouble with thousands of employees of the government is they are afraid of doing too much work for the pay now xeceived by then and hence the continued request for new and additional offices coupled with higher wages instead of devising means to reduce public expenditures we are engaged in devising new schemes of taxation to impose additional burdens upon the people from march 15 to august 5 1909 congress was convened in extra session at an enormous expense to the people for the purpose of revising the tariff and after the revision was effected the law placed upon the statute books its burdens felt by the people it is now universally condenmied by all except the special interests as the worst tariff act ever i want to call attention to some of the features of this bill it contains a provision imposing a tax of 1 per cent upon the net incomes of all corporations whose yearly income is in excess of 5 000 this item of taxation is now held up by the republican party as one of the blessingg contained in the measure because it will produce revenue to the government of 30 000 000 per year we all know that the corporations will not pay this 1 per cent out of their own net income to do so would mean a reduction in their annual dividends this burden will be shifted from the shoulders of the corporations to the shoulders of the people in the way of increasing the prices of the necessities of life all along the line no one doubts the truth of this statement who gives it a moments study in the past few months people by the millions have organized themselves into antimeateating societies refusing to buy meat from the meat trust because of the high price of the same the meat trust is subject to this 1 per cent tax and in their attempt to recoup this amount from the people the price of the meat has become so high that millions of people in this country must abstain from its use the country recently witnessed a bold attempt on the part of the railroads to increase freight rates over the united states and this class of corporations like the meat trust are subject to this tax and in order to shove this burden from their shoulders and place it upon the shoulders of the people and recover the tax back the railroads made the attempt to uniformly increase the freight rates this attempt onthe part of the people in refusing to eat or buy meat sold by the meat trust is but an emulation of our forefathers prior to the days of the war of our independence when they organized and refused to eat or buy anything imported into this country from great britain but this is not the only expensive luxury contained in the tariff bill it provides for the establishment of a customs court at an expense of 100 000 per year to the people although the same class of cases now being tried by this court had been tried for more than a century by the federal courts and then these courts were not overburdened with hard work no one doubts that this customs court is now forever fastened upon the people and will go on from year to year at an everincreasing cost but this is not the only luxury found in the tariff legislation of last year the sundry civil appropriation bill which passed this house a few days ago carried an item of 250 000 to create a tariff board designed to enable the president to collect data concerning the cost of the manufacture of articles at home and abroad although we have a complete system of foreign consular service and other special agents at the governments command which could readily do this work if it was necessary to do it at all no good will ever come of this appropriation so far as the mass of the people are concerned it will however serie one purpose and serve it well it will give several persons a good fat job at the peoples expense and following the universal experienca of alltlhe bureaus and commissions heretofore established with a small beginning this board will continue to grow in magnitude until in a few years it will be chiefly known by the amount of money it takes to keep it going for almost six months congress has been dealing with the railroad rate bill with a view of giving the people some relief from the extortionate charges from freight and passenger charges now made by the railroads and when this measure becomes a law it will contain some more expensive luxuries and create new jobs for the faithful but which the people must pay it establishes a commerce court to consist of five federal judges marshals clerks and all other machinery necessary to put into operation at an annual cost of 100 000 to the people although the federal courts have heretofore taken care of this class of cases and no one ever heard of these courts working overtime but new jobs had to be created the faithful had to be cared for and to do it this court was created the bill contains a provision for establishing a new commission the duty assigned to it is the study of the question of issuing railroad stocks and bonds carrying in appropriation of 25 000 to defray the expense of the commission no one doubts that this is but the beginning of another large commission that ere long will cost the people hundreds of thousands of dollars per year to maintain it we now have an interstate commerce commission well organized and well equipped to do this same work but if this burden was imposed upon the interstate commerce commission it would not provide room for new and highsalaried men clerks and stenographers as the new commission will we are fast becoming a government of commissions every one of which as soon as it is fastened upon the people makes itself felt by enormous appropriations to support and maintain it one of the most noted of these commissions is the immigration commission created in 1907 this commission has expended 782 992 62 many other instances like this could be cited showing an utter waste and disregard of the peoples money but a safe place to begin to practice economy is to begin at home congress annually appropriates 154 000 to pay the mileage of members of congress it the rate of 20 cents per mile in going to and returning from the capital although the salary has been increased from 7 per day to 7 500 per year i have introduced two bills asking the repeal of this antiquated statute and i have made repeated demands upon the chairman of the committee on mileage for a hearing upon these measures and while the committee is furnished and equipped with a clerk and other necessary things to make it a thoroughgoing committee yet i have been denied a hearing upon the bills and they are now quietly sleeping in the pigeonholes of that committee where i suppose they will remain until the people demand the repeal of this statute while the appropriations in all the departments have increased more than 100 per cent during the time the republican party has had control of the government yet the appropriations for the ariny and navy have increased more than any other of the departlments the total appropriations for the army during the last four years of the cleveland administration was 94 3 49 r 35 28 the appropriations for the army during the last four years of roosevelts administration was 351 029 878 78 or 259 8s0 343 58 more under the last four years of roosevelts administration than under the last four years more of grover during the last four years of clevelands administration there was appropriated 107 410 094 36 for the navy and during the last four years of roosevelts administration there wvs appropriated for the navy 460 649 262 29 or 353 239 067 93 more during the last four years of roosevelts administration than during the last four years of clevelands these enormous appropriations for the army and navy continue to go on year by year at a time when we are at profound peace with all the world the special interests of the country demand a strong linmy and a powerful navy to protect their interest yet when this class of people are asked to support an income and an inheritance tax they throw up their hands in holy horror and cry socialism and these systems of taxation are the fairest systems of taxation in existence being systems of taxation the burden of which can not be shifted from the shoulders of one to the shoulders of another the immortal lincoln at the close of the great civil war when our country was sodden with human blood rent and torn in twain

i have cited cotton specifically but poultry perishable goods of all kinds grains wool even lumber and every other commodity was affected these frauds are committed at times by collusion with the

i want to say right here to some of my southern friends who are in favor of a tariff on lumbar because it is a southern industry do not be alarmed at all over this bill as i shall show before i get through that the bill does not and can not reduce the tariff on lumber one penny i believe that the chairman of the ways and means committee thought that it did but i will bet the last dollar that there is one mah on thtit committee who knew that one provision which was ingeniously inserted would prevent even a pennys reduction of the tariff on lumber and that is the distinguished gentleman from michigan i shall confine my remarks to a discussion of the lumber question i must confess that i approach it with some feeling of intimidation i recall thdt the distinguished mahcit 30 member from michigan himself a lumberman a id member of the committee made this bold challenge at the hearings before the committee i can meet any man on earth on this question and flay him in a minute while the gentleinna covered a considerable territory he evened lip in the limited time with which he was going to thrash his opponent i wish to disclaim at once even the appearance of having the audacity to accept his challenge the democratic platform declares in language that can mystify no manwe demand the immediate repeal of the tariff on wood pulp print paper lumber timber and logs and that these articles be placed upon the free list some of my democratic colleagues seem to think and have so declared that that meant that the democratic party was in favor of free trade in lumber only in the event that it was given the power to enact a bill embodying the whole scheme of a democratic tariff for revenue only in fact sir this has been boldy proclaimed to my people since the election whence comes this neverbeforeheardof doctrine certainly the democratic party never dreamed of such a position it appears to me that this argument is made by the men who unwilling to give reasons for supporting their partys platform are hunting for pretexts to violate it the inevitable logic of such a position is that if republicans retain control of congress so that a democratic bill in toto can not be enacted then the democratic party is for a tariff on lumber it further forces its proponents to the position that unless there is a democratic reduction on all articles there should be no reduction on anynot even on articles controlled by the trusts will my democratic colleagues make this new doctrine apply to wood pulp and print paper if it applies to lumber it must also apply to wood pulp and print paper what democrat is bold enough in this house to declare that he will refuse to vote if opportunity is presented for free trade in wood pulp and print paper as a separate proposition was not every democrat in this house during the last congress eager and ready to vote for free trade in wood pulp reread your platform in the same breath in which it demanded that wood pulp and print paper be placed upon the free list it demanded that lumber be placed there how can the most evasive ingenuity in the light of loyalty to his partys platform explain his advocacy of the one and his opposition to the other what argument on principle can a democratic advocate of a tariff on lumber possibly make for free wood pulp that can not be made for free lumber and what argument against free lumber will not apply with equal force against free wood pulp an investigation will convince him that the tariff on wood pulp is more of a tariff for revenue only than the tariff on lumber the democratic party in the denver platform declared no new policy it simply stated a policy on this question that had been consistently and persistently pursued by it for thirty years in this house and in the senate the mills bill which passed a democratic house in 1888 had in it free trade in lumber the wilsongorman act which was passed by a democratic congress in 1894 had in it free trade in lumber it has been asked why the democratic party selected this article as one to be placed on the free list there has not been presented in this house nor ever enacted into law a tariff bill by either party in the last sixty years that did not have upon the free list dozens of articles while it is a general rule to tax all property for the support of government both the state and federal governments have always considered that there are certain kinds of property or certain articles of prime necessity that ought never to be taxed for its support in the states we except from the general rule church and school property and property of charitable institutions in the federal government congress has always made exception to the general rule by placing upon the free list certain articles the democratic party has felt in the past and feels now that iuinber which enters into the conduct of every citizens life and touches him at every point a product a crop that was neither planted nor nurtured by the hand of man but given to the people by the goodness of god should never be taxed by tariff for revenue of the government or for profit of the citizen the party knew that the man on the mountain side who built his hut the frontiersman who built his cabin the artisan who built his cottage had to use lumber it knew that the farmer needed it for his house ills barns his stables his fences it knew that the people far removed from tile cities needed it to build schoolhouses in which to educate their children they needed it to build church houses in which to worship the almighty the democratic party resolved that it would never place the plundering hand of a tariff between any american citizen and the building of a home for his family or the erecting of a temple for his god i remind the republicans that james g blaine forty years ago on this floor declared that no tax should ever be placed on lumberthis prime necessity in mans life my party has followed consistently and persistently the policy that so far as tariff law is concerned every encouragement should be given and no obstacle shall be placed in the way of any homeless man building a shelter for his wife and children as for me unless my people otherwise instruct before my election or unless modified by my nominating authority the path plainly marked out by the national platform of my party is a sufficient guide for my legislative footsteps as a representative of my people in this body i have no quarrel to make with my colleagues who desire to tread another path some pledged their people during the campaign that they would stand for tariff on lumber a few perhaps were so instructed by their nominating conventions these as democrats should stand by their pledge and follow their instructions many i believe on account of the pathetic prophecies of ruin and disaster by those of our fellowcitizens who are supposed to be benefited by this tariff have been alarmed into the belief that the removal would strike a deadly blow at a southern industry soeni i fear have been unconciously intimidated by the large lumber interests into an advocacy of this undemocratic measure it is better for yourselves and your party and your country my friends to yield to that patriotic sense which lifting the legislators vision above his state or district lines encompasses the whole people of this nation if surrender we must on any question i trust we many be found surrendering to the sense of the common good rather than to the demands of the special few i want to say here before i proceed further that in my opinion after the most careful and thorough investigation of this matter as it relates to our southern lumbermen the retention or removal of this tariff will not affect a pennys worth a single lumber interest or a single foot of lumber in the south candor forbids me to stop with that statement while i am convinced that it will not injure the business of the southern lumbermen let no man understand that i favor removal of the tariff on lumber on that account according to the protection theory the diugley tariff enables the manufacturer to add to every thousand feet of lumber he sells from 2 on rough lumber to as high as 4 on lumber planed or dressed on four sides in addition to the 2 on rough lumber an extra 50 cents is given to each side that is dressed or planed the tariff on each thousand feet cut in the united states if the lumber protectionists are correct averages 3 per thousand we cut yearly 40 000 000 000 feet if i am called upon as a representative of the people to vote for a bill which by law forces the 90 000 000 of american freemen to pay to a few thousand lumbermen the tribute of 120 000 000 yearly as an honest man and a patriot i could not vote for such a measure if every dollar of it went into my district i have a home industry to protect whose friends seem to be few on this flooran industry whose operations extend to every mans district the great consumers industry i am asked by my frightened lumber friends to vote for a law which if their contention is correct will enable them to tax by the tariff for their profit every mianbanker merchant mechanic farmerin my district and elsewhere from 2 to 4 on every 1 000 feet of lumber he uses i will never consent to place this burden upon tho backs of my people or your people nor shall i ask for tariff reduction on an industry in your district and then appeal to you to give me protection on an industry ill my district never call we prove our sincerity for real tariff reform unless we can look beyond our own districts and touch elbows with the democracy of the nation here and elsewhere in its fight against tariff robbery if you begin protection on one you will end protection onl all industries if it is right on one it is right on all if you are for protection for your home industry you must be for protection on the other fellows industry if you are for protection from principle then honesty demands that you be for protection on all industries if you are for protection from selfishness then as a matter of policy you must be for protection on every industry you call not get the other fellow to help you by law force the people to pay tribute to your industry unless you are willing to help him force the people to pay tribute to his industry the scheme of robbing by law millions for the benefit of a few is one of harmonious cooperation i beg to remind the democrats of this house that a protective tariff is no better now than it was when the tilden platform of 1876 denounced it as a masterpiece of injustice inequality and false pretense it is no better now than when the cleveland platform of 1892 denounced it as a franda robbery of the great majority of the american people for the benefit of a few it is no better now than when the parker platform of 1904 denounced it as a robbery of the many to enrich a few and my democratic colleagues of north carolina it is no better now than when ransom and vance carolinas twin immortals thundered at the other end of this capitol against its iniquities both voted consistently for free trade in lumber when did the principle of protection become sound to the democratic mind did it become right when the location of some of its beneficiaries was transferred across the potomac if protection is wrong it is wrong south of the mason and dixon line as well as north of it let me say to our friends that i do not think this country is big enough for two protectivetariff parties we need but one party in this country to use the taxing power of this great government to make the millions pay forced tribute to the few we have a party that has made a triumphant success of legalized plunder for fifty years and i am opposed to the democratic party entering this field of competition with it when you begin to vote for protection upon anything for your state or district you should tell your people that the democratic party has been wrong and the republican party right all the time on the question of protection you are putting into the blood of your own democratic people

passion misunderstanding in england a clever writer has said that what the legitimate is to the lurid and crude melodrama the news section of the great papers is to the editorial page in the reports in other words the reader gets factswhat men said and didwhile in the editorials he gets exaggeration misconstruction malice violent rhetoric alas in the case of many american papers it can not truthfully be said that the news columns exhibit any tendency to the legitimate whatever the question may be direct primaries graft municipal charters corporate franchises what notthe news columns are as melodramatic as the editorials we have portraits of villains and of saints we find incorruptible virtue battling with brazen knavery and low cunning the correspondents and rep~orters are expected encouraged instructed to editorialize to pass judgment to draw freely on their imaginations mindreading powers vocabulary of invective and laudatton indeed the distinction between news and editorials has ceased to possess any meaning for most of the newspapers not excepting those who call themselves independent now nothing is more vicious and at the same time more utterly gratuitous and inefficient than this destruction of the news value of the socalled news columns let the editor say what hie pleases in the propier place let the correspondent or reporter give his personal impression of the atmosphere of a fight or situation but first and last let the reporter report what did this man say in his speech or interview what did that man do on a certain occasion and what was his own explanation of the act denounce scoff sneer moralize exhort h~ut let all this be separated from the news readers would deeply appreciate this and pay more attention to the editors opinions for hits scrupulous handling of the facts would ins pire confidence in his sincerity thus alike from the view point of newspaper influence and from that of proper discharge of the primary function of a modern paper the result of the separation would he vastly increased efficiency again a little further on this same writer says there are advertisers who do not hesitate to demand either silence or positive championship of their side of a question there are theatrical managers who will not tolerate adverse criticisms of their productions in a certain style or manner and who actually dictate dismissals of writers this coming from a journalist whose writings find place in the american journal of sociology should lead us to look in the advertising columns of the newspaper or magazine which gives evidence of this class of commercialism to find the influence that controls its policy and right here i have heard it stated that the great department stores and importers pay annually for advertising to the american press not less than 150 000 000 this may explain to a degree at least some things about tlhe tremnendous campaign against the whole policy of protection which was inaugurated by the american press about the time when herman ridder and john norris made their now historic trip down to washington it was about this time that the word cannonism was invented and from that day to the present moment the virulence and hysteria can not be accounted for by considerations of patriotism or public welfare nor is it possible that without prearrangement and common design all these newspapers and magazines should with one accord in all parts of the country at one and the same time assail the tariff bill by one and the same method their uniform action and uniform methods showv concert and conspiracy because i have seen in all this villification and abuse no single resort to argument or persuasion p~rejudice and passion alone are resorted to there is no newspaper or magazinc that undertakes to point out to the american reader anything seriously wrong with this new revenue measure but prejudice is sought to be excited by appealing and inciting distrust and hatred against the men who made it cannon and aldrich and hale are bad men tremendously bad men therefore the bill they made must be bad for nearly two years in the language of the distinguished journalist which i have quoted we have had portraits of villains and of saints we find incorruptible virtue battling with brazen knavery and low cunning it is not enough to draw down and destroy the character of every public man who favored the payne bill but hysterical action upon the part of the general public must be excited by cunning appeals to the prejudice and passion of all the people they are told of the excessively high price of living the columns of the papers of the publishers association are filled with hypocritical sympathy for the poor consumer and yet there is not one of all these papers that dares mention one price that has advanced to the domestic consumer and attempt to point out in a reasonable way how that has been affected by the payne tariff bill without concert of action it is inexplicable how all at once from every corner of the country cannonism whatever that is was discovered to be such a tremendous menace to our institutions and to the common good the hue and cry the clamor the pursuit in its suddenness reminds one of a great organized hunt when the whole countryside has been gathered together for the purpose of hunting down and destroying some dangerous and vicious animal the blowing of horns and the beating of bushes has been tremendous and what is it all about will somebody answer has all this been done for the ultimate consumer bah they had no more thought of the poor consumer than had that downward revisionist who invented the spring attachment to the sugar scales the time has come to unmask the public are tired of this kind of journalism if these newspapers can not retain the patronage of the importers and sanely combat protection by argument and reason in place of abuse they should at least have the common decency to pull down the flag of the republican party in my speech at youngstown i spoke in general terms of the press and for that i have been justly criticised in that i made no exception of the small local newspapers since that time i have been agreeably surprised to learn of the influence and power of the little local newspaper that has no commercial relations with either the predatory trust for whom it is asserted that tariff bills are all made nor with the importers for whom the downward revisionist press is so solicitous i was amazed to learn how many of the local newspapers of ohio are still for protection my generalization was unjust to them i wish to exclude the local newspaper i read with pleasure from the article from which i have already quoted entitled is an honest and sane newspaper press possible a merited tribute to the local press it is as follows let us see what ails the average big commercial newspaper i say big for no one who is familiar with the american daily press will deny that we have a number of local or small newspapers that are as excellent as human institutions can be that is there are newspapers that publish only news fit to print that never deliberately falsify or misrepresent that have convictions and the courage to apply them to the events issues and personalities of the day that employ competent and selfrespecting reporters and correspondents and consequently are well written from first page to last and that are read by educated persons with pleasure and profit newspapers like this are all over the country in every part of the land who have not lost their influence with their patrons and who have not forfeited the esteem of the public they will mold mightily the public opinion of this country one such little newspaper will be worth more as an ally of the payne tariff bill than a dozen of the great commercial papers that have been hysterically shouting wolf wolf wolf until nobody heeds them i now read from the editorial column of the norwalk reflector of june 6"], [0.8983914256095886, 0.8983914256095886, 0, "i desire to submit a few remarks while the house is in committee of the whole house on the state of the union on may 3 1909 there was submitted in this house a resolution of inquiry directed to the secretary of the navy request ing information as to a proposed gift of silver service for use on board of the united states battle ship mi8sissippi the chief decoration of which was understood to be a portrait engraving of jefferson davis late chief of the defunct southern confederacy it sought to inquire into the propriety and authority for the act and contemplated corrective legislation that its exact nature and scope may be readily understood it is here quoted in full whereas the dignity and character of the united states government and its creditable standing at home and abroad require that its battle ships should be in command of officers imbued with high american ideals healthy loyalty and a just pride in the history and institutions of the government they serve and whereas public monuments paintings engravings and other works of art exhibited or used in government buildings structures or in other public places belonging to the general government are intended and should be calculated to inspire reverence for such ideals and teach valuable lessons of patriotism and love of country and whereas it is reported in the public press and not contradicted that an elaborate silver service set of 62 pieces with the centerpiece thereof decorated by an artistic portrait engraving of jefferson davis the head of the late southern confederacy has been purchased for presen tation to the battle ship mississippi for the permanent use of its officers at social and public functions to the exclusion of any other service which might be furnished by the government or presented by other donors and whereas of the 37 officers now in command of the vessel including capt john c fremont of california a worthy descendant of a brave union general in the civil war only 7 were appointed from the states lately adhering to the confederacy and such proportion of appointments from the different states of the union is likely to be continued in the future therefore be it resolved that the secretary of the navy be requested to inform the congress by whom and on what authority such gift is to be accepted and what lesson of loyalty or patriotism such portrait engraving is intended to teach and with what ideals of government it is expected thereby to inspire the officers and men now or hereafter to be in control of such battle ship and especially to ascertain and inform the congress whether or not the proposed gift of silver service thus decorated and such use of it are agreeable to or desired by the officers now in command of the allssissippi as will be seen the resolution does not contain an offensive word or reference of any kind it is in line with the loyal sentiment of the country and the policy of the government ever since the close of the civil war to carefully exclude from government buildings and grounds everything that might tend to offend or wound the feelings of our southern brethren especially unpleasant reminders of their attempt in 1861 to disrupt the union and destroy the government established by george washington and his compatriots the sons of the confederacy thanks to this considerate thoughtfulness on the part of the general government may pass through the full courses at west point and annapolis without seeing on the walls or in the corridors of the buildings any picture or motto calculated to renind them of the fact that their fathers at one time deserted the old flag under which they serve as cadets a confederate reunion might be held here in this capitol building and not a soldier of the lost cause be reminded by picture cut or carving of vicksburg or appomattox he would see in the rotunda a magnificent painting of the surrender of cornwallis but nothing of the fate of pemberton or lee he would see representations of glorious victories won by american arms in mexico and against foreign foes on other battlefields but nothing of lookout mountain shermans march to the sea or the capture of richmond no arc de triumph has ever been permitted to span any of the magnificent avenues of the nations capital the dominant element of the governmentloyal people of the north if you pleasehave ever been thoughtful and considerate of the vanquished those who failed in their illadvised illtimed and illstarred effort to destroy by arms the best government god ever gave to man the right hand of friendship and forgetfulness ever since the tragic furling of the stars and bars at appomattox has been generously extended by the victors it is not their fault if a want of fraternal feeling exists anywhere within the nations domain the passing years have done their perfect work on both sides in healing the wounds of the civil war generously has the line between the blue and the gray been obliterated except in matters of vital principle equality of citizenship under the law has been made absolute without humiliating conditions the government and the people have closed their eyes to the constitutional definition of treason only one man jefferson davis of all the confederacy spurned the governments generous proffer to restore forfeited citizenship after the collapse of his hopes of a southern empire he seemed to live and die literally as the man without a country quoting from a eulogy by his chief lieutenant gen john b gordon mr davis for the last quarter century of his life was the citizen of no country professed allegiance to no government was not concerned in the duties or ambitious for the rewards which make the life of an ordinary man peace blessed peace and forgetfulness seemed to spread her wings alike over north and south after the surrender and parole of the armed forces of the confederacy and with rare exceptions as in the case of mr davis it was fondly hoped that the confederacy itself and all that it stood for in opposition to the general government might in time be forgotten might pass away like a horrid dream of the night but sad commentary on american patriotism this hope has not been realized on the contrary the false ideals of the confederacy would seem from recent events to have been only temporarily laid aside incased as it were in chrysalis form cocoonlike in furled confederate flags only to burst forth in new forms as soon as the general government and the loyal forgiving people of the north could again be lulled into a feeling of security brotherly love and indifference has this condition arrived are there no longer any cherished ideals of the northland has maudlin sentimentality replaced heroic conviction does the recent chiseling of the name of jefferson davis immediately above that of abraham lincoln on cabin john bridge at washington indicate a mistaken belief in the waning glory and fame of lincoln or a wish for the recrudescence of his confederate rival the portent of the times would seem to indicate a belief in the minds of southern statesmen that the ideals of lincoln and grant the eternal principles of right vindicated in a four years war for the union are being forgotten or at least lost sight of in the present mad feverish moneygetting commercial age there is no other explanation of recent events the erection of a monument to major wirz of andersonville fame the forcing into the national hall of fame a statue of a confederate general in the full uniform he wore while fighting to destroy the government the attempted decorating of an american battle ship with engraved object lessons calculated to teach young officers reverence for the false ideals of the confederacy and the congressional attacks now pending in congress one in the senate and one in the house to nullify and destroy both the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments guaranties on which rest many of the vital results of the civil war only tell a part of the story in unguarded moments the hidden thoughts and purposes of a people come to light note the sudden outburst of violent invective at the unexpected introduction of the resolution in question at the late special session of congress simple plain and inoffensive as were its terms it was at once attacked and with its almost unknown author made the object of merciless abuse and misrepresentation all the deepseated rancor and prejudice of the old days of the southern slavocracy when northern men were called mud sills and union soldiers were contemptuously referred to as lincoln hirelings seemed to break forth with increased violence on a mere suggestion that united states battle ships are not the proper place for the display of confederate emblems and that the young officers of the american navy are entitled to different object lessons and different incentives to duty than the engraved portraits of confederate chiefs the storm raged with bitter fury in the press of the south especially in that of mississippi the united states mails from that section were burdened with threats of violence against the hapless author of the resolution even here in the national capital there was a suggestive feeling that possibly a mite of the old spirit of preston brooks and others who were wont to strike down officials for opinions sake might be lingering in the halls or underground recesses of the capitol building it was a sudden awakening for the people of the north who had fondly cherished the belief that grants magnanimity at appomattox was still remembered and appreciated in the south so violent and abusive was this attack in a personal sense that on may 15 at the extra session i rose in the house to a question of privilege and ignoring the low scurrilous abuse of irresponsible letter writers and small newspapers asked to reply to certain articles in four of the leading southern journals one of them published at the capital of the state of mississippi styling itself the official journal of mississippi i believed then and i believe yet that i was entitled under the rules to the privilege but it was denied after the articles had been read in full by the clerk they are printed in the record of that date to make the situation plain however i here quote from them a number of personal excerpts this man eiollingswortt is serving his first term in congress and is evidently a south hater of the rankest kind who is seeking to make political capital for the future raised in a section notorious for its hatred of the south of southern men and southern institutions in a restricted and narrow sphere and with no public experience and taught to believe that jefferson davis was a traitor who should have been tried convicted and hung it is perhaps natural that such a contemptible little whelp should rise up to abuse the men and slander the section that appreciates him htollingsworth belongs to the past though a young man to that class of narrowminded political wretches who think it a virtue to wave the bloody shirt and an honor to denounce the souths great chieftain it is all nonsense for this little ohio congressman to talk about the proposed gift being agreeable to the officers or to ask by whom and on what authority such gift is to be accepted the navy department has known for months what the design would be and no word of displeasure has been received no suggestion as to change made so it is safe to say that no attention will be paid to the cheap resolution of the political nonentity from ohio the ohio congressman who got up in the house the other day and raised all manner of sand about the picture of jefferson davis being put on the silver service presented to the battle ship mississippi ought to be informed that nobody cares what he thinks about it a politically prejudiced gas bag from ohio can no more cast reflection upon the life and character of jefferson davis than a mangy fleabitten bobtailed cur dog can insult the moon by getting up at 2 oclock in the morning and barking himself to death at the palefaced luminary davis is the idol of the south and will continue to be long after this windy misfit from ohio has been retired by his constituency and everlastingly forgotten by the nation it will be interesting to know when and where congressman david a hollngswortic of ohio fit bled and died for his country hed congressman iollingswortih been informed as he should have been he would have known that whatever are the designs and ornaments and figures and emblems on this silverware were selected by a commission of men named by the state that the money for this service was contributed by citizens of mississippi and that nothing has been done without the approval of the secretary of the navy at washington measured by his frothings he is indeed a little man if aged enough to have enlisted in the struggle between the states he was not one of the brave men who were actively engaged in active service and on the fighting line brave men men who experienced the hardships of the march the camp the bivouac and the shock of battle do not wave the bloody shirt perhaps congressman holingsworth was one of the home guards or one of shermans bums who robbed defenseless women old men and children who is hollingsworth has he ever fit and bled and died for his country the man who holds the position of secretary of war today in the cabinet of president taft believes in jefferson davis and if davis deserves the contempt and execration that this pusillanimous pigmy from ohio would heap upon his name the son of a confederate soldier who believes in his fathers political creed has no place in the cabinet of mr taft these quotations fairly represent in my judgment the real feeling and spirit in exconfederate circles toward those in the north who are unwilling to shut their eyes to the manifest and growing recrudescence of the confederacy in thought and power here at the national capital i am not alone entitled to the distinction on attempting respectfully to reply after the articles were read i was met by technical objections from at least five honor2 358 able members representing states lately adhering to the southern confederacy and two from new yorkseven in all and on their objections it was held that such accusations sufficient if true to warrant expulsion did not reflect upon the gentleman from ohio in his representative capacity and were not therefore subject to a question of privilege that is to say it is not officially regarded as a reflection upon the representative character of a member of the house barring personal epithets to accuse him of being a misfit congressman introducing cheap resolutions and raising all manner of sand in the house to make political capital for the future a graver or more contemptible charge against the actions or motives of a member or against his official integrity could not in my humble judgment be made if guilty he should be expelled it seemed to me unfair but it was effective i was knocked out in the language of the prize ring before i got on my gloves unanimous consent a request seldom denied to a member was asked to have my remarks printed in the record explaining my position and the resolution i had offered but again objections from the same source came prompt and vigorous i was squelched i felt like a steam roller had unexpectedly passed over me as the gavel fell ending my efforts the result my own discomfiture shall not weigh a feather with me in the calculation it was not the first time i had witnessed an apparent confederate victory but sinking my own personality entirely i ask again what of the results the press and public men of the south seemed to accept and hail the incident as a complete vindication in the congress of the united states of the principles for which the confederacy stood exultant echoes of this sentiment were heard at every confederate reunion from the potomac to the gulf and even here in the national capital it was as plainly manifested in certain quarters as was the joy which showed itself in many faces immediately following the first battle of manassas junction the quoted newspaper articles claimed to have been thus approved were read and reread with gleeful comment literally a broad smile spread over the southland at my discomfiture and why not my countrymen they stand today unchallenged on the records of this congress they contain sentiments abhorrent to the calm conservative just judgment of the people whose loyalty under lincoln saved this government from destruction and yet no reply was permitted let me quote a few other excerpts not of a personal nature everybody in america who knows the history of the two men knows that in point of education native ability culture oratory legal attainments character and unselfish patriotism that jefferson davis was a greater man than abraham lincoln and knows furthermore that the cause for which the southern soldiers fought was the cause of right o 0 5 0 0 0 0 in revering the memory of jefferson davis the state of mississippi has honored itself and exalted the patriotism of her gallant sons and the devotion and heroism of her daughters the people of mississippi have contributed the money to buy the silver service for the battle ship mississippi bearing the name of their state and the people who contributed believe in the purity and nobility of the life of jefferson davis they sympathized with him during the war between the states they honor his memory and admire beyond expression his superb qualities if the portrait was not on the silver service i should have it put on the service and i would put it in such a conspicuous place that it would be impossible to look at the service without seeing the best likeness possible of the incomparable man who served as president of the confederacy these expressions are not the words of irresponsible passionled men of the south they were not written in 1860 and 1861 when turbulent hotheads south and north if you please were rushing the american people into a clash of arm they were not inspired in the heat of the conflict as it raged from manassas junction to appomattox they were written deliberately in 1909 by representative men of the socalled new south and reveal a present purpose and determination not to let bygones be bygones not to stand by the honorable settlements made between the brave officers and men who fought to a finish the most unfortunate war ever known in history silently and insidiously night and day in the schools churches and other organizations for the control of public sentiment in the south even here in the halls of congress the leaven of distrust and discontent seems to be constantly working the senseless cry of the bloody shirt is still heard repeated and rerepeated as a complaint although sensible people long ago recognized it as a mere ruse to conceal southern hopes and designs southern ideals are being revived southern idols are being recanonized what i ask does this mean are the results of the civil war to be undermined and destroyed if not why the pending resolutions in this congress to nullify the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments why the scores and hundreds of bills introduced fortyfour years after the civil war to pay for alleged damages in the confederate states caused by the union armies in the necessary prosecution of the war why all this commotion about a simple protest against making our battle ships places for the display of confederate emblems why the reported raising of a large fund to erect a confederate memorial at arlington eclipsing in size and magnificence any of the present monuments if its purpose be not to establish a rival center for the annual display of confederate sentiment at a place peculiarly sacred to the memory of union soldiers who lie buried there in such numbers that they and their widows and orphans have been rudely referred to as the greatest of all monuments to confederate valor and confederate honor why the recent demand that antislavery mottoes be removed from the walls of the lee mansion by executive order the truth ought to be known if the state of mississippi merely because the navy department has chosen to name one of its battle ships after the state may force upon it for use anything offensive to the general sentiment of the country the sooner that fact is made known the better if one state may do this another may if the portrait engraving of jefferson davis be a proper object lesson on board the mississippi then that of brigham young would be equally appropriate on the recently launched battle ship utah either suggestion would make of the vessel a laughingstock in any foreign port in christendom i do not disguise the ultimate purpose of my resolution to be a law to prohibit such objectionable displays on all american vessels and public buildings they should be forbidden just as the law now forbids the official acceptance of foreign gifts abuse of the author and sarcastic references to his motives the usual resort of small minds in the absence of substantial arguments can not reduce or minimize the subject it will not down i waited patiently during the extra session in the hope that opportunity might come to bring up my resolution but i was disappointed meantime conditions changed somewhat after june 1 the date heralded in advance for an ostentatious delivery of the silver service on board the vessel with characteristic pomp and blandishment there to be accepted in like spirit by captain fremont son of a union general and first republican candidate for the presidency it was impossible to learn from the public press whether the davis silver had actually been taken on board an opossumlike reticence seemed to settle upon these same southern journals after the 1st of june the last published trace of the precious gift so far as i know shows it on shore in the hands of some of mr daviss friends and a subaltern of the vessel all seemingly making merry over what they evidently believed to be the indifferent attitude of congress and the navy department of the united states government i thereupon in the closing days of the extra session finding it impossible to secure consideration introduced another resolution to be taken up at the regular session and which embodied all the terms of the former one with this addition whereas undor the present rules of the house as administered it has so far been impossible to get such resolution up in the house for consideration and it has been reported in the public press that a subaltern officer of the vessel while on shore june 1 1909 assumed to accept such gift from some of mr daviss friends on behalf of the navy department of the united states government therefore resolved that in addition to the requests for information set forth in the original resolution above the secretary of the navy be also requested to inform the congress whether or not such a gift has been accepted by any one and if so how by whom and on what authority i again call attention to the total absence of any offensive words in the resolution it seeks only information on which to base future legislation i may be paxdoned therefore for a brief reply to the harsh invectives which my resolution excited the war is supposed to be over says this official journal of mississippi coupled with a personal reference intended to be offensive i agree with it in this sentiment the tragedy of appomattox fortyodd years ago was supposed to end a great civil war a war between the states a sort of war of the roses as some modern statesmen insist on calling it ulysses s grant the great captain of the union forces when he said let us have peace meant it from the bottom of his big loyal heart and every true soldier of the north responded amen so let it be they had learned to respect southern valor and southern courage they have kept the faith loyally have they abided by the pact of peace made by grant and lee conscious of the rectitude of their own hearts and the justice of their own cause northern soldiers have been content with the simple fruits of victory and have not in any manner sought the personal humiliation of the equally brave soldiers of the lost cause i also agree with another sentiment of my editorial critic applying it to the soldiers of both armies that brave men men who experienced the hardships of the march the camp and the bivouac and the shock of battle do not wave the bloody shirt a fact easily learned at any reunion of either the blue or the gray especially at such confederate reunions as the one held last summer at memphis the veterans of lee and jackson and johnston present on that occasion did not need to afterwards explain or apologize for anything they said or did they were not there to fight over again the battles of the war or exploit their own acknowledged bravery they were not disturbed by the excited expressions of a few tame civilians ostentatiously wearing confederate emblems and waving confederate flags in a time of profound peace when robert e lee of virginia grants famous rival the real idol of the southland with caln dignity and a nobility of soul born of his own belief in the righteousness of his cause feeling that his personal honor was untouched but recognizing the inevitable bowed his head in sorrow and handed his sword to general grant in token of capitulation and his acceptance of terms the most generous ever offered by a victor on the field of battle he acted in good faith intending thereby the full significance of his action when he said in anguish of heart to his devoted followers boys the war is over he meant it and they too like their comrades in the north responded in fitting approval they also have kept the faith lee did not by hysteric efforts seek personal safety in flight he gave no cause for scandal or false accusation he was not captured in hiding or in disguise it had been a contest of giants anglosaxon had contended against anglosaxon and cavalier for the triumph of ideas there was no middleground for compromise god himself had drawn the line and surrender meant abandonment of the cherished ideals of a lost cause deeply touched by grants magnanimity and in a spirit of heroic resignation lee bade his brave band of survivors farewell and they in turn with deep feeling and affection accepted his advice and returned to their homes henceforth to live the life of good citizenship they abided by the results of the war and have kept the pact of peace this action of grant and lee and their respective commands is an object lesson a benediction an inspiration and an example for all time to those who place god and country above passion and prejudice it is an object lesson in historic setting dwarfing in comparison into infinitesimal proportions the action of the state of mississippi in its recent attempt to revive war memories by forcing upon an american manofwar where only loyal thoughts should be taught or tolerated an object lesson for young officers such as the engraved portrait of the chief of the forces lately confederated against the government nor can i pass by without resenting it another suggestion of one of those quoted articles to the effect that the union army of general sherman was an army of bums who robbed defenseless women old men and children i was not with general sherman on his famous march to the sea but i knew him personally and knew enough of the character of his subordinate officers and men to denounce this sentiment as an atrocious libel man for man officer for officer no more creditable army ever marched to battle under a civilized flag my own part in the great war drama of the sixties was an unimportant and modest one a year or more of service as a private in the twentyfifth ohio volunteer infantry did not furnish many opportunities for distinction or for doing harm to the confederacy but simple and uneventful as it was i am proud of it and have no apologies to make one or two little incidents of my service ought perhaps to shield me from the embittered pens of writers who from the safe vantage of editorial sanctums charge me with being a south hater of the rankest kind narrowminded political wretch waver of the bloody shirt home guard or one of shermans bums and so forth allow me to recite one of these incidents not only in answer to the illtempered inquiry as to where i fit bled and died for my country but as showing that there never was any real animosity or hatred existing between the men behind the guns vuch as iow seems to inspire certain fireeating editors and reunion orators who were either too young or too feeble to do any of the fighting but who now delight in hurling hot explosions of wrath at imaginary foes forgetting that their efforts would be laughable if it were not for their serious effect on the minds of women and children don quixote attacking his windmill was not more ludicrous but to the incident i was about to relate i hold in my hand a little keepsake given me by a confederate prisoner captured in one of the minor engagements of the war it is a fractional bill of one dollar and a half issued august 1 1861 by the metropolitan savings bank richmond and payable in current funds of the kind then in use in the southern states it is a curiosity today but its value and significance to me then and now are shown by a memorandum of facts entered by me on its back after my return to camp it follows this note was given to me december 13 1861 on the battlefield of alleghany summit virginia by a confederate soldier whom i personally captured he belonged to a georgia regiment i shot at him once before he surrendered after throwing down his gun and giving up he remarked that he was nearly starved and i gave him enough for a good square meal out of the cooked rations in my haversack before turning him over to the prisoners guard he thanked me very cordially said the yanks were not such bad people after all and asked that i accept the note as a keepsake i felt a boyish pride in having captured a fullgrown rebel when i was only 17 years and 22 days old david a hollingsworti company b twentyfifth ohio volunteer infantry god bless that particular son of the south i am glad my shot went wild of its mark i called him a rebel then and he called me a yank in the common language of the time but i shared with him my flitch and hardtack and if he is still living and will visit me at washington i shall be glad to entertain him with the best meal the capitol caf6 can afford such incident is mentioned not in selfpraise but in selfdefense against the poisoned arrows incessantly winged at me from all sections of the south the navy department is also charged with complicity or rather with knowledge for months without objection of the intention of the state of mississippi to present this portrait engraving for use on the united states battle ship of the same name i doubt this statement it may be true but i call for specific proof or in default that an apology be made to the loyal sentiment of the country if true the american people are entitled to know the fact i do not believe in perpetuating the hatreds of the war north or south time has softened its asperities and smoothed out its wrinkles no one today objects to the southland honoring its heroes at home in its own way southern statesmen can truthfully boast that they decorate their homes with confederate flags and the pictures of davis lee and jackson without offense to northern visitors of highest distinction and without injury to their political standing no official certainly in the north thinks of encroaching upon individual rights in all the history of civil wars the world over there is not a parallel to the leniency high consideration in fact shown by the general government toward those who less than a half century ago were striking at the life of this great nation as a contrast i noticed on a recent visit to the old confederate capitol at richmond that the captured confederate flags which instead of having been destroyed as they properly might have been at the close of the war were kept and eventually returned to the several states and those of virginia are now displayed in glass cases in the most conspicuous corridor of the capitol building object lessons again teaching the rising generation to revere the false doctrines of the lost cause the same conditions doubtless exist at other southern capitals it was this false educational use of such flags foreseen twentyodd years ago by governor foraker of ohio which called forth his fiery but notable response when asked to join in the sentimental movement for their return that no such flags would be returned from his state while he was governor and subsequent events have vindicated his wisdom and forethought indulgence and sympathy for the south have marked every national administration from lincoln to taft generously have they accorded to the south every right willingly have southern statesmen been called into the councils of the nation at times seemingly to the disparagement of those who stood by the general government when loyalty meant something in this country the internal policy of the southland has been sacredly regarded even though shocked to the point of resistance by the recent erection of a monument on the horrible dead line at andersonville to maj henry wirz a foreignborn confederate adjudged responsible for the admitted atrocities there enacted during the war the rising tide of public indignation at the national capital and in the northern states has been restrained no action has been taken against such desecration no dynamite has been applied no congressional resolution has been introduced there has been marvelous toleration not interference or restraint for all southern ideals and tastes even recently since the close of the extra session there has been placed in statuary hall of this capitol a confederate memorial which is a distinct shock to many loyal hearts throughout the country but inasmuch as it is supposed to be lawful under an old statute of permission to the several states it will doubtless be tolerated until the law can be repealed as it should be and all state memorials be sent back to the respective states where they belong but with due deference to the south and to all southern sympathizers i protest that the limit has been reached in the proposed action of the state of mississippi claimed as a right but without any law therefor to decorate one of our national battle ships with objectionable emblems trophies so called of the confederacy object lessons if you pleasecalculated to inspire in young officers want of respect for the high ideals and history of the government simply because such battle ship happens to bear the same name as the adopted state of jefferson davis as well demand on behalf of the state that old glory be hauled down and the stars and bars be run up to the masthead it is the same spirit which seeks further notwithstanding mr daviss boasted refusal of american citizenship to place an honorary memorial to his memory in statuary hall of the national capitol a place supposed to be reserved for the most honored citizenship of the republic shades of lincoln seward sumner chase grant and their illustrious compeers what next what next some things like the war itself were supposed to have been settled at appomattox they were subsequently embodied in constitutional amendments of which all rightthinking americans are today jealous and watchful they are as sacred as our form of government they constitute the fundamental truths for which free men have contended in all ages they lie at the very foundation of republican government any attack upon them is an attack upon free institutions human slavery although shot to death by union guns was not effectually destroyed until the adoption of the thirteenth amendment to the constitution of the united states citizenship and the equal protection of all citizens under the law came only with the adoption of the fourteenth amendment now sought to be nullified by a resolution offered at the extra session and still pending in the senate its guaranties are universal individual independence is secured by it in all matters of private concern no citizen under it can be questioned for individual conscience individual action lawful in itself can not be restrained racial lines it is true in matters of public right are obliterated but in private life in individual association and choice the individual is and always must remain so to speak the architect of his own fortune no man not even the president can be questioned or called to account officially because of his friends his associations or those with whom he may wish to break bread political equality does not mean social opportunity the fourteenth amendment also wisely forbids payment of the confederate debt and claims for emancipated slaves its repeal therefore as proposed would make such payments possible by a simple act of congress are we ready for this the fifteenth amendment guaranteeing equal suffrage to all citizens was a culmination only of political rights it also should be enforced in spirit and in letter the resolution to repeal it offered july 9 and still pending in this house must be regarded as revolutionary it should be defeated i protest therefore in the name of constitutional government in the name of a just people against all modern attempts to nullify these great settlements of the war period and especially against the open efforts now being made in certain quarters to teach false doctrines and false ideals to the rising generation by such object lessons as the ostentatious display of confederate memorials in the hall of fame at the national capitol or by the decoration of our united states war vessels with the emblems of a defeated and defunct confederacy let the pact of grant and lee at appomattox be kept inviolate in spirit and in fact it is the only safety of our redeemed republic anything else means the complete domination of the general government either by the north and northern ideas or by the south and southern ideas possibly by both at different times but the changes always attended by bitter political animosity and strife such as led to the fiery outbreak of 1861 americans all let us as patriots faithfully observe every duty of good citizenship and avoid all such acts and displays as tend to weaken the harmony and peace of the sections let us honor but one flag on all occasions and that the starry flag of our great republic destined as it is under providence to lead the world upward to a higher purer nobler

the department these particular employees were authorized according to my recollection at the urgent request of the department because it was desired to have a force of men that were specially equipped and who might go at the direction of the third assistant postmaster general to instruct other employees in their work they were to be special instructors to aid the men employed in the various offices in the better performance of their work eind it was believed that the ordinary postoffice inspector considering the manner in which he is looked upon by the average postoffice employee

beyond the time fixed by the rule for the hour of daily meeting the new legislative day would never have a chance to start its operation in starting would be cut off by the action of the house just the same as it would have been cut off if we had taken a recess until 10 oclock today there is no question about that if we had recessed until 10 oclock today and had gone on with our business until 12 oclock surely the new legislative day of saturday would have been set aside why because the house by its action had ordered it to be set aside there can not be any question about that or any reason to controvert it and by the same reasoning if the house by a majority vote expresses the desire not to have a legislative day begin on saturday it has a perfect right to do that by taking a recess and keeping the house intact because the house has not adjourned a recess does not adjourn the house the flag flies on the top of this capitol during the continuance of the recess from the beginning of the sessions of this house under the constitution the mace has reposed on its pedestal during each session until adjournment as it now reposes there recognizing and symbolizing the fact that the house

without using a great deal of time the exact situation and let us see upon whose initiative this matter has taken place some two years ago a billwas introduced in the senate providing for the construction of this siding from the pennsylania railroad on the eastern branch down what is called water street i believe and on to the navyyard and there was an appropriation in the senate bill of 25 000 to the pennsylvania railroad or to this other railroadi do not remember what it is calledthe baltimore potomac and washington i thinkas an aid to acquire a right of way where there was any to acquire it came over to the house and was referred to the committee on the district of columbia of which i had the honor then to be a lnember it had already passed the senate if there was any protest ever made from parties representing the railroad company i never heard of it it came here and the distinguished gentleman from pennsylvania the gentleman from michigan the chairman of the committee myself and others went down there to examine the location of the proposed road and we took with us an engineer of the district we had with us one of the engineers of the pennsylvania railroad company we had with us two of the attorneys of the pennsylvania railroad company which was all right showing us where the road would run discussing the matter with us which was exactly right i never heard the slightest objection to that senate bill being passed by this house but that bill did not provide that any other railroad company building its tracks to a connection with this new track should have the right to operate upon such terms as the road building the line and the other road seeking that connection should agree and if they failed to agree that the question be referred to the supreme court of the district of columbia we never got that bill reported because for one i advocated putting an anendilent on it requiring that any other railroad building its tracks to a connection with this new track should have the same right to operate upon it as this baltimore potomac and washington railroad upon such terms as the two companies might agree or if they failed to agree upon such terms as the court might decide to whom it should be submitted then i further insisted that we strike out the 25 000 appropriation there was no need to give them that 25 000 what are the further facts in connection with this railroad company by the grace of congress it occupied the mall down here for nearly forty years and had a large station upon it and never paid the government one cent as rent that is not all it never even paid taxes upon the property located there as i am informed it has occupied canal and k streets with this very branch to the navyyard ever since it was constructed it is not a simple question of grade crossings it is taking the tracks out of the middle of a street they are in the middle of a street now running right down through the center of the street the gentleman from pennsylvania talks about the kind of improvements there are down there does this house expect a portion of a city to improve and grow up with a railroad running right down the middle of the street would you buy property there to live on or to occupy not one bit of it finally when a bill was reported to the house similar to the bill which has just been reported i had the honor and pleasure of moving in this house to substitute a bill requiring the same company to build its tracks leaving out the 25 000 appropriation and adding to it the provision requiring them to let any other company use the tracks upon such terms as might be agreed on or upon such terms as might be adjudged by the supreme court of the district of columbia now so far as the terms of that bill are concerned they received the approval and acquiescence of the railroad people and of the commissioners of the district of columbia because it is the exact language that was used in the senate bill word for word with the exception of the amendments which i have just stated what was done the bill passed this house and passed the senate it was approved by the president of the united states may 27 1908 it will soon
