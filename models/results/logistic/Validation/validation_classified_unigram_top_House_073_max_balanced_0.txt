club lancaster ohio on march 6 1934 no scheme has yet been devised whereby legislative forms of government can survive other than by the twoparty system three or more parties mean that no party is in the majority and can take the responsibility in such a situation in order to obtain a majority minority blocs and factions always committed to some selfish interests form a coalition based upon each minority faction entering the coalition supporting the selfish interests of other minority factions in the end legislation is enacted which is not for the general welfare and never had the support of an honest majority this means intolerable government the result is that parliamentary government breaks down under the bloc system this accounts for the failure of legislative government in continental european countries oneparty government always leads to dictatorship because there is no agency at hand to restrain the majority from practicing all kinds of excessive encroachments upon the liberties of the people in twoparty government one party must be the majority party to bear the responsibility of government the other party must be the minority party to point out the mistakes and errors of the majority party in the twoparty system the minority party has an indispensable function to perform at the present time the democratic party is in the majority it is its responsibflity to take the leadership and carry out a governmental program the republican party is the minority party it is its function and responsibility to criticize constructively and to point out to the public the mistakes which the democratic majority is making it is inevitable that this democratic majority the same as any other majority party will make mistakes this administration and this democratic majority in congress comprise a human institution and mistakes are inevitable they will be made world without end since the civil war the republican party has been the majority party during the greater part of the time and the democratic party has been the minority party during this long experience as a minority party the democratic party has developed into the worlds best minority party because it became a criticizer par excellence it very largely forgot how to meet responsibility as a legislative party in control of congress it is now a matter of history that the democratic party has been unable to function in a constitutional manner in control of legislation with a democratic president and with a democratic congress virtual dictatorship on the part of the president is inescapable in the light of this record the people of this country must be content with practically a dictatorship rather than traditional legislative government when we have a democratic president and a democratic congress this would seem to be a partisan statement on my part if it were not for the fact that the record substantiates this statement grover cleveland was the first democratic president after the civil war he could not depend upon his democratic congress and had immeasurable trouble with it woodrow wilson was the second democratic president even in the most farreaching legislation of his two terms as president he could not depend upon his democratic congress the speaker champ clark opposed the draft senator stone chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the senate opposed the wilson war program in the house of representatives claude kitchin chairman of the ways and means committee likewise opposed the draft hubert dent chairman of the military affairs committee in the house refused to introduce the draft bill this bill was introduced and carried through the house of representatives under the leadership of julius kahn the ranking republican member on that committee when it came to meeting the legislative responsibilities mr wilson had to depend upon the republican leadership to carry out his war program in order for mr wilson to have a semblance of order in government he had to go to the extreme of disciplining democratic members of congress by going into senatorial and congressional primaries and opposing their renomination franklin d roosevelt the third democratic president since the civil war has found that he cannot depend upon a democratic congress to meet the responsibility of legislating in the usual manner the result is he has been demanding and receiving of his congress legislation which does not legislate on a particular subject but merely transfers the constitutional responsibility of congress to legislate to the president to carry out his program by executive orders the constitution provides that appropriations shall be made by the lower house of congress the reason for this provision in the constitution was that the peoples money should not be expended except under the guiding hand of their chosen representatives at present for all intents and purposes this provision of the constitution is destroyed lumpsum appropriations are being made in the amount requested by the president and the president is expending the money as he sees fit the function which congress is performing in this respect is a mere formality so far as actual results are concerned the president might as well make his own appropriations the congress is abrogating its responsibilities it is conferring upon the executive step by step the full control and power of government it is doing piecemeal what the german reichstag recently did in one fell swoop for the moment this may meet with the approval of the people yet the fact remains their liberties are being transferred to the executive the great struggle for american independence was to take the power of government from the executive and place it in the hands of the chosen representatives of the people the purpose of this was to establish and to preserve the rights and liberties of the people as a whole since the 4th of marcl 1933 we have day by day given over to the executive that which our forefathers gained at the price of blood and treasure when legislation is enacted invariably gag rules are passed in the house of representatives so that the legislation cannot be amended when it is being considered on the floor of the house these gag rules are not employed in order to keep a hostile republican minority from wrecking administration legislation 114 republican congressmen cannot outvote 315 democratic congressmen the only purpose in the world for these gag rules is to keep a democratic congress from wrecking the legislation of its own administration the only possible excuse for this conduct can be attributed to the fact that a democratic congress will not meet its responsibility of standing up and enacting legislation there is equally as much responsibility as there is privilege in being a majority party and having control of government no constructive legislation can be enacted which does not step on someones toes and bring criticism upon those who enact it electionconscious legislators shrink from this responsibility whatever may be said for the new deal this much is certain we are not getting it for nothing one of the prices which we are paying is that the pages of history are being turned back over 150 years and the peoples liberties are being daily transferred from their chosen representatives to the executive department of the government practically every piece of legislation which is a part of the new deal has carried with it a repudiation of some section of the constitution the proposed granting of powers to the presideht to make foreigntrade agreements by changing tariff provisions changes two sections of the constitution first tariff legislation is a revenue measure and under the constitution should originate in the house of representatives from magna carta until now the very cornerstone of free government has been that the revenues which shall be collected from the people shall be prescribed by the representatives whom they elect at frequent intervals it is in this manner that the people have something to say about how much of their money shall be spent and for what it shall be spent the most unbearable tyranny that mankind has suffered has been found in an executive collecting such tribute from the people as he deems advisable the second section of the constitution which is being overridden by this provision is that treaties or agreements with foreign countries shall not become effective until they have been ratified by a twothirds vote in the united states senate yet the legislation which is now being considered places in the hands of the president power to make these foreigntrade agreements which are treaties without their being ratified or considered by the senate the executive making treaties and arrangements with foreign countries without any approval of the representatives chosen by the people is another intolerable tyranny which the writers of the constitution intended to make impossible in the united states it is true that the public cannot suffer from the executives collecting revenues and making treaties with foreign powers unless he abuses that power let us assume that mr roosevelt will not abuse that power the people of this country may be willing to reelect him time after time yet the fact remains that he will not live forever and cannot always be the president of the united states much of this legislation transferring congressional responsibilities to the executive is in the form of permanent legislation which confers that authority upon the president for all time when we talk about repealing it at some future date we must remember that it cannot be repealed without the consent of the president except that such repeal should pass over his veto that would require a twothirds vote in each house so under the present arrangement this congress is day after day delegating its constitutional powers which means delegating the peoples constitutional liberties by a majority vote while these powers and liberties can only be regained at some future date by a twothirds vote this should not be done unless we are ready to concede that the time has come when constitutional government is wholly impractical in the united states let us discuss what has been done by the roosevelt administration since it has come into power in the first place it would be far more partisan than wise or truthful to charge mr roosevelt with all the economic and social ills from which the people of the united states are now suffering in common with the rest of the people of the world we are in the midst of a worldwide depression we do not serve ourselves and our country if we do not recognize this fact but on the contrary merely heap abuse upon the man who may be president at this time i choose to be more charitable with mr roosevelt a democratic president than the democrats were with mr hoover a republican president mr hoover was president when this depression came on to the world the democrats grasped the depression as a golden opportunity to destroy confidence in mr hoover and bring about a democratic political victory in that they made a mistake i doubt very much if the democrats today or of the future will be particularly proud of the record which the democratic party made during the hoover administration when the entire world was in the grip of the greatest depression of modern history surely now everyone will concede that mr hoover did not have the power to meet the depression and that the democratic congress under mr garner would not give him the power when mr hoover went out of office on the 4th of march and mr roosevelt came into office mr roosevelt then and there received every power which mr hoover had with which to meet the emergency mr roosevelt did not turn his hand to meet the depression or the emergency until he first asked and received from congress unheardof powers it is now clear that mr roosevelt is not meeting the depression with the same tools that were in the hands of mr hoover a republican president the principal accomplishments of the roosevelt administration to date have grown out of an unparalleled expenditure of public money we must not lose sight of the fact that there is far more humanitarianism involved in these accomplishments than social and economic recovery the cost of the first year is about ten and one half billion dollars our total government income is about 3 500 000 000 the deficit is about 7 000 000 000 these accomplishments will not be paid for unless and until our children pay for them until they are paid it is yet a debatable question whether or not in the long run the people have been saved from distress and that there is not greater distress ahead there can be no permanent recovery until the government is able to balance its expenses and revenue no government can long survive which is not a solvent government it cannot safely be said that any government is a solvent government which for 5 years has spent more than twice the amount it has taken in and offers no reasonable promise of balancing its expenses and revenue in the future the two outstanding efforts of the administration for recovery are to be found in the n r a and the a a a neither one of which has yet proved its established and permanent merit they have accomplished some good purposes but they have brought forth so many new evils and complications that it is yet a most debatable question whether in the end they are going to bring about economic recovery or greater economic despair the way that they are now being administered if there is any hope for their permanent success it would seem that we would have to pay the price of giving up many of our liberties under the constitution up to date the n r a is playing into the hands of monopoly and giving advantage to the large institutions all to the detriment of the smaller institutions the a a a is monopolizing agriculture it is giving benefits to the large producers while it is collecting processors taxes from the products of the smaller producers largely to furnish bonuses for the producers of agricultural products which producers are largely responsible for bringing about our present condition of an oversupply of farm products for instance the wheat allotments based upon the last 3 years production give a monopoly on wheat to those who have been constantly increasing their acreage this is largely at the expense of the smaller producers who during the last 3 years have been decreasing their acreage the corn hog and dairy programs have shown the same situation to exist allotments based upon the last few years of production give advantage to those who have been increasing their production during that time and discriminates against those who have been reducing their production during the same time the allotment plan fails to give fair consideration to the young man who wants to enter into the business of agriculture and who has no past production upon which to base an allotment it likewise raises an economic and discriminating bar before the man who is returning from the ranks of industrial unemployment to the farm where he hopes to make a living at that most ancient and most honorable of occupations this program is leading to complete governmental control and domination of the land were i alone in making this statement i should be subject to the criticism that my statement was based upon partisanship however rexford g tugwell the assistant secretary of agriculture and the dominating personality in the agricultural program has openly declared what is the purpose of the governments program in a recent speech in philadelphia pa he said we are now engaged in a drastic program of controlling agriculture products for the emergency this in itself means that we are trying to control the entire utilization of all agricultural land private control has failed to use wisely its control of land for the first time the government is thinking of the land as a whole for the first time we are preparing to build a land program which will control the use of that greatest of all natural resources not merely for the benefit of those who happen to hold title to it but for the greater welfare of all the citizens of the country this program is not in keeping with the free independent american program we have known it is more in keeping with the philosophy of stalin and marx communistic russia has prepared a land program not for the benefit of those who happen to hold title to the land but for what the soviet thinks is for the greater welfare of all the citizens of russia the star of bethlehem pointed to the birthplace of a savior and to a better day for mankind there is no star of russia which points to a better day for the american farmer the people of the united states must make the choice of whether or not they want to make this change whatever may be said of the roosevelt administration to date it has not given us something for nothing for the relief measures which it has given to us we are paying the price of having gone in debt an additional 58 for each man woman and child for the recovery measures which it has put into effect we must pay the price of giving up liberties and rights which were obtained in the first instance at an awful price and which for generation after generation we have cherished dearly my judgment is that we are moving too rapidly into this new world it seems to me that it would be wise in the coming election to elect at least enough republican congressmen to check this headlong plunge into a new experiment i do not suggest the election of a republican congress for the purpose of tying the hands of president roosevelt if the people should elect a republican house of representatives in the next election and if the republicans would use that majority to deny to mr roosevelt any opportunity of a reasonable constitutional leadership then they would not be serving their party or their country but a republican majority in congress which would cooperate with the president on constitutional ground will in my judgment be a blessing to the american people at least a sufficient increase in the republican membership of congress for the minority to be able to make itself felt would be a most stabilizing influence at a time when we are moving too rapidly into new and uncharted seas"], [0.07869261503219604, 0.921307384967804, 1, "i move the previous question on the bill and

rates for them on every article of commerce that is shipped in interstate commerce they have been the means of pauperizing the railroads if you will take off the orders by which the railroads are tied today with the restrictions put upon them whereby they cannot reduce their rates then the railroads will come out without trouble they are now penalized if they undertake to reduce the rate fixed by this interstate commerce commission anywhere in the united states and that is what is the matter this commission is running around and investigating the disobedience of some little order of the commission i have introduced a bill in this congressand have introduced it beforeto provide that the interstate commerce commission shall fix only the highest rates that could be charged by the railroads and express companies for carrying freight and thus leave the railroads open for competition with each other so that they could make some of these reductions in freight rates the gentleman from florida a moment ago stated the freight rates with respect to fruit in his state and i can point back to the day when this same commission destroyed one of the most profitable businesses in my state we were shipping thousands of crates of cantaloupes carloads of them throughout the entire united states as soon as the interstate commerce commission got to the point where it could fix a rate

affection such as i have held for few men in my lifetime it is a little hard for me to define it but there are those here who will understand it for many of my colleagues i know felt for tom coffin the same affectionate regard that i did of him it may truthfully be said that to know him was to love him and that those who knew him best loved him best the first time i really came to know tom coffin was shortly after the session began we had had a long discussion on politics and on that subject then as afterwards we usually disagreed this however made no difference for like all of his other friends i had a very profound respect not only for his opinions and his convictions but for the sincere and courageous manner in which he advocated them at the end of this discussion i remember he said your first name is jim isnt it i said yes he said my name is tom and so our friendship which i shall always remember as one of the finest things in my life began and so it continued up until a little while ago when death came unexpected swift and sudden and took my friend away i pay tom coffin the highest tribute i can pay to any man when i say that he was thoroughly goodgood in the highest and best sense there was no meanness in him there was nothing of littleness nothing of selfishness his greatest ambitions was to be of service to those who needed him and to do good was a part of his religion it is hard for us to understand why a man like this just on the threshold of a fine careerand those of us who knew him best were convinced that he had begun here a career not only of great usefulness but of great distinctionit is hard for us to understand why in the very flower of his manhood when he was needed most of all he should be stricken down but none of us may attempt to draw aside the veil nor seek to solve the riddle of eternity it may be that it was intended from the beginning that tom coffins work should end here and if that is so i think there is some satisfaction in knowing that even before he came to us his public life was such that he could have been called at any time during the past 5 years and still he would have left behind him a splendid and a victorious career when my time shall come when i shall go down to the river of death and its chill waters shall dampen my feet may i express the hope that friends will be able to say of me as i now say of tom coffin he has fought the good fight he has finished his work the world is better for his having lived in it"], [0.00024262070655822754, 0.4997573792934418, 0, "if i had my own way about it the investigation of dr wirt would not have been called by congress when the letter of dr wirt was read before the committee on interstate and foreign commerce of which i am a member i tried to stop it from going into the record it has been intimated here today that the republicans insisted on calling this investigation i deny that the resolution for the investigation was introduced by a prominent democratic member of the interstate and foreign commerce committee and i am getting sick and tired of trying to mix this matter into partisan politics every day on the floor of the house when we should be devoting ourselves to things more worth while and working for those principles which we believe will be for the best interest of our country instead of playing politics for more than 3 years

involving 45 945 and the distressing thing is this the expense of that one office at peoria thus far has been 37 000 and the total of loans issued in that office has amounted to only 45 945almost as much expense for fees as the total amount of the loans closed if anybody here wants the record i have it here as it came in the mail this morning from the h o l c office in washington i am glad to see that ohio which has 1 000 000 less population than illinois got 71 000 000 and that indiana that has less than half the population of illinois got 16 000 000 whereas in illinois we got only 4 000 000 this frightful disparity is due to political rottenness which can only be changed when they put this thing on a merit and efficiency business and take these spollsmen out who are supposed to be working in the interest of the despairing home owners of my state it is positively nauseating to think that in ohio indiana and elsewhere they are making loans at a cost of from 13 to 15 per loan while in illinois the report shows that in february the cost was 456 per loan that should be as a stench in the nostrils of the citizens and taxpayers in the branch office at peoria they had 15 employees on the last day of february and 20 on the last day of march of this year and only 16 loans actually closed where is the fault what is the trouble in the face of such a record of inefficiency and such a sacrifice of the interests of the humble home owners of illinois this thing merits an immediate and sweeping investigation the norris amendment for which we are contending today seeks only to eliminate such a rotten condition as this by requiring merit and efficiency in the personnel who are to administer an act that has been hailed as a boon to distressed home owners i am not
