{"top_correct": [[0.07289397716522217, 0.9271060228347778, 1, "if the effect of the passage of the bill before the committee was simply to reduce the interest account of the government on the debt redeemable in 1880 and 1 881 from 5 and 6 per cent to 3j per cent i doubt whether any opposition would be made to it from any quarter to diminish the burden of interest and necessarily of taxation to discharge that interest is a consummation devoutly to be wished but i greatly misconceive the scope of the provisions of this bill if it is not far more sweeping in its effects if not in its objects i fail to comprehend its ultimate ends if it does not involve far more than the present saving of a few millions of dollars in the way of interest it has a far wider and broader range true it saves to the people twelve and a half millions in the difference of interest but it postpones the possibility of paying the rrincipal from twenty to forty years and fastens the burden of a argely accumulated sum of interest together with the principal upon this and succeeding generations it seems to me sir that this bill accomplishes results foreign to the debtpaying policy of our fathom and hostile to the spirit of our institutions that it looks to making the public debt a fixed and permanent institution that it practically repeals the act creating the fund to sink that debt that in advance of the expiration of the charters of the national banks it aims to give them a perpetual lease of life and saddles upon the producers of grain and tobacco as a perpetual heritage the odious internalrevenue ystem with its regiments of collectors inspectors gaugers informers and detectives such being the ends to be accomplished by this bill it will encounter my active and persistent opposition before i proceed to the discussion of this most important measure i beg to inquire of the committee on ways and means why such hot haste has been exhibited to press it to a passage why should so much anxiety be manifested to place five hundred millions of the national debt beyond our control and beyond the reach of payment so long before the debt is redeemable by the government why should refunding a debt the greater part of which has been twice refunded heretofore take such prominent precedence over all other measures within the jurisdiction of the leading financial committee of the house what valid reason can bo urged why this proposition should be pressed upon the attention of congress to the exclusion of all attemptsto reform the most oppressive unjust and prohibitory tariffthat ever disgraced the statutebook of a civilized and commercial people the debt proposed to be refunded and put beyond the possibility of payment during the lifetime of the present generation with the exception of sixteen or eighteen millions is not even due and payable until after the adjournment of the next session of this congress except at the option of the united states it depends upon the action of congress whether we pay it then refund it or continue to pay the same interest upon it we have been paying the credit of the government cannot be affected injuriously if we neither pay it when it is redeemable nor refund it provided we pay the interest as it falls due in the interim between now and the 1st of next december we shall have an opportunity to consult the taxpayers and producers from the earnings of whose labor this debt must be extracted as well as the comparatively insignificant class of capitalists bankers brokers and stockjobbers who have heretofore moulded and fashioned our financial legislation and who contribute so little comparatively to the discharge of the public burdens a postponement of the action of congress on this bill until the next session will furnish us with a knowledge of the wishes of the people as to whether they will prepare to pay this debt within the ensuing decade or transmit to their children and their childrens children that choicest of blessings a perpetual national debt in a ddition to this information so needful to direct our action on so mome tous a question we shall know with some degree of accuracy what i ortion of it can be paid by the increasing revenues of the treasury iv hat contributions will be made in the mean time from the surplus r venues to the sinking fund and what is still more needful it will be demonstrated whether the unexpected and unexampled tide of prospei ity that has set in upon this country within the last nine months is a permanent reality or a temporary and evanescent delusion in no probable contingency that can arise can the credit of the government be injured or its financial resources be diminished to any appreciable extent by delaying action upon this refunding scheme until the next session of this congress but we shall then be in a position to act more intelligently and more in accord with the demands of those who have a right to exact obedience to their will from their representatives i trust there will be a free and full discussion of the provisions of this bill at this session and that final action on it will be postponed until next december on this point i trust i shall be pardoned for suggesting to the committee on ways and means and its honorable chairman that this house ought not to be asked to refund a dollar more of this debt matnring dnring the current and succeeding fiscal year that we are unable to pay after applying all available resources to its extinction by the treasury statement of april ultimo this debt amounted to 742 850 000 having been reduced 39 121 000 since the 1st of jannary with our present increasing revenues it is not unlikely that the secretary will be able to apply not less than six millions per month until the 1st december to the extinction of the debt which would leave that proposed to be refunded at the sum of 700 000 000 if in addition to this reduction the committee will report to this house a bill i had the honor to introduce in december last and referred to that committee to amend the resumption get and for other purposes h r no 2664 fixing the amount of the fund to be hold for resumption purposes and directing any surplus of coin above the sum so designated to be applied to the purchase of the 5 and 6 per cent bonds i doubt not that it would receive most favorable consideration such legislation is recommended by the secretary of the treasury in his last annual report and i am gratified to find that the honorable gentleman from new york has expressed himself in favor of this application of a portion of the idle and useless hoards of coin in the vaults of the treasury out of superabundant caution the redemption fund is fixed by the bill referred to at one hundred millions which would leave a surplus of coin of about 50 000 000 to be applied to the purchase of outstanding boods twentyfive per cent is the rate fixed by law to be held as a reserve on the circulation of the national gold banks on the pacific coast and this proportion is more than ample to provide for the redemption of the outstanding greenbacks subject to redemption under any probable contingency of the future especially is this percentage sufficient when under the construction of the resumption act by the secretary of the treasury he has authority to sell any of the bonds authorized by the refunding act of 1570 to replenish his stock of coin in order to maintain resumption it is a matter of grave doubt whether the legaltenders that can be presented for redemption exceed three hundred and fifteen or three hundred and twenty million nor is there any reason that there should be hold in the treasury vaults a percentage for redemption equal to that which has usually been required of banks of issue a run upon the treasury for redemption of the treasury note will never occur except in a very unfavorable condition of our foreign exchanges and this the head of the treasury nuder his construction of existing law has the power to prevent or at least in a great degree control the confidence of the people in these obligations of the government their sense of their security and their superior convenience forbid that the holders of them should ever demand their redemption for the sake of hoarding the coin or from apprehension of depreciation as long as their issue is reasonably restricted in amount in any aspect in which the lprge coin reserves held by the treasury are viewed it is a matter of surprise that the secretary does not on his own responsibility utilize a large portion in the purchase of the bonds soon to mature if he is waiting upon the action of congress he should wait no longer and the legislation he has recommended can not be enacted too promptly what is the financial problem we are called upon to solve i have before stated that the debt maturing this year and the next aggregated on the 1st day of may 742 850 000 as follows amount rate of interest payablo december 31 1880 6 00 6 per cent payablo july 1 1881 753 950 00 6 per cent redeemable dune 30 188l 166 388 q20 00 6 per cent redeemable juno 30 1881 66 106 150 0 6 per cont redeemable may 1 181 492 89 0o 00 5 per cent total 742 850 600 0 if the revenues continue to increase for the remainder of the calendar year as they have during the months of january to may and the appropriations are made in the same spirit of economy as has characterized the last few years and if the surplus of coin now lying idle and useless in the treasury over and above a just and safe fund for the redemption of the legaltenders be applied to the extinction of this debt it is safe to estimate the aggregate debt will be reduced by the sum of one hundred millions by the 1st of december making it at that date not exceeding 650 000 000 of which it may be estimated that twothirds will bo five percents and the remainder will bear 6 per cent interest no part of this aggregate being then payable except at the option of the united states the distinguished gentleman who has charge of this bill seems to assume that we have no alternative than to borrow the money by the issue of bonds bearing a lower rate of interest to pay this debt he seems to think it can be reduced to seven hundred millions and he provides for the issue of two hundred millions in short bonds redeemable in two years and payable in ten and other bonds for five hundred millions running for forty years and redeemable at the pleasure of the united states after twenty years and both classes of bonds bearing j per cent interest payable quarterly according to this programme the payment of the two hundred millions of short bonds or notes will be spread over ten years and twenty millions of principal per annum is the sum total we shall be called upon to contribute to the sinking fund from 1881 to 1891 wholly ignoring the fact that more than that amount of bonds has been purchased for that fund within two and onehalf monthssince the 1st of january last in his remarks made to the committee on this bill he does not attempt to discuss the question of payment except to this extent and seems to regard it as not within the range of possibility that we can pay any larger slim than two hundred millions in ten years and in fact ho thinks we ought not to pay any more if we could to borrow more money at aless rate of interest is the only solution of our financial problem that this bill presents to us he says he does not believe that this generation can or should be made to liquidate the total public debt past legislation has already thrown the burden of paying more than onefourth seven hundred and forty millions of the original debt upon the generations of the next century which with simple interest for thirty years will amount to within less than two hundred millions of the whole present interestbearing debt of the government no one proposes that this generation shall pay the whole public debt we cannot pay it if we would except at enormous cost to the people in premiums to the holders of it already refunded aggregatingnear a thousand millions but i believe we can pay and we ought to pay the whole of the debt now proposed to be refunded within the nextten years at which time we shall have the right to redeem the twohundredandfiftymillionof fourandahalf percents will my distinguished friend assert that we have not the means and abilityto contribute as much to the discharge of the debt as we had twelve years ago immediately after the ravages and exhaustion of a devastating war is he forgetful of the fact that from 1869to 1873 inclusive we paid in interest 476 920 590 and 327 309 811 in the reduction of the principal of the public debt making an aggregate of 804 230 401 in four years i in the ten years from 1870 to 1879 inclusive we paid in interest the sum of 1 092 330 558 and in principal 436 356 968 06 total principal and interest 1 528 687 526 54 muchthe larger portion of this period being a time of exceptional pecuniary distress and general business depression with resources vastly augmented with productive wealth of every form and description duplicated with an addition to our population of not far from ten millions since 1870 and with a reasonable prospect of having entered upon an era of unparalleled prosperity in all departments of business enterprise ought we to hesitate to pay these six hundred and fifty or seven hundred millions within the ten years preceding the time of redemption of the fourandahalf percents are we sotarren of financial expedients and so destitute of resources that we cannot with the largo reduction of our interest account and the increase of our revenues invent some plan by which we can liquidate this debt other than by the issue of bonds for the special accommodation of retired capitalists stockjobbers and national bankers american statesmanship and especially democratic statesmanship has some other mission than to torture its ingenuity to invent an unnecessary financial system that will alone be acceptable to the owners of idle capital the drones in the hive of industry or the vast army of taxconsumers i beg to ask the attention of the house to some additional facts and figures in order to convince the most skeptical that there is absolutely no reason much less necessity for refunding this six hundred and fifty or seven hundred millions of indebtedness or any part of it in long bonds precluding us from payment of any portion of the principal for twenty years but that by spreading its liquidation over the period intervening between 1881 when these bonds are redeemable and 1891 when the fourandahalf percents become redeemable every dollar of this seven hundred millions may be satisfied without any necessary increase of taxation or detriment to any public interest and if 1 can demonstrate that this can be done and that the amount of principal and interest which would be required to be paid annually will not exceed she interest charge we have paid during several years since 1868 there can be no excuse or justification for the passage of the biu before the committee unless we are here simply to register the demands of stockjobbers and the owners of idle capital and to disregard the interests of the taxpayers and the producers of our wealth during the four years succeeding july 1869 our average annual interest payments were 119 213 147 and were as follows 1870 129 235 498 1871 123 576 565 1872 117 357 839 1873 104 750 688 1874 107 109 815 1875 103 03 544 1876 100 243 271 1877 97 124 571 1878 102 100 s74 in 1831 it is estimated by the secretary of the treasury at 88 877 410 but this estimate was based upon the opinion that there would beno material increase in the revenues of the department and consequent inability to increase our payments on the public debt treasury report page 7 but that the increase in the fall of 1879 was abnormal and would not continue nor is there any deduction for any purchase of bonds by the surplus coinredemption fund to which i have referred the secretary did not believe that he would be able to reduce the debt as he has done at the rate of near forty millions since the 1st of january allowance being made for these deductions in the principal of the debt one to be effected by increased revenues and the other by enforcing the recommendation of the secretary as to the coin in the treasury held for resumption purposes the interest charge for 1831 will approximate the following figures namely interest on 2150 000 000 at 4l per cent 11 150 000 interest on 740000 000 at 4 per cent 29 640 000 interest on 8200 800 oo0 at 6 per cent 12 080 000 interest on 00 000 000 at 5 per cent 25 000 000 annual interest on 1 690 000 000 77 0 000 the secretary also estimates the receipts for the fiscal year 1880 at two hundred and eightyeight millions and makes no allowance for any increase in 1881 when by the latest returns from the treasury see letter of secretary sherman of march 23 the customs dues and internal taxes for eight and onehalf months of this fiscal year have realized two bundrea and twelve millions and at the same rate of increase they will aggregate two hundred and ninetynine millions by the 1st of july and this sum added to the admitted receipts from all other sources will make the total revenue for 1881 three hundred and twenty millions with an average production this year it may be stated with almost absolute certainty that there will be no dim inution of reveneg during the next fiscal year ending june 30 there are causes in operationthat render this almost as certain as any event in thefutnre thelate unprecedented and rapid advancement in the price of almost all articles of consumption must continue unabated our monetary circulation has been greatly increased both by gold silver and paper the privilege extended to the national banks by law to issue their promises and investin them with the functions of money without limitation is giving this rise in prices additional impetus which in turn creates an increased andincreasing demand for more money higher prices and increased and increasing speculation will be the result and as prices of commodities advance here the duties on foreign merchandise are practically reduced foreign importations increase and the doors of the customhouse are thrown open to the foreign manufacturer notwithstanding the prohibitory character of our tariff this country has passed through similar periods of expansion in the past and great increase of customs duties has always accompanied papermoney expansion without considering other effects of an unrestricted paper circulation this one result is as inevitable as fate and is demonstrable both from reason and experience and we shall be blind to the interests of the people and the government if we fail to take advantage of this probable if not certain increase of revenues in extinguishing a good portion of the public debt the estimate of an annual interest charge of seventyeight millions is based upon the idea that we continue to pay 5 and 6 per cent on the seven hundred millions for ten years but this will not be necessary after the ensuing fiscal year while the payment of this debt principal and interest should be spread over the period from 1881 to 1891 resort should be had to the issue of treasury notes bearing an interest of 3 3j or 3 per cent interest and payable within ten years the latter rate of interest may be preferable as being more certain to be taken at par let it become the fixed purpose of congress not to go into any new refunding scheme for the sake of refunding and not to issue any more long bonds at any rate of interest and that it repudiates the doctrine held by no small number of the wealthy classes of this country that a public debt is a public blessing and the fourandahalf and four percents will advance to such a premium as will make room and create a demand for a bond of a lower rate of interest and with a shorter period to run and there will be no difficulty in floating these treasury notes at par there will be thus created by the action of congress a demand for such a security not only in the financial centers but in the sections where there is less accumulated capital insurance companies trustees executors and all classes of persons and corporations liable to sudden and immediate calls for money would become purchasers of them while depositors in banks and savingsbanks themselves and all persons seeking a safe and reliable investment for short periods would take them if placed within convenient reach the demand for the 4 per cent certificates justifies this conclusion notwithstanding the different condition of the country then from what it is now and probably will be in 1881 to whatever extent these treasury notes or certificates can be negotiated they will to that proportional extent reduce our annual interest account and assuming that the whole will be taken within a year that charge will be reduced approximately to sixty millions being onehalf less than it was in 1868 and 1869 and what is a consideration that should never be lost sight of these temporary certificates or treasury notes will be held almost exclusively by our own people and the interest be paid to them and not to foreigners a contribution of fifty millions annually to the discharge of the principal of this six hundred and fifby or seven hundred million debt for the ten years succeeding 1881 would discharge the whole debt before the time the fouranda half percents become redeemable if from any cause not now foreseen the whole debt should not be extinguished within the period indicated it will soon be apparent and we may well trust the ways and means to provide for its final extinction to the future action of congress a most important point will have been secured in the interest of the taxpayers of present and future generations and in favor of the distinctive debtpaying policy of our fathers when this congress shall have pronounced against any further refunding of the national debt and against making it a fixed and permanent institution of this grand and growing republic i shall publish as part of my remarks tables showing the net receipts of the treasury the net ordinary expenditures exclusive of interest and payments on the public debt the annual interest payments and the annual sinking of the principal of the public debt for each of the ten years from 1870 to 1879 inclusive from which it will appear thatthe annual average receipts for the ten years was 313 188 000 the net annual expenditure was 155 382 000 the average annual payment of principal of debt was 43 635 000 the average annual interest payment 109 233 000 annual average payments of principal and interest 152 868 000 conceding that there was a small reduction in the revenue receipts during the first ten years of the decade owing to a reduction in taxation can there be a reasonable doubt that these receipts for the ensuing ten years will average three hundred and thirteen millions per annum i do not doubt that without any change whatever in the present rates or subjects of taxation our annual receipts will exceed three hundred and twenty millions and i offer the statement of the receipts of this fiscal year heretofore referred to as confirmation of this opinion our interest account for 1881 need not exceed seventyeight millions and by 1891 may be reduced to sixty millions and by applying the difference between our then annual interest say seventyeight millions and the average of annual payments of principal and interest for the last ten years we shall have seventyfour millions to apply to the principal of the debt proposed to be refunded when in fact fifty millions applied to the principal each year will discharge the whole within less than ten years i desire it to be understood that i am discussing this question upon the assumption that there will be no material change in the present rates of taxation and on the hypothesis that the increasing production population and taxable resources of the country will even under the present rates of taxation and existing subjects of taxation enable us to discharge as much of the principal and interest of the public debt as we have under nearly similar rates of taxation in former years discharged of interest alone this is the mode i would adopt of solving our present financial problem and i submit to this committee whether we ought not to give it a trial at least before we place ourselves in the condition which i propose to show this bill must inevitably place us i also assume that the ordinary expenditures of the government will not be materially augmented by extravagant and unnecessary appropriations the whole country is in a far better condition to hear the exactions of the taxgatherer than at an any time since the close of the war and with our experience for the last six or eight years it is extremely difficult for us to conceive of the large increase of productive wealth and of population and consequent consumption and ability of the people to bear taxation that seems to await us in the not distant future but the proposition i have submitted involves no increased taxation it is based upon the belief that increased revenues arising from increased production and increased consumption will make it comparatively easy to discharge this debt within the terms of our contract for one i would not hesitate to increase taxation rather than give my consent to the passage of the bill before the committee or to any measure that looks toward sqtting aside the traditional policy of the american people even far less objectionable than the measure i am discussing a revision of the present vicious tariff that looked iore to revenue and less to protection and prohibition of all foreign competition would add largely to the revenues of the treasury and facilitate the payment of the debt proposed to be refunded by imposing a small tax on the sales of the millions of stocks bonds and moneyed securities that are disposed of day by day on the stock markets of the great cities of the union a large addition to the internal taxes might be made without detriment to any interest whatever such a measure passed this house in the fortythird congress by a twothirds majority and i have a bill of a similar character pending before the ways and means committee to make this immense interest contribute to the support of the government and the liquidation of its debt unlike the tax now indirectly levied on the productions of southern and western corn and tobacco it would create no overgrown monopolies interfere with no agricultural or manufacturing industry nor burden labor with annoying and irritating restriction whether such a tax be necessary or not to liquidate this debt of six hundred and fifty or seven hundred millions it ought to be imposed if for no other reason than that the tax now levied on the manufacture of fermented and alcoholic liquors might then be placed on their consumption instead of their production and thus rid the statutebook of many of its most tyrannical and despotic provisions as well as increase production develop our resources and add to the profits of the producers of grain and tobacco we have a law pledging the faith of the government to apply 1 per cent of the entire national debt to the purchase and cancellation of that debt every year it has not always been enforced according to its strict requirements owing to the overruling necessities of the government this sinking fund as it is called amounta for the next fiscal year to 39 828 225 as ascertained and reported by the head of the treasury in his last annual report it increases in amount each successive year and under the secretarys construction of his duties it cannot be executed unless there is a surplus of receipts over the yearly expenditures appropriated by law there is hardly room for doubt that this surplus will largely exceed the percentage required for the sinking fund during the next fiscal year and thereafter during the ensuing decade if the bill of the committeebe adopted may i asktbehonorable chairman how is the secretary to comply with the sinkingfund act especially during the period between 1881and 1891 in which last year we have the option to pay the 4j per cent debt of two hundred and fifty millions he can use a portion of his surplus in the purchase of the two hundred millions of short bonds provided for by the bill but they will be exhausted by the payment of twenty millions per annum for ten years but that fills but onehalf of the requirements of the sinkingfund act he will have twenty millions more for 18sf as the secretary tells us to invest in the bonds of the united statesnot allowing for any surplus revenues coming into the treasury over and above the requirements of the sinkingfund act what will he do with this excess or with the twenty millions beyond the investment in the purchase of the 3 per cent short bonds provided for in this refunding scheme when the portion five hundred millions proposed to be refunded into threeandahalf percents is sold they become irredeemable until the beginning of the next century the fourandahalf percents are not redeemable until 1891 and the four percents not until 1907 does he intend that the secretary shall make his purchases of the 3j per cent bonds just refunded or willhe go into the market and buy either the four or fourandahalf percents paying the market premium in addition to their nominal value these three classes of bonds will then constitute the entire interestbearing debt of the government and the secretary will have no alternative than to make his purchases from one or allthese classes if le prchases the interestbearing debt if he purchase the 34 per cent long bonds i am at a loss to comprehend the wisdom of such a financial feat even if they could be had at par and if he has to pay a premium on his purchases itseems to be the madness of the moon to compel him to go upon the market and repurchase the newlyissued bonds at a premium however small if he uses his surplus in the purchase either of the four percents or fouranda half percents he will be forced to pay a premim of from 5 to 10 per cent up to the year 1801 at which time the latter are redeemable at par after these fourandahalf percents are redeemed the secretary will be forced to applytme proceeds of the sinking fund by that time largely increased to the purchase of the threeandahalf percents until 1907 when the four percents are subject to redemption if this bill should unfortunately ripen into law i can hardly conceive that the committee on ways and means contemplate any such financial operations by the treasury department as seem to m to be inevitable from the provisions of this bill if the sinkingfund act is to be observed and the purchases made on its account are confined to the interestbearing debt if it be the intention of the committee that the sinkingfond act shall not be enforced then i shmolid like to he informed what is to become of the surplus revenues which under existing law will surely be realized during the ensuing ten years does the committee in presenting this bill for our consideration design to extend an invitation to congress to ignore all economy in the administration of the government and to enter upon a system of reckless and extravagant expenditures in order to consume the surplus revenues or do theypurpose to follow this bill with one reducing taxation internal and external so as to bring the revenues down to the standard of an economical administration of the government if the latter be the programme of the committee i respectfully suggest that in my judgment the house would prefer to pass upon these reductions in taxation before we are called upon to vote upon this bill it seems to me therefore that the effect of this hill is practically to repeal the sinkingfund act to leave no other alternative to the secretary of the treasury than to use that fund and any surplus revenues coming into the treasury either to take up bonds at 3j per cent newly refunded or to purchase bonds of a higher rate of interest at high premiums and at great loss to the treasury and to the people or to open the doors of the treasury to the most extravagant and wasteful expenditures and these halls to wholesale jobbery and corruption there is another application of the sinking fund which may be in contemplation by the champions of this unnecessary refunding scheme i am loath to credit which is more creditable to its friends than the practical abrogation of this fund it may be their purpose to seize the opportunity which an overflowing treasury will offer to accomplish the ends of the enemies of the greenback and to apply the surplus revenues during the next ten years to pay off the noninterestbearing debt now represented by three hundred and fortysix millions of outstanding treasury notes unquestionably they constitute apart of the public debt and under the sinkingfund act that fund as well as any other surplus revenue of the government may he legally applied to the extinguishment of this noninterestbearing debt but is this the financial policy underlying this scheme of refunding is this the feast to which we are invited by the honorable gentleman from new york who has pressed this measure upon the house and country with so much zeal and ability is this the cat in the mealtub of refunding has my distinguished friend introduced into this house a trojan horse filled with the armed enemies of the united states note under the guise of a low rate of interest and an indefinite postponement of payment of the principal of the debt it is difficult for me to believe that this purpose is concealed under the provisions of this bill and yet it is so much in harmony with the many insidious and covert attacks that have heretoforeo been made on the credit circulation of the government by its sleepless and untiring enemythe national banksand harmonizes so well with one of the provisions of this bill and the remarks of the gentleman from now york made in its support that i can not divest myself of the suspicion at least that it is not so much to refund a portion of the debt not yet due at a lower rate of interest as it is to perpetuate the national debt and with it the nationalbanking system and thus destroy the note circulation of the government that the passage of this bill is urged so prematurely and so persistently why sir the resumption act was the cover for an attack upon the treasury note as a permanent circulation and the late unsuccessful effort to deprive it of its legaltender function was prompted by the resolutions of the saratoga convention of bankers in the interest of the nationalbank issue this bill provides that the 2040 bonds authorized by it amounting to five hundred millions shall be alone held by the banks as security for their circulating notes after its passage and the honorable gentleman from new york tells us speaking of this provision of his bill thatthus by a longneeded provision of lawwe shall have a nationalbank bond and the governene will be spared the trouble and expense of constant changes in the class of securities held for that purpose thus it will be seen that refunding presents a double aspectthe perpetuation of the national debt and the perpetuation of the national banks they are in fact the siamese twins of our financial system the existence of the one being dependent on the existence of the other and the death of one the death of the other and if you add to these two a third with common purposes and common ends extravagant appropriations and wasteful expenditure of the peoples money you have an organized alliance offensive and defensive dangerous to republican government prolific of peculation and legislative jobbery ruinous to the productive sections of the country and antagonisticto the distinctive policies of the fathers of the republic instead of waiting until the arrival of the period when the charters of the national banks begin to expire thus giving the country the benefit of the experience of the next three years as to whether the power to expand or contract the paper circulation at the will of individuals and corporations shall continue in the hands of a favored few or whether the government shall assune direct control of the issue of the paper as well as the metallic circulation this bill proposes to forestall the growing popular sentiment of the country against banks of issue and prematurely offers a bid for the support of this vast and unexampled organization of credit and says in effect to the owners of national banks if you will exchange the bonds authorized by it as security for your circulating notes instead of the higherhiterestbearing bonds now held by your corporations you will have a guarantee of your circulation as long as grass grows and water runs to refund the debt as proposed by this bill is to transmit to unborn generations the burden of paying the principal and its quarterly interest and the natural instincts of bank owners will of necessity throw every possible impediment in the way of extinguishing the principal i have an abiding conviction that reflection and the experience of the near future will teach the people of the united states what is now universally conceded by all men of all parties in england that the right to issue paper for circulation as money belongs exclusively to the sovereignty that fabricates its coinage and regulates its mints that the credit circulation of this country should be restricted in amount and placed under like control with metallic money that the exercise of the power of issuing paper promises to pay money without limit tends to nullify the express grants of the constitution as to coinage and to expel gold and silver coins from the channels of circulation and from the country and is necessarily productive of wild speculation commercial revulsion and monetary disaster that beyond a fixed amount of treasury notes with an ample fund of coin for their prompt and certain redemption no other representative or substitute for coin should be permitted to circulate except certificates representing so much coin or bullion deposited in the treasury or issue department of the government for their redemption and that competition in the issue of paper money or free banking is condemned by reason as well as by its history in this country and by the experience and existing legislation of that people from whom we have copied this worst feature of banking if there were no other ground of opposition to this refunding scheme than its indirect and insidious attempt to fasten the vicious system of bank issues upon us for generations yet to come i should feel it my duty to use all lawful and legitimate means to prevent its enactment into law it would become the lion in our path to a just economical and judicious system of credit circulation issued and controlled by the government safe to the holder useful to the treasury a help instead of an obstruction to the payment of the national debt and a relief to the taxpayers of millions of its principal and interest for let it never be forgotten that there is a natural and inevitable antagonism between issues of banks and of the government we must realize that our paper circulation must in time be all bank notes or all treasury notes the conflict between the two kinds of circulation is as irreptessible as that between slavery and freedom in years past and gone it cannot continue onehalf treasury note and the other half bank note any more than this union of states could continue onehalf free and the other half slavea philosophic truth uttered by mr seward which many of us were very slow to accept but which we must recognize now as an absolute verity if the banks are permitted to retain their note circulation we may as well prepare to redeem the three hundred and fortysix millions of greenbacks and to witness a duplication of the present number of national banks with the implied pledge of congress that we will never pay the debt necessary to keep the bank circulation in existence to this complexion it must come sooner or later there is another view of this subject to which i desire very briefly to allude and that is the effect of refunding this debt or the major portion of it into long bonds on the abolition or modification of present internal taxation i have stated that the interest on the four and fourandahalf percents the principal of which is about nine hundred and ninety millions is in round nimbers 40 000 000 payable quarterly if the five and six percents of 1881 are refunded instead of being paid during the succeeding ten years our annual interest charge will approximate sixty millions in 1891 we might indulge the hope with an annual interest charge of forty millions that the proceeds of the customs duties wisely adjusted to the interests of all sections of the country would discharge the ordinary expen ses of the government pay this interest and make the contributions required by law to the sinking fund certainly this hope would be well grounded if when the charters of the banks begin to expire congress shall determine to substitute the notes of the government for those of the banks and with these notes purchase the bonds held as security for bank circulation this operation would reduce theinterestbearing debtten yearsbeneo to thesum of about six hundred millions bearing4 and 4per cent interest with an annual interest charge of twentyfour or twentyfive millions it can hardly bedeemed extravagant for us to hope that with the reduction of the principal of the debt to six or seven hundred millions in 1891 we may then begin to look for the entire abolition of internal taxal ion or such a modification aswould at least transfer the present tax on the productions of the south and west from them to the consumption of tobacco alcoholic and fermented liquors and can we not reasonably flatter ourselves that when under the census of this year and the apportionment under it the seat of the political power of this government has been transferred to ti teeming valley of the father of waters with the payment of the debt proposed to be refunded that we shall be able to abolish all internal taxation that imposes restrictions upon labor or shackles productive industry and make the wealth and invested capital of the country contribute its proper share of taxation bet refunding holds out no such flattering hope even in the distantfuture it gives assurance on the eontrary not only that we lire doomed to the indefinite continuance of the present interna revenue taxation with its regiments of taxconsuming officials and its oppressive and irritating exactions but it sheds no gleam of hope of any essential modification or amelioration of the system the national debt is the question above and beyond all others that fills the thoughts and excitesthe lpprehensions of all reflecting minds in this country and its honest and speedy payment consistent with the admitted rights of the taxpayer should command the highest efforts of pgtriotic statesmanship the connection between apubhie debtand the dailylabors of the people its influence upon their contentment their happiness and their prosperity no less than upon the future of the republic and the spirit of its institutions cannot be overestimated or overlooked the necessity of a yearly exaction from the earnings of labor of hundreds of millions gives law to industry imposes restrictions upon production and has in times past created a spirit of discontent turbulence and dissatisfaction among the laboring classes that ought not to be lost upon the representatives of the people war has been classed in the trinity of calamities to nations but it is less of a calamity than grinding excessive and perpetual taxation the one exhausts itself within a few years while the other transmits through successive generations its baleful consequences and condemns the great mass of the people to a continuous conflict with pinching parsimony want starvation and beggary in this as in all other countries the large proportion of the human family earn their bread by the sweat of their brow and no government is wisely conducted and certainly no government can long maintain a republican character that does not treat labor as its primary and paramount interest and the withdrawal from its shoulders of all needless burdens of taxation as an imperative duty our publie debt and the mode and manner of its manipulation brings us face to face with many of the gravest perils that can affect the purity and existence of republican government and the welfare and happiness of the great majority of its citizens excessive and continuous taxation to meet quarterly and yearly exactions of interest however low the rate oppresses labor in all its departments consumes the first fruits of industry and enterprise accumulates capital in the hands of the few and creates a favored if not a privileged class in the state ever vigilant and active in making laws to perpetuate its influence and power the comparatively low rate of interest on the bonds authorized by the bill before the committee offers no inducement to the agriculturist to postpone indefinitely their payment with yearly accruing interest inasmuch as the annual profits on his labor and capital do not average that per cent postponement of the day of payment affords him little or no relief and only adds to the burdens of the generation upon whom the payment of the principal and interest is imposed if we were forced to pay this entire debt principal and interest ten years hence it would amount to one thousand and seventy millions at 5 and 6 per cent if paid in full in thirty years <the mean time of redemption and the time of payment with interest at 3 per cent the generation then living would pay in principal and interest exceeding fourteen hundred millions i repeat that for the ten years preceding the 30th june 1879 we paid of principal and interest of the public debt fifteen hundred and twentyeight millions much the largest portion of which was paid in atime of great business stagnation of shrinkage of values of contracted circulation of unexampled bankruptcy and of almost universal financial distress shall it be said that now with duplicated resources with increasing revenues with large accessions to our population with every indication in all branches of business and in all parts of the cointry of restored prosperity and of hopefulness and confidence in the future that we cannot discharge a less sum of principal and interest in the ensuing ten years the proposition is belittling to our national character insulting to our national pride and disparaging to the present and prospective wealth resources and grandeur of this magnificent republic and i cannot believe it will ever receive the support of a majority of this house to sum up the views 1 have thus imperfectly presented to the committee i repeat that this bill has come into the world before its time and that its final consideration should be postponed until the next session of congress that we can pay the whole debt including principal and all accruing interest by applying no more of the surplus revenue to both principal and interest from 1881 to 1891 than has been applied for several years since 1870 to the payment of interest alone and it ought to be paid even if increased taxation be required rather than refund it in 2040 bonds tlat the bill looks to making the debt a fixed and permanent institution and so far antagonizes the policy of our fathers and is hostile to the genius acd spirit of republican government that it will either practically repeal the act establishing the sinking fund compel the treasury to purchase bonds for that fund at a great loss to the treasury and the people open the door to wasteful and extrava gant expenditures by congress or it will divert the surplus revenues and the proceeds of the sinking fund from the purchase of the interestbearing debt to that of the noninterestbearing debt that it gives a new lease of life to the national banks and a continuation of the banking system is equivalent to the payment and cancellation of the treasury note or greenback circulation and finally that refunding means a continuance of the present internalrevenne system for the lifetime of the present generation without hope of material modification or amelioration"], [0.07424873113632202,

and faithful army of the united states the people of this country will not be slow to understand that there are reminiscences of that army which these gentlemen would willingly forget by burying both the army and the memories of its great service to the union in one grave we do not seek to revive the unhappy memories of the war but we are unwilling to see the army perish at the hands of congress even if its continued existence should occasionally awaken the memcry of its former glories now lot it be understood once for all that we do not deuy we have never denied your right to make rules for this house just as you please under those rules as you make or construe them you may put all your legislation upon these bills as riders but we say that whatever your rules may be you must make or repeal a law in accordance with the constitution by the triple consent to which i referred the other day or you must do it by violence now as my friend from connecticut well said if you can elect a president and a congress in 1880 you have only to wait two years and you have the three consents you can then without revolution tear down this statute and all the rest you can follow out the programme which some of your members have suggested and tear out one by one the records of the last eighteen years some of them are glorious with the unquenchable light of liberty some of them stand as the noblest trophies of freedom with full power in your hands you can destroy them but we ask you to restrain your rage against them until you have the lawful power to smite them down my friend

down the laws which the republic enacted to protect the purity of national elections and to authorize the army to be used tokeep the peace while the national voice is finding expression at the polls that i say is his notion of duty of which he is sole arbiter but when he comes to superadd power in order to complete his right as alegislator i hope hewill not evoke that power out of his consciousness but will seek for it in the great charter the constitution of the united states according to his own algebra lie must have both these elements before he can claim the right to overturn these laws which he denounces as grievances now let me add a word in conclusion lest i may be misunderstood i said last session and i have said since that if you want this whole statute concerning the use of the army at the polls torn from your books i wvill help you to do it if you will otfer a naked propositiou to repeal those two sections of the revised statutes named in the sixth section of this bill i will vote with you but you do not ask a repeal of those sections why 7 they impose restrictions upon the use of the army limiting its functions and pulishing its officers for any infraction of these limitations but you ask to strike out a negative clause thereby making new and affirmative legislation of the most sweeping and dangerous character your proposed modification of the law affects not the army alone but the whole civil power of the united states civil officers are included in these sections and if the proposed amendment be adopted you deny to any civil officer of the united states any power whatever to summon the armed posse to help him enforce the processes of the law if you pass the section in that form yo impose restrictions upon the civil authorities of the united states never before proposed in any congress by any legislator since this government began i say therefore iii the shape you propose this it is much the worst of all your riders in the beginning of this contest we understood that you desired only to get the army away from the polls as that would still leave the civil officers full power to keep the peace at the polls i thought it was the least important and the least dangerous of your demands but as you have put it here it is the most dangerous if you reenact it in the shape presented it becomes a later law than the supervisors and marshals law and pro laoe repeals the latter as it stands now in the statutebook it is the earlier statute and is pro taito itself repealed by the marshals law of 1871 and is therefore harmless so far as it relates to civil officers but if you put it in here you deny the power of the marshals of the united states to perform their duties whenever a riot may require the use of an armed posse the gentleman from maryland said the other day there was nothing in the constitution which empowered any officer of the united states to keep the peace in the states a single sentence before your hammner falls i ask that gentleman when he rises to respond whether the united states has no power to keep the peace in the great postoffice in baltimore city so that the postmaster may attend to his duties whether we have not the power to keep the peace along the line of every railroad that carries our mails or where any postrider of the star service carries the mail on his saddle

of contest in this precinct is that a mr overton one of the judges was drunk there is no testimony that he was drunk i do not understand the habits of the people of north carolina very well and have no refiections to make on the people of that state but mr overton is noi present to defend himself against charges and i do not wish to go any farther than the evidence the testimony is that mr overton was under the influence of spirituous liquors and that is all the testimony in the case except the testimony of mr barrington in regard to whom there is some testimony about his reputation for veracity which testimony i will read in a moment overton seems to have been active in thedisehargeof his duties so far as you can glean from the testimony barrington in regard to whom there is some dispute about veracity and who was a partisan of respass and who was a mulatto schoolteacher who had more trouble in this election than anybody else because he was getting up a bolt in the republican party the only effect of which might be to elect my friend mr yeates testifies in regard to this matter as follows q was the receiver of the ballots so much under the influence of liquor that he was unable to attend to the discharge of his duties at the polls a ile staid at the polls but i think he was too drunk to be fit for busines that day that is the only place where the word drunk occurs q do you know that he did not discharge the duties of his office that day a i do not q was he in the discharge of his proper duties at the times you were around the polis during the day i a he was that is the whole of barringtons statement so far as barrington saw him he was in the proper discharge of his duties that he was too drunk to attend to them is a thought or an imagination of his and no other person puts it stronger than that he was under the influence of spirituous liquors but it is plain from the testimony that he was in the performance of his duties actively so far as you can gather the facts from it during the day whether it is quite safe in administering the laws of north carolina to invalidate the acts of the people them because one of the election officers smelt of whisky on election day i must leave to gentlemen who are more familiar than i am with the public policy of that state the next objection to south mills precinct in evidence but not in the notice of contest is that there was an adjournment for dinner it has been settled over and over again that in these country districts where there is ample time and more for everybody to vote where an adjournment for dinner is sometimes taken and sometimes nota i fancy it is frequently taken by people who are accustomed to dine in the middle of the daysuch adjournments do not invalidate an election the next objection in evidence but not in the notice of contest is that this mr overton when i hey adjourned for dinner took the ballotbox locked it took the key and carried the box to the house of mr spence who is a democrat and who wasthe registrar at that election and who probably went with mr spence to dinner and put the ballotbox in an unoccupied room of spences residence locked the room and the ballotbox remained there while they were at dinner for an hour and then he took the box and carried it back to the place of voting that was a very reasonable and proper precaution mr spence testified q do yon believe that the ballot box was safe from interference during the adjournment for dinner a i do he also gives this testimony q has it not always been customary here to adjourn the voting st noon for dinner i a sometimes they adjourn for dinner and sometimes they do not there is no evidence or suggestion in this case that the ballotbox was tampered with in the least particular that is all there is of south mills precinct but it is ou these grounds that although the democratic state authorities of north carolina counted the vote of that precinct for mr martin it is here proposed to throw it out and to deduct 64 votes from the returned vote of the sitting member the next precinct is vandemere precinct these are all small precincts where everybody knows everybody in the vandemere precinct mr yeates received 31 votes and mr martin received 71 votes the majority for mr martin being 40 here the polls were not opened until eleven oclock and fifteen minutes the reason given was that it took until that time to get enough men from both sides to serve as inspectorsof elections mr holton the registrar puts the opening of the polls at near eleven mr gatlin puts it at eleven oclock and fifteen minutes that is the only objection to this poll what i have said about the delay in opening the polls at south mills applies to this case if it becomes important in any event to determine how many votes mr yeates lost by reason of voters being unwilling to wait until the polls were opened it may be said that one man supposes about tea or fifteen another about six mr mccotter says five eight witnessses in all are produced who swore that they either left or did not go to the polls under the belief that no election would be held and that they would have voted for mr yeates in rezard to the south mills precinct so far as i remember there is no evidence of any particular person who left the polls or did not go to the polls and who would have voted for mr yeates or at most but one such person now if these eight persons in the vandemere precinct all the persona in regard to whom there is any definite evidence that mr yeates suffered by reason of the delay in opening the polls and the one vote at south mills were added to his vote still it would not elect him the next precinct is hamilton precinct in regard to which the charge is made that mr joseph j
