know something about longstaple cotton i can tell you something about the shipment of hope cotton the gentleman probably has never heard of hope cotton but in passing i may say that it gets its name from the town of hope much of that cotton is grown in my district and the best part of it in my county i know where it is grown and i know who has bought some of the crop before it is grown the gentleman had better get the statistics of what has been done with the lolgstaple cotton crop in arizona in texas louisiana and in southwestern arkansas before lie undertakes to bring in a tariff bill for it but gentlemen i want to talk about something elsesomething more serious than this political buncombe about a taiiff on cotton a tariff on cotton when 65 out of every 100 bales has got to be sold elsewhere what is the trouble with the cotton grower it is the same as with the wheat farmer and the wool growermy heart goes out to all of them what is tile matter for five years 50 000 000 men destroyed commodities and destroyed each other ten million of these men who were consumers of cotton surplus wheat and the manufactures and the surplus wool were left dead on the field of battle six million of wounded and maimed men lave their productive capacity destroyed one trouble with wheat cotton and wool and other surplus commodities in this country is that there is an underconsumption the world over but gentlemen youtalk about paternalism and yet for political purposes you go up and down the land trying to make the people believe that the prosperity of the cotton farmer the wheat grower and the new england manufacturer can be relieved overnight by a tariff resolution of congress i thank god i do not live under any such system of government because if by a simple resolution of congress we can bring prosperity to the wheat grower to the wool grower to the cotton grower overnight by the same token we can destroy them and we would have the most vicious kind of government on earth except that of lenin and trotsky oh gentlemen you may be able to do as one gentleman did make an argument in favor of the war finance corporation and then in the next breath say that you ought to cut off imports there are just two ways by which you can settle a debt one is with gold and the other is with commodities has europe got the gold she has not we have more gold here than is good for us and i pray that god may hasten the day when the normal flow of gold will be resumed throughout the earth that will aid the solution of our economic and financial situation more than anything else they have not got the gold and how are they going to pay you here is a question of barter and trade whether you like it or not you are up against the fact that the reverse of what was formerly true now is the fact instead of being a debtor nation we are a creditor nation are you going to maintain a merchant marine and say that you will permit those ships to bring nothing back from europe are you going to run them empty one way if so it will take more subsidy than the republican party ever dreamed of to maintain a merchant marine under that condition"], [0.019760672003030777,

is a serious condition with them last year we imported 60 000 000 pounds of rice and we exported 392 612 000 pounds of rice and yet you put 2 cents a pound on rice when we export more than six times as much rice as we import how do you expect that to help the rice farmers of this country last year we imported 2 295 000 pounds of pork yet we exported 900 000 000 pounds of pork you put 2 cents a pound on fresh meat and pork in this bill gentlemen why have you done that you can not help the farmer on a proposition of that kind it is impossible to do it but i will tell you whom you will ielp in this bill since you have introduced this bill again and are seriously asking the congress to pass it i believe i understand now why in the last congress you defeated tile bill known as the packers bill you would not pass the packers bill through the last congress to regulate the meat trust of the country but on the contrary you come here today and ask the people the consumers of this ountry to pay 2 cents a pound additional on every pound of pork and beef that the packers of this country control and sell t6 the people that is not fair or square to the people who are the consuming masses of this country the farmers can not add tiis tariff to their product because they export more than they import and the packers of tile country furnish and sell to the consumers of this country 99 per cent of the meat products consumed in the country they have a strangle hold o the farmers and stock growers o1 the one hand because there is nobody for them to sell their live stock to except the packing trust they control the farmers and stock raisers o the one hand and on the other hand they have a grapple hold oil the con sulers of america and you are helping the meat trust if yol support this bill because they are in a position to add the tax to their price and if you give them an excuse they are going to add the tax unless the people of this country quit eating nioht that is tile situation i do not think you ought to do it i do not think you ought to try to mislead the american farmer in that sort of a way because he can not possibly get anything out of it and at the same time turn over not only tile farmers but all the consumers of the country to the packing trust on this proposition of beef and pork if you please what else they have tried to fool the cotton farmer here by placing a duty on cottonseed oil yet last year while we imported 9 422 000 pounds of cottonseed oil we exported 184 753 000pounds of cottonseed oil and when they appeared before the committee we made them admit that they lid not need a tariff duty on cottonseed oil but they said they needed it on some other oils yet the committee insisted on putting it in the bill after they knew that the witnesses had testified that it was not necessary from any protective or other viewpoint whlt else have they done in this bill of course you can not help the farmers in this way it is impossible to do it but i will tell you when the farmers will be helped they will be helped when they have a market for their surplus products and not before when europe our great purchaser of surplus farm products gets on her feet again when the people of europe become stabilized socially politically and economically then we will find a market for our surplus farm products and not before what else have you done you have given the beef trust the best of it here and every man in this house must know it what else have you done you have given the sugar trust the best of it why because you boost this tariff to 2 cents a pound on sugar what does that mean to the consumers of america i should like to ask you republicans over here especially those of you who live in the districts where there are three or four million men out of employment where do you expect tile laboring man who is out of employment to get money to pay this extra cent on sugar you are placing a burden oil the people who have to eat sugar and meat products if they are not employed how do you expect them to pay the price do you think it is fair and just to those people that you increase the cost of living to them and at the same time do absolutely nothing for the farmers of america yet you have placed in this bill a provision which in this duty of 2 cents a pound on sugar will mean 190 000 000 to the american consumers of this country and only half of that money will go into the treasury of the united states onehalf of it will go into the pockets of the sugar producers and refiners of the country it seems that you republicans can always get together on propositions of this kind i expect you all to vote fbr this bill because i have always noticed that when democrats and others attack the sugar trust the beef trust and these other trusts it invariably lines up the republican party ill their support now gentlemen what else have you done in this bill i want to say a word about wheat the imports of wheat are decreasing right now and in the last three months those imports decreased 983 462 bushels our exports of wheat have also decreased 20 899 066 bushels of course they decreased because our former purchasers in europ e have nothing with which to buy but the imports also decreased take peanuts the imports decreased 3 000 000 but our exports also decreased 1 138 000 pounds our imports of rice decreased 3 78d 000 pounds but our exports also decreased 80 945 000 pounds my friend the gentleman from north dakota of whom i all personally very fond talked about 100 000 000 pounds of wool being

word of testimony before the ways and means committee showed that you can not sell it at any price they testified that they could not sell wool at any price then how is the gentleliln from north

from wyoming in making his statement seems to attribute the defeat of his party to the fact that all of the ills of the country were inherited from the democratic administration which has been out of power for two years i am very much surprised that the distinguished gentleman should come here at this time after the recent experience and offer that argument because the same statements were made in every voting precinct in tile united states to the american people and they repudiated that doctrine entirely the party to which the distinguished gentleman from wyoming belongs has been convicted upon the record that they themselves have made and as a member of the democratic party i am indeed glad that this issue is brought to the attention of the american people at this time if there is any one issue upon which our party can go to the country it is upon this ship subsidy bill of all the bad legislation that has been enacted by the majority party in this congress in my humble opinion this is the worst measure of all that they have presented for our consideration now gentlemen of the house to get down to the merits of the rule and this proposition i wish to have the record clear and i state that the members of the rules committee on the democratic side voted solidly against reporting this rule to the house and i am fully convinced that when the measure itself comes before the house the democratic party will be recorded against the passage of the bill i am delighted to hear that so many members on the majority side of the house will join us in their protest against this measure i am not reliably informed as to the situation on the majority side but i did read a day or two ago in one of the leading republican papers of the country that after a careful canvass of the house the majority leaders hoped to put the bill through the house by a majority of 25 or 30 you have on this side of the house now something like 169 majority and if you can not summon more than a measly majority of 25 on that side there must be something radically wrong with the bill now gentlemen one reason why i ask the members of the house to vote against the adoption of this rule is because the bill that is now before the house is apparently a new bill at least so i am informed by some members of the committee that reported it a bill was drawn many months ago and thoroughly discussed in the committee and was put before the people now as i am informed even as late as day before yesterday the committee took up the bill made many important amendments to it most of them very objectionable that they were not even discussed in the full committee and the new bill which this house has not had any chance to study or even read because the bill was only printed yesterday comes before the house and we are asked to adopt it under a special rule a bill that the membership of the committee has not had time to consider this special rule is for the consideration of a bill which the membership of the house has not had time to consider and therefore i am opposed to the rule and would like to see it defeated and this matter postponed so that the membership of the house may have time to give it full consideration i can not understand why the majority leaders in tis house are so insistent on putting this bill through under a gag rule at this time or under a special rule to be polite about it why let me call your attention to the fact that you will have a majority in the next house you will have a republican congress in both branches the president in the white house is of your political persuasion and why just a few days after election in which the people have passed judgment on this measure do you bring in a special rule here and why in an extra session of congress called upon this particular bill to ram it down the throats of the american people when your own party is going to be in power for the next two years that very procedure in itself would convince me and i believe any fairminded voter or citizen in this country that there is something radically wrong somewhere in this bill that necessitates the calling of an extra session and bringing in a special rule and undertaking to force this bill through the house i can not see any necessity for the rule or any necessity for this procedure at this time if there was to be a change in the administration or in the congress there would be some justification for your stand but with your own party in power i can not see the necessity ah gentlemen the truth is that the leaders of the majority side know that with a majority of 169 there is such a revolution of sentiment in the republican party that you do not dare to submit it to the next congress even though you have a majority in that congress my friends therefore to keep the record straight i want to call attentron to the fact that the democratic party in this house has voted in committee a d i hope will vote on the floor against the adoption of the rule and then let us line up our forces in opposition to the bill one thing in the presidents message to the congress yesterday impressed me very much he called attention to the deplorable condition of agriculture in the nation nearly onehalf of our population are engaged in agriculture every wellposted citizen in the united states knows that the farmens of the country under this administration have suffered a deflation of their property to the extent of billions and billions of dollars the president of the united states in his message yesterday recognized that fact and said that within a short timeno definite time being stated but at some time in the futurehe proposed to come before the american congress and make some recommendations in behalf of the american farmers let me put this question to you with the deplorable condition of agriculture in which nearly onehalf of our population is engaged why does the president come before the congress after calling the congress into extra session and ask it to pass a bill for a shipping trust which will amount to hundreds of millions of dollars putting that amount into the pockets of the trust instead of squarely meeting the

520 154 in 1920 they were 1 112 000 000 a greater sum than for any other year except 1917 when the stimulation of war perhaps affected them i shall have to run along here and suggest one or two other things and then i am through they say they are going to give a tariff on wheat when the original fordney billthe emergency billwas before the house in the first part of this congress they provided a tariff on wheat you know that emergency tariff bill reminded me of the time you were initiated into a lodge they took you into the anteroom and took your name and treated you very nicely and gave you some ice water told you not to worry treated you very kindly and all that sort of thing but after you got ihto the lodge room proper there was a different situation now the emergency tariff bill was just the anteroom we are now riding the goat in the main hall the emergency tariff bill was simply invented to try to make the farmers and agriculturists of the country think the republican party was going to benefit them by a high tariff they thought they would be able to follow that immediately by this permanent tariff and have them so intermixed like they do all the tariff bills that nobody could tell exactly what they mean finless they study it ery carefully but the trouble about the prescription the republican party administered to the farmer is that instead of matters getting better they got worse now wheat has continued to go down with slight fluctuations up and down a little but wheat has continued to go down ever since the emergency tariff bill was passed that bill became law on may 27 and no 2 wheat was then 1 64 to 1 70 at chicago a chicago press dispatch of june 28 quoted july wheat at 1 19 and july 9 spot wheat was 1 19 i have been told that new wheat is selling in oklahoma for around 80 cents it has gone below the price of may 27 in spite of the appearance of wheat rust which always stiffens the market oh one gentleman explained the low price by saying it would be much farther down than it now is if the tariff had not been enacted if that gentleman is so shrewd in his construction why in the name of tom hill did not he make the tariff higher according to his theory if he had made it higher it would not and could not have gone as far down because lie would have pulled it back after it was halfway down now nobody believes that the farmer can be benefited by a tariff on wheat why because we are exporters of wheat for the fiscal year ended june 30 1921 the united states exported 365 000 000 bushels of wheat and flour in terms of wheat that was the largest volume ever exported in any year in our history the price per bushel was less than for 1920 but the total value 840 000 000 was the highest on record the market price of that enormous surplus controlled the domestic price each republican tariff bill contains a drawbacks provision if a raw material like wheat is imported and if a duty is paid the miller may grind the wheat into flour and export all equal amount of flour and draw back from the treasury 99 per cent of the tariff paid on the wheat in the calendar year 1 920 there were imported into the united states only 5 500 000 bushels of wheat and 220 000 000 were exported fortyfour per cent of the exported wheat was in the form of flour the miller can then draw back 99 per cent of all tariff paid on canadian wheat the farmer is told a tariff is paid but he gets no protection it was held out to him but when he reaches to get it it is drawn back this bill carries no duty on raw cottonj but once in a while some republican who thinks the cotton farmer can be buncoed or deceived by the cheap tricks of a faker proposes a tariff on cotton he merely wants to get an additional cmpensatory tariff on manufactured cotton goods but lie does not fool anybody since 1914 the united states has produced annually about 12 000 000 bales about 60 or 65 per cent is sold in england germany france italy japan and other foreign countries every cotton raiser knows that the price in liverpool england controls the american market because the american manufacturer will not pay any more for raw cotton than the liverpool market forces him to pay liverpool is higher because we ship cotton to england england does not ship cotton here if liverpool goes up the new england factory price has to go up or the cotton will go to liverpool on the other hand let liverpool go down and with that competition gone the new england factory lowers its price and buys cheaply because there is more produced than is consumed in america without the foreign nmarket in liverpool germany austria and other countries the cotton raiser is at the mercy of the manufacturers of the united states that is theexact trouble today germany austria italy france and other european countries can not buy normal supplies of cotton because they have no gold and can only pay us in goods with the foreign market for cotton practically gone new england now pays the farmer for his cotton less than it cost him to produce the cotton grower whether he wants to or not with tariffs or without tariffs has to meet the competition of the whole world in liverpool every bale of cotton that he fails to meet in the american market lie meets in liverpool wherever raised and from wherever shipped lie meets it there england is a freetrade country and has no tariff on cotton it is the worlds market and the price of american cotton is higher there than in america if there is a surplus of manufactured cotton goods the manufacturer closes his factory and lays off his men and stops his expense he thereby holds up the price of cotton goods the farmer can not stop he is forced to continue and a large cotton production forces his price down but what is the object of the republican who sometimes talks about a tariff on cottbn he has two objects the first is that if he can get a duty on raw cotton he then will have an excuse to add a compensatory duty on manufactur~d cotton goods he has already put the regular tariff duties on his goods as high as lie thinks the country will stand but he would like to get more if a tariff is levied on cotton lie can then charge a compensatory duty mind you all republican bills provide compensatory duties though not a pound of imported cotton might be used in making cotton clothing though not a bale might be imported and though a tariff on raw cotton would not raise the price onetenth of a cent to the manufacturer a multiplied compensatory duty would be added to all the clothing underwear hosiery and so forth made of american cotton and added to the already high duties varying up to 40 per cent of their value this added tax the farmer would pay without getting any compensatory benefit himself the second object of the republican is to fool some southern congressmen or the cotton producers into supporting such a scheme in order to commit them to the republican protective theory and thereby forever silence their protest against the outrages perpetrated by that system on the consumers of america if they can induce you to vote with them on one schedule they feel they own your very soul no such transparent fraud will delude southern representatives or southern cotton raisers foreign countries are neither willing nor can afford to pay us as fnuch for our cotton if we deny them our markets as they will if allowed to ship us manufactured goods in exchange for the raw product now what else do we find my time is limited and i want to try to get through you know when a fellow gets to prosecuting a criminal case it takes a good deal of time oh but they said the peace resolution was going to bring trade yes they said we want to trade with germany bring this peace resolution on and in the next minute they say we shall not trade with germany because we are going to put a tariff wall between us and germany i want to talk to the republican member the gentleman from texas a minute the other day in a speech he took the democratic members of congress from texas to task he says that we ought to vote for this bill in order to protect the farmer i want to say to the gentleman from texas that when lie goes back to his farmer and ranch constituents and others in texas i want him to tell them that when lie came to congress the first thing of importance lie did was to vote for a tariff a tax if you please upon nearly everything that the farmer wears or uses from the time lie gets up in the morning until he goes to bed at night and in exchange for his vote what does lie get he has got something that fools him he gets a gold brick he may think it is gold but it is really brass he does not get 5 cents on hides protected hides are not in the bill the republican commit tee would not put them in the gentleman from texas says that the republicans will put them in at the proper time but they will not but let us suppose they should put a 15cent duty on hides automatically the shoe manufacturers will get a 10 per cent compensatory duty on shoes let us see how that will work out a 30pound raw hide now sells in texas for 1 20 fifteen per cent tariff would give the seller 18 cents additional out of that hide 10 pairs of shoes can be made if shoes sell for 4 per pair and most sell for more the shoe manufacturer on 10 pairs of shoes would get 4 compensatory duty he only paid 18 cents additional for the hide but will collect 4 or more than twenty times as much to compensate him a farmer or ranchiman whose family buys 10 pairs of shoes in a year would pay more than he would get on 20 hides all the rest of the people who do not sell hides would pay 10 per cent more for their shoes without getting anything to compensate them the gentleman from texas will find out that most of the republicans wear shoesmore of them than make shoesand they will not give him a tariff on hides he thinks he is going to get something in the way of wool but when he does his compensatory duty will eat him up when the gentleman votes for this bill for the farmers sake what does the farmer friend of my friend from texas find out at 4 30 oclock in the morning lie is aroused by an alarm clock upon which a tax is paid he rolls back cotton sheets because that is the only kind the farmer can afford under the republican administration and all the things which i shall mention are protected in this bill and the gentleman from texas mr wurzu3achi is for it he is anxious about it he is enthusiastic about it when the farmer gets out of bed he puts on his woolen or cotton underclothes his socks his shirt his collar and his woolen clothes though the cotton and wool in them were produced by his toil or care he must pay a tax for the privilege of wearing them he cuts kindling with a pocket knife and builds a fire in the fireplace whose bricks and tile and cement are taxed he strikes a match and makes a fire in thekitchen and his wife cooks breakfast and every metal kitchen utensil that she uses while cooking breakfast is taxed as are the household and kitchen furniture the breakfast table the chairs the knives forks dishes plates spoons tablecloth and napkins must pay their tribute to the tariff he shaves himself with a razor and goes out and hitches up old beck and uses trace chains that are taxed as are the mules shoes and the buckles on the harness saws blacksmith tools grindstones nails staples screws bolts files and hundreds of other articles that lie must buy are taxed why my colleague mr wurzbach says that it is to help the farmer i say it is to help the manufacturer these ire things the manufacturer ships to the markets of the world and there competes with the foreigner but he says he can not compete here and my colleague seems to believe him i have not time to name even half of the articles upon which he must pay toll to the tariff favorite if he goes down to the back of the field to shoot squirrels or kill the crows in his corn he has to pay a tax on the rifle and shotgun at night after a hard days toil his family gathers around the fireplace the good wife and mother is making clothes or knitting for the children her scissors needles buttons yarn and cloth can not escape the taxgatherer the j6y of the children also must bear a burden the dolls and toys with which they play on the floor must contribute to the bulging purse of the manufacturer why because some republican is afraid that a few german toys may be shipped to the united states overcome with weariness lie goes to bed and pulls the blankets around

understood you know i am one of the boys i am a texas boy like all of you texas men john garner and i are as good friends as any two men in this congress and what i say here has not the slightest ill feeling except that i do delight just for a change to live in a rich republican atmosphere you know i have been living for a whole lot of years down there in a democratic atmosphere that is so thick that a republican can hardly live in it when i get up here and have a lot of republicans to back me up it is really a delight why i have heard more than a score of men on this side pay the highest compliments to the texas delegation in fact they say that there is no state delegation in this congress that stands higher than the texas delegation and i tell you it does me good as a fellow texan when i hear that kind of language i feel good over it because i am a texan myself you know i love the democrats almost as much as i do the republicans i would love them twice as much if it were not for the foolish way they have down south of acting on election day some of you people have a wrong conception of conditions down south i am free to admit that some years ago there was some sectional feeling but today that is gone there is no prejudice upon the part of the north and its people toward the south and the people there and so far as the rank and file of the people of the south is concerned there is no feeling of sectionalism against the north or the northern people we all feel that we are citizens of the same country and lovers of one flag the spanishamerican war partly and the world war wholly wiped out the last vestige of sectional feeling in the south now and then you will find on this side of the line or on that side of the line some exceptional man who brings up those questions but they are but the flickering flames of a dying hate that does not even cast a shadow in the brighter and purer light of the rising sun of a new reunion now i want to talk to you democrats it is not necessary to talk to the boys over on the republican side because they are with us but i want to try to talk to you men of the south take this fordney bill which we have now under 6onsideration what complaint have you got to make against its provisions does it not provide for every product of your state there was a time when the claim was made that the protective tariff was only for the north and east but you can not make that complaint now every product of your state is on the protected list except hides and cotton and if i have the same success if my appeal will carry as much weight with you men on the democratic side of the house as i know it will with the gentlemen on the other side i believe that when thil bill comes up for final passage you will have to vote for protection on hides and cotton too i am hoping you will do that in fact i am half expecting you to do it get away from the dead tradition of your party it is not really a tradition of your party your party did not always stand for free trade or for a tariffforrevenueonly policy the greatest men of your party jefferson madison monroe and andrew jacksonstood for a protectivetariff policy and when you see the industries of your section the cotton farmers the cottonseed growers the peanut growers the livestock men of your section lying prostrate i say you ought to rise above your partisanship and vote for this bill if you do not i want to say you are going to have some of the tallest explaining to do that you have ever had to do in all your lives i want to say to you further that it is going to be your political funeral and not mine and right here and now in order to test your sincerity in the stand that you are taking on this tariff question i want to make this open challenge to you democrats of the south i want some of your leaders to declare collectively or individually that you will go before the people of your states in the next congressional election free from all extraneous questions partisan politics and everything else and declare that you stand against a protectivetariff policy against protecting the industries of your own section and let the verdict of the people of the south be upon that sole issue if you will accept that challenge and do that my democratic friends you will see the merriest time in dixieland that you have ever seen and i think there will be a considerable break in the solid south why 80 per cent of the people of texas favor a protective tariff and i want to tell you democratic congressmen from texas who have senatorial bees buzzing in your bonnetsand i think includes about fivefourths of you you had better get straight on the tariff question you might have some trouble in getting by a democratic nomination but whenever you get befqre the people of texas and stand on a protectivetariff policy you will win and if you do not do that we will put up some republican candidate for the senate and we

present lighthouse depot at portsmouth va is entirely inadequate to the needs of the fifth district both in area and in water front this depot is the principal supply station for the lighthouse work of chesapeake bay and the coast from maryland to north carolina with the sounds and rivers the increasing nmaritime and naval importance of the vicinity of norfolk makes it urgent that a suitable depot be established promptly it is the principal depot of one of the largest lighthouse districts and is the headquarters for six tenders and two light vessels during the greater part of the year the aggregate length of these vessels is over 1 400 feet the total wharf frontage is only 240 feet the operation of tenders is much hampered by this limited frontage the delay caused by waiting to discharge or receive cargo being estimated to cost the lighthouse service not less than 35 000 a year the very small area available for buoy storage necessitates much otherwise unnecessary handling of heavy buoys and appendages at a large cost of time and money the available wharf frontage of this depot should be doubled and the area increased by several acres this may be done by purchase of a new and larger site or by purchase of adjacent property the present buildings are mainly antiquated wooden structures they constitute a fire menace and should he replaced by modern fireproof buildings

indiana but toshow that in all probability hewas mistaken atleast in some of his declarations i point out the fact that in 1908 the senator from indiana was the republican candidate for governor of the state of indiana he was then a member of the house of representatives his time during 1908 was in large part consumed in the primary and general election campaigns preceding the gubernatorial election in in diana which i believe took place in november of 1908 his term of bffice as a member of the house of representatives expired march 4 1909 so the senator from indiana was not a member of congress at the time the paynealdrich bill was introduced and considered he was not a member of congress during the first two years of the taft administration during whichl period the paynealdrich bill was framed considered and enacted into law the paynealdrich bilt was introduced in the house of rep resentatives on march 17 1909 it passed that body april 9 1909 it came to the senate and was referred to the finance committee on april 10 was subsequently reported and passed the senate on july 8 1909 the president approving it on august 5 1909 so whatever discussion the senator from indianathent the gentleman from indianamay have heard between speaker cannon and mr ridder must have taken place in 1908 prior to mr tafts first election the important point in this connection is that the senator from north dakota the senator from utah and the senator from indiana have all alleged that the failure of mr tafts party to incorporate newsprint paper in the free list in the paynealdrich tariff law and the refusal to permit consideration of a resolution which it is alleged was pending in congress in 1908 placing newsprint paper on the free list resulted in the turning away from the republican party of many of the great republican newspapers throughout the nation and in the defeat of mr taft when a second time lie was a candidate for the presidency i point out the fact that if the conversation which the senator from indiana states occurred while he was a member of congress in 1908 and 1909 it must have occurred in 1908 prior to the introduction of the paynealdrich tariff
