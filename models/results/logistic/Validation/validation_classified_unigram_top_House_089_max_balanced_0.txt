proven ineffective and a burden on the american taxpayer at the present time we have committed approximately 300 000 servicemenand no telling how many dollarsto fight the spread of communism in the far east there is no question in my mind that we should be there but i do strongly question the wisdom of conducting a socalled war on poverty at home with funds we should be using to provide equipment and supplies to our military men we in the congress over the past several months have heard much about various shortages in equipment and supplies in vietnam trucks medical equipment and ammunition there has also been considerable talk on the subject of a possible tax increase to cover the added cost of the war in vietnam in my judgment there is no excuse whatsoever for our country to experience either military shortagesor monetary shortages our taxes are quite high enough if we would cut this political shackle from the taxpayer in the presidents budget message this year he proposed sharp cutbacks in our school lunch program and the school milk programthese programs have proven effective for years now yet great society officials say they are interested in helping the poor i am afraid that the only help the great society wants to give to the poor is that which binds them to the great societys political machine the administration claims that it is exercising prudence in its spending yet it asks the congress to provide this poverty bill calling for even greater expenditures than last years program this increase must be covered by the taxpayer when threat of a tax increase is at hand i ask my colleagues to weigh carefully the many pitfalls of this bill the enormous responsibility we in congress have to our servicemen in vietnam as well as our

and forceful senior senator from maine recently testified on the need to reverse the discrimination against new england which resulted from enactment of the appalachian regional development act and other federal policies an excellent summary of the senators remarks was contained in an associated press dispatch printed recently in the nashua telegraph which i offer for the record with these additional comments as i pointed out during the debate on the appalachia bill this legislation is a new departure for the federal government for the first time in our history the congress has approved a major program for the benefit of a particular area under this act funds are siphoned from the rest of the country and concentrated on a favored area for the first time we have a program of special benefits and public works limited to a particular area and from which the rest of the country is excluded regardless of the need in other areas the goal of the appalachia bill is to elevate that region at the expense of the rest of the country whether it will really do so is highly questionable but there is no question as to the expenses to the rest of the country they will be huge and to the extent that the program succeeds it will create within appalachia conditions designed to draw industryand jobs from other parts of the country and to attract new industries in effect the rest of the country is financing its own competition through this program there is thus a real possibility that this program by drawing industries to appalachia from other parts of the country may well create new disadvantaged areas elsewhere it was this reasoning that inspired the republican plan the republican bill forged by the minority members and staff of the public works committee recognized the need for special federal attention to disadvantaged areas but provided that all areas of the country needing attention could qualify for assistance although this program represented a modern approach to new problems it was based on traditional concepts of concern for the entire nation our efforts failed and the traditional concepts were reversed now we are faced with a situation both economic and political in which something must be done for other areas that are disadvantaged the balance must be redressed it appears that the only way to do this is going to be through the establishment of other regional programs this is going to be complicated to work out more expensive than it need have been and politically very involved had the republican alternative to appalachia been adopted none of this would have been necessary i want the record abundantly clear that the republican party opposed this approach and that i took an active part both in the opposition and in the construction of a sound alternative plan so much for the record we failed but the question remains what can i tell my people in new hampshire in new hampshire also part of the appalachian mountain chain there are many disadvantaged areas especially in the northern part our recent history has been one of drastic economic erosion we have seen our textile industry drained away to the south to areas that now are included in the favored appalachian region we too need roadssome 80 percent of the appalachia act is for roadsand flood control projects soil conservation water pollution measures hospitals sewagetreatment plants and the other community facilities that are to be bestowed on appalchia our tax base declines while every level of government is pressing for greater revenues yet federal policies increase our burdens cuts are threatened in vital soil conservation services our fuel oil needs cost more than they should because of restrictions on imports of residual oilanother major concession to the big coal interests of appalachiaand operational reductions are announced by the veterans administration and the internal revenue service our food and clothing cost more in large part because of federal policies on wheat corn cotton soybeans sugar and coffee our fruit growers are threatened with a loss of traditional harvest labor because of the labor departments new restrictions on the use of foreign workers a labor policy that may be right for california is applied against us in new englanda different situation a different problem but treated the same new hampshire taxes help pay for federal subsidies and in common with citizens throughout the land new hampshire people suffer the effects of deficit spending and inflation it is not enough to tell the people of new hampshire that i fought against appalachia and lost of course i must fight to redress the balance we will never object or complain about paying our fair share but the key word is fair we are entitled to fairness and we shall demand it perhaps the great society will pay us no heed we are not powerful politically relative to appalachia which includes some of the richest and most populous states in

jury selection and which have so consistently and correctly enunciated the right of all qualified persons under the 6th and 14th amendments to serve on juries the civil rights law enforcement act of 1966 establishes reasonable standards for determining whether in a particular courts jurisdiction systematic exclusion from juries on arbitrary grounds is being practiced and provides a remedy where such discrimination is found commensurate with the dictates of the 14th amendment noted civil liberties lawyer anthony g amsterdam writing in the university of pennsylvania law review makes a cogent and timely observation concerning contemporary civil rights problems in an article on the removal of civil rights cases to the federal courts he states it is no hyperbole to say that the critical issues of human liberty in the country today are not issues of rights but of remedies the american citizen has had a right to a desegregated school since 1954 and to a desegregated jury since 1879 but schools and juries throughout vast areas of the country remain segregated the right is there on paper what is needed is the machinery to make the paper right a practical protection the constitution is still the constitution and is still the supreme law of the land even in the absence of a practical remedy i am distressed by the untenable assumption of persons who have become so accustomed to relying on court enforcement of constitutional provisions that the absence of an effective remedy is the equivalent of no constitutional right nothing could be further from the truth these rights as the supreme court recently said are present rights they are not merely hopes to some future enjoyment of some formalistic constitutional promise the basic guarantees of our constitution are warrants for the here and now this absence of an effective remedy neither qualifies the right nor impugns the courts which are charged with its enforcement rather it is an indictment of the congress which by virtue of the 5th section of the 14th amendment is directed to adopt appropriate legislation to enforce its provisions insofar as the fair and impartial administration of justice is concerned we are clearly in default on our obligations the fact that some states which have primary responsibility in this area have not done all they could does not mitigate the harshness of this indictment it was just such a situation that the 14th amendment was intended to cure as observed by justice strong in ex parte virginia 100 unitedstates 339 345 1880 some legislation is contemplated to make the amendments 13th and 14th fully effective in the case of strauder v west virginia 100 unitedstates 303 306 307 1880 the justice spelled out the purpose of the 14th amendment and congress role relevant thereto he said this is one of a series of constitutional provisions having a common purpose namely securing to a race recently emancipated a race that through many generations had been held in slavery all the civil rights that the superior race enjoy the true spirit and meaning of the amendments as we said in the slaughterhouse cases 16 wall 36 21 l ed 394 cannot be understood without keeping in view the history of the times when they were adopted and the general objects they plainly sought to accomplish at the time when they were incorporated into the constitution it required little knowledge of human nature to anticipate that those who had long been regarded as an inferior and subject race would when suddenly raised to the rank of citizenship be looked upon with jealousy and positive dislike and that state laws might be enacted or enforced to perpetuate the distinctions that had before existed discriminations against them had been habitual it was well known that in some states laws making such discriminations then existed and others might well be expected the colored race as a race was abject and ignorant and in that condition was unfitted to command the respect of those who had superior intelligence their training had left them mere children and as such they needed the protection which a wise government extends to those who are unable to protect themselves they especially needed protection against unfriendly action in the states where they were resident it was in view of these considerations the 14th amendment was framed and adopted it was designed to assure to the colored race the enjoyment of all the civil rights that under the law are enjoyed by white persons and to give to that race the protection of the general government in that enjoyment whenever it should be denied by the states it not only gave citizenship and the privileges of citizenship to persons of color but it denied to any state the power to withhold from then the equal protection of the laws and authorized congress to enforce its provisions by appropriate legislation to quote the language used by us in the slaughterhouse cases no one can fail to be impressed with the one pervading purpose found in all the amendments lying at the foundation of each and without which none of them would have been suggested we mean the freedom of the slave race the security and firm establishment of that freedom and the protection of the newly made freeman and citizen from the oppressions of those who had formerly exercised unlimited dominion over them so again the existence of laws in the states where the newly emancipated negroes resided which discriminated with gross injustice and hardship against them as a class was the evil to be remedied and by it the 14th amendment such laws were forbidden if however the states did not conform their laws to its requirements then by the fifth section of the article of amendment congress was authorized to enforce it by suitable legislation and it was added we doubt very much whether any action of a state not directed by way of discrimination against the negroes as a class will ever be held to come within the purview of this provision no amount of rhetoric can excuse the continued existence of racial discrimination in the agencies of justice of the various practices that deny participation in the instrumentalities of justice to any one class of citizens because of race or color none is more reprehensible nor more repugnant to our democratic institutions than the denial to serve on grand or petit juries in the words of the court for racial discrimination to result in the exclusion from jury service of otherwise qualified groups not only violates our constitution and the laws enacted under it but it is at war with our basic concepts of a democratic society and representative government smith v texas 311 unitedstates 128 130 1940 the jury is the cornerstone of our system of justice it is part of the established traditidn in the use of juries as instruments of public justice that the jury be a body truly representative of the community this tradition was already long recognized in england at the time the constitution was adopted blackstone in his commentaries says the right of trial by jury or the country is a trial by the peers of every englishman and is the grand bulwark of his liberties this grand bulwark of liberty as blackstone so aptly described it was secured to every american citizen in the bill of rights and was further reinforced by the 14th amendments prohibitions against denials of due process and the equal protection of the laws in case after case since 1880 the supreme court has reaffirmed the basic fundamental right of an accused to trial by jury selected without regard to race the basic questions raised by the court in the very first jury exclusion case more than 85 years ago remain just as unanswerable today i quote it is not easy to comprehend how it can be said that while every white man is entitled to a trial by a jury selected from persons of his own race or color or rather selected without discrimination against his color and a negro is not the latter is equally protected by the law with the former is not protection of life and liberty against a race or color prejudice a right a legal right under the constitutional amendment and how can it be maintained that compelling a colored man to submit to a trial for his life by a jury drawn from a panel from which the state has expressly excluded every man of his race because of color alone however well qualified in other respects is not a denial to him of equal legal protection strauder supra at 309 in subsequent cases the court has held that a conviction cannot stand where there has been discrimination in the selection of jurors whether accomplished ingeniously or ingenuously smith v texas supra at 132 despite the clear and unmistaken mandate of the 14th amendment petitions alleging the systematic exclusion of jurors dot court calendars despite the impressive body of judicial decisions affirming the right of all persons to sit on juries negroes throughout the south are rarelyoften neverfound seated on the jury which actually hears a case with racial aspects griswold 1965 report of the unitedstates commission on civil rights 183 recent events in mississippi and alabama make inescapable the conclusion of racial discrimination in the selection of grand and petit jurors thus in anderson v alabama 366 unitedstates 208 1961 the circuit solicitor testified that no negroes had served on a grand jury in the county for 5 years the secretary of the jury commission stated that none had served on the grand jury for years negro citizens testified that neither they nor to their knowledge any negroes they know had ever served on any juries at the time the latest federal census disclosed that 6 940 white males and 7 956 colored males over the age of 21 years resided in the county from which jurors were selected in united states ex rel goldsby v harpole 263 f 2d 71 1959 cert denied 361 unitedstates 838 reh denied 361 unitedstates 850 1959 the evidence revealed that more than 57 percent of the 15 448 persons residing in the county were negroes of this number there were 1 949 nonwhite males over 21 who thus met the qualifications of age and sex for jury service yet as the court noted none of the officials called as witnessesthe circuit clerk the chancery clerk the sheriff the exsherift who had served 20 years the district attorney or the circuit judgecould remember any instance of a negro having been on a jury of any kind in the county in its 1961 report on justice the civil rights commission states the number of cases is not an accurate index of the problems prevalence since in many areas where racial exclusion of jurors persists the issue is not raised p 92 the reasons it is not raised were voiced by the judges of the fifth circuit comprising the six states of the deep south first conscientious southern lawyers often reason that the prejudicial effects on their clients of raising the issue far outweighs any practical protection in the particular case second such courageous and unselfish lawyers as find it essential for their clients protection to fight against systematic exclusion of negroes from juries sometimes do so at the risk of personal sacrifice which may extend to loss of practice and social ostracism united states ex rel goldsby v harpole supra at p 82 the resulting injustice appears in the fact that negroes convicted of crimes are given the maximum allowable punishment thus a negro convicted of rape is usually given a death sentence while this is rarely the fate of a white man convicted of this offense on the other hand a white man charged with an offense having civil rights overtones walks into court virtually confident of the outcome thus the trials of the persons charged with the murders of lemuel a penn and jonathan daniels resulted in acquittals the trial of the alleged murder of medgar evers resulted in a hung jury on two occasions the trial of one of the persons charged with the murder of viola liuzzo also resulted in a hung jury here again a retrial led to an acquittal the negroes plight in securing the fair and impartial administration of justice brooks no further delay due process and equal protection of the lawstoo long deniedhang in the balance existing federal remedies namely 18 unitedstatesc 243 and 42 unitedstatesc 1983 enacted in the 1870s have had no impact in suppressing the systematic exclusion of minority groups in jury selection although the 1964 civil rights act permits the attorney general to join a jury discrimination suit brought by private persons it does not permit him to initiate a suit this is not enough more much more is needed as the court has said it is not enough to hold out a promise that discrimination will not be practiced the 14th amendment requires that equal protection to all must be givennot merely promised smith v texas supra p 130 for these reasons i am introducing a bill to give vitality to the 6th amendments requirement of an impartial jury this bill would insure not only the accuseds right to trial by a jury selected without regard to race but also the right of all persons regardless of race to sit on juries the

our fellow citizens who are negroes victims of discrimination in every area of human activitybecause of skin colorthese men women and children are truly the disadvantaged of our democracy what is to be the american answer for this problem that pervades every element of human relations shall it be constructive action by the lawmakers of this nation to enforce the guarantees of the constitution regarding civil rights or shall governments response be but an eccentric echo of the voices which cry out for freedom from the despairing depths of deprivation too often those whose hearts and souls cannot accommodate a fundamental belief in the constitutionally guaranteed rights of all americans seek to blunt the arguments and actions others of us use for this purpose by ascribing emotional overtones to them the segregationist will say stripped of emotion you are left with an unjustified attempt to secure special privileges for a certain class of people of course i deny the charge my support of the pending voting rights bill rests squarely on the 14th and 15th amendments to the constitution legislation subsequently enacted to enforce those guarantees and court decisions which have upheld the rights of all americans to enjoy equal protection of the law and to be equal participants in the voting process regardless of extraneous considerations but i do not want to leave out the role emotion does and should have in a contemporary consideration of the legal rights of man we need an emotional and spiritual intensity coupled with our knowledge of what is legally right and sound such a fervor is traditional and has deep roots in the history of this revolutionary nation let us look to the particular situations at which this legislation is directed and let us look into the human indignity and injustice which these shameful practices of voting denial breed our examination should convince us that massive numbers of negroes are being arbitrarily barred from polling places in many sections of the country and that the debasing of american citizens is morally reprehensible there isindisputablyin the findings of every governmental survey an abundance of evidence that negroes in the southern states of this country are effectively restricted from voting the statistics from some areas when compared with official population counts are so alarming as to be almost unbelievable for example the state of mississippi has registered to vote more than 12 times as many whites as negroes yet in the overall population there are fewer than 113 more whites than negroes there are some places in these states where no negroes are registered to vote even where the negro population outnumbers the white population beyond our knowledge of the fact that this kind of voter discrimination does occur we know how it is accomplished in fact it is this awareness of the many and ingenious means which local officials practice that are the target of the bill we now have before us i believe protection of the voting right in legislative enactment is demanded in this congress i believe our product must provide remedies for the patterns and practices of voter denial in as many places as they exist and i believe we must express clearly and convincingly to any who would attempt subtle con tempt of this new law that congress has the will and capacity to react responsibly whenever and wherever the rights of american citizens are restricted my efforts in behalf of effective protections in this field are as old as my service in congress shortly after being sworn in as a member of the 88th congress i joined with a group of my colleagues in the introduction of a civil rights bill that carried various voting right provisions a number of these now are law having been incorporated in the omnibus civil rights act of 1964 in this 89th congress i again have sponsored legislation dealing with federal enforcement of every citizens right to the ballot box on february 24 i introduced h r 5402 to provide for the implementation of voting rights through the appointment of federal registrars later as events in selma ala and other places indicated a need for even greater measures to prevent disenfranchising negro citizens i introduced h r 7259 a multifaceted bill this measure provides principally for the abolition of the poll tax in all elections federal and private triggers for the assignment of voting registrars procedures for registering voters in affected areas election observers for those districts where federal registrars are required protection of first amendment rights and fines and imprisonment for those found guilty of violating these provisions the contents of these two bills which i have introduced fairly represent my conviction as to the power and authority which i believe the federal government can and should exercise in wiping this blot of vote denial from todays society i point this out as i feel it is important to record publicly the legislative elements which i have sponsored and which i seek to support in the action of the house while the bill which the committee on the judiciary has reported for our consideration is not so far reaching in some respects as i would desire it does not contradict the provisions i have sponsored and support therefore i can and shall vote for passage of h r every civil rights matter is basic

project is located in the state of maine the lowcost power from it will be utilized to develop the industrial potential of that state at the expense of other states nothing could be further from the truth he asks if this is a subsidy or an investment the answer certainly is that this is an investment in the resources of maine to the benefit of all our people these multiplepurpose hydroelectric projects are regional developments and in the larger sense are designed to benefit the nation as a whole rather than any particular state or locality nor does it necessarily follow that merely because the industrial potential of maine is developed that of other states is depleted no modern nation in history has enjoyed the tremendous economic expansion and the rapidity of industrial development which the united states has experienced in the past few years and which we all hope will continue in the years to come this unprecedented growth means that all areas which possess the necessary raw ingredients will enjoy the prosperity of increased industrialization it is not a matter of one state developing industry at the expense of another state but rather of providing basic elements essential to the continued industrial development of a region where these elements are available the economy will develop one of these indispensable elements is lowcost electricity the simple truth is that new england electricity rates are the highest in the nation and those of the state of maine the highest of the new england states no sustained coherent and well organized plan has been developed by the existing private power interests to bring about lower cost electricity for the residential commercial and industrial consumers of the region which are paying these rates to the extent that the dickeylincoln school development will make available 694 000 kilowatts of electricity at a wholesale rate lower than that anywhere available in new england at the present time with the possible exception of st lawrence power in vermont it will supply a basic element necessary to revitalize the economy of the area history demonstrates clearly that the advent of lowcost federal power creates an element of competition in the power industry which inexorably results in all power suppliers offering parallel service at lower rates no new england private power company will be put out of business or damaged by the dickeylincoln school project competitionyes but damageno as a matter of fact private power companies located close to federal power dams have enjoyed a rate of growth and a rate of profit which exceeds that of the industry as a whole finally with respect to the specific charge that authorization and construction of the dickeylincoln school project will result in a transfer of industry from southern new england to northern new england i respectfully but urgently emphasize that the plan for this project as envisioned by the department of the interior includes construction by the federal government if necessary of a transmission line from the project site to boston mass the only purpose for including this line in the project plan is to assure the people of all new england states that the benefits of the project will not be limited to maine but will be made available on a regionwide basis there is therefore no merit whatever in arguments and contentions to the effect that the dickeylincoln school project would result in the industrial development of one state at the expense of another there is plenty of peaking power in the project for many statesthere is no intent on the part of any one state to exercise a monopoly on its use for too long new england has complained about the benefits of lowcost power in other regions someone once said

one human being to serve another that kind of story has been written over a period of 75 years in grand rapids mich by the mary free bed guild this is the story of a benevolent group which began its service to god and man by endowing one free bed at blodgett hospital in grand rapids in 1891 and today operates a hospital which cares for both children and adults and is on the threshold of developing a complete rehabilitation complex the people who direct the mary free bed hospital and orthopedic center and all those who have contributed their time and energy to making it what it is today deserve the highest commendation and the gratitude of the entire grand rapids area november will be mary free bed month in the grand rapids area and the story of the mary free bed guild will be retold at that time before this year is out the mary free bed hospital trustees expect to announce their specific building plans for the new rehabilitation complex a brief recounting of the mary free bed story is appropriate here as the guild prepares to celebrate its diamond jubilee during mary free bed month the story begins in 1891 when the mary free bed guild endowed a free bed in blodgett hospital by seeking contributions from all women with the given name of mary after incorporating in 1911 as a benevolent association the guild in 1920 sponsored the first crippled childrens cxii 1621part 19 clinic in western michigan at blodgett hospital in 1921 the guild was instrumental in bringing the first formally trained physical therapist to grand rapids and in 1923 the group had a major role in establishing the orthopedic school in grand rapids in 1927 the guild turned over its crippled childrens clinic to blodgett hospital and in 1930 opened the first childrens convalescent unit of 12 beds the guild moved into the blodgett home for children in 1934 and gradually assumed management and operation of the entire building as the mary free bed guild convalescent home in 1935 this was designated the orthopedic center of western michigan by the michigan crippled children commission the guild continued to expand its activities establishing the mary free bed brace shop in 1938 and the dental clinic in 1942 in 1946 the michigan crippled children commissionmccc designated the guild home as a juvenile amputee training center the guild established stateapproved outpatient and inpatient clinics for cerebral palsy in 1947 and opened a stateapproved rheumatic fever ward in in 1948 the heirs of delos a blodgett presented the deed to the d a blodgett home for children to the mary free bed guild that same year the mccc designated the home a juvenile paraplegic training center the guild established an mcccapproved orthodontic clinic in 1951 in 1953 the guilds institution was designated a hospital with the official name of mary free bed guild childrens hospital and orthopedic center by 1954 the guilds training program for affiliating occupational students from various colleges was well established affiliation with the university of michigan for clinical training of their physical therapy students also had been arranged in 1956 a speech therapy program was established and in 1957 the guild opened a stateapproved unit for tracheotomy cases the guild opened its mary free bed outpatient rehabilitation center in 1960 in 1961 this center was designated by the community planning division as the site for the communitys comprehensive rehabilitation facility the following year the association for the blind and sight conservation the hearing and speech center of grand rapids and the grand rapids rehabilitation league moved onto the mary free bed site as the initial step in providing more comprehensive rehabilitation care at one location in 1963 the mary free bed hospital was accredited by the joint commission on accreditation of hospitals and was approved as a participating hospital by the michigan hospital serviceblue cross this year the guild revised its bylaws to create a new board of trustees composed of 12 men and 12 women and changed the hospitals name to reflect its current role as the mary free bed hospital and rehabilitation complex

committee washington d c dear sir we have read with interest the reports we have received regarding the hearings before your committee on h r 14026 and hr 14222 regarding certificates of deposit and related matters up until now the savings and loan associations in montana have not felt the results of the federal reserve boards decision to permit banks to pay up to as much as 5 on cds as much as savings and loan associations have in other parts of the nation however the effect of the higher rates is finally catching up to us as you will note from the enclosed ad which just appeared in the bozeman paper our associations in montana are generally paying 41 or 4 therefore when banks treat cds as savings accounts at higher rates it is certainly going to effect the flow of funds into our institutions which will in turn make much less money available for home mortgages and what will be available will have to be at considerably higher rates than at present i would like to call your attention to the ad which is enclosed and you will note that they are compounding the earnings every 90 days in other words they are treating the certificates of deposit the same as sayings accounts and i dont think this was the intent when cds were first authorized we could write much in regard to the problems created by the higher rates on cds which would mostly be repeating information which has already been presented by the representatives of our trade association the united states savings and loan league and mr john e horne chairman of the federal home loan bank board i would particularly like to call your attention to the testimony given by norman strunk on may 9 and we wish to endorse everything that he said and urge that your committee take action to provide the federal reserve board with power to revise their present regulations to set a minimum amount for which cds can be issued and to control the rate paid it appears to us that this is immediately necessary to provide relief from this problem of excessive rate competition we would like to suggest that the minimum size cd should be 10 000 with a one year maturity for amounts from 10 000 to 15 000 the maximum rate should be 41 then on cds from 15 000 to 25 000 the maximum rate shouldnt be more than 5 and over 25 000 the ceiling of 5 2 could be permitted unless definite steps are taken to control the issuance of high rate cds the shifting of funds is going to be very detrimental to the savings and loan business because as has been pointed out to your committee the savings and loan business does not have the opportunity to earn as much money as cominercial banks and this is especially true when rates are high and rising as at present our associations still have many loans on the books which are at 441 41 2 and 5 these loans arent very profitable when we have to pay 41 2 or 5 to compete with the commercial bank cds we strongly urge that you give due consideration to this problem and take appropriate action in line with the recommendations of mr strunk and mr horne very sincerely yours paul a johnson president"]]}
