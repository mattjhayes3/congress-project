compulsory socialized agricultureas found in russia and communist chinadoes not compare favorably with the productivity of a free agriculture such as we are trying to maintain in america i think we may well ask the question what can our secretary of agriculture learn from russia and the other communist countries he has announced his intention of visiting some who have seen the notice of the freeman farm tour through communistbloc countries have been unkind enough to ask if secretary freeman could possibly be trying to learn good farming methods from the soviets or if he was making the trip to learn better how to go about collectivizing farms or even more unkindly how to win farmer referendums in view of some of the criticism it might be well for the secretary to make sure proper

the majority side to vote against this legislation in commit tee and i wrote my additional minority views for the report let us review briefly the history of this legislation it originated as the emergency feed grain act of 1961 the bills purpose was to cut down the surplus and to maintain farmer income until we could arrive at a permanent feed grain program the committee did arrive at a permanent feed grain program last year and brought it to the floor of the house i thought it was a good program then unfortunately the members on the minority side said this program was compulsory it was going to force controls upon the farmers which it did it required production controls and provided for price supports and they said vote down this program and we will come out with an extension of the emergency program which is exactly what happened we extended this program last year it had support from both sides of the aisle and i want to point out that that is probably true this year that many of the people speaking against it now would support this same bill after the wheat referendum but i do not find myself in that position it is a bad bill now and on may 22 it will still be a bad bill i want to say further that the wheat program provided for in the referendum is the best legislation produced in the last congress as far as i am concerned i have encouraged my wheat farmers to vote for it they have asked for it the national wheatgrowers association the idaho wheatgrowers association the national grange the farmers union have all asked for this wheat bill if they vote it down now i believe they should be left to the other alternative that is provided in the referendum getting back to the feed grain program you have heard how costly it is that is true it is very costly compared with the results we are getting this program will probably cost over a billion dollars yet any feed grain farmer can plant all he wants to plant as long as we spend this kind of money the farmers are going to accept it and they will not do anything to cut their production back when the bill is read for amendments i shall offer an amendment which i will call a freedom amendment not that it necessarily gives the farmers freedom because in my district they have freedom already the only controlled program which we have is wheat they can plant all the sugarbeets they want to they can plant all the beans alfalfa and barley they want to they can produce all the beef cattle sheep hogs and dairy products they desire but my freedom amendment is going to be freedom for the taxpayers of this country i come from a farm district and i think it is important that we do not pass this billiondollar bill and add that on to our overburdened national debt the other morning i heard over the radio that the interest alone on the na tional debt this year is going to be 10 billion i do not oppose a feed grain program as long as it is a program that is going to require some farmer responsibility and one which will cut down production without depending on a billiondollar subsidy i sincerely hope that this house in its wisdom will vote down this bill if the wheat referendum is defeated we will probably do nothing then if the wheat farmers and the feed grain farmers of america later decide they want sensible legislation our committee will help them enact such farm

departments and administrative agencies substantially affects large numbers of private individuals and many areas of economic and business activity these interests which in the aggregate affect the

matter of fact the temporary conferences created by president eisenhower and president kennedy already made it clear that substantial progress in improving departmental and agency practices can result

government is now preparing to enter into a new round of tariff negotiations over the past few weeks hearings have been held by the tariff commission under the trade expansion act one of the industries in the united states which will be vitally affected by the contemplated negotiations is textile manufacturing for many years now this industry has been plagued by economic conditions which literally threaten its complete destruction it is well known that competition from foreign companies which are able to produce textile goods at a much lower cost than our domestic producers has been a major factor in the deterioration of the economic health of our manufacturers we have seen many plants closed in the past few yearswe have seen unemployment in the industry rise at a most alarming ratewe have seen textile manufacturing become a marginal industry which frequently hovers near the brink of economic disaster i firmly believe that we in congress as well as in the executive department should be aware of the conditions under which our textile manufacturers seek to compete i believe that there must be a recognition that this industry is one of those most profoundly affected by the trade policies that this government adopts for this reason i should like to draw the attention of my colleagues to certain facts which i am sure will amply illustrate the necessity for a thorough reevaluation of our policies toward the import of foreign textiles the rapid increase in the volume of imported textiles is an important element to be considered total imports in fiscal year 1963 for example were nearly 12 times the amount imported in 1948 during a substantially similar period 1947 to 1962 unitedstates exports of textile goods dramatically declined by 69 percent we have become a textile importing rather than a textile exporting country we now import half again as many textile goods as we export despite the fact that in 1948 the positions were reversed in 1961 this trend was accurately recognized by the subcommittee of the senate commerce committee which conducted hearings into the problems confronting the unitedstates textile industry in its report the pastore committee stated examination of longterm trends indicates clearly that we are rapidly approaching a major turning point in the domestic textile industry fot more than 10 years the story has been one of contraction and severe dislocation during this time imports have been rising at first the rise was relatively slow but in recent years it has been accelerated i believe that the figures that i have quoted above are ample evidence of this acceleration one of the main reasons that the foreign manufacturers are able to undersell our domestic producers is their low labor costs particularly in certain eastern countries in 1962 over 75 percent of unitedstates textile imports originated in countries which paid average wages of only 26 cents per hour or less to their textile workers the unitedstates average on the other hand was six times that amount at 1 69 per hour when these low wage costs are coupled with an increasing technology in textile manufacture the ability of these countries to offer ruinous competition with our domestic industry becomes abundantly clear the problem of unemployment in the united states has become almost a staple of discussion the domestic textile industry has been experiencing a severe deterioration in the availability of employment between 1947 and 1963 5750 employment in the mills declined by approximately 29 percent this represents the loss of 350 000 jobs in certain areas where whole communities were dependent upon the continued operation of a textile mill the closing of that mill created a critical concentration of unemployment for example in the new england area textile mill employment declined by 63 percent during this 15year period the unitedstates department of labor has found that there are 2 181 cities and towns in which textile mills are located that the unemployment problem is classified as substantial and persistent the number of textile plants closing their doors has been growing rapidly in the past few years since 1947 no less than 942 such plants have been liquidated they are not located in one particular area of the country however new england and massachusetts mills have been most critically affected pennsylvania has been hard hit certain of the states represented by my southern colleagues have felt that impact of foreign competition and have also experienced a decline in textile mill employment this is not a minor unitedstates industry that i am discussing this is the largest manufacturing employer in the nation the textile industry employs approximately 2 2 million workersthis represents 13 percent of all the manufacturing workers in the united states these jobs are essential to the economic wellbeing of many of our states for example in north carolina and georgia employment in the textile industry accounts for over half of the total manufacturing employment also it is the largest single employer in new england with 13 percent of the total manufacturing employment the economic health of the industry is very poor it has lagged far behind the rest of the economy particularly in the manufacturing area the percentage of profits on sales of textile mill products after taxes has averaged about onehalf that experienced by all manufacturing for the past 10 years the earnings of workers in the mills have declined in relation to the average hourly earnings of workers in all manufacturing in 1950 the textile workers average hourly pay was 85 percent of the average for all manufacturing but by 1961 it had dropped to 70 percent of the national average these are startling facts they cannot be ignored or shunted aside a very important segment of our national economy is experiencing a deterioration which must be halted if there are not to be far more serious consequences it is in a perilous fight for survival against a rising flood of cheaplabor imports it is my hope that the president and the tariff commission will be fully cognizant of the impact that any reductions in tariffs on textile product imports will have even the present tariff levels have not served to prevent the damaging effects of foreign competition they should be revised they should have the effect of equalizing production costs in order that unitedstates producers can compete on a fair and equitable basis following is a series of tables upon which the above

crisis does not make a growing interest in outdoor activities capricious or urging ample provision for them unworthy of the nations concern traditionally the outdoors has been an important part of american lifefirst as a wilderness to be conquered and later as a source of inspiration and recreation= since world war ii however our natural geography has been consumed at a prodigious rate this year alone more than a million acres of the american landscape will be converted to sites for subdivisions shopping centers highways industrial plants and the other needs of an increasingly urbanized and industrialized nation growing demands on land and water resources are diminishing outdoor recreation opportunities people find themselves traveling farther and farther from their homes in search of pleasant uncrowded places to enjoy a walk in the woods or a family picnic or to go swimming hunting fishing or boating national wildlife week which extends from march 15 though march 21 is a timely interval to focus upon our conservation practices and to assess not only how well they are functioning but what additional public and private efforts are needed to assure the benefits of outdoor recreation and wildlife for the american people in the decades ahead i am pleased to bring to the attention of my colleagues two recent articles by ned davis a delawarean and an able conservation columnist for the wilmington del evening journal as an avid and active outdoorsman mr davis recognizes that our citizens face the prospect of more leisure time in the future and thus the challenge of using it wisely and well in his column of february 7 1963 for example mr davis wrote as civilization extends itself a whole generation is growing up without memories of catfishing in a millpond or bullfrogging in a gravel pit or rabbit hunting over a vast area of relative wilderness it is true that the lack of open spaces today has placed limitations on our youth in acquiring knowledge about the tides and how they are affected by winds from different directions or where to find teaberries or where the herring run is best it is unfortunate for it is very important to know where a dirt road runs and how often the tide comes in and goes out mr davis thoughts on wildlife and conservation coincide with the editorial comments in the march 8 1964 new york times which pointed out that the wilderness bill and the land and water conservation fund bill are the two most vital pieces of conservation and recreation legislation before congress this year as the editorial stressed the parks the forests the shorelines the sparkling waters and the wildlife of our outdoor heritage are not merely to be preserved for those who would gaze upon them from some distant horizon these are for the people and for their heirs clearly ned davis reflections on conservation and outdoor activities deserve a wider audience hence i include two of his many interesting columns here for the information of

the house by a vote of 290 to 54 passed the arms control and disarmament act the purpose of the act was to establish the arms control and disarmament agency to explore develop and recommend possible alternatives to the arms race in order to enhance our national security i supported that act and the creation of this new agency for peace the goal for which it was established was reflected in the 1960 republican party platform as follows we are ready to negotiate and to institute realistic methods and safeguards for disarmament and for the suspension of nuclear tests we have deep concern about the mounting nuclear arms race this concern leads us to seek disarmament and nuclear agreements and an equal concern to protect all peoples from nuclear danger leads us to insist that such agreements have adequate safeguards we cannot have adequate safeguards unless we participate knowledgeably in international negotiations dealing with such agreements the arms control agency was charged by congress with the responsibility in this field it cannot carry out that responsibility unless it has the funds to do the research necessary for informed participation in arms control and disarmament negotiations this is essential to our national security the committee on foreign affairs carefully reviewed the agencys research program and concluded that it was justified it also concluded that there were no duplications in agency research at that time i concurred in that conclusion and supported the recommended authorization of 15 million for each of the next 2 fiscal years it seems to me that 30 million for 2 years approximately threefourths of which would be spent for research is a rather modest amount during the course of the hearings it was brought out that the agency realistically believes that general and complete disarmament is not presently attainable in todays world the united states has not entered into any agreements obligating the united states to disarm i want that to be exceedingly clear to the members of this body indeed under section 33 of the arms control and disarmament act no such action could be taken without prior congressional approval the members will find in public law 87297 these words that no action shall be taken under this or any other law that will obligate the united c 1417 states to disarm or to reduce or to limit the armed forces or armaments of the united states except pursuant to the treatymaking power of the president under the constitution or unless authorized by further affirmative legislation by the congress of the united states both the eisenhower administration and the present administration have found it useful to state that the objective we are working for is a limited arms control measure some limited measures have been concluded we now have a direct communication link between the united states and the soviet union that link can reduce the risk of war in times of crises some people think it could increase the danger of war i do not happen to think so although i must say i doubt the word of communist russia in every instance because they have broken their word in every instance but one or two in 1o these many years we have a ban on testing nuclear weapons underwater in outer space and in the atmosphere that ban may begin to clear the air both literally and figuratively top officials from other government agencies including the department of defense pointed out at the hearings that the arms control agency was largely responsible for the hot line agreement and the limited test ban treaty we now have a united nations resolution calling on all nations not to place weapons of mass destruction in orbit around the earth such a resolution calls upon other nations to adhere to the same national policy we have already announced so there have been accomplishments by this agency that we created only 2 short years ago not monumental accomplishments but significant steps for these i think we can all be gratefulgrateful because they do represent progress toward a saner and safer world consistent with the dictates of our national security what the committee bill asks us to do is to provide continuing means to pursue this quest for peace in a manner that will safeguard our national interest that is why i support this authorization and hope it will be supported by my colleagues for these i think we can be grateful because they do represent progress toward a saner and safer world what the committee will ask us to do is to provide continuing funds to pursue this quest for peace in a manner that will safeguard our national interests i would like to call attention to an article which appeared in the newsletter of the state department about this arms control agency i quote the following just prior to the creation of the agency activities in the arms control and disarmament field had been carried on by the unitedstates disarmament administration an element of the department of state whose last administrator was edmund gullion now unitedstates ambassador to the congo but as the arms race accelerated it became more and more urgent that a separate agency be established which could give to our disarmament negotiators continuity of direction could administer the political and scientific research needed for developing sound national security policy on arms control and disarmament and insure the constant and fulltime application of unitedstates resources toward reducing the danger of war one of the important areas in which research has been carried on is the effect it would have on unemployment and on matters that are so close to our hearts these days what would be the effect of a general disarmament we must know we still have time to plan ahead of time i think it is very important that all of the members of this body know what they are really talking about some are talking about the action taken previously to the creation of this agency dates are things that do matter in the judgment of this legislation and i trust most earnestly every one of you will give careful consideration to the actual facts that we will not be doing our thinking on what look like facts but we will dig into them that we will also recognize very very seriously that nothing is to be done unless by treaty or by the aggressive action of the membership of this house and the other body i think there are more safeguards in here than many people appreciate"], [0.0006664395332336426, 0.5006664395332336, 0, "i rise in full support of h r 3881a bill designed to assist state and local agencies not only in planning mass transportation facilities and developing improved equipment techniques and methods but also in financing areawide coordinated systems by means of grants and loans there should be no doubt in the minds of anyone that the continued growth of the national economy is dependent upon adequate transportation in metropolitan areas transportation is the most important single factor determining the nature of future urban areas mass transportation is the key to other forms of transportation however all methods and modes of transportation must be coordinated into an overall system if our metropolitan areas are to continue to progress transportation systems must be planned within the framework of all other urban planning and programing transportation must be an integral part of comprehensive land use and community development for entire urban areaswhether they encompass few or many political subdivisions and jurisdictions the federal obligation to assist state and local bodies is evidenced by many other programs such as urban renewal the bureau of public roads cooperates informally with other agencies concerned with urban planning in the location of new or improved urban highways under the federal aid highway program without such aid many communities would have been unable to finance these activities but highways are only one of the necessary components of an adequate transportation system and plans and programs must be evolved to develop a balanced transportation system consistent with the present needs and future development of the economy this bill h r 3881 will contribute toward resolving many of the most important transportation problems in the metropolitan areas its purpose is not to take over the responsibility of the state and local agencies but to supplement their efforts historically the federal government has aided and encouraged all forms of public transportation from the early days of this nation this bill would extend financial aid to the efforts of state and local agencies in planning the equally important mass transportation facilities in metropolitan areas as we become more and more a nation of urban dwellers the role of transportation becomes increasingly important traffic congestion is not only the concern of the people in the congested areas but also a national concern problems which affect the welfare of some twothirds of our population must be the concern of the federal government in many of the metropolitan areas mass transportation service has declined or disappeared at the same time the population has grown and become more widely dispersed away from the central cities creating the need for increased mass transportation facilities meanwhile the remaining facilities have been deteriorating and service becoming less adequate resulting in still less use of public transportation diminished financial resources have resulted in poor service and inadequate equipment state and local governments are hampered in efforts to solve this problem by constitutional debt limits and diversity of political jurisdictions federal cooperation is needed to help solve problems which cross political and geographic boundaries we do have metropolitan areas but no metropolitan governments this serious problem is not confined to the large metropolitan areas such as new york chicago philadelphia and others but it faces smaller communities and cities as well it has been reported that over 70 cities with populations of 25 000 and over are without any mass transportation service this bill would help these less publicized communities as well as the larger more publicized cities as urban population grows each and every mode of transportation will be needed to facilitate the movements of people and goods mass transportation must provide superior service to gain increased patronage the highway programs the urban renewal projects and all urban planning assistance programs will become more effective with the passage of this bill despite the existence of one of the most highly developed and diversified transportation systems in the world public transportation in the united states has not kept pace with the growth and increasing needs of urban areas the metropolitan areas are the backbone of our national strength their continued growth and consequent contribution to the national economy depend on adequate transportation systems within the areas as well as between them before concluding i would like to bring to the attention of the members the deep concern of the executive director of the port authority of new york at a recent conference of urban transportation mr austin tobin the director reiterated the inability of states and cities to underwrite the capital requirements of mass transportation facilities though they can underwrite operating deficits equipment needs exceed their financial resources and they have a right to expect the federal government to be as interested in moving city workers as in shipping wheat and rock phosphate down the arkansas river i firmly believe that the provisions of this bill are the best and most practical way in which we can help solve this mass transportation problem in this country"], [0.0006793737411499023, 0.5006793737411499, 1, "for the information of the house i might say that two bills on
