have likewise been discussed by other members of the committee and other members of congress there are one or two things regarding the question of proration which i want to discuss that have not been

city at the hearings of the state legislature the same contention was made and the same opposition arose against proration that are being used by the opponents of this measure here the state finally adopted its proration laws it was then the producers of oil commenced to put their oil through hidden pipe lines into interstate commerce and this gave rise to what is called hot oil the state of oklahoma was helpless to protect the owners and operators of oil wells in that pool shortly thereafter the east texas pool was discovered and the same conditions arose there when these conditions arose the governors of the two states got together and commenced the consideration of a character of proration laws which would protect the people which would protect the owners of royalties and the leaseholders it was from this beginning there grew up the law which is now on the statute books of the government no one state by itself could enforce proration without getting into the compact all the oil wells in that field or in that general country therefore kansas oklahoma texas louisiana and new mexico all contiguous states joined in this compact with the result we afterward secured passage of the connally act this is a conservation measure no matter what those who are opposed to it may say all of the owners of the land were receiving royalties of 121 2 percent oneeighth of the oil produced when the hot oil was being stolen from their premises and through pipe lines put into interstate commerce no report was made of it to the state authorities who lost the state taxes on oil in our state a 3percent gross production tax the royalty owners lost all of their interest in the royalty and have never secured it from that day to this this measure concerns the interests of the royalty owners it stabilizes the industry and does not raise the price of the oil that is marketed out in iowa or in any other state or community heretofore when oil was selling for 10 cents a barrel

civil service appeals with power to hear and determine grievances from employees of the character described in section 3 of the amendment it is not proposed to create a board to which all federal employees may go directly with their troubles no matter how minor they may be the classified service has grown steadily during the past decade and will probably continue to increase and hence it appears to be the duty of the government to set up machinery for the consideration of major grievances of employees these relate to removals reductions suspensions to allocations fixing the rate of pay under the terms of the classification act of 1923 and to retirements other grievances are regarded as of minor importance and properly should be amicably adjusted by department officials in other words the purpose of the amendment is to accord employees of the classified service the right of appeal to a board independent of the departments and other agencies with respect to discharge reduction in rank grade or salary suspension from duty without pay and to employees whether or not in the classified service whose positions come under the classification act or who are retireable under the civil service retirement act of may 22 1920 as amended or the canal zone act of march 2 1931 to have the allocations fixing the rites of their compensation under the classification act or their status under the retirement laws reviewed and determined by a board independent also of the united states civil service commission which is charged with the administration of these laws as the agencies which are not now under civil service are classified the amendment will automatically extend to the employees thereof while the civil service act of 1883 was in effect a substitute for the then existing spoils system it left undisturbed the power of departmental executives with respect to dismissals demotions and suspensions from duty without pay the act of august 24 1912 provides that no person in the classified civil service shall be removed except for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service and for reasons given in writing and that the person whose removal is sought shall have notice of the same and of any charges preferred against him and be furnished with a copy thereof and also be allowed a reasonable time for personally answering the same in writing and submitting affidavits in support thereof but no examination of witnesses nor any trial or hearing shall be required except in the discretion of the officer making the removal the act of march 27 1922 42 stat 470 provides that the classified service shall include only those persons who have been heretofore or who may hereafter be given a competitive status in the classified service with or without competitive examination by legislative enactment or under the civilservice rules promulgated by the president or by executive orders covering groups of employees with their positions into the competitive classified service or authorizing the appointment of individuals to positions within such service further the act provides thatthe expression classified civil service as the same occurs in other acts of congress shall receive a like construction to that herein given therefore an employee occupying a position excepted either by law or rule from the provisions of the civilservice regulations may be removed without compliance with the act of august 24 1912 ordinarily persons in positions excepted from the requirements of civil service are not selected on the basis of open competition as is provided for by the civil service act of january 16 1883 they owe their appointments to some extraneous influence chiefly political and hence it would seem proper that the officer who exercises such authority in appointment should also be accorded corresponding power in removal the purpose of the law relating to removals from the classified service was to prevent the discharge of employees whose services were needed but whom there might be a tendency to dismiss because of considerations other than those which would promote the efficiency of the service the removal law does not contemplate the retention of employees regardless of the fact that there is no work to be done nor that there shall be life tenure and that employees who become inefficient or those guilty of misconduct shall be retained the act of august 24 1912 merely defines and establishes the procedure in dismissals of employees from the classified service in no manner does it hinder or prohibit the executive or administrative officer from ordering the removal hence the removing officer remains to all intents and purposes not only the complainant but the judge jury and executioner it is a notorious fact that the power to dismiss is exercised arbitrarily by officials of the government complaints are constant that employees have been unjustly dealt with that experienced and trained men and women with excellent records for efficiency and conduct have been displaced by less experienced and less efficient persons at the whim or caprice of a subordinate official the bill to establish a board of civil service appeals neither curtails nor abridges the authority of an appointing officer to remove an employe nor does it affect in any manner the procedure in dismissals as provided for by the act of august 24 1912 the department head proceeds unhampered against the employee and no question may be raised as to his power to exercise the right of removal the employee concerned may apply for reinstatement termination of his suspension or restoration to his former grade rank and salary as the case may be and if his application is denied by the united states civil service commission or the department whichever has final authority in the matter appeal may be taken to the board of civil service appeals thus the case is allowed to proceed in an orderly manner and final action on the merits is taken on the employees petition for restoration to duty or reinstatement to his former position or grade there has been a persistent demand that congress create a board which shall have power to grant hearings to employees in the classified service who have been demoted suspended from duty without pay or dismissed such board after hearing or investigation to have the authority to restore the salary terminate the suspension or cause the employee to be reinstated if the facts warrant such action the purpose of such legislation is to erect a safeguard against improper unlawful or arbitrary reductions sus pensions and removals through their authorized representatives employees have petitioned that cases of the character mentioned be reviewed by an impartial tribunal and that this duty be lodged in an independent agency established and empowered under the direct supervision of the president to hear and decide appeals from removals suspensions and reductions in its report concerning personnel administration in the federal service the presidents committee on administrative management discusses briefly this problem in the following language the civil service commission has at various times commented upon the complaints that it is constantly receiving from individual federal employees alleging favoritism or discrimination on the part of their official superiors with respect to efficiency ratings work assignments disciplinary actions separations from the service and numerous other matters although the civil service commission at present has little power of review in most of these cases it has on several occasions recommended a considerable expansion of its powers as a board of appeals moreover the establishment of an independent central board of appedls with wide jurisdiction and powers of final settlement of disputes has frequently been urged by employee organizations and other interested parties some of the cases of individual grievances that have arisen in the past have been of so serious a character that there has been little reason to doubt that the services of an impartial central agency could have been used to great advantage in their settlement the cases of arbitrary and outright dismissal from the service because of activity in or as a representative of an employee organization and the equally serious cases of arbitrary removal for political religious or other extraneous nonadministrative reasons obviously fall in this category on the other hand by far the larger number of grievance cases in the federal service are of much less consequence to the service as a whole although important to the individual employees who are immediately affected it would therefore seem of doubtful wisdom to establish a central court of appeals to which each of the more than 800 000 federal employees could go directly with his troubles however minor such a court would be swamped with work it would find it difficult to establish a sufficient basis in fact for its actions and its establishment might readily result in a decline rather than in an improvement in morale and working efficiency the most immediate need in connection with this problem is the general extension throughout the service of the practices and procedures for the settlement of grievances that have been found to be sound and workable in the agencies that have given most attention to the problem in general this means on the one hand that supervisors must be trained to accept the right of individual employees and groups of employees to be represented in the settlement of disputes and grievances by representatives of their own choosing if they so desire and their right of appeal to higher officials if they consider appeal necessary or desirable on the other hand it means that employees and groups of employees must accept the desirability of attempting to settle grievances through established supervisory channels before appealing to the heads of agencies or attempting to bring pressure to bear from outside sources the situation could undoubtedly be greatly clarified and improved by action no more drastic than the issuance of a simple statement of policy in the form of an executive order by the president accompanied by instructions to the heads of the various agencies to establish with the assistance of the central personnel agency suitable procedures for the orderly adjustment and settlement of disputes arising within their respective jurisdictions the procedure in every case should clearly provide for the point at which final action is taken within the agency whether in the office of the head of the agency in the office of his director of personnel or in some special official or committee representing the head of the agency the services of the central personnel agency should be available both to assist the various operating establishments in the installation of suitable procedures for the settlement of grievances and to assist in the settlement of the more difficult types of cases after these important preliminary steps have been taken it is probable that a small residuum of rather important individual cases may remain that cannot be adjusted and settled within the agencies where they arise consideration should then be given to the permanent measures that should be adopted to provide for the disposition of these cases in some cases the problem may be solved with complete satisfaction by the establishment of joint boards of adjustment with equal representation of employees and officials in other cases it may prove better to provide on a permanent basis for impartial boards of adjustment that can be called into session when needed meanwhile the president should have authority to establish special boards of adjustment to hear and decide cases of major importance or should have authority to refer such cases to the parttime federal service personnel relations committee previously proposed the present lack of an orderly procedure for the settlement of major disputes and grievances is highly discreditable to the federal government particularly in view of the extent to which it intervenes in connection with the problems of personnel relations in private industry this lack should be remedied as rapidly as feasible but the remedies must be found through experience education and leadership as much as through authoritative action there are three significant points with respect to the foregoing namely first the thought that the federal government should set up machinery for handling practically every kind and type of grievance the employees may have second the absence of any discussion of allocation appeals complaints concerning which are the most constant and frequent and third the characterization of the present lack of an orderly procedure for the settlement of major disputes and grievances as highly discreditable to the federal government students of government will agree that administrative officers must be held responsible for the conduct of the employees under their supervision and that their authority in this respect should not be curtailed to the point that proper discipline may not be enforced while the employee should be guarded against improper and unlawful discharge or other actions which might seriously affect his earning capacity his misconduct involving infractions of regulations or offenses of similar minor importance should be dealt with for disciplinary reasons by departmental officials in such manner and through such procedures as may be deemed fitting and feasible it is conceded that a central board of appeals to which the army of federal employees could take their grievances of whatever nature or character would be constantly swamped with work the doubtful wisdom of establishing a board with such general powers is likewise conceded but it is submitted that the creation of a central board of appeals with authority limited to the consideration of major grievances would be both wise and expedient the right of appeal to an independent body in removals reductions in rank grade or salary suspensions from duty without pay and in cases concerning the allocation of positions under the classification act and retirement laws would meet all of the objections raised to the present lack of system which the presidents committee describes as discreditable to the federal government and at the same time insure proper control by administrative officers over the employees under their direction and supervision the orderly dispatch of departmental business demands the exercise of disciplinary control which would be impaired seriously were the ordinary and routine conduct of employees not subjected to reasonable and necessary restraint within the department but when the employee presents evidence showing that his removal or other action resulting in the cessation of his wages was unfair improper or unlawful simple justice demands that his case be determined by an impartial tribunal it is the collective judgment of thousands of conservative men and women with long experience in the federal service that an appeal board composed of employees or employees and officials of the same department in which the complainant is employed under the int xix323 fluence of the department heads and certainly with first consideration to their own standing could not because of the human weaknesses to which the flesh is heir give to the facts that impartial unprejudiced free and uninfluenced judgment which fair dealing and true sportsmanship demand be accorded to the complaint of an aggrieved fellowworker whose salary has been stopped or withheld while the presidents committee fails to distinguish the actions which should be appealable by employees to a central board of appeals from those in which conciliatory measures might be applied properly by administrative officers the most significant omission from the list of grievances is that pertaining to the allocation of positions under the classification act the basic demand of employees of the federal service is grounded on their right of appeal from the decisions of the united states civil service commission setting the grade to which their positions have been allocated thus fixing the rate of their pay in the administration of the classification act the civil service commission functions to all intents and purposes as a wage board and as such prescribes under the provisions of the act the amount of compensation which every employee coming under the terms of that law shall receive its decisions are farreaching and by indirection control the salaries of thousands of field employees to whom the classification act does not apply since the departments as a policy pay the same rate of compensation to employees outside of washington as is paid in the departmental service in washington for the same or comparable duties the united states civil service commission has set up an appeal board within its own organization with authority among other things to hear appeals in allocation cases the original classification or as it is commonly referred to allocation of a position under the classification act is made by the personnel classification division of the commission except in a small class of cases the action of this division is not subjected to a review by any official of the commission and hence the decisions of the personnel classification division constitute the decisions of the commission rules of practice respecting allocation appeals require that unless the board of appeals affirms the previous decision the case must be returned to the personnel classification division and if the differences cannot be reconciled the case is submitted to the civil service commissioners for final action in other words the same employee or group of employees of the personnel classification division who were responsible for the original allocation from which appeal is taken participate in the consideration of the appeal obviously no one will seriously contend that under these circumstances the commissioners would not be influenced by the previous decision if the original action is taken by the commissioners themselves there would appear to be no right of appeal worthy of the name left to the appellant employee the employee in an allocation appeal case as in the event of his removal comes to bat with two strikes already called against him what american would assume the hazard or be content to have his appeal decided by the same judge who had rendered the adverse decision against him in the court below without question federal employees are justly entitled to the consideration of their appeals in classification matters as well as other grievances of major importance in the american manner which contemplates a decision by persons who were in no way responsible for or participated in the action that is the subject of complaint the extension of the merit system to positions that are now filled without regard to the civil service act and rules as has been proposed will make for many more complaints from employees who are unjustly denied their day in court the number of complaints in allocation cases alone received annually by the civil service commission fully warrants the creation of a board to consider appeals from the commissions decisions and adding thereto the large number of discharges reductions and suspensions to which objection is voiced constantly it is clear that conditions justify the establishment of an agency charged particularly with the duty to investigate these grievances and to make final decision with respect thereto it may be added that a career service concerning which much has been heard lately is not possible unless and until employees are guaranteed fair and impartial treatment equal pay for equal work and unhindered opportunity for advancement since the united states civil service commission administers the civil service retirement act and act pertaining to the retirement of employees of the canal zone decisions adverse to annuitants should be appealable to a body independent of the commission this amendment to establish a board of civil service appeals is designed to remedy the conditions described in the foregoing and at the same time to lay a solid foundation on which may be builded a career service that will attract welltrained and qualified citizens who are willing to devote their talents to the administration of the public business with full assurance that their retention and advancement in the service of the united states will not be improperly or unjustly prevented or obstructed this is particularly essential if the pending reorganization bill should become a law under such circumstances a civil service appeals board is more vital than ever the great importance of a civil service board of appeals is fully recognized by all who have close contacts with government personnel problems i am a member of the house committee on the civil service and i am quite familiar with the problems of the personnel in the classified service there is at present no suitable opportunity for appeal by employees who become involved in difficulties with supervisory officers except in cases involving such matters as religion or politics and probably nothing would do more to promote harmonious personnel relations in the government service and to eliminate possibilities of friction than satisfactory appeals procedure the very fact that such procedure existed would check most tendencies toward unwarranted favoritism which are a prolific cause of personnel problems the need of an appeals system great at all times is certain to be intensified if and when the reorganization plan is put into effect for naturally this will necessitate many personnel changes even though few if any dismissals may be necessary there will be changes in assignments to duty and numerous changes of status and existence of a sound appeals system would make these changes possible with a minimum of trouble if the appeals system is there employees will have confidence that any changes made are for the best otherwise there will be a tendency to regard them as arbitrary with consequent resentment and loss of morale it need not be emphasized to competent personnel officers that loss of morale might well counteract all the gains that might be made through a better organization of government agencies and better coordination of effort there

congress the point has been raised that the proposed amendment to the reorganization bill authorizing disapproval of executive orders by concurrent resolution by the two houses of congress is unconstitutional on the ground that it vests an executive function in the members of congress by authorizing them to participate in executive action it is true that the supreme court has held that the legislature or members thereof cannot be authorized to perform executive duties thus in springer v philippine islands 277 u s 189 the court was considering a statute of the philippine islands which placed the management of certain government property under the control of a board consisting of the governor general of the philippines the president of the philippine senate and the speaker of the philippine house of representatives the philippine organic act embodied the doctrine of separation of powers in a manner similar to that of the federal constitution and the court held that the management of governmental property being an executive function the legislature could not thus engraft executive duties upon a legislative office since that would be to usurp the power of appointment which was vested in the executive in the springer case however the law involved had already been completely made all the details of the statute had been filled in by the legislature when it passed the law and no details were therefore left to the board to fill in the board merely executed the provisions of the law this is entirely different from the case where congress in the statute declares its general policy and delegates authority to fill in the details of the statute to another officer in the latter case the provisions of the law are not complete and the officer to whom the power is delegated consequently is exercising quasilegislative power in filling in the details the principle of the springer case therefore has no application to the question involved in the propo3ed amendment my amendment would not confer upon the congress a power which is executive in the constitutional sense but would delegate to a majority of the two houses a quasilegislative function namely the power to pass upon the executive orders of the presidentto participate in filling in the details of the reorganization law as enacted by congress this is an entirely different type of power from that involved in the springer case the supreme court has indicated in humphreys executor v united states 295 u s 602 that where congress delegates to an executive or other officer the power to fill in the details of a statute within the limits of the policy prescribed by congress that officer is not exercising executive functions but rather those which are quasilegislative in character thus in the humphreys case the court held that the functions of the federal trade commission were quasilegislative and not executive it also indicated that the functions of the interstate commerce commission with respect to the fixing of rates and so forth were quasilegislative and not executive similar principles are laid down in morgan v united states 298 u s 468 in the latter case the court held that the functions of the secretary of agriculture in fixing maximum rates to be charged by market agencies for buying and selling livestock under the packers and stockyards act were quasilegislative the court said it is a proceeding looking to legislative action in the fixing of rates of market agencies and the order is legislative 0 under the principles of these latter two decisions therefore it is apparent that the president under title i of the bill and likewise the majority of the two houses of congress under the proposed amendment will be exercising quasilegislative powers which are not of

purpose is to take post exchanges out of the business of virtually running department stores in competition with local merchants the senate stood out stoutly for its amendment but the house conferees felt that if the change were generally effective a real injury might be done to patrons of exchanges at isolated posts as a way out it was suggested that in order to avoid the imposition of any hardship upon service personnel the secretary of war should have authority to pursue a more liberal policy as to exchanges conducted at posts isolated from a convenient market and the action we are

activity because of the loss of the akron and the macon regrettable as these losses were no one has suggested that heavierthanair activity should be stopped because of disaster after disaster in the early days of aviation nor even today is the same thing suggested because of the unfortunate series of passengerairplane losses according to admiral leahy previous experimentation with the use of lighterthanair craft has been confined to scouting duties in connection with the fleet but other fields especially the use of lighterthanair ships as carriers for bombing planes remains to be developed a surface airplane carrier costs a minimum of 50 000 000 at approximately the same cost we could construct 10 lighterthanair dirigibles each capable of longrange movement at double the speed of a surface carrier and in all probability adding exceedingly to the effectiveness of our fleet this relatively small authorization for lighterthanair will enable our navy to develop lighterthanair craft and to determine whether or not the genius of american inventors and american design can do for this field of transportation what they have done for the airplane and the automobile commander rosendahl of lakehurst possibly the bestposted man on lighterthanair in america today came before our committee last year and made the statement that one airplane carrier cost 50 000 000 this airplane carrier would take care of 80 planes he stated further that 10 rigid ships or dirigibles can carry 8 bombing planes apiece and these dirigible ships would cost 5 000 000 each he stated that these rigid ships can become fighting units of the fleet he stated further that the dirigible or rigid airship has not been tried out at all the los angeles built in germany many years ago is still over at the hangar in lakehurst the hindenburg would be flying still if it had been using helium instead of inflammable gas some few years ago while the germanbuilt ship was cruising off the coast of south america specifically off the coast of chile captain eckener held his ship off that coast for 3 days while a revolution was going on in chile when the revolution was over he brought the ship in how can

commerce of america but for the transportation of mail in america as well as for military distress by aiding the development of lighterthanair ships the airship when properly built and properly constructed can be used as an airplane carrier it can carry anywhere from 12 to 25 airplanes according to the size you are building why not have an airplane carrier on land as well as on sea i believe we should help private capital to invest private capital is waiting for the government to give some inducement for it to go into the manufacture of lighterthanair ships for the last 17 or 18 years the government has turned thumbs down on the development of such aircraft in america and this is why private capital has not been invested in the development of the lighterthanair craft if this amendment
