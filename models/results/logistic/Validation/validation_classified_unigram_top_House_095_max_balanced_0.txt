minority member of the committee on aging i am profoundly supportive of the provisions of section 8 which provide for reduced air fares on a spaceavailable basis to persons 60 years of age or older and retired persons 65 years of age or older and to handicapped persons and their attendants a comprehensive review of this provision has been conducted during the 94th and 95th congresses by the subcommittee on aviation of the committee on public works and transportation i wish to take this opportunity to commend the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee mr anderson and the distinguished ranking minority member mr snyder for their leadership and dedication in providing the elderly and handicapped the accessibility to long distance travel which will be resultant from the enactment of this legislation the committee on agings review of the transportation problems of older americans revealed that the most expensive mode of transportation for the elderly is commercial air travel in todays mobile and transient society many elderly persons find themselves isolated by great distances from the homes of their families and from specialized medical facilities less expensive alternative modes of travel are often nonexistent for the elderly especially for those residing in inaccessible rural areas the committee on aging found that in hawaii where specialized medical care is located at various sites throughout the islands the state attempted to respond to the transportation problems of the isolated elderly by instituting a reduced fare for those aged 65 and over on a spaceavailable basis one airline reported a 340percent increase in the number of senior citizens they were able to accommodate as a result of the fare reduction unfortunately this reduced air fare for the elderly no longer remains in effect because the carriers faced legal challenges to the special fare provision from the civil aeronautics board the majority of todays retirees rely on social security benefits or pension plans for their sole source of income in 1976 for instance when the median income for all families was approximately 15 000 per household the income for households headed by an individual aged 65 or older was less than 9 000 per year moreover approximately 15 percent of those persons living at or below the poverty level in 1976 were aged 65 or over transportation represents the third largest expenditure for older persons whose incomes are also eroded by the rising costs of food health care and housing in the committee on agings 1976 report senior transportation a ticket to dignity it was revealed that only about 5 percent of the passengers on a major airline were aged 65 and over despite the fact that this group of persons represents over 10 percent of the population the most expensive mode of transportation for the elderly is air travel which is underutilized as a result of limited disposable income the recent history of congressional interest in providing reduced air fares for the elderly and handicapped suggest the need for expedient enactment of this conference report the house passed legislation designed to provide reduced air fares on a space available basis to the elderly and handicapped on september 21 1976 by a vote of 400 to 1 and again on february 22 1977 by a vote of 403 to 0 the reduced air fare provision was contained in other aviation legislation packages which passed the house on september 30 1976 and june 8 1977 while i commend the committee on public works and transportation for their continuous efforts to enact this legislation congress

may or june then this august conversation was at least the second time that congressman eilberg was brought to mr civilettis attention as possibly being involved in a transaction that might be the subject of an investigation this in turn would make the november 25 1977 discussion with mr baker at least the third time that mr eilberg was a topic of sensitive discussion with mr civiletti august 26 1977 mr cordial pleads guilty to obstruction of justice september 15 1977 convicted witness charles cordial advised special agents bird and foster f b i washington d c of mr elko obtaining federal funds for hahnemann hospital and agreed payoff to mr elko and mr fleming for their efforts in obtaining federal funds approximately september 20 1977 mr baker returned from philadelphia where he met with a number of people including the philadelphia strike force joel friedman and neil welsh the highly respected f b i agent in charge of that office he was urged by mr welsh to report back to washington that philadelphia was a cesspool of corruption that marston was doing an excellent job and that it was important to retain him mr baker reported this to mr civiletti and to mr egan clearly then mr civilettl was made aware that philadelphia was a hotbed of political corruption in need of conscientious prosecution of the political corruption cases mr welchs recommendation combined with mr civilettis march 1977 recusal in the unitedstates vs fineman case in philadelphia might well have put mr civiletti on notice that there might be some real merit to the information he had heard by this time at least once and possibly twice about congressman eilberg october 19 1977 mr elko and ms brislin were convicted in the west coast trade school case in los angeles mr david hinden was the assistant united states attorney and prosecuting attorney on that case mr fleming testified as the principal government witness against elko october 20 1977 mr dowd flew out to los angeles and met with mr elko and ms brislin in the law offices of mr alan may mr dowd raised the subject of hahnemann hospital as one of the areas about which he believed elko could provide information mr dowds source of information was mr fleming a business associate of sorts of mr elko october 25 1977 the f b i in philadelphia under neil welchs direction opened a case on hahnemann hospital november 4 1977 congressman eilberg called president carter urging him to remove david marston as united states attorney he informed president carter that marston was prosecuting too many democrats november 4 1977 mr baker signed off on a request for immunity for mr elko and ms brislin this was done in conjunction with mr dowds strike force 18 and mr friedmans strike force in philadelphia we have learned through testimony that an immunity grant requires as a final step the approval of the assistant attorney general this is required by law 18 unitedstatesc 6003 et seq now mr civiletti was somehow unavailable on november 4 1977 and according to testimony mr baker authorized these grants of immunity the contents of all the paperwork accompanying the request for immunity is significant one document indicates that mr fleming had said that mr elko would be able to testify about hahnemann hospital there is a detailed paragraph on that subject so we have a situation then where mr baker has heard hahnemann hospital mentioned to him or a transaction concerning congressman eilbergs firm or both in august he again heard in september that philadelphia was a cesspool of political corruption furthermore according to testimony from mr dowd and mr baker they met quite cften frequently bypassing the chain of command in the organized crimestrike force section therefore it is possible that mr dowd may have mentioned his work and most probably his trip to california to interview mr elko to mr baker mr baker then was reviewing immunity documents that touched upon a subject that was quite familiar to him by november 4 that is hahnemann hospital and it is not impossible that he may have made the necessary connections in his mind between hahnemann hospital and the transaction involving congressman eib o there is also a curious aspect about this november 4 immunity grant we know from mr civilettis log that he was in the department of justice during that day in fact according to mr bakers records and mr civilettis logs he had on that very morning called mr baker in for a meeting now this was the first time that mr bakers calendar reflected a request by mr civiletti to see him generally they have both testified they caught each other in passing and met informally but this date was somewhat different we also have a conflict between testimony and documents on this point mr civiletti does not recall requesting a meeting with mr baker in fact he testified that they did not meet that morning mr baker does not recall a meeting but his log reflects a meeting at 9 35 with mr civiletti mr civilettis log shows baker at 9 35 and is again listed at 10 00 what did they meet about or what did civluetti plan to discuss with mr baker and did mr baker bring up the subject of the immunity grant at that time none of these questions were answered to my satisfaction one might guess though with as sensitive a matter as this that mr baker may well have mentioned the reouest for immunity to civiletti and even if he didnt bring it up that morning it would still seem important enough that at some later time mr civiletti would have been indeed should have been briefed on the elkobrislin immunity november 4 1977 mr elko subpoenaed to philadelphia grand jury november 7 1977 dr holmes of hahnemann hospital interviewed by f b i in philadelphia november 7 or 8 1977 president carter calls attorney general bell urging judge bell to replace mr marston because among other reasons marston was presecuting too many democrats according to the attorney generals testimony mr civiletti was probably apprised of this conversation with the president shortly after it took place november 7 1977 a philadelphia grand jury heard testimony from mr elko november 10 1977 a washington d c grand jury heard from mr elko surely elkos testimony did not go unnoticed by anybody in the justice department at the very least mr friedman in philadelphia and mr dowd in washington were aware of what was going on november 13 1977 united states attorneys conference in washington d c mr marston met with associate attorney general michael egan mr egan told mr marston about the pressures from on high to replace him describing congressman eilberos phone call to the president november 14 15 16 1977 mr elko was in mr dowds office along with assistant united states attorney david hinden and other f b i agents during debriefings mr elko mentioned hahnemann hospital and congressman eilesg somebody either mr hinden mr dowd or an f b i agent showed mr elko a piece of paper dated june 1976 which detailed various job options for mr elko one notation indicated a sum of 50 000 to be paid mr elko by congressman eilbergs law firm the eilberghahnemann hospital connection was discussed though not in detail there is another conflict in testimony on this point mr dowd specifically denied that mr elko had discussed congressman en berg or hahnemann hospital on november 14 15 or 16 he also had no recollection of using papers visual aids or diagrams in debriefing mr elko contrast this with mr hinden who was quite certain that the subject of emberg and hahnemann hospital had come up in november and that mr elko had been questioned on these dates about a document which contained a reference to congressman eilbergs law firm november 25 1977 mr baker met with mr civiletti a meeting which mr civiletti does not recall but significantly does not deny mr baker informed him at this time that the eilberg case is alive as mr bakers notes reflect in addition mr civiletti was informed of the conversation from on high to replace mr marston and the fact that mr marstons office was conducting an investigation into congressman emlber this was not a casual comment this conversation called for some direction from mr civiletti as to how the criminal division should follow up on this possible criminal act by a congressman mr civilettis response to tell egan is entirely unsatisfactory coming from the head of that division mr egan after all has nothing to do with the criminal division his job is replacing united states attorneys mr civiletti should have seized the reins and directed further investigation into congressman eilbsos call as a possible attempt to obstruct justice in addition to alerting mr egan and the attorney general to this sensitive matter december 9 1977 intensive discussions focusing on hahnemann hospital and congressman eilberg took place during the debriefing of mr elko these are reflected in the f b i 302s taken during those sessions the debriefing sessions continued throughout december through january 3 1978 according to mr hindens testimony how does one reconcile the testimony of mr hinden and mr dowd mr hindens testimony is that as early as november 14 15 and 16 mr elko was discussing congressman eilberg and hahnemann hospital mr dowd has testified otherwise in fact he has said that on these dates there was no mention of either eilberg or hahnemann but this is not the only significant difference between mr dowds perceptions of the elko debriefings and those of mr hinden mr hinden testified that on december 9 intensive discussions were underway in washington in fact these discussions took place in mr dowds office in the presence of f b i agents one of the subjects brought up and described in detail was congressman erlbergs involvement with hahnemann hospital discussions which are reflected in f b i 302 notes mr hinden went even further in his description of these debriefings when he said that they continued in an intensive fashion from the beginning of december until january 3 1978 mr dowds testimony is otherwise according to his recollections the first date upon which he had facts connecting congressman eilberg to hahnemann hospital was december 19 fortunately this conflict in recollections can be resolved by reference to the f b i 302s which were taken during debriefings of elko at which mr down was present if not actively participating which corroborate mr hindens testimony this is relevant to our inquiry into what mr civiletti knew and when he knew it because it has a very direct bearing on mr bakers notes of the november 25 meeting with mr civiletti at which time he reminded mr civiletti that there was no change in the status of congressman eilberg and that the eilberg case is alive if as mr hinden has testified mr elko had mentioned congressman eilberg and hahnemann hospital on november 14 15 and or 16 then it is that much more likely that there was real substance to mr bakers notes that the eilberg case is alive after all by that date the f b i in philadelphia already had an active case on hahnemann hospital the unitedstates attorneys office in philadelphia was involved in that investigation and john dowds strike force 18 was also involved in aspects of the hahnemann case in the final analysis mr hindens testimony makes mr bakers testimonythat he discussed an eilberg case with mr civilettithat much more believable this outline could most certainly be expanded to include other pertinent events during the latter part of december and in january including of course the dismissal of david marston as united states attorney january we all know is the month in which the president held a press conference at which time he was asked about mr marston and congressman eilbergs phone call it was shortly thereafter that the president revised his previous posture on the marston matter january was also the month in which mr marston notified the attorney general by letter dated january 9 1978 that principal defendants in political corruption cases were eager to have marston removed and viewed that event as a remedy for their less than desirable lots we also know that mr dowd briefed the attorney general and many other individuals on january 16 on the investigation involving congressman eilberg and that beginning on that day and continuing for one week the office of professional responsibility conducted a superficial investigation intended to clear the president and attorney general of wrongdoing the attorney general himself testified that the inhouse investigation by the office of professional responsibility did not go far enough and that at the very least mr moore and mr cable in the white house should have been interviewed while the details of all the events of december january and february concerning the marston affair are not developed in this summary outline that is not to say that they cxxiv 780part 10 are not relevant to the general questionwho knew what and when however insofar as my evaluation of mr civiletti to be the deputy attorney general of the justice department goes the aforementioned events are the material ones based upon this chronology it was my conclusion that the department of justice had enough information by november about an eiiberg case to have put the attorney general and the president on notice that mr marstons office was investigating sensitive matters surely touching upon one if not two congressmen both of whom had repeatedly insisted on the replacement of mr marston a quick review of all the events that occurred prior to november 25 support my conclusion that mr baker did meet with mr civiletti on november 25 as mr baker has testified and furthermore mr civiletti was told about the eilberg case on that date in finding mr bakers testimony more credible than mr civilettis i am not accusing mr civiletti of lying i have said during these hearings that his memory is a highly selective one and i will stand by that i arrived at this conclusion after an evaluation of the most reliable evidence in this case i am impressed by a combination of factors including but not limited

reported by the committee on education and labor while there sre a few problems with this bill which i am sure will be addressed by the vprious minor amendments of my distinguished colleagues and myself i believe that the work of the committee has been thorough and careful of particular note is the committees consideration of the issues surrounding the formula by which funds will be distributed under title i of esea the committees support for the ford jeffords amendment for the distribution of fund increases under part a basic grants to local education agencies of the act means that the distribution of funds under the act will increasingly reflect the latest accurate knowledge of where poor children live in this country in particular the committee has recognized the importance of using the most recent available data for estimating the number of poor children in the country in this case the 1976 survey of income and education sie which is acknowledged to be significantly more accurate than the now badly outdated 1970 census the committees endorsement of using the sie data means that we have recognized the need to direct funds to where the need is now rather than to where the need was in 1970 as the committee report makes clear the most significant finding of the sie is a shift in the distribution of the poor from the south and west northcentral states toward the northeast and great lakes regions the importance of dealing with this redistribution of the poor now rather than waiting another 5 years is clear the recently published annual budget review by the brookings institution setting national priorities the 1979 budget endorses this view furthermore assuming that the new data are broadly accurate not to use them would be irresponsible as a practical matter it is sensible to being adjusting now to the changing distribution of poverty rather than wait for the 1980 census and a probably much larger and more difficult redistribution pp 99100 the sie data do have the expected limitations associated with a survey rather than a census there is a certain amount of error in the data however the committee has gone far to correct any possible inequities arising from this error by providing that states which seem to lose badly through use of the sie can ask for a special count of their children in poverty population compared to the use of the 1970 census 20percent sample the sie data do achieve the broad accuracy mentioned in the brookings study a department of health education and welfare report entitled estimating children in poverty which was mandated by section 822 of the education amendments of 1974 concludes that on balance in any case the sie is generally be~leved to provide the more reliable estimate of children in poverty for 1975 the limitations of the sie survey both in terms of of the sampling variability and the possible survey error are found to be small relative to the changes in poverty since the 1970 census in addition the committee has wisely recognized the problems inherent in defining poverty the other important factor in the formula therefore money distributed under the siebased formula will use 50 percent of the national median income for a family of four as a poverty benchmark this definition includes persons in many areas of the country who are in fact poor but who would not be counted as poor under the current definition the orshansky poverty index the composite formula which is contained in the bill will balance the various factors which must be kept in mind when considering a title i formula the difficulty of defining poverty and its distribution around the nation the need by local school systems for some stability in allocations from year to year and the need to see that funds are directed to areas which appear to be in greatest need the formula amendments which the committee adopted will affect an increase of about a net 208 million in part a funds proposed by the president and future increases thus no state will ever lose funds compared to what it has been receiving this is in sharp contrast to the result of the 1974 debate over the formula when a number of states suffered sharp declines in their title i funding declines from which they are only now recovering none of us wishes to see the results of the 1974 battle repeated for any region of the nation

1979 the congress added 27 more new starts the impact of these extra projects on the 1979 budget is very small hardly noticeable in terms of the total federal budget but they will add 1 8 billion to future budgets and here is where our concern should lie congress has been in the habit of starting new programs and proj ects with very small initial costs but much larger costs in future years i have no doubt that many of the new water projects added by congress are needed but i also have grave doubts that all 27 are needed immediately therefore i cast my vote to sustain the presidents veto i hope that the appropriations committee will make some prudent decisions on the order of priorities for these projects and report to this house a more moderate bill the president has properly expressed concern about future budget impact but it is the responsibility of congress to set the priorities for spending taxpayers money it is our failure to make prudent choices that causes vetoes now as in the past g"]]}
