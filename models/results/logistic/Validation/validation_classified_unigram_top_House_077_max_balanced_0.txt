more prosperous it will be congress seems to have been successfully etherized and we will apparently not have regained consciousness until some more blanket authority shall be demanded by the president he has succeeded in gathering in the executive department so much of legislative power that i expect that he will not need more money or additional authority for some time to come i interrupted the gentleman from georgia yesterday to remark we do not see democracy working we see democracy being worked the democratic party has drifted far from its ancient moorings it still celebrates birthdays of its old heroesbut to what end jackson day dinners at 100 apiece simply to get all the jack possible out of jackson nothing else jefferson is seldom quoted in these latter days defense measures and foreign affairs seemingly occupy the full attention of the administration which has administered an anesthetic to congress lest we meddle even with our domestic affairs however this is the critical moment to do those things necessary to restore and strengthen the public faith in the nations credit it is a little hearteningis it not to know that there will soon be a tax bill which will restore a little confidence to those investors who fear that the nation is already lost in a vortex of debt never before has the congress found the public more ready to accept higher taxes cheerfully they know it is now necessary however some suggestions from those high in authority are rather frightening to me secretary morgenthau says that the simplest and easiest way would be to raise all present taxes by onethird how comforting to that citizen in the 76percent bracket to learn he will pay 102 percent wonderful reasoning is it not when that word goes out i think many will say i will keep my money in the bank as long as such a large percent is to go in the kitty however these taxpayers in the 76percent bracket will probably not be touched by the new tax bill their present tax is highway robbery already we heard the appeal from the secretary of the treasury mr morgenthau in the movies lately he said that the united states credit is now as always the best in the world may i leave my argument for a moment may i say to my colleagues that i know how restless they are they do not wish to listen to comments certainly i have as much attention as other speakers and i should not complain the anesthetic has done its work i was speaking of what secretary morgenthau said to the people of this country through the medium of the movies buy a share of the united states but when you buy a share of the united states you know full well that you are buying a share of the united states debt not a share of united states assets we saw the picture of the enormous sheet of stamps and the bonds of small denominations being printed to be offered to the general public slogans of doubtful value will soon be on the air i read one the other daydid you read it buy baby bonds for baby little tootsie should grow up in the national debt will those making an appeal for the purchase of these bonds now spend less for nondefense purposes i saw an editorial in the washington post this morning assuring us that those former methods of appeal would not be adopted only a very polite invitation to buy will be given without any special ballyhoo they do not wish to stir up the public lest it start to ask questions are we to give up anything no says the handsome bronzed mcnutt in that manner did the newspapers describe and quote him very recently speaking undoubtedly for the administration he stated in effect no it is not necessary for us to give up any of our social gains labor will not be hampered in the slightest and he proceeded to ridicule these strikes as important or dangerous again the handsome bronzed mcnutt whom i suppose the ladies because of his attractive personality will be more easily persuaded than will the men to believe and to follow let us beware of these personalities who so take possession of ones reason indeed let us beware of the pied piper who already has captivated by his pending sprees and led us to the very brink of national bankruptcy will the appointment of harry hopkins bring confidence to these people who are asked to invest in united states securities he scattered billions like chaff to the winds with little reference to need all wealthy communities have had their full and complete share and even more since they could meet the bond conditions while poor communities could not make the required contributions but he said spend and spend and we will elect and elect he also said tax and tax but to him elect and elect was more important there were w p a votes even if only a few in every wealthy community and those votes had to be garnered will the appointment of hopkins lend confidence to our people when it comes at a moment when the national credit hangs in the balance such an appointment as this is no ray of sunshine to me and how careless the president is in his statements would not you democrats give anything if he could withdraw this statement what of our national debt do we not owe it to ourselves then there is his later reference to the silly dollar sign does that not send the shivers up and down your backs when you contemplate the national debt suppose you have eight brothers one has money and he lends to the other seven and loses it all that is all right you see it is all in the family will you accept even this as comforting but this large family of 130 000 000 people of the united states may look at this as something quite different we all know that this administration has 4 long years to go and we look to the future with confidence far from unshaken am i trying to sell america short oh no it is a marvelous country all its tangible assets will be left i am only suggesting that those who have must part with what they have but other people will have the tangible assets of course the country will recover will the president reassure his people that he has changed he easily changes can we now believe dorothy thompson may be right what a change she sees in him after harassing him for 7 or 8 years now she declares that she sees a new president there is a little hope in my own heart that he may indeed turn and go the other way he has done it before we need only hark back 6 months after he took office when he turned and went in absolutely the opposite direction he did so many things which he promised he would not do if it were not for the words of abraham lincoln ringing in my memory i could never forgive him and i suppose this must apply to all of us it is stated that abraham lincoln saidi quote from the historians book called the age of hatethatif i found a solemn promise that i had made to the people that had finally proven itself to me that it was harmful to the people i would break that promise i think a promise would be broken by abraham lincoln only under great stress of circumstance his promises would not have been constantly broken and he would not have been blown around by every wind of doctrine i hope dorothy thompson is right i had been getting rather tired of reading her articles but i will have to follow her more closely to see if she can continue to maintain this viewpoint this president of ours has fed fat his grudges against business now these business and industrial leaders are the men on whom he has to depend to meet the national emergency in order to induce the public to buy this huge amount of bonds we must cheerfully endure greatly increased taxation to maintain the nations credit confidence is the first thing to be restored up to this moment there has been no indication whatever that there is to be any cessation of spending the gentleman who just preceded me the gentleman from massachusetts and he placed his speech in the record on yesterdaysays that w p a must not be curbed your committee on appropriations during the entire session to date has seen gunpowder even in all nondefense appropriations everything is tied to defense and except for w p a no nondefense appropriations have been curtailed and now we know that in the end these will not be curtailed the last 7 years we have had sledgehammer blows of taxation sledgehammer blows have been inflicted upon business by bureaucratic control all this is in contrast with a willingness to grant to labor all its demands in full certainly these things do not make for confidence rather do they inspire doubt and fear we granted the president enormous powers in the emergency crisis he has not consented to give them up and be cause of the large though dwindling majorities he has received in election we have not dared to take away from him a single one of those powers it is very evident that once clothed with power he will not give it up it must be taken from him but confidence will not be restored as long as the sword of damocles hangs over the head of the monetarysituation on december 30 1943 to my utter amaze ment and perhapsto yours the federal reserve boardwhose members this president appointed and who were political appointments always within his controlthis board buttressed by the entire board of governors of the federal reserve united unanimously in recommending to this congress the taking away of those powers up to this moment not a sign of activity by the banking committees of either branch of congress has been shown why they are awaiting a nod from that dictator president of ours how did he get such control over this congress should we not now move and move quickly to put into effect such persuasive recommendations are we still under the impression that public opinion and that the populace trusts only the president how foolish we are if we think that twentytwo million people and the solid south do not blindly follow him most southerners voted for him merely because they are democrats but they are not with him no most of them agree with the speech made yesterday by the gentleman from georgia most of them like to have us speak for them they are not with roosevelt and the new deal policies but they are not with the republican party either they never will be probably they saw nothing to be gained by joining the republican pairty so they simply voted democratic that is all what are those recommendations of the federal reserve board to which we have paid not the slightest attention the power to devalue gold expires this june they say do not renew it they recommend that no more paper money should be issued against silver bought from foreigners that there should be no more money issued against the seigniorage of silver which is the difference between the bullion and the minted coin value bullion valued at thirtyodd cents an ounce and coined at 1 29 black magic they also suggested the repeal of the power to print 3 000 000 000 which if taken advantage of would send the shivers down the spine of any monetary authority and those who are watchful of the beginnings of that operation they recommend an increase in the legal reserves to any required or necessary amount to prevent possible infla tion and lastly that a stop be put to selling bonds to commercial banks how often i have taken the floor on that sub ject we are now told that the baby bonds cannot be transferred they will have to be canceled over by the treasury if sold or redeemed the treasury is beginning to see the light because if these bonds could be transferred they would get into the banks and then the banks could issue money against them sale to commercial banks is a highly dangerous proceeding but it has been allowed to go along so long that now more than 47 000 000 000 of money is available for inflationary spending unless it is curbed why do we sit here dumb because secretary morgenthau supported i am sorry to say by administrator jesse jones has replied to those recommendations phooey morgenthau must sell bonds he scents the danger of inflation he wants plenty of money available for his purposes he wants the banks to have plenty of money to buy the bonds if he cannot sell them to his public the president does not want to give up these powers is he clothed with greater monetary authority and knowledge than the federal reserve board of experts selected by himself when it comes to a point that he will not take the unanimous advice of a board like that he is assuming to himself an omniscience which i hesitate to think any man would dare assume i am talking a little today about the nations credit and i want to say to you that we should restore confidence to that public which is asked to invest its savings public opinion is only what you think other people are thinking public opinion will be moved by what we do and by our statement of intentions you are the leader of public opinion in your district and you are not to sit idly by until your president or any other pied piper makes your public believe something they ought not believe we cannot assure ourselves by saying my public wants it and therefore i will vote for it the truth about these financial matters is greatly stretched the truth hurts and so would you if you were stretched so much i am sorry that my friend the gentleman from texas and my friend the gentleman from california are not here this afternoon one of them said he certainly would be here beware of these money doctors these sincere but misguided colleagues who are advocating printed money more black magic we are all very much appreciative of our friend the gentleman from california he is greatly overworked he is very thoughtful and conscientious as no other man he wants to find a way out but let him beware that he does not fall a victim to highly dangerous theories"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.9692556262016296, 0.9692556262016296, 0, "iask unanimous consent to take from the speakers desk the bill

break down this large group of 1 700 warehouses in the interior which are essential to the cotton industry because it is these warehouses that the cotton growers must rely upon to render the service that is necessary to the sale of the product and instead will result in building up these few large warehouses in the port cities which are not in a position to render service to all the farmers which
