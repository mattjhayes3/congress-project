calm deliberate attention of gentlemen on both sides of this house for a short time although it is not to be expected that there will be any change in the general vote on any important feature of this proposed code of rules the decree of the republican caucus has gone forth to adopt them but on the subject of pensions to which allusion has been made today and on previous days during this debate in some rather impassioned remarks by several gentlemen i want to read in the hearing of the house what was said on this floor by mr garfield then a member of the house on the 8th day of december 1876 he was at that time a member of the committee on appropriations and when the general annual appropriation bill providing for the payment of pensions was pending before the house he made a statement in regard to the general subject for the purpose as he stated of giving to the country information upon the subject of pensions he said my idea is that we have reached and perhaps passed the summit of appropriations for this object that it took a number of years to develop to get through with the regular form of laws to admit to the rolls the persons entitled to pensions and that the time must necessarily come when we shall pass the climax and begin to go downward i suppose we have already passed the maximum the amount of the appropriation bill then pending for the payment of pensions was 28 535 000 but from that day to this the annual appropriation fbr the payment of pensions has been going up until this year for which the amount was between eighty and eightyone millions and we are now confronted with a deficiency of over twenty millions more so that for the present fiscal year there will be one hundred millions of dollars expended for this purpose when our friends on the other side therefore speak of the constant opposition of the democratic side to liberal pensions i for one speaking as i believe the sentiments in fact as i know the sentiments and as record has been made of those sentiments on this side of the house can say that there never has been a time when there was a spirit of illiberality manifested on this side or an attempt in any manner to deprive the real the true the brave soldiers of the union of their rights under the law in this regard but since the date of this speech by mr garfield this increase has gone on from 28 000 000 to about 100 000 000 and next year it will perhaps be 120 000 000 and i now speakingin the hearing of union soldiers who went into the war from conviction and patriotism to their country as they viewed and understood it men who fought for their convictionsi speak to their calm deliberate judgment and i do not believe that they would be willing to urge extravagance in this regard beyond the bounds of reason because we should consider well in connection with this matter the common justice which is dub to other classes of people already we have information that the peoplethe farmers of kansashave petitioned the governor of that state to call an extra session of the legislature in order that there may be steps taken to stop the foreclosure of mortgages th s money to pay pensions has to come from the people whether it be paid directly or by indirect taxation the government can not make money simply by its fiat and call it into existence the money must come from the great body of the people the consumers and the great body of the consumers of this country are the farmers and laborers it is strange that at a time like this when the great body of the producing classes on the farms in the factories and workshops throughout the country realizing that although they toil with energy and industry and exercise rigid economy there is such a drain by indirect taxation on all the articles of everyday necessity and in the interest of trusts monopolies and combines to oppress them theythe farmers and laborershave found it necessary to organize for their own protection these organizations representing as i have said the producing portion of our population have again and again appealed to congress for reliefnot for favors but for equality and justice only shall their appeal be in vain the prosperity of all other interests and classes depends upon the prosperity of these i allude to these questions now because the debate upon the proposed radical changes in therules of the house shows the avowed purpose to be to clear the way for the hasty and certain passage of certain measures so frequently alluded to by those who advocate these changes if these measures are to be adopted as now seems probable the oppressed and burdenbearing classes to whom i have referred will not only receive no relief in the reduction of their burdens but will have to submit to still greater ones there is necessarily an increase from year to year in the expenditures of the government on account of the growth of the country but the increase is entirely out of proportion to the countrys growth the amount of the net ordinary expenditures not including interest on the public debt sinking fund or expenditures out of the postal receipts was for 1889 96 667 560 43 greater than for the year 1879 thustheexpenditures for ordinary purposes have rapidly gone up nearly one hundred millions in ten years the following figures will show the rapid increase of the annual expenditure for pensions 1878 27 137 019 08 1879 35 121 482 39 1880 56 777 174 44 1881 50 059 279 65 1882 61 345 193 92 1 83 66 012 573 64 xxi 84 1888 55 429 228 06 1885 56 102 267 49 1886 6 63 404 864 03 1887 75 029 101 79 1888 80 288 508 77 1889 87 624 779 11 it is singular with this record and in view of the further fact now apparent to all that the amount for pensions this year will reach 100 000 000 that for partisan purposes gentlemen on the other side of the house make the charge of illiberality against the democratic side especially when they remember that during this period of rapid increase for pensions the democrats have been in control of the house the whole time except for two years surely no true soldier will complain of illiberality in the face of this record but there are many other objects for which large appropriations have long been sought at the hands of congress they still confront us the rules now proposed by the republican caucus give the committees of the i louse larger powers than ever before to designate the bills to be considered the powers and privileges of the individual member of congress are correspondingly diminished the result will inevitably be that the committees having in charge measures they desire to pass will combine one with another in the support of their respective bills and by this method known in plain language as logrolling many such measures will receive a majority which they would not have standing alone on their own merits among theschemes for large appropriations that will be pressed with great vigor is that of providing subsidies forsteamship lines between the ports of our country and those of others which simply means to take irom the earnings of the whole people millions of dollars to hire steamshipowners to engage in private business for their own gain in a hopeless effort to build up foreign commerce with other countries against whose commerce this g6vernment under republican rule has built up a chinese wall in the form of a prohibitory tariff other propositions are pending to give a bounty or subsidy out of the public treasury to the sugargrowers again another proposition which has heretofore been strongly pressed and will be again is that in the interest of the pacific railroads to pay them several million dollars which the government has retained out of their earnings to be credited on their indebtedness there are many other claims and schemes which are not new to this congress many of which are wicked and unjust but some of which have shown considerable strength in their support heretofore i have seen members on the other side of this chamber as well as on this invoke the rules of the house as they have hitherto existed to postpone or prevent the consideration of some of these schemes but now i regret to see these same gentlemen on the other side of the i louse voting in obedience to the dictate of the republican caucus to totally destroy in advance these same rules which they have heretofore successfully used for good purposes while my republican friends from the mortgageridden west are voting to strike down the safeguards in the rules of the house which the experience and wisdom of more than one hundred years have erected for the protection of the rights of the people and the public treasury and to secure deliberation in the enactment of public laws and

object to being interrupted i have but fortyfive minutes of my time and after i have concluded what i desire to say then i will yield if gentlemen desire to question me i say therefore sir that this is an effort in the framing of this territorial bill to inject into it a subject that has no business in it at all you are endeavoring to make the laws of the state of arkansas under the judicial system you propose to establish in the indian territory the laws by which the rights of the indians themselves are to be adiudicated and determined i have always held that the five semicivilized tribes are sufficiently able to take care of their own affairs hence when the bill was introduced in the fiftieth congress to enable the creek and the seminole tribes to sell a portion of their lands embraced in the oklahoma region to the united states i did not raise my voice in opposition to it because i felt that they were the best judges of their own interests although i believed then as i believe nowmy belief at present being made sure by the events now transpiringthat the policy of selling lands to the government of the united states by these indians for any purpose which leads to the processes attempted to be carried into effect by the provisions of this bill is injurious to the interests of the indians and i have doubted the policy on the part of the indians to sell lands to the government of theunited states which should enable it to establish a territorial form of government to be occupied by white people and subsequently to be a state occupied by white people because sir it would furnish a leverage by which you might eventually extinguish the title of these people to all their land as they say in the memorial which has been read at the instance of the gentleman from georgia before i began my remarks that it is entirely and only for the purpose of absolutely doing away with the right of title of these indians to all their landswherever they are now sir i say that this bill of the house which is proposed as a substitute to the senate bill violates article 13 of the treaty of 1886 which reads in these words art 13 the cherokees also agree that a court or courts may be established by the united states in said territory with such juisdiction and organized in such manner as may be prescribed by law provided that the judicial tribunals of the nation shall be allowed to retain exclusive jurisdiction in all civil and criminal cases arising withn their country in which members of the nation by nativityor adoption shall be the only parties or where the cause of action shall arise in the cherokee nation except as otherwise provided in this treaty i say sir that this bill establishing these foreign laws and this foreign jurisdiction is in violation of the provisions of this treaty and of section 13 to which i have adverted but sir the statement was made yesterday by the gentleman from illinois and by others probably that this effort to establish a territorial government over the land designated in the house bill which is proposed as an amendment to the senate bill was not an infraction of the rights of these indians under any treaty stipulation by the government it is proposed to include within the limits of this territorial government as designated by the house bill offered as a substitute for the senate bill what is known as the cherokee outlet now sir it is insisted that we have a right to include this cherokee outlet what does that cherokee outlet contain and what is its area according to the report of the committee it contalns 6 022 211 acres of land that is proposed to be included in the house bill in establishing a territorial form of government now sir i assert that no lawyer who has ever read the treaty of 1866 no lawyer who has ever read the patent of the united states executed by the president of the united states in solemn form conveying these lands to the indians can question the title of the cherokees to the outlet any more than they can question the title of the cherokees to the land which they actually occupy they hold it notaloneby treaty but when it was proposed that the cherokees should be moved from georgia that the creeks should be moved and that the choctaws should be moved from mississippi the then president of the united states andrew jackson said to them if you will go if you will give up the lands which you now occupy and hold in trust in the state of georgia and in the state of mississippi and perhaps in other states east of the mississippi river we will give you a region of country west of the mississippi river which we will forever guaranty you perpetually and we will go further and will give you the additional guaranty that no state or territory shall ever be established within the borders of those lands or interfere with your treaty rights or your patents the consequence was that the president of the united states who succeeded andrew jackson in the presidencymartin van burensigned these patents and signed in express terms clothing them with the power to hold these lands not only by treaty stipulation which we are wont to disregard whenever we feel like it with a weak power but they were told to hold them by virtue of patent i had occasion in the last congress to call the attention of the house then and i call the attention of the house now to the terms of these patets and i want to show that these patents did include the cherokee outlet by the same terms of grant by which it conveyed the lands upon which the cherokees now live the terms of the patent are a follows and i quote from the patent itself therefore in execution of the agreement and stipulations contained in the said several treaties the united states have given and granted and by these presents do give and grant unto the said cherokee nation the two tracts of land so surveyed and hereinbefore described containing in the whole 14 374 135 14 acrescoming down to a fraction of an acre because the land had been surveyed in two separate surveystohave and to hold the same together with all the rights privileges and appurtenances thereunto belonging to the said cherokee nation forever subject however to the right of the united states to permit other tribes of red men to get salt on the salt plain on the western prairie referred to in the second article of the treaty of the 29th of december 1835 which salt plain has been ascertained to be within the limits prescribed for the outlet agreed to be granted by said article and subject also to all the other rights reserved to the united states in and by the articles hereinbefore recited to the extent and in the manner in which the said rights are so reserved and subject also to the condition provided by the act of congress of the 28th of may 183 referred to in the above recited third article and which condition is that the lands hereby granted shall revert to the united states if the said cherokee nation becomes extinct or abandons the same now here is the solemn patent of the government conveying to the cherokee nation this outlet that you propose now to include in this territory held by the very same patent and under the very same language that it conveys the land on which the cherokees live and inhabit today if you can violate a solemn patent of the government and put under the territorial jurisdiction of the united states the outlet you can also embrace and include within that jurisdiction the very lands upon which the homes of the cherokees are today what is to prevent it they hold both by the same authority they hold their lands and their homes by the same authority that they hold the outlet and by no stronger title both are patented to the cherokees to be held by them forever as long as they exist as a people therefore i repeat if you can take the outlet you can take the cherokee lands themselves and it will be well remembered by gentlemen who were here in the fortyninth congress a congress in which i did not have the honor to serve that when the territorial bill for the indian territory from the committee on territories was introduced in that congress the territorial committee of that day bolder in their assaults upon the rights of these people than the committee of today proposed to include every rood and inch of land belonging to all the five semicivilized tribes but gentlemen found that would not pass they tppealed to the american people in vain to commit this grand act of robbery equaled in the history of civilized nations only by the act of the five great powers in partitioning poland by the sword the congress of the united states would not respond to that proposition of the territorial committee in the last congress in which i did have the honor to serve another bill was introduced for the purpose of establishing a territorial government in oklahoma which excluded the territory actually occupied by the five semicivilized tribes but included everything else this outlet as well as the other and i am gratified to say that my honorable friend from georgia who bore the brunt of the battle in that contest by his ability and his leadership defeated that bill and it never became a law the fortyninth congress of the united states and the fiftieth congress were appealed to for the establishing of these territories these indians were said to be in the way of the march of civilization that was the argument then and i suppose it is the argument now i took occasion then to say that if the civilization which proposed this grand act of robbery to be perpetrated in the name of the american people and by the american nation was indeed and in truth a christian civilization it would scorn the argument made for the proposition inboth those congresses what sort of a civilization is that sir which proposes to disregard the great principles laid down in the canon law and in christianity itself as they were engraved by the great lawgiver upon the tablets of old one of the first of those commandments was do unto others as you would have others do unto you another was thou shalt not steal and i commended it in that congress to the honorable gentleman of the territorial committee and insist that we should not disregard those great laws which lie at the foundation of all christian civilization as against a weak people that you sometimes say are the wards of the nation when you want to make a favorable treaty with them that is what you say when you want to treat with them but when you want to take their lands the summation of the argument is that the best indian is a dead indian ii you propose by some process or other to get every rood of land which they hold now this bill of the house proposes to establish a judicial system under a strange code of laws these people are a simplehearted people they have their own governments they have their legislatures in the five semicivilized tribes and their own judiciary and it is proposed virtually to supersede those and to introduce a foreign system of laws and a foreign judiciary they furnish an illustration of the doctrine upon which rests the fbunudation of the government of the united states itself having received the solemn patent of the government issued in accordance with a solemn treaty stipulation the indians supposed that they were at least secure in the lands which they took in exchange for the lands which they ceded on the eastern side of the mississippi out of the lands which they thus ceded you have made state after state supporting the grand entablature of the union stretching as it does from ocean to ocean they ceded vast empires to the people of the united states and they took these lands to which they supposed they had an absolute title after they had been crowded by this christian civilization i from one reservation to another they were at length confined within a small limit where the tide of civilization coming sweeping from the atlantic wfis met by the tide of civilization coming sweeping from the pacific so that they could move no more when they agreed to cede the lands east of the mississippi river and accept the lands assigned to them on the west side of that river they were shrewd enough to say to this government give us a patent give us a deed do not let us merely rely upon our treaties but give us a formal deed and there lie now in yonder building of the interior department those patents given to every one of these tribes signed by the president of the united states conveying these lands to them forever as long as they shall occupy them there were two limitations two restrictions two provisos and only two one is that what was known as the saltlake region should not be cut off from the other tribes who might settle in the land and the other was that if the cherokees should become extinct or should abandon their lands then those lands should revert to the united states but these indians are not extinct they are a prosperous people under their own form of government as are the choctaws and the creeks and the chickasaws and the seminoles they live and prosper by virtue of their own form of government they exist by virtue of the principle of home rule and community independence which the grand old statesman of england pointed to in the english parliament when he declared that the american constitution was the noblest production that ever in a given time had emanated from the brain of man he said what is it that makes the american constitution so noble so worthy of imitation it is that it is founded upon the great principle of home rule and community independence and heturned with an appealingaud powerful eloquence to the house of commons where he was serving and begged them to solve the great problem of the government of ireland by applying to it this great principle of the american constitution these people live under their own laws upon their own homesteads with their own legislature their own judiciary their own peculiar form of government holding their lands as they do in common now it is proposed in violation of solemn treaty to take over 6 000 000 acres of the lands which the cherokees bold by a title as indefeasible as that by which any man in the united states holds his land in a controversy between citizen and citizen in the courts of the united states he who can derive his title clearly and unquestionably from the patent of the government must prevail the patent of the government is the foundation of the title by which every citizen of the united states holds his land the title must be derived from somebody who held the original patent as well might you undertake to say that the congress of the united states possesses the power to disregard the solemn conveyances made to corporations or to individuals as to say that you have a right to disregard these solemn conveyances made to the indians it will not do to say as is the habit of my learned and distinguished friend from illinois that the cherokees are leasing this outlet and i believe he went so far yesterday in the exuberance of his fancy as to declare that there is not an indian on this outlet that no indian can go there that the land is not theirs at all because forsooth they have found it to be their interest to lease those lands to cattleowners of the eastern states or elsewhere for pasturage it has been the policy of the interior department to encourage agricultural development among the indians some of the severest indian wars that have ever occurred have been brought about by the fact that agents representing the interior department have insisted that the indians should use their land for the cultivation of field crops and not for pasturage but this land is theirs theirs by a title as high as that by which any man in the united states holds his land theirs by solemn treaty of the government theirs by the solemn patent of the government and they have the right to make such use of it as they think most favorable to themselves if they choose to regard it as more suitable for pasturage and for grasses than for the cultivation of field crops who shall question their right in this respect they do lease this land they lease it for a fine sum of money from wbich they expect to support their government and the schools which they are establishing now with wonderful advancement giving some lessons in civilization that might well be patterned after by the people of the united states themselves these indians choose to let this outlet to people who want to use it for pasturage because the indians believe that the income derived in this way is greater than it would be from planting what right have we to say when we have deeded this land to them by the most solemn patent of the government when we have guarantied it to them by the most solemn treatieswhat right have we to say how they shall use thisland yet this bill proposes to include the 6 922 244 acres which constitute that outlet in the territory which the house bill proposes to establish it has been said that this is no violation of the treaty why sir what is the treaty stipulation with the indians in the last treaty made with themthe treaty of 1866it is provided in the sixteenth article thatthe united states may settle friendly indians in any part of the cherokee country west of ninetysix degrees to be taken in a compact form in quantity not exceeding 160 acres for each member of each of said tribes thus to be settied the boundaries of each of said districts to be distinctly marked and the land conveyed in feesimple to each of said tribes to be held in common or by their members in severalty as the united states may decide said lands thus disposed of to be paid forto whom to the cherokee nation at such price its may be agreed on between the said parties in interest subject to the approval of the president and if they should not agree then the price to be fixed by the president the cherokee nation to retain the right of possession of and jurisdiction over all of said country west of ninetysix degrees of longitude until thus sold and occupied after which their jurisdiction and right of possession to terminate forever as to each of said districts thus sold and occupied it will be observed that under this provision of the treaty when these lands are used by the government of the united states for the purpose of settling friendly indians on them the transaction for the purchase of the land is not a transaction between the government of the united states and the tribe or tribes that may occupy and settle upon the land but it is a transaction and a trade between the friendly indians that may purchase the land and the cherokees or other indian nation that sell it and the money derived from the purchase does not go to the united states but to the cherokee nation who has the title to this land will you say that under this treaty the government of the united states designed to cheat and deceive these indiansintended to say to them you may sell these lands and receive money for them but we will take your lands whenever we want to do so sir it is conceded in the very terms of this article that the title of the land is in the cherokee nation and that the settlement of the friendly indians when it is made is made with the assent of the civilized tribe owning the land and of the tribe that purchases and under this agreement settlementafter settlement of friendly tribes of indians has been made upon this territory and it will be observed that by one clause of this article 16 the jurisdiction of the cherokee nation is to be absolute over all the country west of the ninetysixth degree of longitude until the friendly indians are settled there and become domiciled then it is proposed to yield to them the same principle by which the five semicivilized tribes govern their own affairs i have said sir that they are ruled and governed by their own action in accordance with that principle of home rule and community independence which lies at the foundation of our own constitution and which had its origin primarily with the sturdy german race in their german forests and was transplanted to england became there a part of the code of laws and thence by our ancestors transported here to become a vital principle of this great free independent a merican republic and we have treated with these indians from the very inception of the government as people acting in a collective capacity as nations they have been so treated not only by the legislative department of the government but by the judicial department in all the transactions and treaties with them we have regarded them as a people having their own autonomy of government having their own national legislature their own national judiciary we have never attempted to interfere with them in these matters until we attempted to establish this territorial form of government in the manner now proposed by the substitute for the senate bill we have not a right to take one foot of the land which belongs to them any more than we have to go to the home of my friend from new tork and say you have broad acreage more than you can use we want a part of it and though you hold the solemn patent of the government for this land we will take what we want because we are the stronger and possess the power to do so these indians hold their land by the solemn patent of the government by these treaty stipulations which were intended to give them an absolute title a title which could not be questioned a title which they should hold in the language of the patent forever ii it was a guaranty deed on the part of the government of the united states that they should hold that land unmolested and undisturbed"], [0.029172122478485107, 0.9708278775215149, 1, "i enter this debate because i feel the profoundest solicitude for the safety

complications and intricacies that gentlemen who formulated it do not understand it the gentleman from illinois one of is professed authors did not know that it authorizes an unlimited number of special deputy marshals on this floor there is a difference of opinion as to whether it authorizes the employment of troops at the polls a prerogative which no statesman would leave in doubt and yet the plain people of this country are to administer it at their peril when you enact a law for the government of railroads you know that those corporations have able counsel and you have provided for them a high tribunal to settle disputes that may arise as to the construction of the statute when you enact alaw to change the practice of the courts of the country you know that there are learned judges to decide difficult matters after the arguments of able lawyers if you change the practice in any of the departments of the government you provide those departments with law clerks with solicitorsgeneral and attorneys general to guide and direct the learned secretary but when you make a law to be administered by the untutored and unaided citizens who are to preside over the very sources of all power in this country they must execute it correctly or go to jail and to make this bill of pains and penalties and infinite complications effective against our masters it is proposed to try them in the united states courts and deny them a jury of their peers the act of 1879 which provides that jurylists in the federal courts shall be made up by the clerk and a commissioner of a different party from the party of the clerk was a compromise measure originating in a spirit of obvious fairness on that compromise in a large degree proceeded the pacification of the country it was on this foundation that confidence in the justice of the government and in the fairness of its courts was again encouraged in the south this bill proposes to repeal that great safeguard of liberty and leave the jurylists to be made alone by the republican clerks of court offenders indicted under this bill if they are republicans are to be tried by their friends and if they are democrats are to be indicted and tried for political offenses by their political enemies i say that rather than have such a jury trial as this bill provides i would prefer to have the institution of trial by jury abolished altogether now look at another feature of this bill up to 1863 gentlemen who had certificates entitling them to seats upon this floor brought them here and presented them and their sufficiency was determined during the first hours of the organization of the house of representatives in 1863 that law was changed so that the clerk of the house was authorized to make up the roll of members but that act passed in a period of great confusion provided that the clerk should place upon the roll those who were accredited in regular form according to the laws of the states that statute has stood ever since it survived the war it survived reconstruction yet now you propose to supersede that practice where trust and confidence and mutual interest require that we should appeal to the highest right and settle these matters according to principles in which all patriots should concur you provide by this bill that the certificate of a returning board in judicial districts shall determine the right of a member to have his name entered upon the roll i tell you that when that question comes here to be determined at the organization of the next house of representatives you will place this country under a strain not paralleled since the days of the disputed presidential count the people of this country will not trust the decisions of your partisan returning boards they may submit if they will as they have submitted before the peace of the country may be again due to the forbearance of the party to which i belong but according to the traditions of liberty according to the maxims which have governed this anglosaxon race to which we all belong you might as well place dynamite under the house and put at hazard every interest of this country it is the work of an anarchist if it is statesmanship it is the statesmanship of guy fawkes i am aware that in addition to the pains and penalties which this act provides one gentleman on the other side has sent after it the menace of a killing bullet it may be that i should be frighted when a madman stares i have been taught sir in the hard stern school of adversity no imprudent declamation shall escape my lips on this occasion but i tell you that behind me and behind every representative on this side and behind every gentleman on that side there is a deep undercurrent of fair play which will rise in indignation against this usurpation applause on the democratic side j as to that section qf the country from which i come i shall pay its people no tribute but i trust i may be permitted to read here and now a few words recently uttered in another place by a gentleman who stands high in the councils of the republican party and who himself advocates a measure of this kind i refer to the hon mr hoar of massachusetts speaking of the southern people he said i am saying this of a people with as gallant noble and honorable traits when this race prejudice does not get possession of their souls as ever existed on the face of the earth they have some qualities which i can not even claim in an equal degree for the people among whom i myself dwell they have an aptness for command which makes a southern gentleman wherever he does not a peer onlybut a prince theyhave a lovelof home they have the best of them and the most of them inherited from the great race from which they come the sense of duty and the instinct of honor as no other people on the face of the earth they are lovers of home they have not the mean traits that grow up in places where moneymaking is the chief end of life they have above all and giving value to all that supreme and superb constancy which without regard to personal ambition and without yielding to the temptations of wealth without getting tired and without being diverted can pursue a great public object in and out year after year and generation after generation i rely on these high characteristics which this honorable gentleman has imputed to our people as a means of safety not only for them but for all the rest of the country he gentleman who proposes this bill once entertained very different opinions from those which he now advocates on the 4th day of july 1879 before the honorable mayor and council of the city of boston he made a speech full of sentiments worthy of a statesman speaking of the principle of state rights he said it is the great anglosaxon principle of local selfgovernment and is the safeguard of our liberties now as it has ever been in the past without it there is no health in us it should be more jealously watched than any other because the tendency in large communities is always towards centralization our government is a system of checks and balances destroy one element and the whole fabric falls nationality is strong and safe our most important duty is to protect our local rights wherever they exist and feel as the colonies did when the boston port bill passed that the cause of one is the canse of all i commend

not the authority of the people behind it it simply comes from a body of a few men who on coining into power are determined to use it for all that it is worth it is but an illustration of the tendency

expenditure of millions of dollars as subsidies have not found the party in power that was able and willing to answer their schemes since the close of the fortythird congress there has not been for the republican party the opportunity to make large expenditures the fortyseventh congress found the country largely in distress and it was restrained but now you have the opportunity to commend yourselves to the shipbuilding interest by the expenditure of large sums of money upon a navy 11 you have the opportunity for the expenditure of money for the making of contracts in relation to various subjects of taxation which by reason of the fact that your party is in power in the senate and in the executive branch can not in human possibility be curtailed within the next four years in the fortythird congress after you had been defeated at the polls you adopted a system of taxation in the fortyseventh congressat its closeby a trick in parliamentary law the subject was brought up in

his seat presented the case of the majority report in the most prudent logical4 sober and dispassionate manner thus far observed by that side of the house the gentleman from illinois who initiated this discussion quite frequently referred to or hinted at alleged conditions which he insisted formed a justification or at least an excuse for the report submitted by the majority of the committee on rules i listened with much attention and interest for an enumeration of those peculiar conditions which could justify this violent and extraordinary departure from the ancient and accepted usages of this body the recent as well as the more remote parliamentary history of this country is searched in vain for an instance in which an absolute injury has been done the american people by an occasional resort to parliamentary motions to arrest the progress of hasty and immature legislation justified by no affirmative expression of the public judgment it is generally admitted that the country is at peace with all nations and with itself all is quiet and serene tonight except on the potomac wherein then is concealed the condition which at this late day is to justify this innovation on the customary rules of procedure observed in this house for over one hundred years i admit that the situation easily suggests a hypothetical case political events in this country within the past eighteen months recall the historical fact that the constable of the bourbons agreed with charles v that he would march his army against rome and take that city providing it were distinctly stipulated that he should be unrestrained in the sack i his consuming ambition to possess rome and a mercenary army composed of all the bandits of western europe led by a talented and unprincipled commander ready and willing for plunder to serve that ambition were the conditions confronting the spanish prince and he readily assented to the proposition it is possible to imagine a case growing out of the rivalry of political parties for the possession of the government in which peculiar and even embarrassing conditions might arise a great political party might be in desperate straits in its efforts to repossess itself of public power under those circumstances it might summon to its aid all those individuals and corporations to which in former years it had granted special favors and which it had endowed with special privileges it might inaugurate a fat frying processto raise the sinews of war then might come forward these beneficiaries of special privilege from all parts of the country and enter into a contract with the chairman of the national committee to capture the presidency and place the party in possession of the government with the distinct stipulation that for a term of years they were to be absolutely unrestrained in the collection of tribute from the people and the plunder of the public treasury suppose that they had performed their part of the contract and were clamorous for the redemption of the reciprocal obligation and ravenous to enter on their promised estate then indeed would the leaders of that party be confronted by conditions which might compel the ad6ption of some such remarkable code of rules as is here submitted for our ratification nothing but a judgment of foreclosure and expiration of the equity of redemption could account for the deliberate destruction of the elementary principles of parliamentary liberty so scrupulously observed by the long line of illustrious statesmen who have occupied that chair and by the ten thousand members of the house who have come and gone in the legislative history of our government i am opposed to the proposed rule which authorizes the speaker of this house to manufacture a quorum that is a power which is not conferred by the constitution was never assumed by the men who made the constitution and never until now exercised by any man under oath to support and defend the constitution i care not if he be as wise as solomon and as just as aristides it is a power which under our government should never be lodged in any one man he who covets s ch a power is unfit to wield it he who is fit to wield such a power would never accept it the very constitution of human nature itself renders the exercise of such power inconsistent with the rights of freemen it is not disputed that the speaker of this house on two distinct occasions deliberately inserted in his private diary the name of a merther as present in his seat and declining to vote when as a matter of fact in both cases the member was not only not in his seat but was not in the house and in one instance the speaker transferred that private diary to the journal of the house and on the following day by his assumed prerogative of manufacturing a quorum approved that journal yet the constitution provides that the house shall keep a journal of its proceedings that journal imports verity is unimpeachable by any human testimony is conclusive and exclusive evidence as to the proceedings of the house in every court in the land the court whic4 should now be called upon to enforce this old and inflexible rule of evidence would be confronted at the outset with the fact that as a matter of truth the journal no longer imports verity that its integrity im discounted that doubt lurks in every page and that at best we have left but a mutilated substitute for the constitutional journal provided for by the fathers now if our distinguished speaker with all his attributes of infaliv bility fell into the error just cited and did that unintentional injustic to two members of this house what may we not expect on the fulfillment of the prophecy of mr conger of michigan in the fortysixth congress when the chair is to be occupied by shakespeares scurvy glasseyed politician who seems to see the things he does not what may we not expect when by some accident of politics that chair may be occupied by some lucky parliamentary buffoon or mere gaveled dervish or by a man incapacitated by nature and education for acting as a just and impartial umpire between man and man in the struggle of parliamentary life on this floor if such a one should succeed to that exalted position of trust and honorand the possibilities are not growing fewer as the days go byhow convenient it would be for him to turn to the journal of the present house with its alleged statements of the fact and quote it for precedent 1 when by the same example i errors many may rush into the state such a speaker would act at least with a precedent however doubtful and vicious everybody admits that many of the rulings of the present occupant of the chair are not only without respectable precedent but in direct defiance of the concurrent opinion of the most illustrious men in the legislative and judicial history of the country again i am opposed to the rule that clothes thq speaker of this house with the right to explore the motives of individual menbers to confer on him the power to declare the ordinary motions of deliberative bodies to be dilatory is to substitute his discretion his judgment and his will 1br the conscience the judgment and the will of the individual members of the house he not only is to decide at his pleasure that a motion though made by the member in the utmost good faith is dilatory and refuse to entertain it but is at his pleasure at a certain stage to refuse to entertain an appeal from that decision the right of the meanest criminal in the land to appeal from a partial prejudiced or unjust judge to a jury of his peers is by this remarkable code denied to the representatives of the people on this floor what is the overpowering exigency that requires that the members of the house must abdicate their individual rights and consciences to magnify the influence and multiply the power of the speaker the agent of the house the gentleman from ohio rworth in his ingenious defense of the rulings of the chair declared that antiquity is characteristic of many things wrong in themselves true antiquity presents us with the spectacle of one man on whom capricious fate fixed a crown reaching out with one hand and gathering to himself the substance of the people and with the other dividing his illgotten revenues among the ivorites of his court this is the kind of antiquity that characterizes this code we are here contending for the antiquity of liberty as against the antiquity of autocracy and despotism it might be well to remember that the fortyseventh congress had an experience similar to the present in nature though not in extent the speaker then arrogated to himself the right to determine that certain motions were dilatory to rule them out of order and to apply the gag law it was then argued as now that action not nonaction is the function of the house it was then asserted as now by the leaders of the majority that we are here to do the public business they did do the public business and the time camewhen not only that business but also the methods of its transaction were submitted to the crucial test of the public judgment the verdict was returned and as you all know the party that resorted to reactionary and unusual method was buried under a majority 75 deep on this floor the verdict of the people at the polls on that todobusiness house left the wake of the fortyseventh congress strewn with a choice selection of political skeletons which even at this hour are bleaching under the uncooled wrath of public opinion there is not a newspaper in all the land nor a public man with any reputation to lose who has had the temerity to attempt to draw the conspicuous leaders in that assault on the ordinary and to that time unquestioned usages of the hfouse fron the obscurity to which they were relegated by their lust of power and rage to do business a significant feature of the proposed code is the fact that it almost obliterates the representative character of inlividual members of the house the member is to no longer introduce a bill in the house he carries it to the speaker the membcr is to no longer on the authority of a committee reporb a bill to the house he is to cariy his report to the speaker the speaker is to refer his bill to such committee as he sees fit and the speaker is to send his report to such calendar as he sees fit the speaker is to rule motions out of order as dilatory when he chooses so to do if on the passage of a bill the rollcall fails to disclose the presence of a quorum the speaker is to ma ufacture a quorum and inject his statement of fact 1 into the journal of the house if a member disputes the verity of the journal and therollcall on itsapproval discloses no quorum present thespeaker again manufactures a quorum and approves the journal again at every point in these rules the individual member is overshadowed and dominated by the committees there is established an alliance offensive and detensive between the speaker and the chairmen of the committees the individuality of the member is utterly submerged by this code all of the memberson one side of the house and twothirds of those on the other side are disfranchised in a ineasu re of their legal representative character and capacity and their constituents of course lose representation in the same proportion human ingenuity seems to have been exhausted in devising a scheme to lodge in the speaker absolutely and completely the fate of legislation the contention that this code is designed to enable the majorityto control the public business is without foundation the majority should control the public business within itslegal limits and itcan do so now this code is expressly intended to enable the minority however small with the asistance of the speaker to rush measures through the house the old constitutional rule which compels the party which insists on controlling the public business to have its majority in the house is stricken dowu a new rule is submitted in its place under which a mere minority of 3 or even 1 as admitted by gentlemen on the other side could with the assistance of the chair carry bills through this house taling millions of dollars out of the public treasury in brief to provide that a minority of the representatives elected by the people may control the public business is the very purpose and essence of the proposed code and all the hysterical protestations of gentlemen to the contrary have not changed the fact it may not be amiss to recall the fact that some of the obnoxious features in the proposed code were fully discussed in former congresses mr blaine when speaker of the house repudiated the proposition that the speaker should count a quorum as conducive to fraud and scandal and predicted that the recognition and exercise of such a power would place the house on a volcano i garfield and hawley and conger and the present speaker of this house when in the fortysixth congress denounced the proposition that the chair should see a quorum the present occupant of the chair then denounced the proposition not only as vicious in parliamentary policy but clearly unconstitutional and in that view he was sustained by an overwhelming majority on both sides of the house what was then denounced as vicious is now eulogized as virtuous what was then pronounced clearly unconstitutional by our present speaker is now held by him to be clearly constitutional what was then characterized by him as a valuable privilege is now stigmatized as a vicious practice i what was then denounced as unwise reactionary and revolutionary is now applauded as wise parliamentary and legal indeed sir how irresistible must be the influence about this capitol that can work such a complete change of opinion and such inexplicable inconsistencies in human conduct but the public can hardly be deceived as to the secret power at work the creatures of government favor demand among other things that the time for the payment of the debt due the government from the pacific railroads shall be extended seventy years the confirmation to the subsidized railroads of the title to their unearned land grants additional legislation for favored banks the refunding and perpetuation of the national debt for several generations and these things can be accomplished only by congress stealing a march on public opinion the american people are to be chained still more securely to the chariot wheels of monopoly and the old rules must be thrust aside as hampering and impeding that process under the old rules parliamentary motions seldom if ever embarrassed good legislation in many distinct instances they arrested doubtful legislation and they certainly never facilitated the progress of bad legislation to correct this tendency and effect is the patriotic and philanthropic purpose of the proposed code the rage of contending interests for priority at the public treasury is on the clamor of the lobby rings out high above the voice of the people ninetynine out of every hundred pledges so lavishly made to the soldier turn to ashes while the gigantic combinations of steamship and other subsidy bandits storm this house and train their artillery on the exchequer of the government the subsidy and the fictitious claim offer large percentages while the honest claim must wait tardy recognition of its merit the beneficiaries of privilege sentinel the capitol of the nation the farmer and laborer to whom so much was promised in the last campaign are forgotten and nothing is to flourish but the industry of raising and consuming taxes in conclusion this occasion will stand memorable in the parliamentary history of the country even the occupant of the chair admits in his report that some of the provisions in this code are extraordinary while we all know that they are radical and revolutionary the authority of great names is disregarded the precedents ofa century are trampled under foot the pursestrings of the nation are flung to the wind the way is blazed broad and plain and direct for the lobby into the public treasury that there are gentlemen on the other side of the htouse who are doubtful of the propriety of many of the innovations in these rules and have misgivings as to their effects there can be no question but no speech on either side of the house will change a single vote the word has been spoken the decree has gone forth the pover that could suggest such a code of rules will find means for enforcing its adoption recognition and subserviency

declares that they shall not rule nor is the gentleman alone in that determination the gentleman speaks for south carolina the gentleman from alabama is reported by a paper in his state as having expressed similar sentiments about alabama i send to the clerks desk and ask to have read the interview as reported in that paper which has never been disavowed it was printed in the record of june 4 as a part of the speech of the gentleman from minnesota i think it is probable that he will try hayess policy on an enlarged and surer basis of giving the offices to protectionists and weakkneed democrats as a meansof disintegrating the democratic party and giving to the negro voters more respectable white leaders than they have had heretofore and he will find some who are for sale the number will depend very largely upon the social status which the earliest converts are allowed to retain if no difference is made between them and democrats in this respect the number will 43 much greater than if the old ostracism of the reconstruction era is maintained but in any event the number of birds caught in the federal trap will not be great enough to break up the solid south unless therepublican heartof the negro can be fired so as to bring them to the polls and vote them solidly for the republican party this will be very difficult if not impossible of performance for the reason that when the negroes flock to the polls to take control race antagonism is aroused and the irrepressible white men will not submit to it congress will i believe amend the laws so as to authorize supervisors of federal elections to be appointed by federal judges with powers much enlarged above those they may now exercise for the pupose of encouraging the negroes to vote and to havetheir votes counted and make any interference with the supervisorspunishable by the federal courts we all know that ninetenths of the negroes are republicans and that when they vote at all it will be with few exceptions the republican ticket they do this not from convictions of duty or by process of reason but from race prejudice thestimulus which will make the negro an active partisan will invite a few more carpetbaggers into the south to be sacrificed as officeholders but they will be less numerous than formerly because the negroes themselves will wanttheoffices there will not be harmony in the camp in some localities their domination may be submitted to while in others there will be race conflicts and bloodshed the increased representation which the enfranchisement of the negro gives the southern states in congress and in the electoral college all of which cr0 democratic is the one sore spot in the republican spine and they will make desperate efforts to change it these may have some effect upon southern prosperity and progressthey will create an apprchensiona distrust which will be felt but they will not stop ourprogress because such apolicy will prove a failure these states are white mens governments and white men will make and execute their laws without the dictation of negroes chinamen indians or any other colored race of men the gentleman from alabama is a man accustomed to weigh his words he is acknowledged as is also the gentleman from south carolina as among the ablest members of this house we have had a very great number of election contests before this body in which charges of fraud intimidation and suppression of the votes have been established one man who had been elected as was claimed by his friends to thisbody mr clayton ot arkansas lies cold and silent in death shot by political assassins while attempting to prosecute men who had stolen ballotboxes with a view to reverse the verdict of the people at the polls isit not about time that congress should execise the power conferred on it by the constitution to supervise efficiently the election jim 28 of members of this body the power to control the entire subject clearlygranted implies the right to exercise a less important supervision and to declare the result the situation is one of momentous importance if we falter in our duty to the citizens of the country we will prove ourselves unworthy of our high trust we failed in that duty once before and the masses of people thought the party had abandoned its high duty and left it in disgust gentlemen on the other side have made a parade of their love of the colored race and the faithful old black mammy has more than once been extolled as an object of devotion and admiration both the gentleman from mississippi and the gentleman from virginia have pronounced appropriate eulogies over that faithful domestic if that good old soul patiently performed the double duty of raising her own children and those of her mistress she certainly is entitled to their gratitude if not to eulogiums for her nobility it would show greater appreciation of the kindness of that faithful domestic to accord to her own sons the free exercise of the privileges accorded to them by the constitution much has been said about the assumption of the power by the national government to correct local wrongs all of the gentlemen on the other side have grown eloquent on this feature of this case we have seen this morning the pronunciamento of the democratic members of this house to the country against the strengthening of this law the reasons given for the entire abdication of the authority of the government to protect the citizen and secure the suffrage are reasons that have been presented before by the same gentlemen against the national authority when the life of the nation was involved namely that it violated the rights of the states gentlemen affect great regard for the fathers of the constitution but mr madison in the fortythird article of the federalist in reference to local violence growing out of conflicts of parties said it will be much better that the violence in such cases sliould be repressed by the superintending power than that the majority should be left to maintain their cause by a bloody and obstinate contest the existence of a right to interpose will generally prevent the necessity of exerting it the same distinguished statesman said further in the same article in cases where it may be doubtful on which side justice lies what better um res could be desired by two violent factions flying to arms and tearing a tate to pieces than the representatives of confederate states not heated by the local flame to the impartiality of judges they would unite the affection of friends happy would it be if such a remedy for its infirmities could be enjo yed by all free governments if a project equally effectual could be established for the universal peace of mankind this expression of the opinion of mr madison about the propriety of national intervention in cases of violence is worth a whole batallion of men whose motives seem to be wholly influenced by a desire to excite popular prejudice in order that they may profit by continued repression of the republican votes of the south and yet still retain forty representatives based on the colored population to dictate the laws for the nation and
