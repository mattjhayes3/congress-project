europeans through bilateral agreements which would not protect the interests of the american steel industry according to the reports much pressure was being exerted by the european economic community eec to reach a settlement that would prove unfavorable to our domestic producers consequently the executive committee met in an emergency meeting on thursday morning july 21 1982 and agreed unanimously to inform secretary of commerce malcolm baldrige of opposition to the european offer that same night secretary baldrige rejected the european offer to limit steel exports to 90 percent of the 1981 levels i would like to submit here for the record the official press release of the commerce department on this decision the unitedstates department of commerce could not accept a lastminute proposal by the european communities ec to suspend 12 steel countervailing duty cvd investigalions involving belgium france italy and the united kingdom because the legal requirement of removing the apparent injurious effects caused to the unitedstates industry by subsidized steel imports was not met the proposals were formally presented to commerce secretary malcolm baldrige at 5 30 thursday by the ambassadors of the four countries accompanied by representatives of the ec the contents of the proposals had been received that morning the ec requested that the commerce department suspend the investigation on the basis of quantitative restraint agreements as permitted in unitedstates law under that provision the deadline for reaching an agreement is midnight july 24 in announcing his decision baldrige said we welcome any attempt by the community to settle the unfair steel trade cases between the unitedstates and the ec but unfortunately these proposals are not legally acceptable unitedstates law requires that any quantitative restraint suspension agreement must eliminate the injurious effect of subsidized exports of the subject merchandise to the united states since the steel imports from the ec that caused the injury increased almost 30 percent from 1980 to 1981 the 10 percent reduction offered today from the higher 1981 levels was simply not sufficient to remove injury as required baldrige stated that if acceptable suspension agreements could have been concluded on these products the steel trade tension between the ec and the unitedstates would still not have been eliminated he noted that 19 antidumping ad cases on the same products and 13 other ad and cvd cases are still pending baldrige felt that an overall settlement leading to withdrawal of all cases was the best way to relieve the current trade tension and repeated his willingness to continue discussions with the ec to find an equitable basis to deal with the problem in its entirety as well as the proposed suspension agreements the ec required that the unitedstates accept all of the 12 proposed agreements or none in its decision the doc compared the ecs suggested restraint level to the levels at which the unitedstates international trade commission made preliminary determinations of injury in 1980 and 1982 most of the proposed restraint levels were above the levels found to be injurious by the itc doc also considered the current state of the unitedstates industry now running at less than 45 percent utilization and the level of subsidies found in the june 10 preliminary determinations which in one case amounts to 40 percent subsequent to that decision the secretary made a counterproposal to the eec that provided about a 20percent cut in steel imports unfortunately the europeans turned that proposal down in the meantime in accordance to the relevant trade laws future negotiations on these cases will require the commerce department to seek the approval of the domestic steel industry before reaching a settlement now i have been advised that the secretary will pursue additional discussions along these lines this week in brussels it would seem to be in the interests of the european community to 11 4692 co participate in these negotiations otherwise they will risk final determinations and penalties i urge the secretary to do everything in his power to settle these cases as soon as possible in order to get our steelworkers back on the job a mr bevill the war being waged against the american steel industry by foreign steel producers has taken yet another twist news reports indicate that several of the european governments which have been accused of subsidizing their steel mills and permitting them to dump their steel in this country at prices far below production costs have been applying equally unfair pressure on this government to let them plea bargain their way out of the trade suits filed against them these news reports indicate that the europeans have used the russian gas pipeline deal and other diplomatic issues in an attempt to exert a form of international blackmail against our government they want to force a negotiated settlement without the consent of the injured american steelmakers which brought the complaints if they are successful our domestic steel firms would suffer even further losses of jobs sales and would have to have longer delays in their efforts to modernize their plants further the european nations pressuring for favorable settlements want a guarantee that there will be no future filings against them of additional antidumping cases or countervailing duty that would provide them with free reign to systematically destroy our domestic steel production capabilities already basic steel employment in america stands at a depressing 49year low if current trends continue our steel producers can expect to lose 2 billion during this decade and another 100 000 american steelworkers will be without jobs as a member of the executive committee of the steel caucus i want to express in the strongest terms possible my sincere belief that our government must not turn its back on our own steelmakers who have lived within the law the cases they have filed are a test of the law and i believe americans want to see that law enforced the world is watching this important trade issue and our future international trade could be affected greatly by the outcome if the law is not enforced in this area we are sacrificing one of our most important industries america has been a good trading partner for
