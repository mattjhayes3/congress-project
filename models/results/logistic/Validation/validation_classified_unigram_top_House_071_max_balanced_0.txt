eligible under this hill to borrow money will have to pay the bill provides that the rate of interest shall be fixed by the board my amendment does not take from the board this authority but provides that the board shall not charge a rate in excess of 4 per cent per annum for the purpose of this discussion and consideration of this amendment it can be safely stated i think that the business interests of this country may be divided into two classes one is the class that pays interest and the other is the class that collects interest the first question which will be asked by persons interested and particularly the farmers when this bill is passed or becomes a lawand each one of us will be interrogated about it when we return homeis what rate of interest is going to be charged the farmers for this money we will not be able to answer this question because under the provisions of the bill this is to be regulated by the farm board no man unless it is president hoover knows what persons will comrpose this board after they are appointed by the president no one but him will know what rate the personnel of this board will decide to charge i have great confidence in the judgment of the committee on agriculture and those members of the committee on both sides of the house who have spoken in behalf of this bill but i honestly think that they have made a mistake in leaving to the board the right to fix the rate of interest the people interested in this bill even while it is being considered would prefer to know the rate of interest which farmers will be expected to pay in the first place i wish to observe that no greater authority has ever been bestowed upon any government board or any government agency since the formation of the government than the authority delegated to the federal farm board and the president under the terms of this bill except it be the federal reserve board this rate of 4 per cent is not an unfair one to the government it is not a very liberal or reasonable one to the borrower in every instance so far as i can recall since i have been a member of congress when bills of this character have been passed the rate of interest has been fixed by the congress take the jointstock land bank as an illustration congress fixed the rate of interest the rate of interest was fixed by the congress in the case of the intermediate credit banks the rate of interest was fixed by congress with respect to the agricultural credit corporation the rate of interest was fixed by congress in the case of the shipping board on money loaned by the government to the shipping board to construct ships and for other purposes incident to the shipping board business in the case of the federal farm loan board established many years ago the rate was fixed by congress in the different bills which have passed congress from time to time to assist farmers of the west the rate of interest was fixed by congress the same is true in respect of the bill passed at the last session of congress to loan money to farmers in the floodstricken areas of south carolina virginia north carolina georgia florida and alabama i do not recall in the 12 years since i have been a member of congress that congress has ever delegated the power to any other person or corporation to fix the rate of interest upon loans made by the government i do not think this ought to be done in any case and i appeal to the agricultural committee and particularly to the chairman of the committee on agriculture all of whom i think are fair men if it is not better for the government and the people to let the congress fix the rate of interest to be charged to the farmers now or at least prescribe the maximum rate the rate of interest charged all the european countries who borrowed money during the war and since the war to aid in rehabilitating the peoples of those countries was fixed by congress take italy for instance no interest was charged for the first five years and the rate after this time and for 10 years thereafter was fixed at oneeighth of 1 per cent thereafter it was fixed at the rate of onefourth to onehalf of 1 per cent for the successive 10year periods and at no time does this rate of interest ever go beyond 2 per cent besides this low rate of interest charged the government of italy in order to help their people the loan runs for 62 years congress fixed the rate of interest for france and did not require france to pay any interest for 10 years and after that time the rate of interest was fixed at onehalf of 1 per cent up until 60 years the interest charged great britain was fixed at the rate of 3 per cent finland and hungary from 3 to 31 2 per cent poland was fixed at 3 per cent belgium 31 2 per cent latvia 3 per cent the czechoslovakia republic 32 per cent estonia 3 per cent and so forth not only was the interest rate fixed at a certain amount to all these countries and other european countries who borrowed money from this government but they were given 62 years within which to pay the same you will observe the rate of interest was not only fixed but fixed at a rate below 4 per cent if it is a wise policy to give money to the european countries who borrowed money during the war and since the war at an extremely low rate of interest in order to help the people of those countries why is it not fair dealing to loan money to our own people who need help upon the same liberal terms if it is lawful and expedient on the part of the federal government to loan money to italy at oneeighth of 1 per cent interest per annum in order to rehabilitate the italian people why is it not likewise lawful and expedient to loan our people money not in excess of 4 per cent per annum in order to rehabilitate them if it was wise to loan italy money at oneeighth of 1 per cent and to france at onetenth of 1 per cent and to england at 3 per cent in order to rehabilitate the people of those european countries hbw in the name of common sense can you refuse to lend it to our own people at a rate of interest not in excess of 4 per cent my time has about expired and i ask you as business men and i appeal to your judgment and sense of fairness not as democrats or republicans but as representatives of your people is not this rate of 4 per cent a fair rate and is it not a wise and reasonable policy to do with this bill as congress has done time and again heretofore and fix the rate now and not leave it to this board congress should assume this responsibility and not shift it to the board certainly the 435 members of this houge are as well qualified to fix this rate of interest as any seven men are who may be appointed by the president to constitute the farm board i hope all of you democrats as well as republicans alike will for one time during the consideration of this bill and you have not done so up to date consider the merits of this amendment and not steam roll it to death i do not hesitate to say that the committee made another mistake in rejecting my amendment providing that farmers who are not members of the cooperative associations should be eligible to make loans under the provisions of this bill it developed in a colloquy between judge kinemh o of kentucky and me early in the debate on this bill that farmers who are not members of the cooperative marketing associations would get no benefit under this bill i asked him this distinct question suppose in my county that 10 per cent of the farmers are members of the cooperative marketing association and 90 per cent not members would the 90 per cent be eligible to borrow money under the provisions of this bill his reply was that they would not unless they become members of the association my amendment provided for this contingency in other words the amendment provided that farmers who are not members of any cooperative association would have the right to organize into a corporation or a corporate body under the laws of the state or territory in which they reside and thus become eligible for help under this bill under rules adopted by the cooperative associations and the board the bill that passed the house will in all probability be the bill which is finally enacted into law i do not believe that it will be of any substantial benefit to the cotton farmers of this country it certainly will be of very little benefit to the cotton farmers who are not members of the cooperative associations i am disappointed in the bill because i have been looking forward to the enactment of federal legislation which would be substantially helpful an~d of real practical relief to the cotton farmer in the firstplace no one knows who is the author of this bill its paternity is unknown the president does not claim that it is his bill mr haujen does not claim that it is his bill no member of the agricultural committee on either side of the house while not disowning it asserts any pride in its authorship however it is a step in the right direction the psychological effect of its enactment may be helpful i do not see how it can become a curse and yet i am not very optimistic that it will be a blessing i shall give the president and his board so far as i am concerned my hearty cooperation and do everything within my power in and out of congress to assist in its successful functioning with the hope that it contains germs of real assistance and relief to the cotton farmers which for the present i can not discover i think the bill is defective among other reasons because a it does not fix the rate of interest to be charged to the farmers but leaves the exercise of this responsible duty up to seven men who may constitute the board b that under the provisions of this bill 90 per cent of the cotton farmers in my judgment in the cottongrowing states are ineligible to participate in the benefits of this bill c it does not contain the debenture proposition and this will not be included as one of its provisions when the same is presented to the president for his signature it is estimated that under the operation of the debenture plan it would increase the price of cotton at least 10 per bale if the president of the united states had let it be known that he would not object to this debenture plan it would have been inserted in this bill on the contrary he let it be known that he was opposed to it d there is no single provision in this bill which has the effect to take care of the surplus crop this is one of the chief and outstanding features of the various menaryhaugen bills which the house has heretofore passed and is one of the essential evils confronting the cotton farmer which makes it necessary to have farm relief legislation the price of cotton takes care of itself as a rule other things being equal where there is no surplus crop i have always contended that about all congress could do for the cotton farmer was to enact legislation taking care of the smplus crop during surplus crop years i think it was a monumental blunder to leave this provision out of the bill e there is no new idea or proposition contained in this bill which has not been thrashed out by congress for eight years mr thomas m cahill one of the chief writers upon this bill who has given great thought to it recently stated the house bill has many features acceptable yet taken as a whole gives little in the way of assistance to the farmer it needs strengthening because it gives the farm board much power and unless therefore great care is used in selecting this board disaster is likely to follow and it certainly is not conceived to be of any service to the raisers of cotton if president hoover wants to do the farmers of this country and particularly the cotton farmer a substantial service and to render to him practical and substantial relief which in my judgment is not afforded by this bill he should direct this extra session of congress to take up for consideration the muscle shoals bill and have it passed at this session of congress he promised during his campaign and he is committed to the proposition that this congress would be called for the purpose of passing farm relief legislation there is no sort of farm relief gislation which has ever been proposed that is in the class of this muscle shoals bill which the house of representatives has yoted for upon two different occasions the object of this bill as all know is to aid the farmer by reducing the cost of his fertilizer one of the muscle shoals bills passed by the house contained a provision that fertilizer should be manufactured for the purpose of selling the same to farmers at cost congress could pass this muscle shoals legislation by july 1 or sooner if president hoover would just say the word"], [0.013148844242095947,

the gentleman however that of the 45 000 000 this congress is about to appropriate for socalled drought relief not one penny under the interpretation as announced by the secretary of agriculture will be spent for food for the starving people of arkansas oklahoma or any other state unless the caraway amendment or some other amendment is adopted allocating a portion of this relief fund to buy food

members of the house i would not want to say anything that would detract from what the gentleman has said about the reputation and standing of the gentleman from arkansas as i said here yesterday he was a distinguished jurist of that state a man who was loved and respected by the people but the point i could not understand was why he should have joined in the face of his apparent interest in the cottonseedoil industry in creating an organization which had for its purpose the depriving of the farmers of the south among whom he had lived all the days of his life of 75 000 000 each year now that is what the oil industry had in mind if the judge did not see that i do not know why he did not but the record speaks for itself and if i am misquoting this record or if these charges are untrue or falsely made the best way on earth for that federal trade commission to be exonerated would be by having this resolution brought upon the floor of this house a committee appointed and an investigation made so that all the members of this commission might be exonerated i even thought so much of this old gentleman because of the name he had made in arkansas that in the first speech i made i did not mention his name of course our republican friends here yesterday brought it out and i told them he was the chairman of that meeting they did it for the purpose of showing it was a democrat that is why they did it and i do not blame them for it although i do not believe the judge should be singled out the whole commission is responsible for the acts of that conference everything that was done there was later approved by the entire commission i say now and i will say it to the gentleman from arkansas or anybody else that that whole commission has performed their duty in such a gross and careless manner that they are each and every one guilty of malfeasance in office the word malfeasance means that they have performed acts they had no right to perform under the law when i make that statement i make it advisedly and i make it deliberately i can back up every word i say not only from this record but from other records as well they have no right to hold these socalled tradepractice conferences i desire to invite the gentlemans attention to the fact that the secretaries of agriculture of the various cotton states had a little meeting at memphis last fall they represented the farmers of the south and they even petitioned the federal trade commission to investigate this cottonseed oil trust did they do it no they did not do it one of the secretaries of agriculture reported that he had written to the federal trade commission before that a long time months before or weeks i do not know which but a long time and a sufficient length of time for them to make a reply but they even refused to answer his letter a secretary of agriculture reported that i want to say that if that commission is so blameless if they have done nothing wrong they should not fear an investigation at the hands of member of congress if they are not guilty of anything why should they not want an investigation gentlemen talk about these federal tradepractice conferences being inaugurated back in 1919 they didhave a little conference or two but if the gentleman is informed on this subject he will know that 90 or 95 per cent of these conferences have been held within the last 12 months and certainly within the last 18 months why because the industries of our nation have just learned that they can get an agency of our government to supervise and preside over their meetings where they cals organize a trust and where they can set their prices there is not a lawyer in this house who will not agree with this statement that the courts of this country have decided that where one posts a price and then causes it to be given to his competitor or where he is disclosing to his competitor the current price or giving to his competitor the price which he expects to pay or to give that is a violation of the laws of the united states notwithstanding that i just want to call the gentlemans attention to another little conference they held in the millwork industry in which they put out this rule as found in this pamphlet standards of business practices they will get this commission to preside over a meeting of the representatives of the industry thei will be organized and then they themselves will put out these little pamphlets about federal tradepractice conferences over the signature of the federal trade commission i want to read to you one of these rules and if it is not a violation of the law you ought to get up and stop me right now this is rule 12 and it has to do with sash doors and things like that which go into the homes of this country they got that industry together or at least they sent out notices and presided over the meeting and i will now read from this rule the industry hereby records its approval of the practice of distributing and circulating to the entire industry current price lists and all notices of advance or decline in prices made by any individual distributor or manufacturer either by the individual distributor or manufacturer or by the association or group he may be identified with will the gentleman from arkansas get out of his seat and say that is not a violation of the law"], [0.02179163694381714, 0.9782083630561829, 1, "this is in effect the rankin bill imposed on the johnson bill we do not disturb the johnson bill we leave it intact up to 1925 but impose thereon the provisions of the rankin bill in order to carry tubercular cases neuropsychiatrie cases and other chronic constitutional diseases up to 1930 this amendment covers those cases about which so many appeals have been coming to congress for relief it covers 18 000 tubercular patients who are now suffering and drawing no compensation it covers 23 000 neuropsychiatric cases which are also in distress and drawing no compensation we put them on the roll by presumption because it has been impossible for them to prove service connection owing to the red tape of the veterans bureau and owing to the fact that these menmany of them the best soldiers america furnished during the world warattempted to carry on they attempted to make a living without asking their government for assistance until finally when they broke down they found they were too late the men suffering from nervous troubles these neuropsychiatric men invariably owe their disabilities to shell shock and to the strain and stress of the war and the intensive training through which they passed during the time we were in that conflict they are just as deserving as any and if congress fails to adopt this amendment which will care for these poor unfortunate men and put them on the roll those men who broke down prior to january 1 1930 it will be a serious disappointment to them and a disappointment to the american people not only this but this is to take care of those unfortunate tubercular men to whom i have just referred not a one of whom is put on the pay roll by the johnson bill not a one of whom is given compensation under the johnson bkl if these men were included i

fighting for the destruction of the human race he is more dangerous than any foreign power and more destructive than any antagonist our country has ever encountered on the field of battle he is the friend of none yet he is the confederate of every disease and the ally of every foe of mankind he is more devastating than the sword more treacherous than poison gas more sinister than the submarine and more cruel than caligula in the heat of battle in the fullness of his pride and strength the soldier takes little heed of the hissing bullet or the bursting shell he is urged on by his patriotism and the consciousness of his countrys support and cheered on by his comrades to victory or to death but he who dies of tuberculosis must in a measure fight his battles alone he lingers for days and weeks and months and even years while this insidious foe stealthily performs his deadly work he comes not up like a brave and daring enemy storming by sudden onset the fortress that resists he besieges he draws his line around the doomed garrison he cuts off supplies he undermines he never summons to surrender he asks no quarter and gives none he observes no armistice he recognizes no flag of truce he halts at no rubicon he pauses at no delaware he is grim stealthy insidious malignant relentless and implacable his arena of constant warfare spreads throughout the earth the devastating wake of his ravishing march leads through every land wherever he goes he conquers he conquers amidst the burning sands of the south where the phalanx of alexander halted in mutiny he conquers amidst the snowdrifts of the north where the grand army of napoleon found its winding sheet unlike a common warrior he tortures his helpless victim and gradually puts him to a slow and painful deathhe smothers him to death when finally the spark of life has fled instead of relenting his assault he gloats over the dead and moves on to attack and if possible destroys his defenseless loved ones thus

gentlemen from new york i think there has been an abject and indefensible surrender upon this proposition and i regret very much that this conference report comes before this house at this time in the form it which it does come i have no disposition whatever to save the face of any man either on my side of the house or on the other side of the house i think all of us on both sides have ample cause when we leave this chamber to be ashamed of the action which will be taken here today the gentleman from louisiana has called attention to the fact that the republican leaders have come to the same position which was occupied by some of our democratic friends earlier in the session that is tiue but the way they have come gentlemen does not appeal to me i think it is a shameful thing when an american congress has to write to the secretary of agriculture to find out the meaning of a word if we meant to include food if we meant to include the necessities of life for these farmers who are suffering why did we not have the courage to say so and not write to some subordinate official or to some other branch of the government to find out what we mean by what we are saying this afternoon it is pitiable it is shameful my friend from arkansas has indicated that he hoped this measure would be administered sympathetically well he entertains a hope which i do not entertain especially if a person has to come in at the back door as the administration has done in this case in view of the intellectual dissimulation which has been practiced in connection with this bill i have very little confidence in their administration of the law i have had information from the district which i have the honor to represent that in the administration of the 45 000 000 loan law in that district where farmers are applying for loans they have been required to pay an overhead expense in order to get these loans amounting to 121 2 per cent on loans of 100 and 22 per cent on loans of 50 gentlemen it is a shame and a disgrace that this thing has come about i shall support this conference report with shame and with a great degree of reluctance let me review the situation which has made consideration of this legislation necessary more than eight months ago the country woke up to the realization that it was in the midst of a drought which for the extent of territory involved and the damage it was doing was unsurpassed by any previous drought in our history rivulets and brooks became dry springs no longer flowed and even in such great rivers as the mighty father of waters the lightest craft found navigation seriously impeded a merciless sun beat down from a brazen sky upon field and forest and vegetation withered and died in the blistering heat pious folk prayed and socalled rainmakers used every device imaginable to coax moisture from the skies but the combined efforts of the good and the credulous were unavailing the situation had become so alarming by july 12 1930 that on that date the state health officer of kentucky telegraphed the president of the united states that the prolonged drought had not only brought great economic loss to a vast section of the country but that it also had become a threatening menace to the health and physical wellbeing of millions of people in response to the appeal of the state health officer of kentucky the president directed the surgeongeneral of the public health service to summon the state health officers of alabama arkansas georgia kentucky mississippi missouri north carolina and tennessee to convene in washington on july 22 1930 to consider the phase of the drought which related to health conditions at this early date this conference of state health officers found that restrictions had been placed on the use of public water supplies in many sections in each of these states that private water supplies had disappeared and that the families of thousands of farmers were drinking water hauled from great distances from doubtful and polluted sources it was found that this shortage of suitable drinking water had produced a definite increase in typhoid fever dysentery and other filthborne diseases and that there was also a marked increase in pellagra and other dietary deficiency diseases as the days came and went the drought continued with relentless fury when the congress convened last december the drought had already destroyed a major portion of the crops in 21 states of the union livestock were dying for want of water and provender upon which to subsist and millions of american men women and children undernourished and poverty stricken ill and poorly clad were battling against uneven odds for the most precious boon of human existencethe preservation of health and life little wonder therefore that many members of the congress should have made it their first concern to seek the speedy enactment of legislation which would bring a measure of relief to the millions of their fellow americans who were hungry ill and destitute as a result of the greatest peacetime disaster and the greatest economic debacle for neither of which were these unfortunate people responsible this nation has ever known bills were immediately introduced in both branches of congress authorizing an appropriation of 60 000 000 to be loaned to farmers for the purpose of enabling them to purchase food and also seeds and other necessaries incident to the business of farming at once a determined effort was made in both the legislative and executive branches of the government by the republican leaders not only to cut this proposed appropriation in half but to limit the use of all money so borrowed and for which ample security should be given by the borrower to feed for work stock seeds for planting and fuel for farm machinery these generous republican leaders said a niggardly sum might be used for the feeding of mules the planting of seeds and the purchase of oils and gases but not one cent could be used to stay the hunger or to clothe the bodies of millions of destitute americans who were the republican leaders in this house who turned a deaf ear to cries of distress heard in 21 states of this republic many of them were men who in former years had voted to give millions of dollars to the suffering people of italy although the italian government had not asked for it many of them were men who took delight in miore recent years in placing their hands in the public treasury and in taking therefrom hundreds of millions of dollars to supply food and other necessities of life to peoples who speak in alien tongues and who acknowledge fealty to alien flags day in and day out these republican leaders fought to deny to american citizens that which they freely gave to those who live in far and distant lands across the seas true to the history and traditions of their party the democratic membership in the congress fought valiantly for the poor and the distressed while the republican leaders in this body supported by the republican president had no eye to see no heart to respond to the cry of distress coming from hungry and starving americans who were not asking for a gift such as had been bestowed upon the peoples of other lands but for the right to borrow money from their government to enable them to feed and clothe their families i knew that upon the tariff and other economic questions the republican leaders in this body could hear no other voice when the big interests of the nation spoke i knew that they had gagged and bound this body while they forced through this congress a tariff bill which annually takes hundreds of millions of dollars coined in the sweat and dust of the honest toil of those who now suffer and are in want in order to further enrich the great captains of industry i knew that a little more than a year ago when the stock market crashed and business was paralyzed with hoover prosperity they had sponsored legislation which canceled 160 000 000 in taxes lawfully due to the government from those whose earnings for the year 1929 had exceeded the losses which they had sustained during the same period i knew they had proposed that in the course of the next 18 months the federal government should lend to the shipping interests the sum of 107 000 000 at an annual interest charge of less than 2 per cent i knew that they subscribed to the doctrine that government should be used to enrich the few at the expense of the many but i had never believed that these latterday republican leaders would deny bread to hungry men and women or refuse milk to the parched lips of famishing babes therefore i was amazed as i saw these republican leaders whip their legislative battalions into line my ears were deafened by the rolling thunders of their heavy artillery from massachusetts i was embarrassed as i heard the sharp invectives fall from the lips of an angry captain from another state i was sorely grieved when i observed that their great leader from connecticut had seemingly forgotten the hearthstones and firesides from which he had sprung in the old volunteer state when the tumult was at its height i turned from the turbulent scene and in fancy i saw the great army of the poor and the unfortunate back in my old kentucky home across the gap of years i fancied i saw lincolnthe lincoln who is said to have loved the common peopleand i wondered what he would say if his disembodied spirit could be called back to its tenement of clay so he might walk once more into this chamber and hear the words of those leaders in this body who profess to be his followers i wondered if after witnessing the scenes which i have witnessed he could say that the attitude of his professed followers on this floor squared with his expressed hope that this nation might be preserved as a government for the people the opposition to relief which includes food for starving americans assert that the granting of that character of relief would establish a precedent socialistic in its tendencies and dangerous in its consequences but the benefactions made from the national treasury to relieve distress here in our own land and abroad in scores of instances and covering more than a century of honored history refute their claims nevertheless if there had been no long line of precedents to justify the position of those who have been battling for a federal appropriation to aid those of our fellow citizens who are in dire distress at this time i should have felt constrained to support adequate relief measures the sea of life is wide and wild and strange and we can not know what lies beyond the rise of a days journey but we do know that nothing for us lies behind except points to steer by individuals organizations and nations which spend their time in looking backward become like lots wife monuments of salt upon which no history no prophecy remains but whose virtues scale in every rain to pour in brackish waste about their feet to sterilize the spot of earth they cumber much as we may revere the past we have no right to linger by the hallowed dust of other days while living beating bleeding hearts call us on new and changing conditions present problems which can not always be safely solved by applying the cold rule of precedent but in the battle which has been waged in this congress for adequate relief for the distressed those of us who have supported those measures which offered the maximum of aid to our unfortunate fellow americans have not only responded to a compelling heart appeal but furthermore we have been bulwarked and supported in the position we have taken by a line of precedents extending back to the early days of the republic in casting my vote in favor of liberal relief measures which have been before this body for consideration i believe i have faithfully recorded the will of the great constituency whom i have the honor to represent i have received letters from many individuals and resolutions from various organizations in my district which have given unqualified approval to the promptings of my own heart as to the course i should pursue on these relief measures i shall not burden the record by asking that these letters and resolutions be printed but i ask that you indulge me while i read the following brief extract from a letter which i have received from dr b f berry who resides in the fine little college town of murray in my district many of our tenant farmers are leaving the farm and moving into any shack or hovel they can get here in town just for one reasonto be in closer touch with more people from whom to obtain help out on the country lanes maybe a mile or two from anyone without even a horse to ride to town we find widows with a house full of children suffering for want of food and still the united states congress says we will feed your work stock if you will give a mortgage on your next seasons crop but you and your kiddies must go hungry we will give not lend our money to feed foreigners but it would be a violation of a most sacred principle to appropriate one penny to assuage the hunger of an american child god almighty what are we coming to ladies and gentlemen of the house these are not the words of an alarmist these are not the words of a sluggard seeking to reap where he has not sown these are not the words of a man lacking in knowledge of the fundamentals of our government these are the words of a man whose professional skill and ability have enabled him to make ample provision for the care of those who are his dependents these are the words of an intelligent patriotic american citizen who is a close observer of conditions prevailing in his community and elsewhere and who has been amazed at the position taken by those who have opposed any form of federal relief to those of our own citizens who through no fault of their own are hungry and destitute of the bare necessities of life kentuckians are a proud and selfreliant people i have not paraded their woes in the present crisis before this house and they would not have me do so but the condition in which thousands of them find themselves at this time through no lack of energy industry and prudence upon their part in providing against the fugitive uncertainties of life which have brought this great calamity upon them prompts me to make some general statements as to conditions in my state kentucky has within and on her borders more great navigable rivers than can be found in any other state in the union the memory of the 1927 flood is fresh in the minds of all of you and you will recall that in that year the floods destroyed millions of dollars worth of growing crops livestock buildings highways and other property and that scores of human lives were lost there were no crops in the valleys and in the lowlands that year the floods again returned in 1928 and in 1929 destroying crops and other property to the value of many millions of dollars after the floods subsided the farmers of my state replanted their crops only to have them destroyed before maturity by ununusually early frosts with three crop failures in succession behind them and with the greatest period of economic depression this country has ever experienced facing them the farmers of kentucky with unrelenting courage and high hopes planted their crops for the 1930 season the soil was well prepared and a large acreage was planted day in and day out from the first streak of dawn until the coming of darkness these farmers worked with the hope that nature would deal kindly with them and that bountiful harvests would reward their toil they had hoped to recoup some of the heavy losses of previous years and to lay in store a sufficiency of the necessaries of life upon which they and their families might subsist until the harvesting of another crop then came the drought with its blighting devastating influence reaching into 117 out of the 120 counties in kentucky giant trees in the forest which for decades had proudly withstood the siege of storm and wind and sun and snow and flood bowed in death before the blistering heat rivers and streams the great arteries of transportation upon which thousands of kentuckians who live in the hills and in the mountains must depend in order to float their logs to the markets of the world became impossible of navigation and the logging industry was paralyzed pastures were seared and cattle and other livestock were sacrificed upon the market because their owners could not feed them gardens were burned and fruits failed thus preventing thrifty housewives from canning and preserving foods for use in their homes crops were destroyed and farmers were unable to meet their tax bills and other fixed obligations as a result of this drought a hundred thousand farm homes in my state are passing through the greatest financial crisis which they have ever experienced and thousands of people are without sufficient food to properly nourish their poorly clad bodies thousands of little children axe denied the privilege of attending school because they are scantily clad and have no shoes many of those who are in school are badly undernourished a survey made in certain sections of my state showing that there are many children attending the rural schools with absolutely no food during the day except such immature acorns hickory nuts and walnuts as they may be able to find in the forests but ladies and gentlemen bad as it is that does not complete the gruesome picture today throughout my state there haunts the grim spectre of disease typhoid and dysentery produced by contaminated waters have been on the increase and undernourishment has given pellagra a menacing foothold just a few days ago kentucky had her first general rain of any consequence since february 1930 while suffering but grateful people hailed these rains as showers of blessings yet this long prayed for relief has brought with it some measure of danger according to the statement of dr arthur mccormack state health officer for kentucky a man who has had 34 years of experience in the work in which he is engaged and whose high professional standing is acclaimed throughout the nation these rains will mean a sharp and marked increase in dysentery and kindred diseases because of surface contaminations which have been washed into water supplies while the drought may be broken it not only leaves a great economic problem to be solved but it also leaves in its wake problems of health and sanitation which are of the most vital concern with these unprecedented conditions having such a marked bearing upon the health and wellbeing of those who live in the rural sections of the land it gave me much pleasure a few days ago to vote for a measure carrying an appropriation of 2 000 000 to promote health and sanitation in rural districts i sincerely regret that the measure upon which we are to vote within the next half hour falls so far short of the requirements of those who are in need through no failure of their own to live up to the high ideals of honest intelligent industrious and lawabiding american citizens i am one of those who believe that it is the duty of the government to protect its citizens from famine and flame flood and disaster pestilence and catastrophe brought upon them by conditions over which they have no control and when the political subdivisions in which they live are unable to extend to them necessary succor and aid if the life of the citizen is worthy of protection in war why is it not equally precious in times of peace if american citizenship gives him the right to protection in war what moral right has the government to discriminate against him in times of peace just because of the occupation he may follow or the particular locality in which he may dwell the bill before us for consideration is unfair and discriminatory to the millions who are in distress and who are without the necessary property qualifications to offer security for a loan this bill offers no hope the sole justification for the passage of this measure is that it establishes a system of credits in communities where banks have been closed and business has been paralyzed for that reason alone i am persuaded to vote for this measure within a few days this congress will be forced by the mandate of the constitution to close its labors if there were the slightest chance to procure the enactment of a more just law at this session of the congress it would give me pleasure to vote against this conference report just as it gives me pleasure now to protest against its terms and to denounce the manner in which it has been forced upon the congress for consideration when there is no human probability that an appropriate relief measure can be passed by this congress i can not see my way clear to vote against this bill which does offer a small degree of relief to those who may be able to qualify for it under the terms of the bill and the regulations which may be issued by the secretary of agriculture this congress has miserably failed in the discharge of its obligations to those of our citizens who should be the objects of our greatest solicitude and care let us hope that the people of this nation will not be guilty of a like indifference to the worthy poor let us hope that through the agency of the red cross and other angels of mercy the naked may be clothed and the hungry fed let the great heart of america so speak through these agencies that the world may know that

announcements was that they were going to curtail production they gave that out to the country whether they did or not it had the same effect the effect was to help paralyze the cotton market we have not recovered from it yet one of the things they agreed to do or announced their intention or decision to do was to curtail production by shutting down from friday to monday it threw laborers out of work the man who was trying to support his family was deprived of two days work a week in their efforts to control production and in that way they helped to depress the cotton market not only that sometimes they made announcements which they did not carry out why in order to have a psychological effect on the market which they were helping to depress some of them even went into the market and sold cotton and in that way contributed to the depression tell me they are not in an illegal combination in restraint of trade i ask you to take that record and read my crossexamination of mr hines i do not believe there is a lawyer in america who would not come to the conclusion that they are operating in violation of law and ought to be restrained gentlemen i am asking you to pass a law that will give the american people the american government the power to regulate the cotton exchange that great institution that has more to do with the welfare of the cotton farmers than anything else you

ever had an opportunity to help frame all other relief measures coming before this house since the committee on world war veterans legislation was created have been called up under a suspension of the rules where only 20 minutes to the side was allowed for debate and where none of the voluminous and important provisions could be changed in the slightest particular these former bills thus passed have been machine made they have been mostly prepared by hardboiled bureau chiefs not even ranking members of the committee much less any of the other 434 members of the house could change one word of the bills this is the reason that technicalities have deprived thousands of totally disabled veterans of relief urgently needed and left them helpless with wives and children starving when this rankin bill was passed by the house there were only 49 votes against it if it had been a vicious bad bill would the republican leaders of this house have allowed it to pass with only 49 votes against it when the republicans have a majority of over 100 members in this house if it were wasteful and extravagant was it not the duty of the republican leaders in this house who now speak of their responsibility to the nation to have stopped its passage and not given their approval to it with only 49 votes against it out of the total membership of 435 representatives this rankin bill thus went to another body it was there carefully considered first by a committee and then by another body itself another body amended it making its provisions even more favorable to disabled veterans it was debated by it at length although republican leaders of the house and administration spokesmen had had weeks to consider and ponder over the bill they had passed none dared to take the floor and condemn it as vicious or as extravagant or as bad they casually allowed adjournment to approach without a word of warning they did not hold a republican caucus they did not hold a republican conference they did not swing their party lariat around the necks or bulldog or hog tie the rank and file and place upon them the hoover brand of subjection and obedience on last monday june 23 1930 another body amended and passed this rankin bill by a vote of 66 to 6 or 11 to 1 out of 96 who had the privilege of being present and voting only 6 ersonally voted against this bill does mr hoover expect the country to believe that avicious bad extravagant ruinous bill could thus pass any body of the united states congress after being carefully considered for weeks and debated at length with only six personally voting against it

is upon the president to execute and enforce the laws none of the three has the right to invade or interfere with the functions of the others they are separate and distinct we can not shift our responsibility to the people by the attempted excuse that the president insisted on us doing soandso obeying the mandate of the president does not warrant our laying aside our own judgment and

the world war been prolonged one month it would have cost many times this sum it was these brave men the disabled whom we are now seeking to succor and rehabilitate who forced the armistice months

of dollars in gratuities that was within the presidents financial program that was within the financial program of the republican party that comes out of the pockets of the common people in what they eat wear and use in their homes and on their farms this republican party through its republican president and administration has since the war granted to large taxpayers refunds of taxes admittedly amounting to 1 191 000 000 of which 96 000 000 went to the united states steel corporation that was within the financial program of the republican president none of his party followers have objected or criticized or condemned him for it if the projects authorized by the rivers and harbors bill are appropriated for that bill will eventually cost the taxpayers of the united states approximately 250

it has for its purpose the amendment of existing law so that there may be made to manufacturers and importers of tobacco products refunds of stamp taxes where tobacco products become damaged or unmarketable and are removed from sale or consumption the bill passed the house on january 19 1931 it provided that in order that the indicated refunds might be made claims therefor should be presented within two years from the dates of cancellation of such stamps irrespective of the date of their purchase on february 21 1931 the bill passed the senate with an amendment striking out the 2year limitation thus removing all limitation of time as to applications for refund the original billthat is to say the form in which it passed the housewas drafted to meet the views of the treasury officials the senate amendment was not acceptable to the treasury as a time limit was desired as a result the senate amendment was struck out in conference and there was substituted an amendment providing for a 3year limit touching redemption and providing certain details of operation to meet more fully the methods of certain tobacco manufacturers accordingly the bill will go to the president

removal from factory or customhouse for consumption or sale the manufacturer or importer withdraws from the market may under regulations prescribed by the commissioner of internal revenue with the approval of the secretary of the treasury be redeemed if issued after december 31 1931 and if claim for their redemption is presented by the manufacturer or importer within three years after the year of issue as indicated by the number or symbol printed thereon by the government irrespective of the date of their purchase beginning with the year 1933 stamps of any issue shall not be sold until those of the previous years issue have been disposed of or later than one year after the issue the following is quoted from the house committees favorable report on the measure the same including the favorable report thereon by the secretary of the treasury the proposed legislati i amends existing law to permit manufacturers under proper regulations to be prescribed by the treasury department to recover the value of internalrevenue stamps affixed to tobacco manufactures which have been removed from the place of manufacture for consumption or sale but which the owner has been unable to market or which may have become damaged or stale or otherwise unmerchantable through failure of a new brand to sell by reason of faulty or unattractive packages or for other legitimate reasons some manufacturers also protect their brands by frequently replacing those on the market with fresh goods under existing law a manufacturer who withdraws such product from the market must lose the value of the stamp or stamps affixed thereto unless he exports the product and obtains a drawback of the tax paid it is estimated that 94 per cent of the drawback paid on tobacco manufactures during the fiscal year ended june 30 1929 represented tobacco withdrawn and exported for the purpose of recovering the value of the stamps affixed to require the manufacturers to export damaged or defective tobacco products in order to secure refund of the stamp taxes paid thereon not only subjects the manufacturers to substantial inconvenience and loss but also results in dumping into foreign markets unsatisfactory american manufactures with the consequence that americanmade goods suffer in reputation in foreign countries one of the purposes of this measure is to obviate this situation it is estimated that claims presented under this bill will amount to about 450 000 based upon the current rate of tax collections but will be nearly offset by increased receipts from the sale of stamps to manufacturers on goods that replace the products so removed from the market the purpose of the amendment is to make it clear that the 4year statute of limitation applicable to unused stamps contained in the act of may 12 1900 will not apply in the case of redemption of stamps on goods withdrawn from the market and was suggested by the treasury department the bill has the approval of the secretary

went to vicksburg during the 1927 flood to ask the mississippi river commission to grant permission to the governor of louisiana to blow the levee in order in the minds of citizens of an emotional disposition to save new orleans it was thought at that time new orleans was about to be inundated we to the manner born were not panicky but the people who had come to the city within the inst 15 years or so felt that way about it if i had been governor of louisiana i would not have asked the mississippi river commission for permission in an hour of the gravest peril to my people i would have blown the banks of the mississippi river any place necessary to protect the lives of my people and let the mississippi river commission do their worst and what could they do but i do not want to

you orally as we have done in this commitment to the governor but unanimously we believe that the river banks ought to be blown above new orleans which is common sense and not after the water had passed the city but as i said already they would not put this in writing as a matter of fact the commitment was that the governor should blow the banks of the river on the advice of the state board of engineers at any place they selected to avoid embarrassing the railroads interests though it might mean the peril of 400 000 people the then governor on the advice of the state board of engineers ordered the levees blown below the city of new orleans and did not in my judgment grant a modicum of relief though the people had to pay for the damage done through that blowout that was only just and was in a measure what the citizens committee promised me before i consented to go to vicksburg lo and behold at the hearings on the flood control bill the entire personnel of the mississippi river commission was present and to my amazement they advocated a spillway below new orleans though it was absolutely at variance and in contradiction of what they had told senator ransdell and me and which

products of big business the chief contributors to the campaign fund of that mighty party its history has demonstrated that it does not believe in extending tariff protectibn for the benefit of the

against it before and when it returns still further grundyized i imagine more will vote against it again and if enough do not vote against it to defeat it the beneficiaries will have to contribute

subject of peanuts the address is as follows the second district of virginia is probably the greatest peanutproducing section of a similar area in this country and the beautiful little city of suffolk located in the center of that area is the greatest peanut market in the world many years ago i am advised some one took peanuts to china to attempt their cultivation the chinese took to peanuts like a duck to water and what those chinese dont know about peanuts now is not worth knowing in 1914 they were beginning to interfere materialy with the sale of american nuts during the years of the world war these peanut shipments ceased but beginning again in 1922 1 they began to ship peanuts to this country in great quantities in 1922 peanuts both shelled and unshellad were imported as follows these figures being taken from the foodstuff division bureau of foreign and domestic commerce and figures being given only in the millions pounds 1922 11 000 000 1923 52 000 000 1924 61 000 000 1025 83 000 000 during the recent disturbance in china the importations dropped off and for 1926 there were 46 000 000 pounds 1927 43 000 000 pounds and 1928 69 000 000 pounds so you can see they are now after thei american market in earnest and unless our american farmers are given protection they can not possibly survive this competition i peanuts are a commodity not connected with any other schedule and to allow an adequate tariff on peanuts would disrupt no other schedulel in the tariff bill i am frank to say that i do not believe the farm relief bill will materially affect our peanut farmers the only thing which can help them is an adequate tariff on peanuts which will protect them from this cheap chinese competition the prevailing wage in china is from 10 to 15 cents per day frequently less than this as they are raised by women and children on little plots of their own and there is no way to estimate their wages depending on mr hoovers promise to save the american market for the american farmer i have told the peanut farmers of my district that they could depend on mr hoover and the republican party to make this promise good i believed it and they believed me chinese peanuts are raised brought across the ocean on empty ships returning from china largely as ballast and landed in san francisco and hampton roadsand sold at 214 cents a pound they send over principally the shelled peanut and only the large select nut corresponding to the virginia jumbo named for and made famous by jumbo the elephant in barnum and baileys circus the american field run peanut has an average of only 40 per cent of these jumbo peanuts hence an american buyer would pay less for the american fieldrun nut than for the select chinese nut this automatically reduces the tariff of 6 cents to about 4 cents according to the report of the tariff commission table 48 page 94 it shows the average cost of domestic nuts shelled f o b mills as follows extra large corresponding to the chinese imported nut 11 68 cents per pound while i can not commend too highly the work of the faithful members of the ways and means committee who have labored so patiently in the preparation of this new tariff bill and while i hesitate to express an opinion contrary to the views of that committee having been born and raised in the peanut section and knowing the difficulties of the peanut farmers i feel that i am prepared to speak intelligently on this subject at the hearings before the tariff commission the commission estimated the average yield per acre at 1 202 pounds this may be true of the more progressive farmers who have the money to buy farm machinery and ample fertilizer but it is by no means true of the average farmer many of whom are poor negroes and who have neither the money machinery nor fertile land of their more successful neighbors and we are equally anxious to help them in their industrial endeavors the agricultural department from 1921 to 1927 found that the average yield per acre was 917 pounds and according to the census report the average was 885 pounds the gentleman fron georgia judge crisr a member of the ways and means committee who filed a brief before the committee on this subject states in his briaf that the average yield in georgia for 1925 and 1926 was on y 608 pounds per acre and the united states tariff commission finds that in china the average yield per acre is 2 661 pounds showing the intensity with which the chinese cultivate these nuts we introduced before the tariff commission 75 farmers as witnesses who testified that the average yield in virginia is about 900 pounds per acre i attended a hearing of the peanut growers and cleaners preparatory to presenting this matter to the ways and means committee many were of the opinion that 8 cents on shelled peanuts and 6 cents on unshelled was the fair and reasonable rate to put the american farmer on nn equality with the chinese farmer they took the view that while 8 cents was fair that they would only ask the minimum which they felt would protect them and decided on 6 cents for unshelled and 7 cents for shelled peanuts this however was the very minimum and all agreed that the american farmer could not compete with china with a lesser rate the present bill gives walnuts not shelled a protection of 5 cents per pound and shelled 15 cents per pound edible nuts not shelled 5 cents and shelled 10 cents brazil nuts not shelled 5 cents shelled 10 cents we would like to have 10 cents on peanuts but are only asking 6 cents on unshelled and 7 cents on shelled last october i drove through the peanut belt with secretary of labor james j davis he had never seen peanuts grow so we stopped et a farmers house and asked him to let us dig up a few peanuts he gladly consented and he and his sons came out in the field with us told us to dig up a car load if we wished that they were no good to him and that he intended to plow them under or turn his razorback hogs in on them to grow smithfield hams as it would not pay him to dig them for the market he found out who secretary davis was and said to him wont you please take this message back to washington for me and beg the people in washington to protect us from chinese peanuts he said i my sons and daughters work bard here all the year and when we come to market our crop we find that it frequently does not pay us to dig them he said further i would like to have my children dressed in decent clothes and be able to send them to school properly dressed i would also after working all the year like to have an automobile not a fine one like yours out there we were driving a buick but just a ford he further told mr davis that if he would take that message to washington for him and get the relief that he and his fellow farmers were praying for that he could have his whole crop of peanuts we promised to bring the message here and here i am today delivering to you this message of this humble virginia farmer who believed our campaign pledges and is now asking us to make good on them peanuts are raised in practically every southern atlantic and gulf state from virginia to texas there is no politics in this cry for relief from the virginia and southern farmers i know our friends on the democratic side are as much interested in the protection of their constituents on this commodity as i am judge caisp judge ker and many of our democratic friends including my friend and predecessor in office mr deal have been active in trying to secure relief for the peanut farmers i want to say to you in conclusion that they voted for me largely on my promise to use every effort in my power to secure for them an adequate tariff on peanuts i was sincere in the promise i made and the hope i held out to our people i know my party is sincere in trying its best to give relief to the farmers of our country regardless of whether they live in maine or texas california or virginia and i beg of you not to send me back

heretofore been able to get on the rolls as well as increase the rate of those now on the rolls another provision of the bill as amended is the elimination of the vicioushabits provision in the existing law this will take care of many more who have not been able to get on the pension rolls the bill as amended provides that the pension or increase of pension commences from the date of filing applications therefor in the bureau of pensions after the approval of the act increases should be automatic without the necessity of filing claim but the committee seemed to have a different view and as we can not offer amendments by the rule under which the bill is considered we must take it in its present form upon investigation it was found that 43 846 veterans now on the rolls will be benefited by the increase from 30 to 35 per month that 34 197 veterans will benefit by the increase from 40 a month to 50 per month and that 24 912 veterans will benefit by the increase from 50 a month to 60 per month by eliminating the vicioushabits provision from the existing law it is estimated that it will take care of 5 per cent more of the claims allowed each year and as there is an average of about 13 000 original claims a year that will mean many more additional veterans per year to be taken care of under this provision this is all under the 90day period of service provision it
