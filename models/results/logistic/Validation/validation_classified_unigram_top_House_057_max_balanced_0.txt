philippine islands since i have been a member of this house i have been content for reasons satisfactory to myself and i trust to my constituents to renlain silent and to serve them in the most effective way i could by constant attendance upon the sessions of the house and by vol ing upon all propositions for what i believed to be for their best interests not only have i endeavored to be constant in my efforts to represent them upon this floor but wherever their interests were involsed i have endeavored to serve them as efficiently as i could and this without question of political affiliation or condition in life i do not know whether i should consider myself fortunate or unfor unate in being in the american congress at a period when the whaole theory of our government seems to have undergone a sudden and violent change four years ago when i announced my candidacy for congress we wore upon the threshold of a war with spain for the purpose of freeing the people of cuba from spains inhuman and despotic powet since that time strange events have crowded thick and fast upon each other until the american mind stands appalled at the gravity of the situation the sound of deweys victorious guns in the harbor of manila as reochoed later by schleys greater victory in the harbor of santiago is still fresh in the minds of the american people but who can realize the stupendous results and grave responsibilities inherited by the american people from those brilliant victories i venture the assertion that if four years ago some member of this house had announced to the american congress that the united states government would occupy the attitude it does today aith reference to those foreign islands he would have been laughed to scorn and ridicule by every lover of the institutions of his country at that time he would indeed have beenconsidered a wild and reckless prophet who should have foretold that a war begun to free lie struggling cubans from the cruel and despotic power of spain would today have been changed into a war of subjugation in the philippine islandsa war which for inhuman acts and atrocious conduct has shocked not only the sense of justice but the moral sense of the civilized world mr chairman the story of what induced our war with spain is kncwn to every intelligent citizen in the country they know this umhappy people had been striving for generations to secure their liberty and independence they know that spains wicked and inhuman policy had devastated the beautiful island of cuba anid made it a howling wilderness they know that the bitter cries of its oppressed and starving people had so stirred the american conscience that there was a universal demand for intervention they know that the destruction of our illfated battle ship with so many precious lives was the crowning act in the long series of tragedies which hastened the declaration of war and the crushing of spains power in the island of cuba they know too that this great republic most solemnly declared that it was not to be a war of conquest that it was not to be a war for territorial aggrandizement that it was not to be a war of criminal aggression but we protested to all the world that our only purpose was to free the cuban people from the spanish yoke and give them the blessing of liberty and independence the people applauded the action of congress in voting 50 000 000 for this purpose it was a short decisive and victorious battle we had a right to be proud of our army and proud of our navy we had a right to be grateful to the philippine people who at our request joined with our naval forces in crushing the power of spain in the philippine islands we knew that the filipinos had been fighting for ages to free their native land from the heel of the despot and to secure their independence we know now that they were led to believe through our representatives that an alliance with our forces meant their liberty and a government of their own they knew it was a war against oppression for liberty and the uplifting of humanity for we ourselves had so declared and they trusted in the honor and justice of the great american people how that trust has been so wantonly and shamefully betrayed the whole world knows today i believe it was the intention of our government in the beginning to give to the philippine people their liberty abd independence and a government of their own the correspondence between our representatives and the administration can leave no serious doubt that this was the intention we defy any candid and truthful man to read this correspondence and then assert that such was not the inevitable conclusion the very fact that our own government did not question or controvert the tenor of that correspondence is conclusive proof of the fact that the philippine people had a right to expect that the united states would guarantee to them their independence we sought their aid and armed and supported them with the munitions of war we knew then that liberty and independence was their dearest hope and that they would fight americans as quick as spaniards if subjugation was to be their eternal lot is it possible that we armed these people knowing that later they would turn their arms upon the american flag no such would have been a suicidal policy and unworthy of the patriotism if not the good sense of the american people the proof is irresistible that we intended and they believed that the hour of their deliverance had come but in an evil hour the insane desire to become a world power took possession of some of the american people the taste of spanish blood had whetted the appetite for more and had so poisoned the american system that we started forth upon our inglorious career of greed cruelty and despotism c we had demonstrated the superior skill of our soldiers and sailors and our splendid battle ships had startled the world with their effective and destructive power now we should turn them not against a great and powerful nation but against a weak and feeble people who had lately been our allies against spain whose burning desire was for independence whose every act and declaration was a solemn warning that nothing short of liberty would ever be submitted to that it was independence or extermination i do not believe that for ingratitude treachery and cruelty our present war in the philippines has been surpassed in modern times what did spain do in cuba that we have not done in the philippine islands ah what have we done in the philippine islands that spain did not do in cuba the american conscience revolted at weylers reconcentration camps in cuba but that same conscience is supposed to be dormant and numbed at our same policy in the philippine islands we are told that it is treason to criticise the conduct of this cruel and relentless war we are told to wait until the work of benevolent assimilation has been completed shall we wait until thousands more of our brave american boys shall go down in death and to the grave in trying to subjugate a people who have been taught by the noble example of our forefathers that liberty was the priceless jewel of the human race shall we wait until the torch has finished its deadly work and blackened the earth with the smoke of its humble homes shall we wait until another smith shall issuo his command to kill and burn and make it a howling wilderness until its land is bleached with the bones of its men women and children shall we wait until we have exterminated its population above the age of 10 and left only its babes and sucklings as a reminder of the generosity of the great american people those who have disagreed with the administration in its policy in the philippine islands have been accused of encouraging resistance to our authority there let us remember that nearly a century and a half ago when our forefathers were struggling for liberty and independence against the despotism of great britain the elder pitt one of englands greatest statesmen came to our relief and declared upon the floor of the house of commons gentlemen sir have been charged with giving birth to the sedition in america they have spoken their sentiments with freedom against this unhappy act and freedom has become their crime sorry i am to hear the liberty of speech in this house imputed as a crine but the imputation shall not discourage me it is a liberty i mean to exercise no gentleman ought to be afraid to exercise it it is a liberty by which the gentleman who calumniates it might have profited by which he ought to have profited hie ought to have desisted from his project the gentleman tells us america is obstinate america is almoet in open rebellion i rejoice that america has resisted three millions of people so dead to ali feelings of liberty as voluntarily to submit to he slaves wouldhave been fit instruments to make slaves of the rest the cry of treason and the encouragement to the american rebels had no terrors for pitt he went so far as to boldly declare that he rejoiced that america had resisted i am not aware that any american senator or representative has ever gone so far with reference to the filipinos it has only been a source of regret to us that this free republic should have pursueda course of such manifest injustice and cruelty as to inevitably lead to resistance upon the part of a people whose burning desire was for liberty and to whon the thought of independence was as sweet as it was to the american colonists in all the years of our national life what loyal american has been found to denounce pitt as a traitor and to condemn him for his courageous defense of our colonial ancestors they were resisting what they rightly coneived to be the unrighteous and unconstitutional acts of the british parliament the filipinos are resisting what they conceive to be an unrighteous military subjugation and the unconstitutional acts of the american congress and the president of the united states we were told in the beginning that our war in the philippine islands was in behalf of civilization and christianitythat it would be of short duration and with little loss in treasure and blood but nearly four years have passed and the bloody tragedy still goes on and as the years have fled the army has been enormouslye augmented the expenditures are climbing rapidly to the halfbillion mark our military excesses have gone from bad to worse until the country has been largely depopulated of its adult male citizenship to siy nothing of the women and children who have perished in the awful work of destruction since we have christianized them with the svord and civilized them with the torch we do not now hear so much about christianity and civilization it is now commercial expansion w are unctold that they have once again become pacifies and the land is ready for the advent and possession of the carpetbagger and adventurer we would hope and trnst tht they could not only be pacified but satisfied but we do not believe that the word pacified has any place in the argument of this question we do not believe that a people high strung and intelligent as they are said to bea people who love their homes and their country and who for more than two hundred years have shown their willingness to die for the security of the one and the independence of the other in their unequal warfare against spain and other powerswiu ever become pacified until they have been promised and assured their independence and a goverhment of their own they may be overpowered and subdued for a while but will not the insults and wrongs and tortures and devastation which they have suffered at our hands live to rankle in the bosoms of their posterity and call for a continued military force to keep them in subjection now before proceeding to ascertain what is to be the future course of the republican party with reference o the philippine islands as revealed by the two bills pending in the senate and house for the government of said islands let us see how the account stands to date but first let me advert to the proposition so often advanced by our friends upon the other side that the american people had indorsed at the polls the policy of the party in power in the philippine islands i deny it i deny that the republican party ever went before the people upon any fixed and certain policy as to the government of the islands their cry was stand by the flag uphold the army the country is prosperous let well enough alone and trust to us to deal honorably and justly with the great questions involved in our foreign possessionsand the people whose blood was still feverish from the excitement of war took them at their word but the people of this country are a just intelligent and discriminating people they are a patient and forbearing people but when their conscience is once aroused they can not be trifled with they know a great deal more about these questions than they did two years ago the facts have been slowly but surely coming to light the books have been partly opened and we see more clearly the fearful condition to which our country has been brought it is true the reserve i will not say concealment that has obtained in administration circles and the censorship which has been permitted has kept the light from a great many things that the people would like to know in regard to what has transpired in the philippines but we know enough to know that our whole course there has been an expensive and horrible one the secretary of war recently stated in a communication to the senate that it would be difficult to give in detail all of our expenses in the philippine islands up to the present time but it is not denied i believe from any source that these expenses have exceeded 300 000 000 and this does not take into account the amount we have paid are now paying and the enormous amount we will have to pay for generations yet in pensions to the dependents of those who have or may die from wounds or disease and to those who have and will contract some of the innumerable diseases to which the human race is subject i have no doubt it would be a safe prediction to say that 75 per cent of the americans who are in the service of their country in that tropical climate will finally be placed upon the pension roll no one can estimate the untold millions that the american people will yet have to pay for this purpose if the millions we have already spent in trying to subjugate the philippine people had been kept at home and wisely expended what manifold blessings it would have brought to the american people we have seen gentlemen upon this floor antagonize certain items in the agricultural appropriation bill where the question of only a few thousand dollars was involved and which was intended to aid the great agricultural interests of the country this great department of the government which is doing such a magnificent work for the farmers of the country is to receive niggardly aid at the hands of the american congress while millions are leaving the treasury of the united states in our mad prosecution of a cruel and unrighteous war we are asked to give only a few tlpusand dollars to the agricultural department to be expended under the direction of its bureau of public road inquiries for the purpose of making experiments in road building and of giving information and arousing public sentiment as to the great importance of a bettef system of public roads and yet we spend millions to establish our reputation as a world power and to oppress a weak and sorrowstricken people 10 000 miles from our capital but we are told that the government ought not to go into the business of assisting our great rural communities in securing a better system of public roads this government since its foundation has spent hundreds of millions of dollars in improving rivers and harbors to increase our commerce and build up the great cities of the country they have given away millions of acres of the public lands of the united states to aid in the construction of the great railroads that traverse our western territory in order to develop that great section and give to its people better transportation facilities we contend that if the government can engage in such enterprises as i have mentioned and a number of others that might be enumerated it is just as legitimate and proper for the government to extend its aid in perfecting a better system of public roads so as to furnish our rural communities better transportation for the products of their farms then again mir chairman under the system so wisely begun and so auspiciously being carried on of estatlishing rural free delivery for the carrying of mail to the home of every farmer and wageearner in the united states the roads of this country will eventually become a great network of postal routes over which the united states will have its mail carried to within convenient reach of every citizen of the land now for the lack of sufficient appropriations this great and benefient service of rural free delivery has not progressed with the rapidity we had hoped for or that the rural communities had a right o expect i believe it is the greatest institution ever put into operation for the direct benefit of the agricultural and wageearing classes of the country they can feel its benefits quickly and immediately for it brings them into closer touch with the educational industrial and commercial interests of the country with its complete establishment the people of all the land will become in easy communication with each other newspapers magazines and other educational agencies will daily find their way into the homes of the country boys and girls upon whom in the future as in the past must largely rest the perpetuity of our free institutions we want to see this great system expanded more rapidly i have urged its establishment and rapid extension for my conitituents with as much persistency as i could i do not complain that i have not been able to do more for i realize that the appropriation has not been sufficient to enable the authorities to press the work more vigorously if we could have kept but a part of fhe hundreds of millions this government has so recklessly expended in our inglorious war of conquest and oppression in the faraway islands of the sea we could not only have more quickly given to that great army of rural producers and taxpayers better roads aad mail facilities but we would have been better engaged in preserving the honor and traditions of our country the congress appropriates about 5 000 000 for the agricultural department of the united states as i have said before this department presided over as it is by a wise and distinguished secretary is doing through its various branches and agencies an inestimable service to the american people in general and to the american farmer in particular i woi dd not detract from any of our citizenship engaged in any of the avocations of life but i say the agricultural interests of the country deserve the most generous and liberal treatment at the hands of congress they are a patient patriotic and persevering people and have always constituted largely the foundation upon which the greatness and prosperity of our republic rests for the american farmer the policy of the republican party results in the burning of the candle at both ends they not only take from him an enormous sum in the way of taxes for the purpose of increasing the army and navy and of carryir g out their imperial policy in the orient but by reason of its unjast system of tariff taxation as it regards what the farmer has to buy we have reached the point where he is completely at the mercy of the great monopolies and trusts who a few years ago were d manding protection for their infant industries but which have n w become so overgrown that they are actually selling agricultu ral implements and other domestic articles manufactured here in america for from 25 to 75 per cent less in foreign countries than they are selling the same article here at home in other words by reason of the injustice of our tax laws they are enabled to pay the freight and other charges upon these goods to foreign countries and then sell them much cheaper there than they do to our own people here in america as an illustration of the great injustice which the protected monopolies are enabled to practice upon our own people by reason of the tariff system now in force i herewith give a list of some of the agricultural implements and other articles manufactured in this country and showing the price at which they a e sold in this country and the lesser price at which they are sold in foreign countries articles domes foreign tic price price barbed wire per 100 pounds 3 00 00 wire nails per 100 pounds 2 25 1 35 plows 14 00 12 00 horse rails per pound 17 14

375 medliuni 22 00 17 50 cheap 18 00 12 00 i do not believe that the american people will much longer submit to a policy which gives the foreign purchaser such a great advantage over our own people in the purchase of such goods of american manufacture mir chairman we are told that under domestic conditions as well as the policy of conquest and empire upon the seas the ameri can wageworker in shop and mine and factory is contented and happy and yet who has not felt in the recent past the unrest and dissatisfaction that was permeating the wageworking classes of the country notwithstanding the efforts that have recently been made to alleviate the situation and adjust the differences between capital and labor we see inaugurated in pennsylvania almost under the shadow of this capitol one of the greatest if not the greatest strikes in the history of the world does this show that labor is satisfied with present conditions not at all if such an unfortunate condition of affairs can exist now at a time when it is alleged there is unexampled prosperity what may we expect when periods of depression come i believe the conflict between capital and labor is one of the greatest dangers that threatens our republic and it is most earnestly to be hoped that some way can be found to adjust these differences upon a basis alike honorable and just to all we have discussed the policy of the administration in the philippines its conduct of the war and the effect of such a policy upon the future of this country in addition to the many millions taken from the treasury and spent in our efforts to subdue those people we are continuing to spend something like seventyfive millions per annum in the further prosecution of those efforts and where it will end no human being can tell we all know that partly by reason of the prosecution of this war the very bill now under consideration carries many millions more than similar bills lid prior to the spanishamerican war now there is one other feature of this question that i want to present to this house and the american people it is believed that upon the passage of the majority bill now pending that millions of capital will go from this country to the philippine islands for exploitation and investment ii its lands forests and mines as a nation we are yet in the morning of the development of the natural resources of our own great country and that great section from which i come is in the very infancy of its industrial development no place in the world offers greater inducement for legitimate investment than that great district which i have the honor to represent upon this floor i assert here without the fear of successful denial that no similar area upon the face of the earth can present a greater field of varied and natural resources than southwestern virginia its mountains of coal embracing the surface of almost entire counties has scarcely been touched by the hand of industry its iron lead marble barytes salt plaster zinc and other deposits are there in almost inexhaustible quantities all of which is yet in the beginning of its development its timber consists of numerous varieties of hard woods and is of the finest quality its water power is unexcelled its agricultural lands are fertile and abundantly productive its grazing lands are unsurpassed and produce cattle for export and home consumption that commands the highest price its people are honest industrious conservative lawabiding hospitable and patriotic and would welcome those who would come there with capital and an honest purpose to assist in the development of the vast resources i have described but now you propose to pursue a course which will divert millions of american capital from the development of our own resources and for the benefit of our own people to the exploitation of the lands of a wronged and helpless people on the other side of the earth the measures of thejrepublican party for the government of the philippine islands now pending in the senate and house are but another step in the onward march of empire and colonial possessions they do not provide for any government except a government of force and a perpetuation and increase in the executive administrative and judicial power of the philippine commission they do not disclose or even intimate what the future policy of the republican party is to be with reference to the islands they are framed for present emergencies and are almost entirely devoted to provisions for exploitation greed and plunder there are about 76 000 000 acres of land in the philippine islands and only about 5 000 000 are held by private title wbat a magnificent field for the american adventurer we have spent years in preparation for this the next inglorious step in the crushing of a peoples hopes and aspirations under our benevolent rule its men women and children have been starved its people have been tortured and the torch has swept its towns and villages from the face of the earth and now after all this reign of terror our army is to be kept there to hold in subjection its remaining population while the greedy speculator seeks what else he may devour no one to molest him or make him afraid the american republic with its army stands behind him and in front of him while he roams over its great public domain and takes from the forests and mines their richest treasures what a spectacle is presented to the world today england is crushing liberty and independence in the south african republics in order that shemay possess its lands and rob it of its riches and we denyinag liberty and independence to a helpless people in order that we too may become a world power rob the land of its riches and take our place beside the despotic empires of the earth the people of this country have never yet declared for such a policy nor do i believe they ever will no gentleman upon the other side will confess to the american people that he is in favor of ever permitting these islands to be admitted as states into the union upon equality among the sisterhood of states that may be the hidden purpose of some but they dare not proclaim it you do not propose now or hereafter to give them their liberty but your purpose is to hold these people as subjects and to rule them with the sword of a tyrant in one hand and the decrees of a dictator in the other you will keep on sacrificing the lives of american soldiers and spending millions upon millions of american treasure until the people shall demand that you stop your career of annihilation and spoliation until they shall demand that you shall give to these people their own government with that protection necessary for its peaceful and successful inauguration then olur soldiers can turn their faces homeward and the drain upon our treasury can cease in this course there is honor and glory for the republic in any other there is humiliation and shame we can then say to all the earth that we began as a republic and that we shall continue as a republic we can say that wherever we are forced to go it will be to carry the blessings of liberty not tyranny it will be to teach people to love us not to hate us it will be to establish republics not empires and that no black star representing a colonial despotism shall ever stain the red white and blue of the american flag"], [0.014387071132659912, 0.9856129288673401, 1, "the bill before the house has been reported as the result of the urgent recommendations contained in the presidents message on curbing the monopolistic tendencies of the trusts speaking as the official head of the republican party the president has repeatedly recognized the existence of the socalled trust evil and has in so doing proved that both parties are in accord in believing that there is an evil that should be remedied so much has been written upon the trusts so much has been spoken not only by those who know something of the subject but by those who know nothing at all that this great vital question of our day has been so obscured that at times its solution seems almost hopeless gentlemen speak of curbing the trusts and of smashing the octopus as though the deflection of the trend of existing economic conditions were as simple a performance as changing the direction of a stream of water coming from a garden hose the very terms in use in the discussion are obscure the same words are constantly used and misused to represent opposing thoughts until we know what it is we wish to cure until we know what the evil tendencies are we desire to curb it is hopeless to even pretend to undertake to touch the question some there are who argue that every combination of wealth on the face of the earth is an evil gentlemen have undertaken to prevent the concentration of wealth when they should have devoted their energies to the task of trying to reach the monopoly that concentration aided by government has made possible the sooner that we are ready to recognize the economic fact that the tendency of the age is in the direction of the concentration of energy of effort and of wealth the sooner will we be able to deal intelligently with the evil effects of concentration i take it that in speaking of trusts gentlemen do not necessarily mean trusts in the literal sense alone they usually include in their references to trusts any combination of capital which is larger than those to which they are accustomed furthermore gentlemen are in the habit of assuming that all great combinations of wealth are necessarily monopolies which is very wide of the fact it is a new phase in the development of the republican party that it should show any solicitude upon the trust question what its purposes may be what its theories are passes all human comprehension i have always been possessed of an impression that the republican party derived its sinews of war derived the very vital force which permits it to continue to exist from the treasuries of those very trusts which it is now professedly anxious to curb on the other hand the democratic position is consistent the democratic party makes no war with wealth legitimately and honestly acquired we realize that the tendency of the time is in all things in the direction of concentration we know that labor is as dependent upon capital as is capital upon labor and that the greater the honest wealth in a nation the greater will be the peoples prosperity but when great aggregations of wealth engaged in the production and the distribution of the necessities of life become monopolies then we say that it is time to call a halt not that we object to the wealth of itself for we do not but because we do object to its misapplication and its misuse and so unlike our republican opponents who are fighting like men buffeting the air blind guides leaders of the blind we are actuated by a common purpose none realizes more thoroughly than do i the vastness of the task to which we have set ourselves the united states is confronted with the most serious economic crisis in its history not even excepting that of slavery and upon its correct solution will depend the future happiness and the hope of generations yet to come broadly stated there are in the united states five classes of monopolies first those derived from patents and copyrights which are within certain limitations generally recognized as being in accordance with wise public policy second natural monopolies derived from the exclusive ownership of certain natural sources of production and which must be borne as long as the right of private property exists third monopolies due to direct government action such as streetrailway franchises in cities fourth monopolies caused by discrimination in freight rates accorded by the railroads fifth monopolies due to the protective tariff it is with the last two classes of monopoly that we are alone concerned the tendency of monopoly price is constantly upward until it reaches the point at which the law of substitution comes into playthe point at which the consumer can no longer afford to uy and must seek some cheaper substitute there are socalled trusts in every civilized country on earth but the existence of trusts does not necessarily imply monopoly wherever there is competition it follows that there can be no monopoly for the moment the effort is made to raise prices the competitor brings his goods to the market at the old price and no increase is possible in freetrade great britain whenever an effort has been made on the part of a socalled trust to raise the price of its product above that of the world market the producers of the world have at once brought their goods into competition and the effort has ignominiously failed to make it possible for a producer to raise the price of his product above that of the world market the world producer must be excluded from competition this can only be where government in its might excludes the foreign competitor by means of a protective tariff in every country of europe the railroads are either owned and operated or carefully and honestly supervised by government so the question of discriminating freight rates is nonexistent there is therefore only one possible cause of monopoly natural and direct government monopolies being excluded in any other country but ours and that cause is a protective tariff and so we find that wherever there is free trade there is no monopoly but that wherever there is a protective tariff monopoly exists its power for oppression being directly proportionate to the amount of protection accorded the problem with which we have to deal is that growing out of discriminating freight rates and a protective tariff the bill before us comes with more advertisement than any in recent years it is the result of eight months earnest effort on the part of the entire republican party it is only fair to assume for the sake of argument that its authors intend it seriously and that before final adjournment it will be enacted into law but even so what will it accomplish its purposes appear to be twofold in scope 1 the socalled publicity feature intended to furnish the public with information as to the condition of corporations engaged in interstate or foreign commerce 2 stringent provisions against discrimination on the part of common carriers in the matter of freight rates just at present it is the fashion to assume that publicity in the affairs of corporations will prove an absolute preventive of monopoly gentlemen honestly believe that if the public is in possession of the details of management of our corporations that in some mysterious peculiar way those corporations will be prevented from acquiring monopolies the gentleman who fathers the bill before us states in his report that publicity will tend to lay the foundation for more intelligent legislative action in the line of direct control of the trusts yet publicity will not make the evil effects of monopoly more evident than they are today the only result of the publicity feature of the bill will be a greater protection to the honest investor in corporate securities it may result in preventing the floating of wildcat companies and the fleecing of the bleating lambs of wall street but the wall street end if i may use that expression is the only part of the problem that publicity will reach the sections of the bill designed to strengthen existing law against discriminating freight rates may serve to prevent the growth of monopoly in the future based upon this particular wrong but they come too late even if rigidly enforced to destroy by themselves many monopolies already in existence it is a question whether they do not tend to close the stable door after the horse has been stolen and certainly their efficacy will depend upon the spirit in which they are enforced the sincerity of a lukewarm administration driven to take some action by an insistent public clamor is but a feeble reed to lean upon in the righting of a monstrous wrong the most glaring example of monopoly due to discriminating freight rates is the standard oil company thanks to the complacence thanks to the silent if not the active partnership of the railroads this vast trust has acquired so complete so absolute a monopoly that no enforcement of a prohibition against discriminating freight rates will serve to shake it the remedy must be sought elsewhere we must not flatter ourselves that by a mere stroke of the pen we can reform humanity there are some evils incident to our growth that can only be cured by the evolution of our race but there is no evil that can not be minimized by wise and just legislation and none that can not be prevented provided its anticipation renders prevention possible when the door is open and egress easy the wise man if capable of walking loses no time in leaving a burning building and does not wrap himself in asbestos for the purpose of testing the temper of the flames he prefers the obvious and simple solution of the problem rather than one which while picturesque is not unattended with danger when the cause of a disease is perfectly evident and when that cause can be readily removed the commonsense remedy is the removal of the cause we propose by this bill to make public the affairs of the trusts thereby protecting investors so far so good we propose to prevent the railroads from joining the trusts in sleeping partnership a very wise proposal worthy of the statesman who fathers it even if not original but these remedies do not go below the surface and so do not strike at the primary cause of the evil of monopoly the effort to destroy the vine by trimming its leaves is doomed from the beginning the effort to slay the monster of monopoly with paper pellets can scarcely disturb the confidence of the intended victim to propose publicity and to prevent discriminating freight rates are well enough so far as they go but as long as the government remains in active partnership with the trusts of this country just so long will the trusts be able to maintain monopolies the fundamental cause of monopoly in this country and in every country is a protective tariff just so long as we maintain a tariff which prevents competition just so long will we have monopolies i grant that it is a clever move on the part of the republican party to try to hoodwink the public by means of bills such as the one before us while professing sincerity in their efforts to destroy monopoly they offer us this bill which can accomplish but little and very carefully refrain from even by implication touching the tariff the views of the minority of the committee on the judiciary call attention to the chief omission from the bill the most dangerous class of monopolies the most oppressive the most absolute is left entirely untouched either directly or indirebtly either by statement or by suggestion there is not one word in this bill in reference to the protective tariff in the report of the gentleman from maine there is not one word of hope that the time will ever come when the republican party will dare to face the real question involved in monopolythe protective tariff now upon the statute books it is perfectly true that the standard oil companys monopoly was created because of the complaisance of the railroads and that today it is strong enough to exist without their help it is however no less true that were the countervailing duty against caspian oil repealed that product would serve as a guaranty to the people of the united states that the price of the home product could never be raised above that of the world market it is probable that were iron and steel admitted duty free the steel trust so called would continue to do business and to pay wages and dividends but it is certain that were iron and steel placed upon the free list or a revenue duty levied upon them the steel trust would find itself powerless to raise prices above the world level or to maintain its present monopoly were the duty on sugar reduced to the maximum revenueraising point it is very possible that the american sugar refining company would be obliged to go out of business but as it exists today thanks to government bounty its stockholders when investing take a gamblers chance that the law will remain unrepealed and for this very reason receive proportionately enormous dividends the benefit to the people of the united states resulting from free sugar would far more than offset the loss of government charity to the owners of the trusts whatever justification there may have existed for a policy of protection in the early days of our history that justification has long since disappeared we have become so great so rich so prosperous american labor is so efficient american ingenuity and american brains so competent that we can compete on equal terms with every other nation on earth the only possible result of protection today is the granting of government subsidies to producers and distributers who do not need them we may deceive ourselves by specious arguments we may talk of the unrest that would be created in the business community of the country by a revision of the tariff and yet the fact remains that without a revision the problem can not be solved the party to which i have the honor to belong was founded upon certain fundamental principles which are unchanging and unchangable one of those principles is that there should be no taxation except for purposes of government economically and honestly administered that principle is as vital today as it was a hundred years ago and but for the violation of that principle monopolies would not exist try as it may the party in power can not shift the issue and can not shirk the responsibilty of its own acts by this bill upon which it has staked its future it proves its own hypocrisy the republican party has been in power for six years the president and both branches of congress are republican a revision of the tariff is demanded by the people the necessity for that revision is conceded by farsighted and patriotic republicans and yet no revision is proposed nor promised and this miserable makeshift is offered as a substitute a makeshift of which the best that can be said is that it is better than nothing at all the people of this country are hardheaded and intelligent they are conservative and slow in reaching their conclusions but when they have once made up their minds as to what they want they ultimately obtain it should this bill be enacted as we must assume it will be it can only be a question of months when it will prove its own impotence it would have been far wiser from a political point of view far more courageous from a manly standpoint had the republican party openly acknowledged its solicitude for monopoly the feat of running with the fox and hunting with the hounds is as impossible of accomplishment in statecraft as in the hunting field there was a time when republicans were not ashamed to boast of the artificial industries they had created now that their monster has grown strong violent and disreputable they disclaim all responsibility for his existence they even cut his acquaintance when they meet him on the street but they nevertheless continue to feed him by stealth when he calls after nightfall at the basement door they talk loudly against the evils of monopoly but let the latter perfectly understand that it has nothing to fear as long as they remain in power no halfway measures can avail no legislation that does not go to the root of the matter can be efficacious there is but one solution of the problem there is but one cure for the evil that is the absolute dissolution of the unrighteous partnership that exists between government and monopoly in the protective tariff"], [0.016718566417694092, 0.9832814335823059, 1, "the republican party of this country has definitely determined to enter into a system of colonial conquest and government when this question was last up for debate in this house we of the opposition contended that such a policy was not only unwise and dangerous to the continued liberty and prosperity of our people but also not permissible under the plain provisions of our federal constitution recently the supreme court of the united states by a decision reversing former decisions has seen proper to amend the federal constitution and declare that congress can govern acquired territory outside the prohibitions and requirements of the constitution it has specifically decided that that clause in the constitution which declares that all duties imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the united states applies to the states only and not to the territories and other possessions by this decision it declares that congress has power to impose duties upon goods coming from the territories into the states and also from the states into the territories it confers upon congress absolute power of taxation in the territories unrestrained by any provision in the federal constitution by a more recent decision the court has declared that the philippine islands and other possessions are not foreign but domestic territory and as the dingley bill by its terms limits its collection of duties to importations from foreign countries it does not apply to the philippines hence no duty can be collected on importations from those islands until congress shall so direct ever since we have had control of these islands until this decision the duties imposed by the dingley bill have been collected on all goods brought into this country from them this bill proposes to continue the rates of the dingley bill upon all importations into this country from the philippine islands in this respect it proposes to treat those islands and their inhabitants absolutely as foreigners their commerce their trade and their importations are to be subjected to the same heavy exactions the same rigorous restrictions that are applied to strangers another provision of this bill fixes absolutely all customs duties to be collected on importations into the philippines and in addition an export duty on certain goods when shipped from there this feature of the bill treats the inhabitants of the philippine islands as subjects of this country to be governed absolutely by the will of congress thus by this bill when concessions and trade benefits are needed by the unfortunate inhabitants of the philippine islands they are treated as strangers and foreigners but when exactions and taxations are to be imposed they are treated as subjects this irreconcilable dual position of subject and stranger is created by this bill and illustrates the policy of the republican party in the formulation of its colonial system the principles upon which such a bill is founded are repugnant to every principle of justice and right and antagonistic to all our traditions and institutions by this bill congress assumes the right and does exercise the power to fix the rates and the conditions upon which the goods of the philippines can be sold in the markets of the united states and also the rates and conditions upon which our goods can be sold in the markets of those islands in other words we practically fix the price at which they must sell their goods to us and also the price at which they must purchase ours this is precisely the same power that was claimed by the british parliament when we were colonies the british parliament then contended that the power of parliament was absolute in the american colonies and that parliament had the right to impose taxes here and to fix the duty on importations from the colonies into great britain and also the duty on importations from great britain into the colonies our fathers denounced this assumption of power as tyranny and despotism when it was sought to be exercised they rebelled separated themselves from great britain and established this union our fathers contended that the vast power to control absolutely the trade and commerce all the buying and the selling of the commodities of one nation by another is such a dangerous power so liable to abuse that no just nation would ever try to exercise it and that it should never be conceded yet by this bill this congress will exercise in a more aggravated form precisely the same power claimed and sought to be exercised against us by the british parliament when we were colonies great britain could not have succeeded in the revolutionary war without destroying british institutions and ultimately the liberty and freedom of her people we can not enact this bill without destroying our institutions without abandoning all our glorious traditions and perverting our principles of justice and liberty which have been the foundations of our governmental structure let us examine this bill in detail and see if in exercising the vast power of congress the scale of justice will be balanced evenly between the inhabitants of the united states and those of the philippine islands those who advocate this policy in reference to the philippines are perpetually proclaiming their good intentions and benevolent purposes toward those people they assert that they intend to give them a full measure of justice and opportunity for development and progress let us measure declarations with deeds let us compare promises and performances let us examine party platforms with party legislation and by these ascertain the real disposition of those at present in power toward the philippine islands this bill as i have said before fixes the duty upon philippine goods when imported here and also the duty upon united states goods when imported there let us compare the duties thus imposed and we will get some idea of the injustice and great discriminations of this bill one of the great industries of the philippine islands is tobacco we are also a tobacco producing and exporting country this bill permits our tobacco to be exported and sold in the philippine islands upon the payment of a duty of 22 cents per pound yet by this bill their tobacco can be imported here and sold in our markets only on the payment of a duty of 1 85 per pound in addition to a heavy export duty one of the enterprises of these islands is the manufacture of cigars by this bill our cigars when sold in their markets will have to pay a duty of only 88 cents per pound while theirs when imported here and sold in our markets will be required to pay a duty of 4 50 per pound and in addition an ad valorem duty of 25 per cent with also an export duty hemp is another one of their large industries our hemp can enter their markets with a duty of 11 per ton while theirs when sold here must pay a duty of 20 per ton another one of their large industries is sugar raising under this bill we can import sugar there from the united states from porto rico and from hawaii upon the payment of about 17 per ton while their sugar when sold here or in either of the two islands named must pay an exorbitant duty of about 36 per ton in addition to an export duty we are told that these islands have fine deposits of minerals which in time will bring to them great wealth let us see how this bill proposes to encourage and develop the mineral interests of the philippines under this bill our iron ore can be shipped there upon the payment of a duty of 25 cents per ton while on theirs will be required a duty of 67 cents per ton an examination will show that the same glaring discriminations the same gross injustice exist all through the schedules of this bill the rates of duty imposed here on importations from the philippine islands are from one end of this bill to the other heavy exorbitant and restrictive they are such as can give no encouragement to enterprise there no development to trade or commerce the duties imposed on importations from this country into the philippines are such as it is thought will benefit those who are especially engaged in exploiting the islands for their own enrichment i will guarantee that no bill was ever before presented to a legislative body intrusted with power to fix absolutely the commercial relations between two peoples which was so oppressive in its exactions upon the one people who are helpless and powerless and at the same time so generous in its concessions to the people who alone are possessed of the power every line of this bill bristles with inequality the american people are too just and humane to approve its unfair and oppressive provisions they have no desire to despoil the poor and wretched filipinos the paltry profits of the unjust trade relations here sought to be established would be poor recompense to us for loss of reputation for just and humane treatment to the helpless and dependent i invoke those religious people of this country whose only desire in the matter is to better these people to pass judgment upon this pernicious bill this bill carries to these people no blessings no benefits it gives no encouragement to enterprise no stimulus to development it brings to them the burdens that we refused to bear ourselves they witness a congress 8 000 miles from them in which they have no voice no representative absolutely controlling their commerce fixing their trade relations imposing taxesall without consulting their wishes or regarding their interests this bill is worse in principle worse in every feature than any legislation the british parliament ever sought to enact against the american colonies if this country shall fix the duties and the conditions upon which philippine goods shall enter the markets of this country a legislative body representing the filipinos should certainly fix the duties and conditions upon which our goods shall enter their markets to deny this is to deny every elementary principle of justice and right we inherited it from our british ancestors and have persistently maintained that the people who pay taxes should impose them charles i of england lost his crown and his head in trying to deprive the english people of this inherent right if congress is determined permanently to hold the philippine islands and never to accord to them independence it should at once create a just and liberal territorial government for the islands representing these people and their interests which should be empowered to impose taxes and customs duties there if we are to have colonial possessions let us at least follow the present liberal and generous policy of great britain and not the narrow and oppressive one pursued by spain this bill adopts spanish and not british methods of dealing with colonies this illiberal policy will produce the same discontent the same rebellion which ever prevailed in spanish colonies as we are now told that peace exists in the philippines there is no excuse for not according these people a liberal territorial government with powers of imposing taxation and other administration to grant this at once would go far toward reconciling those people to our sovereignty i appeal to those who are bent upon this policy to let our first experiment in colonial govermnent be marked by liberality not selfishness by breadth not narrowness by justice not iniquity the fit place for such a bill as this is the cortes of spain and not the congress of the united states this bill is so indefensible that its authors apologize for it and claim that it is only a temporary nmeasure this measure should not disgraceeven for a daythe statute books of a free and enlightened people besides the enterprises and industries of the philippines can not be promoted or benefited by legislation which its authors claim they intend to change soon capital will not invest in the islands enterprises will not be undertaken trade and commerce will not grow so long as uncertainty exists and changes are contemplated justice wisdom and business sense require that at this time a definite and permanent policy in reference to the trade and commercial relations of these islands should be fixed there will be no development and no progress there until this is accomplished temporary measures only increase uncertainty and unrest they bring no relief but i am satisfied that the characterization of this bill as a temporary measure is merely a pretense to persuade many to its support who could not otherwise be induced to do so i am satisfied that this bill if passed will fix for years to come the commercial relations and customs duties between this country and the philippine islands besides this measure will tend to intensify the dissatisfaction and unrest in the philippines these people can not be expected to quietly acquiesce in the spirit of colonial favoritism exhibited by this government when we enact this measure the people of the philippine islands will see the sugar of two of our coloniesporto rico and hawaiiimported into this country and sold free of duty while theirs must pay an exorbitant duty they will see that the tobacco and cigars of porto rico are given free access to our markets while duties that amount to absolute exclusion are imposed upon theirs they will experience that this government is engaging in colonial favoritism of which they are the least favored people will submit to such gross inequalities only when compelled by force to do so every instinct of manhood rebels against such unjust discriminations this country can never successfully conduct a colonial system unless it is formed in justice and equality a colony that realizes that it is receiving a less measure of justice and liberty than is being extended to others will ever be in a state of discontent and rebellion if we are to have colonies and outlying possessions prudence and wisdom demand that all should be treated alike that there should be no favoritism no partiality the injustice of this bill to the people of the philippine islands and the indisposition on the part of the republican party to treat them with fairness and liberality becomes more striking and glaring when we compare its provisions with the recommendations recently made by the president and the secretary of war concerning cuba the president in his annual message says that we are under moral obligations to give cuban imports into the united states a substantial reduction from present tariff duties the secretary of war is even more insistent upon this than the president the two chief products of cuba like those of the philippines are sugar and tobacco this administration favors a great reduction from the dingley rates on sugar and tobacco when imported from cuba and yet sustains this bill which collects the entire dingley rates on sugar and tobacco imported from the philippines and in addition an export duty the american people will not sanction this our obligations to cuba have been fully and completely discharged when they have established a free and independent government and we have withdrawn from the island this will soon happen they owe us a boundless debt of gratitude when they were oppressed by spain and their cause was hopeless at a great expense and sacrifice to ourselves we espoused their cause drove their oppressors from the island and gave to them freedom and independence at much expense we have kept peace and order there and administered the government pending the formation by them of a safe and stable government no other nation has ever bestowed upon another more generous substantial and disinterested favors than we have bestowed upon cuba with the filipinos the case is reversed the filipinos had overthrown spanish authority except in manila before our troops arrived they could have deceiiber 17 driven their oppressors from the islands without our aid they were our valuable allies in a war that we had undertaken for the liberation of cuba they desired to establish an independent government under our guidance which would have made to us generous trade concessions we denied this request and by war and conquest extended our dominion over them we now hold them as colonies and as a part and parcel of this country we have granted to cuba and she has decided to become a state free and independent of us i can see no moral obligations on our part to make any concessions to cuba except such as our own interest may demand if reductions in tariff duties are to be made for the introduction of sugar and tobacco into our markets the claims of the philippine islands are vastly superior to those of cuba the profits to be derived from the sale of these two products in the markets of this country should certainly go if possible to our own people instead of to foreigners i can not understand the wisdom of a polic that urges such generous concessions to cuba and imposes such heavy exactions and restrictions upon the philippines so long as the philippine islands are a part of this country justice and wisdom both demand that their sugar and tobacco interests should be encouraged and developed rather than the sugar and tobacco interests of cuba but the hostility of the republican party and of those in power to the philippine islands is further exemplified and in a manner that can admit of no excuse no defense as i have previously said this bill imposes on the sugar of the philippines the high rates of the dingley bill our government has already signed treaties with great britain for the barbados for british guiana for jamaica and for bermuda which have been sent to the senate and are being pressed by the present administration and the republican party for ratification and all provide for a reduction of 124 per cent from the duties imposed by the dingley bill upon all sugar imported from them into the united states a treaty has also been signed with argentina which has been sent to the senate and is likewise urged for ratification that provides for a reduction of 20 per cent from the rates of the dingley bill on sugar imported into the united states from argentina the republican party places itself squarely before the people and the country as favoring that sugar shall be imported into this country from british possessions and from argentina at more greatly reduced rates than it shall be imported from our own possessions in the philippine islands no moral obligation can be urged for the extenuation of the extension of these rebates and privileges to foreigners while they are denied to our own people ifthis policy is to prevail in order to obtain trade advantages with the united states it is better to be a british subject than to be a citizen of the united states history will fail to furnish another such example where a government has so wantonly and openly ignored he rights and privileges of its own people in order to subserve foreigners and strangers i believe the american people will repudiate a discrimination so suicidal so unjust as this they would greatly prefer consuming sugar raised by the unfortunate inhabitants of the philippine islands than sugar raised by british subjects i appeal to his congress to its sense of justice and right to its prudence and its wisdom not to inflict upon these defenseless and helpless people such hardships and such inequalities do not teach them that dependence on america means spoliation let them feel that we are their friends not their foes that our purposes are to aid them not to despoil them to encourage and not to retard them sir this bill will continue for the future practically the same commercial relations with the philippine islands that have existed during the last two years as this bill proposes to continue present conditions it may be well to inquire what have been the profits and benefits to the united states under them during the ast calendar year as shown by the report of the secretary of war the entire importations into the philippine islands amounted to 24 284 666 of this amount the united states furnished 2 061 804 of which 1 102 604 was for beer wine and whisky"], [0.018221836537122726, 0.018221836537122726, 0, "this bill has been on the calendar since last march but instead of moving to suspend the rules and pass the ill with the amendments it was thought best that it be considered in the house as in committee of the whole because there might be some additional amendments suggested and some question as to some amendments i will say briefly in outlining this bill that it is a measure that was introduced to carry out the suggestion of the president in his message to congress last december the details of the bill briefly are these there are certain reservations that have been fully surveyed their boundaries definitely established and their permanency agreed upon there are certain other forest reserves whose boundaries are yet in piocess of alignment this proposition is to permit the president to issue an executive order and transfer to the department of agriculture such of the reservations only as have been finally and fully established as to their boundary lines it also provides second that with the consent or at the request of the governor of any state in which a forest reserve is located the whole or a part of such reservation may be set apart as a game preserve now practically these are the two features of this bill at the present we have two bureaus of forestry one under the department of the interior and the other under the department of agriculture the department of agriculture is better adapted for the permanent care and permanent protection of such of the reserves as have been fully and finally established as to their boundaries on the other hand as to those reservations whose boundaries are still in process of delimitation the department of the interior is now the better to control the same in a general way this bill provides for these two matters as to creating forest reserves or transferring them or portions of them into game preserves it was thought best not to attempt to do that in any state without the consent of the state that would result first in having a concerted action on the part of the state and a mutuality of action which would lead to harmony and prevent the establishment of such reserves where they are not wanted on the other hand it would enable the executive with the consent of the governor of the state to set apart one of these reserves in each state or a part thereof or even more if the governor of the state should so agree as a haven of refuge in which the wild animals and birds could breed and from that point spread out over the state this would not interfere with the other uses of the forest reserve in other words it would set apart a breeding ground where desired by states for that purpose this is practically all there is in this bill and with this explanation i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.022261381149291992,

and class yet these degenerate sons of grand men are endeavoring to ingratiate themselves with the useless figurebeads of effete monarchies it is good to know that there are yet some who are able to speak and who are willing to endure the odium of unpopularity for the sake of warning the american people again against the insidious wiles of foreign influence and to urge that the jealousy of a free peeple ought to be constantly awake since history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government i hope that your frankness will not militate

the white house down rotten degenerate royalty i what have we asan americanpeople to dowith it whetherit be england germany or any other of the socalled princely powers it is a shame that the president even though he is there by accident and through the assassins bullet should so far forget his duty to the american people as to take such notice of the coronation of an english king as to debauch the american sentiment and principles by sending a member of his family to he tutored in the way of rotten royalty and spend the peoples money to entertain another accident of birth the brother of another degenerate socalled emperor it is enough to make the true american how his head in shame and hide from the public gaze we are drifting rapidly toward centralization of pewer brought

gentleman from massachusetts it was pitched upon a high plane and ought to be sufficient to induce the house to support the pending bill but as excellent as his address was and however much merit this bill may have it should have by way of amendment more effective provisions for the suppression of the trust evil in behalf of the minority of the committee on the judiciary of this house i am authorized to say that we will support this bill not because it meets the popular demand but because we hope to amend it and that if we can not do that then we will vote for it for the reason that it has at least a little merit i want to indorse what the gentleman has said as to the conduct of our consideration of trust measures before the committee on the judiciary and as he violated no committee secret i violate none in saying that those discussions took no party tinge upon questions of law but it perhaps would not be out of place to say that there as here whenever a proposition has been or is urged for the enactment of any law that militates against any party policy or cherished economic theory it did and always will provoke opposition on partisan lines the gentleman was correct in telling the house that this bill as now reported is predicated solely upon the commerce clause of the constitution if you have done the minority the honor to read their views you will readily see the difference between the minority of the committee on the judiciary and the majority it is apparent as has already been disclosed here today that the majority of that committee and the majority of this housemore than that that the majority of the other legislative branch of the government and the head of the republican party in the white house as welldiffer from the democratic party in that in all their demands for legislation for the control of the trusts and for the suppression of the criminal trade conspiracies republicans now ground all their proposed remedies upon one constitutional provisionthat is the power of congress to regulate interstate commerce it has been said in substance by some great statesmanburke perhaps but i care not who said itthat around the question of taxation the greatest battles of civilization have been fought and around this question today the battle of the people against the giant combines engaged in criminal conspiracy in the restraint of trade for the purpose of limiting production of enhancing prices of lowering wages of crushing out the independent producer of destroying the business man of moderate meansaround this question and taxation as a remedy must be fought the battle against the tyranny of monopoly and the oppression of unlimited and uncontrolled wealth there is more than one provision of the federal constitution that those of us on this side invoke to meet this evil we are not content with singling out one provision of the organic law of the union to meet every phase of the trust wrongs and injuries the argument of the gentleman from massachusetts just delivered well illustrates the futility of invoking the commerce clause solely he points out certain corporations that perhaps can not be reached by the commerce power of congress and he undertakes to show that certain corporations or trusts can not be reached by the taxing power of the federal government i recur to what happened in the fiftyfifth congress for the purpose of showing that the power of taxation was then demanded in this house by a distinguished democrat to meet the trust evil which then was merely threatened as compared now with its subsequent and present development let me refer to the fact that when the dingley bill was presented here the distinguished kentuckian offered a provision to tax the trust corporations engaging in interstate commerce and further that repeatedly during the debate on that measure and since democrats have offered provisions to remit certain tariff a taxes in order that combines built up and fostered by the abuse of the taxing power should not be sheltered behind the tariff wall permit me to digress for one moment for the sake of history in the fiftysixth congress the two parties assumed a different attitude for in the latter days of the long session of that congress within six days of the adjournment of that session two measures were brought into this house and briefly debated and put through here by the majority attention to this fact is invited so that the gentlemen of the republican party may know that while their distinguished president is discussing the doctrine of evolution in the next campaign as he did in the last he may be reminded that the present pretended hostility of the republican party to the trusts is to some extent evolution from their position that no effective remedy was possible without an amendment of the constitution you remember that the proposition was brought forward to amend the constitution of the united states you will remember that the chairman of the committee on the judiciary at that time made a labored able and extensive speech of perhaps three hours in length in which he took the position that congress was powerless to deal with trade monopolies and restraints without a constitutional amendment i shall quote from his speech to show that the contention of the republican party at that time is variant from their present assumed attitude a distinguished member of that committee mr overstreet who wrote the report on the bill called the littlefield bill in the fiftysixth congress took the position that publicity as a remedy was worthy of no consideration he then reported that bill eschewing the publicity feature contrast that with the repeated later demand of president roosevelt for publicity hear also attorneygeneral knox at pittsburg last october they corporations should be subject to visitorial supervision and full and accurate information as to the operations should be made regularly at reasonable intervals secrecy in the conduct and result of operation is unfair to the nonmanaging stockholders and should as well for reasons of state be prohibited by law and now we have this bill with elaborate provisions for publicity so that we congratulate you gentlemen that you have evoluted from the position of demanding a constitutional amendment as the sine qua non to deal with trusts to your present insistance that publicity will do good and is the best remedy hereafter when you discuss the darwinian theory which is applicable in the case of mollusks and monkeys make some application of it to the republican party that party has at last reached the monkey stage where it has vertebre and a tail and monkeylike imitates some of the good actions of the democratic party we challenge you to read the debates of the fiftysixth congress i have them here i go loaded for you if you want to see them come over here and get them i challenge you to read these debates right here and see if you gentlemen did not take the position that you were powerless without a constitutional amendment you cried out for it you said that the interstatecommerce clause was inadequate learned lawyers made ingenious arguments to support that contention ah but in the process of evolution when you have reached the vertebrate state when you cease to be oysters clams orshall i say lobsters when you have passed to that stage of evolution you now come to the democratic position that there is sufficient power in the congress under the constitution to deal with these gigantic trade conspiracies"], [0.024468839168548584, 0.9755311608314514, 1, "the time allotted for the discussion of measures in this house is so exceedingly short that i count it a matter for congratulation that i have been able to secure a few moments during which to discuss a proposition which i believe to be of great importance to the american people the plan of the majority on this floor is rather peculiar important measures are allowed but a few hours of discussion unimportant measures are given ample time this is certainly an evidence of great boldness upon the part of the majority the more unimportant a measure is my observation has been the more time there is allowed for its discussion but measures affecting the property or happiness of millions of people are rushed through with unseemly haste and a minute or two is exceedingly precious now another evidence of the boldness of the majority was the rule which their committee brought in on yesterday not permiting any amendments to the bill which was then under discussion if there had been any opportunity for amendment humbly as a new member i should have been glad to submit this for their consideration whenever any article manufactured in the united states is sold at a lower price abroad than in the united states the president having ascertained such to be the case is authorized and empowered to suspend the collection of the duty on similar articles imported into this country from abroad for such length of time as the president may deem expedient the republicans tell us that they have a bold party and that they dare do anything they were not bold enough however to permit an amendment of this kind they were not bold enough to give gentlemen an opportunity to vote upon an amendment of this sort yet it is stated in the public prints and i have never seen it denied that the great trusts of this country the great industrial combinations are selling their products cheaper abroad thau they are to the people of the united states for instance they are selling farm implements grain drills harrows and things of that kind cheaper to the people of south america than they are to our own people here in the united states they are selling petroleum outfits cheaper to the people at baku on the shores of the caspian sea than they are to the people of beaumont in the state of texas they are treating us worse than they treat foreigners more than that mrchairman they are treating us worse than foreigners treat us it seems to me that no gentleman can stand on this floor in the light of this condition of affairs and deny that proposition i desire to emphasize air chairman that these great industrial combinations fostered protected and built up by the republican party are treating us not only worse than they treat foreigners but they are treating us worse than foreigners treat us all that we ask is that we be put upon an equality with heathens and aliens now for the edification of our republican friends i should like to read from a declaration of their convention you would never hear anything about this if some gentleman did not read it but i find in the republican platform of the year 1900 these words we recognize the necessity and propriety of honest cooperation of capital to meet new businese conditions and especily to extend our rapidly increasing tradesounds like you might trust that does it not but we condemn all conspiracies and combinations intended to restrict business to create monopolies to limit production or to control prices nobody would ever have known this last was in the republican platform except by referring to the original document now this amendment which i should like to see tested it seems to me is above criticism even from a republican standpoint of course as a good democrat i say it does not go far enough it puts in the hands of your president the power to suspend the duty upon articles which come in competition with articles of american manufacture sold cheaper abroad than they are at home these monopolies have become so absolute and so tryannical that they fix their price according to competition where the competition is small the price is high and where the competition is great the price is lower our people at home are absolutely at their mercy the law of supply and demand is abolished and in order to aid these combinations to oppress the people more effectively the republican party has surrounded this country with a tariff wall which shuts off competition from every other part of the universe there is nothing complex about the proposition to put these articles on the free list it does not require the president to determine whether any particular corporation is a trust or not it does not require him to ascertain whether two or more persons have conspired together to regulate prices there is no difficulty about it there is no legal obstacle in the way there need be no fear of any shifting decision of one majority by the highest court in the land the proposition would apply to the individual as well as the corporation it is simply the suspension of duty on every article which comes in competition with articles sold by american manufacturers cheaper abroad than at home the president could easily determine this you say you do not fear him he is a protectionist he is a bold man heis a warrior he leads a strenuous life you need not fear to put yourself in his hands you say and i say we believe he is honest now if these things be true let us offer an amendment of this kind to some bill and let us give to theodore roosevelt republican soldier warrior the absolute power to suspend the duty on all articles which are sold cheaper abroad than they are at home you condemned all conspiracies to restrict business or create monopolies in the platform of your party we are ready to help you carry out your platform pledges if you do not do this then all we ask of you is that in the year 1904 you have the courage to nominate for president of the united states theodore roosevelt upon a platform which honestly declares the true principles of your party yes in some respects your president is bold ho is bold enough to allow the stars and stripes to continue to float over polygamy and human slavery during the civil war the great lincoln issued his proclamation giving freedom to every slave in the united states now you say your president did not enter into a contract with any one of the native rulers of the philippine islands whereby we are bound to protect slavery over there you can not deny that human beings are held in bondage by other human beings in one of the islands at least why has not your president the courage of great mr lincoln why does not he issue his proclamation and declare free every slave in the islands you say the war is ended gentlemen on this floor who have recently visited this extraconstitutional territory of ours tell us they have seen and talked with slaves your president is czar of the islands let him issue his edict and remove this stain before history shall indelibly record it but we have been told that our party is dead that the democratic party is dead we heard something of that kind of talk in 1872 then they said that the democratic party was dead in 1876 they found out differently they got the presidency in 1876 in a way they have never been proud of there is an odor about that affair which lingers to this day in 1880 they said that the democratic party was dead in 1884 they found that it was still alive in 1888 they said the democratic party was dead in 1892 they found out the old party was still alive they say now that the old democratic party is dead but in 1904 they will again find out that the old party is still alive thank god our republic can boast of the greatest trusts on earth it is too bad we must be constantly punished by them you said if the government would protect these great corporations so that they could become rich it would enable them to sell their goods cheaper and enable them to pay more for the labor necessary in the manufacture of their goods my observation has been that these huge combinations of capital get just as much as they can for their goods and get their labor just as cheap as they can this is human nature anyway men do not pay wages according to their ability to pay most men get all they can in this world the laboring man is not fooled by this argument any longer he knows that he must look out for himself and he is wise when he does it the trusts have outgrown our country they tell us they want the world for their market if so it is only fair that they should have the world to compete with these things can not endure always unless the conscience of the republic has become paralyzed there must be there will be a change we have the right on our side and in the end the right will win it is not right to shoot down men who are entitled to freedom just as much as we are it is not right to allow laws to endure which permit individuals and corporations to charge us more for their products than they do foreigners if anything in the world is wrong these things are wrong if there is ever a change it must be it will be wrought by the democratic party it may be of interest to you republicans to know that in the year 1904 you will be confronted by a united democratic party and nobody knows better than you what that means hoist your banner if the truth shall be written upon it your motto should be this slavery or death to the filipinos protection for the trusts at home upon ours shall be freedom for the filipino equal and exact justice to all men equal opportunity to every citizen state and section and upon this issue with confidence we shall appeal to the sense of right

injected into this bill is that after we have surrendered to the corporations the profit and power to be derived from issuing money made a legal tender to all the banks and to all the myriad necessities of the government yet we do not propose here in this bill to have the united states guarantee the final redemption of these notes in gold if for any reason the banks shall fail to make them good it is true that in return for a quasi guaranteeing of their notes the banks give the government a first lien upon their assets but the trouble with this is that while it is sauce for the note holder it is decidedly cold victuals for the depositor who frequently even now receives little enough from the failed bank under such a system as this it is quite evident that the depositor would fare far worse than he now does in case of failure because the government is bound to realize upon the assets in order to reimburse the guaranty fund in case of failure gentlemen say further that this money is not guaranteed by the government of the united states now i want to say here that when it comes to the question of money you can not altogether depend upon the experience of other nations as to how the people of this country will receive that money we have had a large experience in unguaranteed notes during the statebank issues and the people of the united states will look with suspicion upon any money unless it is guaranteed by the national government i remember in 1894 when this assetcurrency plan was first submitted a bankers convention lip here in the state of pennsylvania was discussing the principles involved in asset currency and after several gentlemen had dilated upon the security of this plan and the expediency of it a gentleman arose who was evidently old in experience and said gentlemen i do not care how you may secure this money and how expedient it may appear unless the american government guarantees your money the american people will not have it because of their experience in the past after all these gentlemen have based the real security of their money upon the great privilege of governmental legal tender and governmental monopoly their money is good for the same reason that the silver and united states notes are good every one of them is good because every one of them is an american dollar a legal tender for the billions of dollars due the banks and the billions of dollars due the national government and with limited issue that demand will sustain it everything that is behind the flag is behind that dollarour matchless credit our boundless resources our illihitable possibilities the allcontrolling allcompelling allabsorbing demands of american business and american commerce the only way that you can assault that dollar is to assault your nations dignity and honor and dispute her proud position as first in the grand galaxy of nations to deny that dollar is to deny your countrys present greatness her future grandeur and her glory to deny it is to deny the hope and aspiration that animates the breast of every good american citizenthat columbia shall yet sit enthroned here between her silver seas the undisputed queen and master of the commercial world in conclusion this bill is largely experimental and in its recognized principles it follows the line of absolute monopoly which underlies and supports every empire in the world today it is the enthronement of monopoly it is the very apotheosis of special privilege by the granting of governmental favors we have enthroned monopoly in control of the transportation of the country by the granting of special privileges we have enthroned monopoly in control of the industrial interests of the country and monopoly has now begun its assault upon that last citadel of the peoples libertythe peoples money it is the last great source of privilege and power yet remaining in control of the national government and it is the record of history that when once a brave and free people such as ours ever loses control of a great and priceless privilege such as this it has always been lost to them forever because i believe the bill is experimental monopolistic and unsound

friend with all his ingenuity to devise any scheme which would make a washingtonian love to pay taxes other objections urged to the passage of a personaltax law are of a character which tempts me to exclaim in the language of mark antony if you have tears prepare to shed them now mr roessle according to the post said taxes are so heavy in washington that people are being driven to suburban towns in maryland and virginia mr parker is quoted in the same paper as saying it would ruin washington to increase taxes now it would drive away from here just the people we have to depend upon the people who have large holdings of personal property who would he most affected by the levy of a persoml tax are the rich men who have come here to reside this is a resident city not a business city if a personal tax is imposed on the wealthy resident he will move away if this be true if there be a rich man in this city so purely selfish and so very parsimonious and niggardly that he would change his domicile rather than submit to the just and equitable provisions of a law that exacts of him only the same reasonable tribute it demands of his less fortunate neighbor then in my judgment the sooner he moves the better if he has no broader conception of the duties of citizenship if he has no loftier aspiration than to become a parasite upon the community he is not a desirable citizen here and will not be elsewhere but go where he may he will find no place of retreat no haven of security from taxation such as is now being enjoyed by the owners of great wealth in washington yes he may take the wings of morning and fly to the uttermost parts of the earth but when he alights thank god he will find on the one hand a vigilant assessor clothed with an inquisitorial blank to force him to uncover and disclose his wealth and on the other a diligent tax collector armed with legal process to compel him to render unto c9sar the things that are cmsars and in the end when hope has departed and he is engulfed in deep despair he may be led to proclaim in the language of the blind poetme miserable which way i fly is hell myself am hell i hope a law subjecting all personal property to taxation will pass at this session regardless of all opposition that has arisen or may arise to defeat it it is a shame that it has been so long deferred in no section of the united states are the people treated with such unprecedented and inexcusable partiality and favoritism as in the district of columbia the time honored but almost obsolete principle of equal rights to all and special privileges to none which we all still profess to respect seems to have no application here it has been ruthlessly brushed aside and repudiated in our discriminating and fostering care of the interests and welfare of the inhabitants of this city and district the civilservice law expressly provides that appointments to public service in the departments at washington shall be apportioned among the states and territories and the district of columbia according to population as shown by the last census this has not been done this provision of the law has been ignored and defiantly violated in the interest of resident place hunters in utter disregard of the rights of citizens of the states the law as administered has become a doorway which opens easily to the favored citizen of this city and enables him to reach the goal of his ambitiona desirable and lucrative position in public serviceand then abruptly closes with a selfacting doublecombination lock to the vast majority of applicants from the states it seems to me the law as administered has become a farce and a fraud and that it ought to be promptly repealed unless its provisions can be fairly executed in a pamphlet recently

medicine the bank counter the business world or the farm jasies h kyle came to the senate from the clerical profession and was one of a few from that class who served in congress during the time of his incumbency many times no doubt in following his calling as a clergyman he had occasion to speak feelingly and soothingly over the remains of the dead many times no doubt in his ministry he dwelt upon the virtues of the leparted gave consolation to the stricken and drew a moral for the benefit and guidance of all and of him as one numbered with the dead we speak today pursuaing his duties as a clergyman in the agitating time and political upheaval of 1890 he was caught in the sweep of the reform movement that passed over the west touched with the general dissatisfaction with conditions then existing and thrilled with the general desire for a change new to the political field he very naturally became as enthusiastic upon the questions then agitating the masses as his temperament and his calling would permit elected to the state senate he served but a short time when at the end of a bitter contest he was taken up and elected to the united states senate it happened during a portion of his service here that i was quartered in the same house at which he also lodged and naturally we became quite well acquainted and naturally too we and others of similar minds upon many of the political questions of the day often talked over the issues and the prospects at that time senator kyle was full of the sentiments which animated and directed the course of those who had placed him in office he was full of the reform movement of the day full of the belief that legislation had been turned into the wrong channels that the many had not derived from lawmakers and laws and the executors of the laws the benefits and security justly due them and that something ought to be done to change the general coursethe lawmakers should look to and strive to promote and protect the interests of the many to a greater extent and the interests of the few to a lesser extent that senator kyle was an amiable man kindly disposed and of generous impulses i think all who knew him can truthfully testify he was not aggressive nor obtrusive he had that amiable disposition was of that wellbalanced and placid temperament which always go with regard for the feelings opinions and interests of others he never pushed in an aggressive way or in an offensive manner his own opinions or projects he passed through his senatorial service in a quiet and unostentatious undemonstrative way at a time when there was a good deal of turmoil and a good deal of feeling in the political world as his first senatorial term approached its close and the time came for tie election of his successor those who knew his sentiments and feelings and his course here were hopeful that he might be returned i recollect talking with him upon the eve of departure for the west for the contest which before his return would be settled for before he would be with us here again it would be known whether lie would come as the senatorelect or as the defeated aspirant for the senatorial succession it was known that the party with which he affiliated had a small majority in the legislature of his state and the only question seemed to his friends here to be whether that majority party would unite upon him or whether some other member of his party would be successful in getting its support it was found that the senators party was not for him his party wished him to retire that it might honor another with the senatorship again a bitter contest ensued again a deadlock occurred and finally after much balloting and many conferences and a great struggle senator kyle was reelected as was stated by the eloquent gentleman from south dakota by a few votes of his own party and the solid vote of the opposition party he won his party was defeated naturally when he caine back it was appreciated by those with whom he had been associated politically that a change 61m taken place in his relations to political parties and that probabm a change would take place in his relations to jbolitical questions so no surprise was expressed when later on he became affiliated with the majority party in congress the republican party which he had first opposed but which in his second election had returned him to the senate i do not think there was any harsh criticism of him certainly not here i know not how it was in the state in which he dwelt it is not for me or for anyone recklessly to say that his change of sentiment did not correspond and entirely keep pace with his change of party he was educated at oberlin republicanism was deeply instilled into him in his youth he went to dakota no doubt an intense republican a movement for reform which swept over the country carried him from the party of his fathers froni the party of his earlier devotions into another and it is not so remarkable that under changed circumstances he again became fast in the faith which was his early faith and turned from the course which for a time he had followed h=e was a kindly man of generous impulses and blameless private life no feelings except kindly feelings can be entertained of him personally by those who knew him here he has passed off the stage gone in the prime of life gono with the largest portion of

strive for andato be proud of if one retain that esteem and veneration after the senatorial office is gone until life itself is gone his memory becomes a rich legacy as one who knew senator kyle and
