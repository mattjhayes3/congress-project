dont have the kind of running off of the topsoil that would occur if the grasses are the type of grasses that tend to clump instead of cover the ground uniformly so that is one of the reasons why the

energy and commerce committee wrote the energy policy and conservation act of 2005 it directed the department of energy to develop a conservation standard for external power supply products because of the inadvertently broad definition we created for external power supplies emerging led drivers were swept up into a standard that as you have heard so eloquently from the other speakers just doesnt

assessments can support teaching and learning good assessments used appropriately can serve as one tool for monitoring students progress and in helping parents teachers and school leaders see how students are performing across the state this amendment will help to reduce the testing burden and build highquality assessment systems that support teachers and students importantly the amendment recognizes that a onesizefitsall policy to address excessive testing wont work there is evidence that time spent testing fluctuates significantly among districts with some districts dedicating three times as many hours to testing as other districts this variety in the use of tests is why our amendment lets the states and local districts design their own plans to improve the use of assessments our

funds to audit their assessment systems and report to the public the results which might include the amount of time students spend taking tests whether those tests are high quality and whether the tests provide prompt feedback to support teaching the amendment allows states and school districts to use the funds to develop and implement a plan to make assessments work better for their teachers
