on the the home loan bank act was subject of this special order signed by president hoover ina turbulent time the campaign that would lead to roosevelts election was just getting underway the terror of economic dissolution was palpable indeed on the day hoover signed the bill the angry remnants of what had been 17 000 members of the bonus armys world war i veterans were camped in washington the house had passed the patman bonus bill less than a month before only to see it defeated in the senate most of the veterans left washington but on july 22 there were still about 2 000 angry and desperate veterans in washington only 6 days after signing the home loan bank act hoover ordered the army to remove the veterans by force in an infamous act troops led by douglas macarthur in whose train was dwight eisenhower evicted the bonus army and burned its camp that was the climate that existed when this country took its first halting steps toward a national housing policy franklin d roosevelt announced the new deal in his nomination acceptance speech less than a month before hoover signed the law creating the federal home loan bank system interestingly enough his new deal platform did not include specific reference to housing it was a program for economic reform designed to bring some order out of the chaos of banking and securities restore some confidence and encourage states to create what later became the social security system in mid1932 when the new deal speech was written the full magnitude of the great depression was still developing needless to say the home loan bank act could not by itself do what needed to be done to house the poor let alone make home ownership possible for the great majority who were at the time tenants less than 40 percent of americans owned their homes then and many who did lost them in the depression in the chaos of the depression it represented little more than a faint flicker of hope when franklin d roosevelt became president in march 1933 he faced utter chaos nothingnot farms not banks not industrieswas working cities and towns had run out of money to feed and clothe the growing army of desperate people thrown out of work and off their farms you must remember that at that time america was mostly rural in that disastrous time urgent action had to be taken and it was within 100 days an incredible amount of legislation was enacted to restore order and begin finding the way to recovery among those acts was a relief program for homeowners the home owners refinancing act signed june 13 1933 this emergency relief act was the second great step toward a national housing program the refinancing act created a corporation capitalized by 200 million to refinance the mortgages of hardpressed homeowners a few months later in april 1934 an additional 1 billion in capital went into the corporation it did more than refinance mortgages the corporation could advance money to pay back taxes and provide for repairs and maintenance these cash advances could be for as much as 50 percent of the appraised value of the loan the whole thing being secured by the value of the property the home owners loan corporation remained in business for only 4 years but in that time it had made loans covering more than 1 million mortgages and it produced a profit fifty years later with the country in a recession as deep as any seen since 1933 notwithstanding to the contrary what we heard a few minutes ago i offered a bill to provide emergency help to hardpressed homeowmers and we called it that the emergency homeowners assistance act in colorado for instance in the city of pueblo where the steel mill was shutting down the sole source of employment the foreclosure rate on homes was 100 a month at that time i took the floor and asked this house to approve the homeowners emergency assistance act the house did indeed pass it the one and the only what my minority members called a new program that has been approved by the house under the reagan administration that is since 1981 it languished in the senate and it died in the senate a senate that in 6 years never once even had so much as a hearing on housing needs or community development needs of our country the senate proposed to do nothing and my proposal did nothing radically more than essentially what we had seen and i had witnessed during the depression in the homeowners loan corporation in fact did the research work on that bill myself and with the able help of the staff and counsel we reshaped it in terms of modern needs all it would do would be the same thing make loans against home equity to prevent those homes from being foreclosed ironically not too long in fact less than a year and a half after that in my home town of san antonio when i walked the line of about 203 fellow americans destitute homeless waiting to make their entry into the homeless shelter that had been provided them by the city i talked to one young relatively young because i consider anybody under 40 very young homeless father of two who had lost his home in pueblo co and had we enacted that program that i had envisioned he would have been enabled to have been assisted and to have remained under the roof and the shelter of his home instead of having to park his wife and kids with his parents in another state and wander through the south thinking that perhaps in the south he could find employment and come to a city such as san antonio where indeed the need was just as great as the city that he left i have never been able to understand why this simple humane eminently workable ideawas so adamantly opposed by the administration why it was willing to let so many thousands of people needlessly suffer the loss of their homes when hundreds of thousands could have been helped at virtually no real cost or risk to the government why not extend help to people who are suffering economic disaster through no fault of their own as a result of forces they cannot control it made sense in 1933 and it should make sense today a little more than a year after the home owners loan corporation bill was signed the national housing act of 1934 became law this law was truly monumental it brought up the capital of the home owners loan corporation to 3 billion but more than that this was the law establishing the federal housing administration at this point i want to render tribute to a man who passed on just last month on august 9 the great leon keyserling and i want to render testimony that it was his architectural hand his designing hand that devised the basic 1934 and 1937 national housing act and whose friendship and counsel i never dreamed i would be able to enjoy years later after those miserable dim days that i recall vividly because i am a depression kid and i was in school at the time and would enjoy his great wisdom and would have shared his last supper literally because he died 4 days after i had enjoyed an invitation to supper at his home here in washington leon keyserling actually is a man that i hope we can memorialize in a more lasting and meaningful way when the time comes but his real monument has been etched into these great acts of humanitarian legislation for he was the architect and the counsel and lawyer that devised and structured the basic fundamental framework of reference for this noteworthy legislation the fha became the engine of housing and home ownership as a matter of fact the miracle of the world in the 20th century was performed here in america because between 1940 and 1980 we reversed where a minority of american families owned their homes to a percentage increase of the overwhelming majority by 1980 the sad thing is that since 1980 we have had an increase in the emergence of this phenomena of modernday homelessness which is in epidemic proportions and for which this congress has passed emergency legislation just this year and all because there is cause and effect you cannot turn back on the basic commitment to housing and the allocation of national credit for construction of affordable housing affordable to the main mass and stream of our families today the average cost of a new singlefamily dwelling unit in the united states is over 175 000 that means that we have priced out all but 6 percent of americans from the dream of owning a brandnew singlefamily dwelling unit for their loved ones it was the fha through its system of mortgage insurance that made home loans a low risk proposition and made it possible for lenders to extend the longterm fixed rate mortgage that was the cornerstone the inspiration and the motivation of mass home ownership in this country under fha tens of millions of people have obtained home loans it has turned a profit its property standards insured a consistent quality of housing and its operations remain at the heart of home ownership in this country today since the national housing act of 1934 home ownership has become the rule not the exception no longer do twothirds of americans rent though we are in a period of regression and headed back to that twothirds live in their own homes thanks to these programs through fha the affordable mortgage became a reality and with it the affordable home the sensation of 1937 was president roosevelts famous fight to transform the supreme court by increasing the number of justices that is the old supreme court vehemently opposed packing charges the president was accused of trying to pack the supreme court in order to have a patsy supreme court which would give him the opportunity to pack the court with justices he believed would not overturn as the conservative court had his industrial recovery act the court fight made the bork case seem utterly tame it mesmerized the country from february to july but the great court fight was not all that was going on that year on september 1 the capstone national housing act of 1937 became law by 1937 the banking system was stable there was deposit insurance the refinancing programs for homes and farms had stemmed loan losses and the home loan bank system was in place the fha had begun its work what remained was to deal with slum clearance and to try and provide decent housing to the millions who could in no way afford to pay market rents the 1937 housing act created the unitedstates housing authority which was empbwered to make 60year loans to local housing agencies the local agencies had to put up 10 percent of the cost of clearing slums and erecting housing projects the authority had the power to grant operating subsidies so that rents could be geared to the incomes of poor families that basic mechanism remains in place to this very day what an honor to be able to rise at the end of this month to memorialize the congress on the fact that on the first day of this month exactly 50 years ago in this month of september the 1937 basic housing act was approved that in that day and time the congresses and their presidents did in fact have faith and confidence in the average american family in the faith that with just a bit of help it could be tided over in dire circumstances over which it had no control that not only would those loans made then under those conditions be repaid but that they would earn a profit to the treasury of the united states as indeed those programs did within a few years slum clearance could be seen and felt within 4 years the unitedstates housing authority had helped create 511 new housing projects for lowincome families with more than 161 000 units in the 50 years since enactment of the landmark 1937 housing act this government has expanded the assisted housing stock to some 4 million units about half of which are publicly owned today we still have in place in being and in operation the same basic housing tools that were created during the cataclysmic years between mid 1932 and mid1937 those tools were revolutionary in their concept and in their effect before this nation set out on what became a bipartisan commitment to a comprehensive housing policy a full third of our people lived in poor sometimes inhuman conditions today the proportion of people in substandard housing is perhaps 10 percent this reflects a monumental achievement and yet the need should not be that great its 5 percent more than 1980 nor would the need remain so great had not the present administration elected to withdraw from housing as far as it could in 1982 the administration even tried to eliminate mortgage insurance for most people it has managed to virtually stop construction of publicly owned housing units it has managed to prevent enactment of an emergency homeowners assistance program but it has failed to kill housing it has failed to stop enactment of this nations first effective emergency shelter program for homeless people and it has failed to prevent members of its party from joining in this years effort to reassert and begin to revitalize the comprehensive housing program that came into being with the housing act of 1937 the nations commitment to a decent and affordable home for every citizen has been fiercely advocated and honestly administered by a small dedicated extremely proficient corps of public servantsvisionaries and practical administrators innovators and financiers regulators and politicians it has worked it works still and after 50 years the dream is as alive as ever after 50 years we still have not reached the goal of a decent safe and affordable home for

production had an estimated value of half a trillion dollars let me repeat that half a trillion dollars unfortunately our countrys jurisdiction to arrest drug traffickers extends only 200 miles from our shores hence an international force or mechanism aimed at stopping the trafficking of illegal drugs is necessary mr javier perez de cuellar secretarygeneral of the united nations supports this concept and has established a task force to examine the feasibility of such a force my amendment is a strong show of congressional support for that task force and for the united nations to continue its efforts in this area the drug problem is not limited to the united states it is a worldwide problem that dictates worldwide strategies and cooperation the united nations has pledged to pursue vigorous international actions against drug abuse and illicit trafficking its now obvious that the united states cannot win the war on drugs alone we must work together witi our friends all over the world by passing this amendment we demonstrate the resolve of congress to fight drugs at every front at this point i would like to comment on the bill in general to say it is a good bill which i support of course theres only so much congress can do much is left up to local communities this is true in the area of drug abuse education although congress can provide valuable monetary assistance drug abuse education programs just as education in general is something left up to the states i am glad that this bill authorizes millions of dollars for drug abuse education because lets face it when all is said and done education is really the most effective way we are going to deal with the drug menace there must be a concentrated longterm effort to educate our people on the perils of drug abuse i stress here the word long term an example of how we can be successful with education is the protracted decadeslong effort to educate people on the hazards of smoking after decades of educating people on this we are now finally seeing results with smoking tailing off tremendously throughout the nation how did that happen through education when i was a young man no one know how bad smoking was for health now we are all aware of that not everyone has quit but no one can deny the great effect smoking education has had on reducing the number of people who smoke and whos to say a longterm education effort aimed at drug abuse wouldnt have similar success perhaps more afterall cigarettes are legal and therefore easier to obtain than most drugs and the negative effects of taking drugs often happen more quickly than from smoking cigarettes you dont often see people keel over dead from smoking a cigarette but we all know that can happen from taking drugs witness len bias along the lines of education we should be using the latest technology to got the point across the printed word used to be the key to education and still is important but todays youth must be exposed to the latest in videos dealing with antidrug themes i have worked with the department of education in this area and i praise the departments efforts in its production of 30 antidrug videos these videos which are scheduled to be released shortly are aimed at delivering creative effective antidrug messages to our nations students as a young man i viewed an antidrug movie that left a lifelong impression on me and i am hopeful that these new videos will be just as effective on the students of today i encourage my colleagues to learn more about this pro ect so that we here in congress can make sure that every school in our nation is aware of this valuable antidrug tool so lets commit ourselves to a longterm effort to educate people on the perils of drug abuse as is the case with most social problems there are no easy answers we cannot wave a magic wand and have it all go away we must all be vigilant we cannot expect change overnight but we can make progress this bill is in the

of new york states republican delegation he served our nation at a time when all his leadership and intellectual skills were most needed he gave us all these skills and so very much more like many of us howard served during two of the most painful periods in our nations history he was here in congress from the initial days of the vietnam conflict to its last like many members of congress who served in the house at that time howard initially supported the american involvement in vietnam yet as the years dragged on as the casualties mounted and as the tragedy of the conflict shook our countrys very foundations he became an outspoken opponent howard robison was also a member of congress during the watergate scandala scandal which fundamentally challenged 6ur governments constitutional process the times were difficult but he was able to calmly and fairly evaluate the information which was presented to the congress and reach politically difficult decisions on what would best serve the interests of the united states his decision process always had the interests of the united states as its base not what might be politically popular but aside from these difficult and trying problems there were many other areas in which howards wisdom and foresight was in evidence the instance i recall most vividly was his early skepticism of the liquid metal fast breeder reactora project which would eventually be called the clinch river breeder reactor as the members in the chamber will recall i worked to eliminate this environmental and budgetary nightmare although the project was eventually killed it was not until millions of taxpayer dollars were wasted however had the congress heeded the advice of howard robison these scarce dollars would have been saved in fact during the 1972 debate on the breeder howard warned against overreliance on the reactor in fact he remarked we should guard against any aec atomic energy commission to put all of its eggs so to speakin this particular basket there are alternative avenues for both research and development which the aec should pursue when this statement was made the financial obligation howard was stood at 50 million but we know that the price tag eventually rose to 4 billion before the project was scrapped in the mid1980s i have deeply missed howard since his retirement both as a friend and as an adviser

did vote for aid to the homeless i hope the good lord as mr north refers to him makes a mark down for me for that if it helps somebody but in this bill we are trying to do a good job for the men and women in our armed services we did not even fund some of the money for glcm sites pending what happens in the talks that are still going on we did pot fund swimming pools we did not fund auditoriums we did not fund all the frills we funded the bare necessities"], [0.0008051395416259766, 0.500805139541626, 0, "i thank the gentleman for yielding i want to reflect what a few other members of the committee have said that we are not talking about jurisdiction what we indeed should be talking about is what is good for the consumer of this country or what is not good for the consumer of this country a lot of people will tell you that the airline passenger protection act that we just passed h r 3051 was a cureall that this is going to take care of it let me make five points first of all h r 3051 does nothing more in section 1706 than endorse the airlines present advertising practices h r 3051 does not acknowledge that the federal trade commission is the institution that has historically protected the public from unfair deceptive and fraudulent advertising h r 3051 does not acknowledge the fact that the department of transportation office of intergovernimental affairs and consumer affairs has only 12 people only 12 people who have fulltime duties to review these complaints h r 3051 does not acknowledge that the ftc whose whole involvement is in protection of the consumer has over 500 people to do this very thing h r 3051 does not acknowledge that the dot is a facilitator for complaints not a watchdog as would be the case for the ftc i think we are moving in the right direction on this for the consumers of this country and i think we ought to support the consumers of this country and allow the ftc to take control of this very important issue"]]}
