hitherto to characterize that method of legislation and i think it is well illustrated in this case if it could have been avoided in any way it ought it seems to me to have been avoided here the subject embraced in the sections which relate to the surveys of the public land should have been embodied in a separate bill and subjected to the most careful scrutiny but as the sections are here and may be ruled in order i offer a few suggestions upon their merits i will say however that one subject provided for in these sections has had no other place in our laws except in appropriation bills and probably cannot be ruled out on the point of order i speak of those scientific surveys which for the last ten or twelve years have been supported by the government i think i am right in saying that there is no independent statute touching them all the legislation in regard to them is to be found in the appropriation bills and what i shall say in the short time i propose to address the committee this morning will relate chiefly to those surveys it is of the utmost importance that whatever the united states undertakes to do in reference to science shall be done upon some wellunderstood wellreasoned and welldefined system andivent ire to ask the attention of the committee of the whole for a few minutes to some general views on the relation of the national government to this subject we are accustomed to hear it said that the great powers of government in this country are divided into two classes national powers and state powers that is an incomplete classification our fathers carefully divided all governmental powers into three classes one they gave to the states another to the nation but the third great class comprising the most precious of all powers they refused to confer upon the states or the nation but reserved to themselves this third class of powers has been almost uniformly overlooked by men who have written of and discussed the american system my attention was called to this in a striking way not long since in reading a speech of bismarck before the reichstag of germany a proposition was pending to grant some political rights to the jews in the german empire bismarck opposed it and in doing so he took occasion to state what in his view was the primary object of the prussian government and i was startled at the statement all gentlemen around me will admitsaid hethat the primary object of the prussian government is to maintain and defend the gospel of our lord fesu christ ow then can one who disbelieves in christ be properly admitted as a sharer of vower in this kingdom i was struck with the fact that the great statesman of germanyprobably the foremost man in europe todaystated as an unquestioned principle that the support defense and propagation of the christian gospel is the central object of the german government then i considered in contrast with that the peculiarity of our own government our fathers though recognizing in common with germany and the other christian nations of the earth the supreme importanceof religion among men deliberately turned to the great nation they were to establish and said you shall never make any law about religion and to the states they virtually said you shall never maho any law establishing any form of religion in other words here was an interest too precious to be trusted either to the nation or to the states our fathers said this highest of all human interests we will reserve to the people themselves we will not delegate our powcr over it to any organized government state or national we will not even allow legislatures to make any law concerning it to my mind it is the sublimest fact in our american system that in defining the boundaries of delegated powers they chose to intrust the most precious of all the interests of human beings on this earth absolutely to the voluntary action of the individual people of the republic not to be voted upon by their representatives but to be regulated protected and cherished by their own voluntary action leaving themselves perfectly free to have no religion if they chose or any religion that they pleased thus they exhibited their regard for liberty their faith in thevoluntary action of the people and their belief that the most precious interests would be safest under the immediate guardianship of freemen in my view we have spent too much time in discussing state sovereignty and national supremacy and have neglected to recognize and appreciate the vast importance of the reserved rights of the people it is a safe and wise rule to follow in all legislation that whatever the people can do without legislation will be better done than by the intervention of the state or the nation what i have said in reference to religion applies with almost equal force to science in the main the framers of our government trusted science to the same jurisdiction to which they intrusted religion with the single exception of one clause in the constitution authorizing congress to promote science by granting copyrights and patents the chief support and maintenance of science are left and i think wisely left to the voluntary action of our people and this was done not in the interest of liberty alone but in the interest of science itself this leads me to inquire what ought to be the relation of the national government to science what if anything ought we to do in the way of promoting science for example if we have the power would it be wise for congress to appropriate money out of the treasury to employ naturalists to find out all that is to be known of our american birds ornithology is a delightful and useful study but would it be wise for congress to make an appropriation for the advancement of that science in my judgment nanifestly not we would thereby make one favored class of men the rivals of all the ornithologists who in their private way following the bent of their genius may be working out the results of science in that field 1 have no doubt that an appropriation out of our treasury for that purpose would be a positive injury to the advancement of science just as an appropriation to establish a church would work injury to religion generally the desire of our scientific men is to be let alone to work in free competition with all the scientific men of the world to develop their own results and get the credit of them each for himself not to have the government enter the lists as the rival of private enterprise as a general principle therefore the united states ought not to interfere in matters of science but should leave its development to the free voluntary action of our great third estate the people themselves in this noninterference theory of the government i do not go to the extent of saying that we should do nothing for educationfor primary education that comes under another considerationthe necessity of the nation to protect itself and the consideration that it is cheaper and wiser to give education than to build jails but i am speaking now of the higher sciences to the general principle i have stated there are a few obvious exceptions which should be clearly understood when we legislate on the subject in the first place the government should aid all sort of scientific inquiry that are necessary to the intelligent exercise of its owl functions for example as we are authorized by the constitution and compelled by necessity to build and maintain lighthouses on our coast and es tablish fogsignals we are bound to make all necessary scientific inquiris in refereneet lightand itslaws sound and itslawsto do whatever in the way of science is necessary to achieve the best results in lighting our coasts and warning our mariners of danger so when we are building ironclads for our navy or casting guns for our army we ought to know all that is selentif zally possible to be known about the strength of materials and the laws of mechanics which apply to such structures in short wherever in exercising any of the necessary functions of the government scientific inquiry is needed let us make it to the fullest extent and at the public expense there is another exception to the general rule of leaving science to the voluntary action of the people whereyer any great popular interest affecting whole classes possibly all classes of the community imperatively need scientific investigation and private enterprise cannot accomplish it we may wisely intervene and help where the constitution gives us authority for example in discovering the origin of yellow fever and the methods of preventing its ravages the nation should do for the good of all what neither the states nor individuals can accomplish i might perhaps include in a third exception those inquiries which in consequence of their great magnitude and cost cannot be successfully made by private individuals outside these three classes of inquiries the government ought to keep its hands off and leave scientific experiment and inquiry to the free competition of those bright intelligent men whose genius leads them into the fields of research and i suspect when we read the report of our commissioner to the late paris exposition which shows such astonishing results so creditable to our country so honorable to the genius of our people it will be found in any final analysis of causes that the superiority of americans in that great exposition resulted mainly from their superior freedom andthe greater competition between mind and mindunlrammeled by government interference i believe it will be found we are best serving the cause of religion and science and all those great primary rights which we did not delegate to the congress or the states but left the people free to enjoy and maintain them leaving these general reflections i come to the special question of our geological surveys leaving out of the account all the government works proper such as lighthouses such as the survey of our coast such as the survey for our rivers and harbors such as the surveys of the lakes of military surveys properleaving all these out we have spent almost 000 000 in the last twelve years for purely scientific surveys while the results have been very gratifying while they have been exceedingly interesting to men of science and also of commercial value to the country i believe we have spent a large part of that money upon an unwise system and in a way which has tended to discourage the private pursuit of science by our people we have made the government a formidable and crushing competitor of private students of science and i think we have in some cases gone beyond the fair limit of what the government ought to do in the way ef scientific investigation we have had the war department with two or three separate expeditions exploring our western territory we have had two separate organizations from the interior department also exploring and it has all been done on a system which has invited and fostered a personal seeking of favor from congress there have been good men intelligent men scientific men who have sought for authority and aid to make scientific investigations in fields which private citizens were exploring and in employing so many separate and independent parties there have been many cases if not of collision at least of overlapping and duplication in the same field of examination it seems to me it is high time for usi first to restrict our scientific work plainly and narrowly within the limits of the rules i have tried to lay down and second to consolidate the scientific part of our work of survey under one responsiblo head and having done that with all the economy which can be fairly nsed let us make our outlay only in the direction of public necessity now lest some one should think iam attacking the geological surveys i hasten to say that it is absolutely vital to an intelligent discharge of our duties as trustees or rather as owners of the great public domain yet nnsurveyed and unsold to give to our people all the light that science can shed upon the character and quality of those lands while i may doubt the propriety of making at once the whole change proposed in this bill it is perfectly clear to my mind that we have reached a natural crisis in the management and disposition of our public domain we have now reached the foothills of the great rocky mountain chain and the old plans the old methods both of survey and of settlemeu are in the main no longer applicable of what possible use can it be to checkerboard the slopes and the tops of mountains that are full of ores with the old system of sections half sections and quarter sections to say that the old plan has worked well for a hundred years is to praise our past properly but to say that the same plan will work well for the next hundred years is to say the matchlocks gunflints the spontoons and other nameless and obsolete implements of war that were in vogue a hundred years ago will be good for a hundred years to come and should not be abandoned we must not revolutionize merely for the sake of change but we must wisely and intelligeutly adapt our policy to the progress of events and i believe it has been clearly shown that if the old rectangular system is continued it will be substantially worthless in its application to most of our usurveyed territory"], [0.08430752158164978, 0.08430752158164978, 0, "this is a new branch of the service and during its existence which has been only i believe for

before this committee is the question of transacting some business in a businesslike way and in getting it done as cheaply as it can be done and as well as it can be done now the gentlemen who have discussed this question on both sides admit that about nine hundred thousand vouchers have to be made out in the course of a year and upon those vouchers the pensioners must be paid no matter whether the work is done in washington or whether it is done at eighteen separate independent pension agencies throughout the country it appears to me that the plain commonsense practical question here is this where can we have that work done the cheapest and at the same time done well i submit to any gentleman upon this floor upon either side of this question whether he cannot go to his own home outside of washington and have twice if not three times as much clerical work done for the same money as he can have done in washington city i do not believe sir there would be a single negative vote on that proposition i can go into my stateand i want to say here before i go any further that i have got no pension agent in my district that i have got no particular man to favori can go into my

you centralize the business in washington cityand put it in these departments and i am not saying anything against heads of departments or tails of departments i am speaking of a fact patent to every man in this housewhen you put business into the hands of these departments a man has to live a long while before he can chase it from one end of the department to another and bring it to a conclusion if the object is to save money we have to cut down the fee of these pension agents it can be reduced ten or fifteen cents on every voucher and the wor k still be well done but i say it can be done outside of the city of washington much better than in it and upon that the whole question turns if gentlemen will look this thing in the face upon the facts as they exist i think no gentleman will deny that this work can be done outside of the city of washington better than it can be done here bringing the agencies nearer to the pensioner and with a greater degree of certainty of the payments being made safely than if made here and with the certainty of their being made sooner than they can possibly be made if the agencies exist in the city of washington these two points in my judgment cover the whole matter they cover the whole ground we can save by the amendment already pending a little over 100 000 a clean saving money in the treasury no discount upon it and have the work done

whether the land system of the government should be so radically and wholly changed as is contemplated by the bill under consideration the land system of the united states has been in operation now for a great many years it has been substantially the same for the last forty years the laws of the united states have all been passed in harmony with this system the decisions have been made under it and all the intelligence and all the information of the entire people concerning the public lands have been derived from the system as it is and which it is now proposed to overturn the question therefore is practically this is there to be a great good attained by abolishing the preseut system and adopting one entirely new i believe that a system so long held as this has been ought to bechanged hardly under any circumstances there should be very many and very strong arguments given why we should change the present system touching our public lands in regard to their disposition and management it is not necessary to allege that the present system is perfect nor is it necessary to assert that the system which is proposed would be particularly iruperfect but my objection to this change at the present time is because the present modes are so well understood by all the people not simply by the people who are here today and who are in possession of a given portion of the public lands under some one of the laws of the united states but these laws modes and methods are well understood even by those who are on their way to this country at this hour to become settlers on the public lands of the united states it is impossible to foresee just what kind of rules can be adopted by this now system it is impossible to tell how severe would be some of the new rules to be adopted and how long a time it would take to understand those new rules and adapt themselves to the dew methods that might be devised for getting on to the public lands if this system is adopted there will be transferred from each state and territory where there is now a surveyorgeneral all the archives all the books the maps the charts the tracings and all the entries of the state surveyors office here to washington the change would necessarily result in a change of clerical force in the administration of the government here at washington a change in the clerical force and an adoption of new rules would embarrass an entry on the public lauds that would not end in six months or in a year but many years would elapse before the entire people of the country would be as familiar with the now methods of getting on to the public lands as they are today with the present method whatever any gentleman may say about the scientific aspects of this case to me has no value the learned gentleman from new york who has just taken his seat has said many elegant things in the course of his argument but this is an intensely practical question the simple question is shall we get rid of our present methods of entering the public lands now well understood well known understood by everybody understood by the immigrant the very day he lands at new york he knows where he shall go he knows to what land office he shall approach he knows what blanks he shall need he understands the whole methods by which he shall get hold of his quarter section of the public lands and it is proposed to wipe all this out and to adopt a new system to be followed by new rules by ne methods by new avenues we have already enough to contend with upon the frontier it takes now long enough to get a patent by the proemptor or the homesteader but you adopt this system and three four or five years would elapse before any now system unless it should drop down from heaven itself would be half as well understood as the present system the present time is in my judgment a very unfortunate time in which to introduce a great radical change in the land policy of the government there has sprung up during the past year and during the present month an unexampled immigration into the territories and into the western states of the union we were informed in the committee on commerce yesterday by a gentleman from new york that the indications were throughout all europe that therd was to be a large immigration to this country the present year now this immigration is all as i have sajd in advance acquainted with our present policy and our present land system it is proposed to adopt a new one let us look at some of the entries during the past year there was an increase in the public land entries in the following states and territories last year over the year preceding which to my mind as i have said once before gives a very hopeful outlook to the country there was an increase last year over the year before in the territory of dakota of 500 per cent there was an increase in idaho of 100 per cent in kansas of 150 per cent in minnesota of 250 per cent in montana of 275 per cent in wyoming of 350 per cent here is this large increase in that portion of the republic which ought to receive not simply the immigration from europe but from the older and more densely settled portions of the country the hitherto idle and unemployed people of those states and cities now it is proposed with this large rush of immigration into these very territorial and frontier states where the public lands are to overthrow the present system so well vnderstood as i have said before by everybody and introduce a system whose animus and methods shall be scientific and theoretical rather than practical the delays that would be caused would be very serious there would be long delays caused by the introduction of the new system in place of the old one theold one we understand it has worked well it has given to us the empire states on the west of the mississippi riverminnesota an iowa and kansas and nebraska and califoruia all the vast west of the country the very heart of the republic has been settled up developed and

violates the fundamental principles of a just and equitable taxation and i object to it in the second place because it puts a prohibitory duty upon the lowgrade sugars that are refined by anerican skill and become the cheap sugar in common use among our people it injures one portion of our industrial interests and gives an unreasonable protection to another it violates the canons of free trade on the one hand and of protection on the other it destroys absolutely the business of refining the cheap lowgrade sugars and will increase the cost of sugars most in use let me illustrate still further how is it that this day while i speak to you sugar is cheaper in the united states than it has ever been before because we have built up in this country a great industry by which we are eclipsing the world as refiners of sugar when the french manufacturers were at philadelphia at our centennial they were amazed to see that our sugar products there rivaled the best products of the old world they did not understand how it had been done but it was the result of the same skill that has enabled america to surpass so many other countrie id the recent exposition at paris and to carry off more medals in proportion to their exhibitors than any other five countries of the globe we were so successful in the refining of sugar that two years ago we were exporting seventy million pounds of our refined proeuct it was becoming and it will become if we are allowed to carry on this industry a great element in our export trade we are trading with cuba and south america we are compelled to depend largely upon the tropics for our raw material is it not wise for us to be ableto sendback the refined product in exchange or shall we so legislate as to give an undue protection to our louisiana planters and drive the refining business out of the united states allowing cuba england and other coulatries to do our refining for us refined sugar we must have the day is gone by when our people will eat the animals which abound in the raw unmanufactured sugars of the world i say therefore that this bill as drawn sins against the consumer and against the refining interest and unreasonably protects the producing interest of the country let me illustrate a little further in the phillipine islands there is a class of people who have not enough intelligence and resources to take the first simple step toward clarifying sugar they have no limestone on their islands they cannot even furnish the lime to drop into the sugar vats and clarify the product just a little but they take the juice of the cane and boil it down in the crudest radest simplest way by labor the cheapest and least skillful and when they have reduced it to a black cheap form of crystallized sugar the dirtiest yet known they put it up in sacks of one hundred and fifty pounds each so that a man can carry it on his back down to the landing to be shipped away our people are buying largely of that low grade of sugar from the phillipine islands we are buying it also from other countries where the production is of a low grade this sugar we bring here and by our skill and labor make it into a cheap clean sugar for table use shall we now by law impose a prohibitory duty on all that trade and industry an 80 per cont rate or a 65 per cent rate keeping it all out and bringing in only the sugar that ba been advanced by the higher and more intelligent processes of our nearer neighbors thus cutting off the whole business of refining these lowgrade sugars i hope not i know there is some controversy among the refiners themselves some of themindeed quite a number of most estimable gentlemensay let this bill pass and we can do a better refining business than is done now we can refine the highgrade sugars now i am glad to have those gentlemen work the higher grades of sugar and make a success of them but i see no reason why our refineries should not also take the lowest grades of sugar that which has the least value the least labor in it and bring it up by our american labor to a cheap useful merchantable form and therefore i am unwilling for the sake of helping one class of reaners to destroy another i do not believe it is necessary to destroy either i regret that the refiners do not unite on some common ground on which all could have had a fair chance but there seems to have been an internecine war among them and with such a war i have no sympathy having now stated my objections in brief to the bill of the gentleman from north carolina i turn to answer his criticisms of the measure i have proposed which is the bill of the treasury department the gentleman from north carolina says that the polariscope is an unsatisfactory instrument and that however perfect it might be there is serious difficulty in sampling the sugars to be tested i admit that there is trouble about sampling uppose a hogshead of sugar is allowed to remain lying on its side for a month and the sampler bores a hole in the hogshead and draws out a sample close to the bottom he gets a wet black coarse portion of the sugar on the other hand if he draws his sample from the top hs gets a dry lightercolored better grade of rbutler how much foreign labor is there in the settlings of thau suar i r grfield there certainlyisa good deal ofdirtinit as a matter of course if that sampler has boon bought by some importer he may take the samples out of the bottom of the cask only which will not represent the character of the whole but whether the system proposed by the gentleman from north carolina mr ronnixs or that of the treasury department prevails we must leave the details of carryiug it out to the secretary of the treasury under the regulations of the treasury department an official is not permitted to sample a hogshead of sugar in one spot only he samples aboe and below and at the center and the different samples being mixed into one make a pretty fair average sample of the cask and then taking every tenth cask of the cargo a pretty fair set of samples of the whole cargo is obtained but the trouble about sampling inheres in any graded system and no one proposes to abolish all the grades but the gentleman thinks the polariseope test is good for nothing ibbve some evidence on that subject in the first place the polariscope being a scientific instrument into the details of which i will not go as my learned colleague on the committee did the secretary of the treasury sent it about two years ago to the american academy of sciences of which professor henry was president with the request that it be examined and a report made as to the advisability of its use by the government in determining the value of sugars for revenue purposes after a thorough examination and with the assistance of persons well qualified to judge professor henry reported to the secretary of the treasury on the 5th day of february 1878 as follows after due deliberation on the subject the following are our final conclusions that the quantity of crystallizable sugar in imported raw sugars should be estimated by the polarhmeter which is an entirely trustworthy instrument and one the use of which can readily be taught to any intelligent person of ordinary education f the polarimeter should be adopted as the measure of the value of sugar a supply of these instruments should be obtained from germany and their use taught to the appraisers by a person thoroughly acquainted with the theory and practico of the instrument the accuracy of the instruments themseles should also he tested and the appraisers from time to time be examined as to their skill in the use of the instrument this is the opinion of a scientific man the most eminent and trustworthy of our countrymen and when he says that a layman a man without special skill can be taught to use this instrument accurately and that it is entirely trustworthy i have not quite the courage to say it is not so but that is not all i turn from the test of science to the test of practice i have before me a memorial containing the resolutions adopted by the importexs refiners and dealers in sugar in boston signed by 66 firms representing i am told every refiner in that city they speak for themselves boston january 30 1879 at an adjourned meeting of the importers refiners and dealers in sugar held this day the following rese utiens were unanimously adopted rezocd that the duties on sugar should be assessed by a graduated scale of specifoc rates adjusted as nearly as possible to the ad valorem principle and that tis can be done by the use of the polariscope better than in any other way its general use in bu3ng and selnoin all cavilized countries proves that i is les nomplicated and more reliable than any other method of determining the actual value of sugar ieelved that duties ought so be so regulated and assessed as to encourage the largest possible supplies ofsugar from all places of production and not in any way mane so as to favor one place more than another and that the amount of revenue new derived from the lower grades of sugar cannot he increased without injustice and injury to the consumers as it is now too hi high grades o calqder chufrma w t 11 greeley soretary we tho undersigned importers refiners and dealers in sugar approve of the above resolutions signed by sixtysix frims the testimony of these gentlemen is that the grading of sugars can be better effected by the polariscope than in any other way its genoral use in buying and selling sugar strongly attests its practicability a prominent gentleman from boston who is one of these signers of this memorial stated to the committee of ways and means that he bought twentysix large cargoes of sugar during the last season from cuba ofn telegraphic orders and by the polariscope test it was done in this way he cabled to the manufacturer in cuba send me so many hogsheads of sugar testing 920 or 940 polariscope test and the sugars came the cuban seller applied the polariscope test when he shipped them and the boston buyer applied the polariscope testwhen they were received the record of those twentysx cargoes shows that if the duty had been assessed by the test of the polariscope there would ha ve been but 125 difference in half a million dollars duty between the cuban test and the boston test there were variations in the tests of single cargoes but the whole shipment showed if we had followed the cuban test alone in levying the duties the account would have varied but 125 from the

as i see it is to be protected from one another and that is what our bill aims atthat this sugar interest may not fall into a few hands which would certainly raise the price of sugar to consumers i do not want to legislate for a few men or a few special classes i want to legislate for the american people and for the ad vancement of the countrys interests commercial industrial auu every other and at the same time protect consumers against the oppression and extortion which must result from a monopoly besides glucose other adulterants are said to be used such for in stance as muriate of tin alum c the first named being a deadly poison which gives whiteness to sugar by greatly improving its color and making it more marketable vastly increases the rofiners r fits with trifling cost i have here on my desk some specimen umps of white sugar which do not taste sweet till you have eaten the tin off the crystals gentlemen can help themselves to it i have had enough the public health demands that we stop so far as we can the adulteration of an article of such universal use as an additional significant circumstance i mention the fact that since this house has been agitating this question of amending the sugar tariff in a way that tends to stop adulteration of sugars the price of glucose has fallen very much but if the monopolists shall succeed in staving off a vote on our bill and thus defeat it i have no doubt the price of glucose will go up again on all grades of sugar above no 16 the bill of the committee imposes a duty of 4 per one hundred pounds the existing rate is 64 06 up to no 20 and 5 above that it will be seen that we propose some but no great reduction on these highest gradesi which axe denominated refined sugars the duty now imposed on thie chlss of engar is nearly prohibitory we imported of them in1878 only 777 36apounds the duty on these sugars proposed in the pending bill will also be substantially prohibitory this much in a spirit of compromise we leave untouched for the benefit of the american sugarrefining industry and surely it ought to be content with this we hereby shut out the competition of foreign refiners and secure to our own the exclusive control of the domestic market in really refined sugars it is a great boon in reason and decency they cannot ask more to sum up the argument in favor of the bill it will if made a law save millions each year to the treasury break down the sugar monopoly foster the legitimate refining interest check adulteration of sugar3 enlarge our commerce give the smalrer ports a share of the sugar trade stop the payment of a premiun to foreigners for a bad article and secure to the american people cheaper and purer sugar in short it will benefit everybody and hurt nobody unless it be an injury to put down deceit and extortion and wrest from shylock his pound of flesh a few words now upon the antagonistic propositions of the gentlemen who oppose the bill and i have done the first is the substitute of the gentleman from ohio which proposes to retain the test of color even down to the lowest grades but provides that any sugars not above no 10 dutch standard in color which shall contain over 92 per cent of crystallizable sugar shall pay the duty now chargeable on sugar above no 10 and not above no 13 dutch standard in color andthe per cent of crystallizable sugar shall be ascertained by the polariscope or such other means as maybe prescribed by the secretary of the treasury this obviously concedes what i have said about the untrustworthiness of the color test in the darker grades of sugar for it looks to the use of some other test and still itproposes to continue also the color test as to them one objection which of itself ought to be fatal to this proposition is that it would establish two tests inconsistent in character and entirely different in the results they might give for the same sugars who is to say in any given case which of these two tests is to be appliedthe color test or the percentage test a hogshead or a cargo comes in rating somewhere below no 10 in color shall it in any case be permitted to pass the customhouse on paying the duty chargeable according to color only or shall all these sugars be tested by the polariscope or other prescribed means so as to find their percentage if the latter is done and you do not rely in any case upon the color test as to these sugars but always resort to the percentage test what possible good can there be in continuing the color test at all for the dark augars t after having tested them for percentage of sugar strength why not levy your duty solely according to that percentage and say no more about the color since color in these dark sugars is no element of value itself the more i think of this plan of introducing two inconsistent tests for the same article the more i am convined that its effect would be to bring confusion and complexity into the law and its administration and open the door wider than ever to frauds and evasions of the duty if you could use any instrument or process which could be relied upon to show with accuracy the percentage of crystallizable saccharine matter in sugars the sugargrowing world would find away to dodge the law by a change in the methods of sugarmaking just as they have done with reference to the existing law if you enact the substitute into a law and thereby tax for instance a sugar no 7 in color and 93 in percentage 2 81 on the one hundred pounds while a no 7 sugar testing not over 9 2 per cent only pays 2 19 on the one hundred pounds it is easy to see what the foreign sugarmakers would do they would at once go to making all their sugars for our market not over no 7 in color and just below 92 in percentage the difference in value between a 91 per cent and a 93 per cent sugar is very trifling but the difference in dutyone at 2 19 and the other at 2 81 a hundredis relatively very considerable the discrimination would be in favor of the low per cent sugars justcas it now is in favor of the darkcolored sugars and we should have a repetition in another form of the very same evasions of the true intent of our law which the revenue is now suffering from and which have driven us to consider how we can legislate to prevent thei the substitute of the gentleman from ohio ought not to be adopted for another reason andthat is that there is no practicable and trustworthy means which the secretary of the treasury can prescribe to ascertain the percentage of saccharine matter in sugar with sufficient accuracy and uniformity to meet the requirements of the tariff withoutrum to the sugar trade chemical analysis of course would be a perfect test but the secretary could not prescribe that because we could not employ so costly a process upon the millions of pack ages of imported sugar the only other means known to science for this purpose is the polariscope i will not undertake here to describe this instrument for without seeing it and witnessing the manner of its use no one would be likely to get any satisfactory idea of it from anybodys description gentlemen who have studied the science of optics know something about the polarization of light by double refraction and the production thereby of two rays of different properties putting a solution of sugar into the horizontal tube of the polariseope and looking into this tube through the eyepiece at one end there is seen at the other end of the tube a round disk divided by a perpendicular line into two halfdisks of diverse colors because each is illuminated by a different one of the two rays of the polarized light i have myself looked into the polariscope tube and seen this n ow revolve the instrument to the right and these half disks gradually assimilate in color until at a certain point in the revolution they become of the same shade the polarization of the light being at that point neutralized by the transmission of the rays through the sugar solution the distance you must revolve the instrument to produce this effect depends on the percentage of saccharine matter in the solution through which the rays are transmittedthough it seems to me density of the solution produced by any other matter might produce the same effectand an index pointing to and moving over a graduated scale shows the degree to which you have revolved the instrument and consequently the percentage of pure sugar in the solution used thisisthe theory of the polariscope many members let the time of the gentleman be extended we want to hear this no objection was made and

his noble career withered like a leaf on a summers tree before the autumn or winter came to chill and blast almost before we were through witb the obsequies of others his parting knell sounded and we bore him away to the endearing circle which received him so lovingly in his beautiful southern home various are the relations we sustain to each other in this house it would take a psyche to assort and arrange the confused seeds out of which have grown so many and such endearing relations of regard and affection some of us live here under the same roof some serve on the same committee some take the same side on favorite themes some have had in our changeful american life mutual friends who have brought them together some are knit to each other by association in their own states and others though far distant share early and delightful reminiscences and among teem that one which springs radiant out of the morning of life enhanced and beautified by coll ge partialities and studies the relation which drew me to julian hartaitnco was the last one we were as far apart as ohio and georgia where our parents lived yet we became children of the same parent in new england our ala inater was brown university i was his elder in the college graduating two years in advance of him but not the elder in that sedateness and regerve which is supposed to mark the years by the disposition and which gives even to the young a strength that maturity does not bestow it was this college memory of our alsai taler which quickened and preserved our friendship here having reached the stadium of a half century of years memories of early associates become more distinct and interesting as i look back to those early disys they return with their relict radiance and enchantment like a dawn all opaline in the sky all diamond on the grass all auroral with a joyous splendor through which glimmers a mist of tears for those who shared their joyousness and who one by one fall and fade as our years slope waning down the arch these hopes and illusions as now and here become memory others may speak of julian hantridge as a husband and father of his affectionate heart and tender sensibilities and f his domestic ties these with all his reserve he could not conceal do we not recall his tremulous and tearful tribute to his old colored nurse spoken from yonder desk i it was a perilous theme in this house too often effusive in its irreverent mirth others may speak of him as citizen soldier lawyer and man filling with uprightness and honesty all the relations to family client state and society it is mine to speak of him as a scholar as one whose mental characteristics were as he often told me molded and inspired by our grand teacher dr francis wayland and the corps of admirable professors associated with him at brown university in making up manhood much may be attributed to hereditary causes muchto early parental guardianship and care but more to the discipline and knowledge which education gives who shall underrate the beneficence not to speak of the advantages of educationi it has been well said that it is a companion which no misfortune can depress no crime can destroy no enemy can alienate no despotism enslave at home a friend abroad an introduction in solitude a solace and in society an ornament it chastens vice it guides virtue it gives at once grace and government to genius without it what is man a splendid slave a reasoning savage it is customary with some to depreciate scholarship there are those who find in its pedantry some sort of compensation for their own wantin the lack which often attends mere learning and even those who are accomplished sometimes affect to despise its attainments truly it is not alone or chiefly by books that manhood is made was i not carlyle who said that a man perfects himself by work more than by reading but he was discriminating for he gave the meed of praise to that growing kind of men that combine the two things wisely and who valiantly do what is laid to their hand in the present sphere and prepare themselves withal for doing other wider things if such be before them this was the education which gave us the scholarship and intellect of julian hartridoge it was peculiar to brown university it was the educational system of dr wayland it lay in the power of analysis it was the dissection of a subject into its constituent parts to form a complete and rounded whole terse atqus rotudus it was the remark of professor greenleaf of cambridge that in the first recitation he could tell where his law students graduated but he always marked those of brown because of this special training in analysis certainly the members of the judiciary committee of this house and the courts and bar of georgia in recognizing the cogent advocate must have seen how his finer susceptibility was kept in braining and in stamina by this early discipline what were his favorite books mid studies and what his recreations what his habits in college life it may be curious if not useful briefly to recall although they do not infallibly indicate the subsequent life how few of the ambitions of college days are realized how few of their cherished designs are carried out how frail in after years seem those sustaining illusions and enrapturing enthusiasms which spring from the hard rocks of study all pure crystalline and iridescent it was the verdict of julian loartridges college mates that although he was reserved and made but few acquaintances and had but few companions and confidants he was ever courteous and kind chivalric and true to his convictions this reserve seehed to some to have an air of hanteur but we who knew him understood him better perhaps it came from a certain isolation in the college growing out of sectional feeling which even then had permeated our institutions of learning whatever he did lie did well his dilatoriness and laxity of effort at times seemed to be filled up by an excellence when he was aroused which must havebeen the fruit of abstraction and meditation though he may not have stood as high as some others in his class sometimes failing outright yet what he did was perfected like a cameo cut by a practiced hand with an exquisite sensibility to the beautiful he was regarded in spite of certain shortcomings as a brilliant scholar and especially brilliant in the art of rhetoric those who have heard him here will not be surprised that his fancy his susceptibility his southern ardor chastened and curbed by discipline gave him facile grace and elevated genius in oratory his junior speech in 1848 was on the superstitions of the highlands one of the professors remarked of it that never in essayer speech had he listened to such a warm and glowing tribute as that paid to robert burns and his religion of humanity he was very happy with his pen writing with fluency and fervor but he was most felicitous in oratory no one doubted his power in his speaking he had that dash that dian which is characteristic of the gifted southerner there was i his voice an indefinable magnetism over an andience that held them as in a spell as he graced the noble fervor of the hour he had the natural endowment of the orator who is born not made no one in his class so fascinated and thrilled this was doubtless the secret and select compensation he chose for any indifference to other branches of culture i have wondered that he did not more frequently display this rare gift in this house perhaps in his modest regard of himself he underestimated its charm he took no pains to excel in classroom work and graduated with moderate rank but all agreed that he was no idler he was a diligent reader especially of history and historical fiction all agreed that his was a mind of unusual brilliance hut few then anticipated that he would erect so solid and superb a structure on the hard science of the law we who served here with him know how partial he wasto his state his section and its institutions and history evenin his collegedays these local feelings were very marked they were encouraged by his habitual reserve in a new england state one of the freaks which grew out of them illustrated the intensity of his local pride when the class of moral science lingered three weeks in debate over the slavery question he persistently refused to recite during that time because he would not rereat dr waylands sentiments as expressed in the textbook luckily the state of roger williams and the nniversitiwhicb was founded on the principles of toleration expressed in its charter passed this by as a pardonable element of the genfas loci which is not peculiar to any section that which fitst gave to dr wayland his fame was not his peculiar methods of teaching it was his tractate on accountability if his scholars were not impressed by him with this idea in its highest meaning it was from an inborn obduracy in the scholar he taught us that it was the gravitation of the moral universe that intellectual beings were moral agencies sand that they must have this virtueor be sundered from gods universe witboua it the rnler is a tyrant the judge a despot the legislator a charlatan and the philosopher an empiric it is the strength and the ornament of the soul without it what are the rudiments vestments and culture of the mindi what his constituents and his state loved in jltan hartridge was this sense of accountability and his recognition of it as duty imbedded in his nature which never know a dishonest thought and along with his mental habitudes was the moral genius implanted by our great teacher whom the sonsof brown university ever delight to revere it was this mental power anq moral rectitude which jurai hartridge bore away from the city of providence when lie began the active labors of his profession and filled the offices with which his people intrusted him praical education is not obtained by book or by recitation few who leave their imprint on the world are shus educated there is a selfeducation that only collision with others ca give nay this conflict must uneducato often to reeducate for practical

rights and powers of the constitution as it was and is he knew well their meaning and had no timidity in following the needle which pointed to the haven designated in the articles he desired to restore to the nation the hallowed and healing spirit of mutual ionfidence and conciliation when he came hither he brought no mental or moral reservation indeed he was as his report on the reopening of the presidential matter in this congress showed conspicuously conservative in many senses of the peace and contentment of the people i have said that mr harthodge had a dainty aqd refined sensibility it was not limited to taste in art or in literature he was fond of flowers and especially of those rate flowers which are of tropical origin the brazilian orchids in our botanic garden were his delight they are the offspring of perpetual summer they cling to trees and blocks of wood and feed not upon the soil but upon the moist and heated air their variety and brilliance of color and exquisite aroma are said to excel all the productions of the floral kingdom their habits belong to the atmosphere and not to the earth and their formation is a portrayal of the entire scope of animated nature including a mimic caricature of the human species there is one in the botanic garden known to science as cattlyea warscciiczi which excels all of its numerous tribes it was this flower which my friend was accustomed to watch ho visited the garden again and again to observe the development of its gorgeous blossoms it decorated his desk and casket on the occasion of his obsequies i thought he would love to have his favorite in life near to him in death no poet has yet sung of this airy exquisite flower the rose and lily have had their minstrels but no muse has yet attempted to express the delicate loveliness of this paragon of beauty whose hue outblauches the lily and outblushes the rose if fancy were allowed some license something in our friends character and culture might be found symbolized in this flower itsvariety its luxuriance its honeyed wealth which from its copnstitution no insect can touch without death its isolated growth amid lofty tropical trees to which it clings like a bird of manycolored plumage its unsullied purity amidst the surroundings of fen and marsh are emblems of his rare excellence his exuberant imagination his sweetness of disposition his

calamity they could scarcely realize that the music of his voice which melted them with pathos or convinced them with reason was hushed forever they had expected that their favorite would have been preferred to other honors than those which belong to georgia here little did they expect that their beloved representative would end his existence before that service was ended little did they expect that only his inanimate form would return to them there was some solace for their loss in the honors which this house and the country paid their representative but it was indeed a somber day for the

with him that it has been reported by the wrong committee while in one sense it is a war claim in another it is an educational matter and hence it might properly be considered by the committee on education and labor i opposed the payment for the destruction of william and mary college for the reason that i thought it would be a bad precedent for this government to undertake to pay for damages which wore merely incidental to the prosecution of the war this claim for compensation by this institution for the use of its buildings for hospital purposes for a period~of four years by the government of the united states stands upon entirely different principles if there is either any law or any moral principle against the propriety of the government of the united states paying claims like this they are written in some book that i have never read this is simply and purely a claim for compensation for the us of this property and this institution of learning is just as much entitled in law and in morals to be paid a fair rate of compensation as any person in any other part of the country would have been had the government used his property for that purpose the confederate government never had any control of this property the government of the united states took possession of alexandria and the surrounding country i believe a day or two after the passage of the ordinance of secession by the state of virginia and before that state had become a part of the confederate government that portion of the territory of virginia in which the cemetery is situated was recognized by the government of the united statesduring the entire war as loyal territory it was represented in the senate of the united states during the entire war and during a portion of the war at

section are not subject to the point of order i think sir that even that clause is entirely subject to the point of order if in chicago and new york too much rent is paid cut down the rent make the officers rent less costly buildings but if you say they cannot have their quarters in any but governmental buildings you will be forced to send the army to headquarters where there are buildings where there are barracks when probably it is not a fit place for them the result would be we would soon be required to build or repair barracks in other places now it certainly does not show retrenchment when you say they shall not rot if they have got to have a building and cannot rent then they must build or they must buy it may be largely in the interest of economy to rent and it may be largely tending toward extravagance to be forced to build or to buy"]]}
