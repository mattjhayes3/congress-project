distinguished gentle man from michigan gets up and makes a point of order against it and will not even let the house vote on it the idea of charging 70 000 little school children here in this district

the first is this for a long while here in washington in the various bureaus and departments the chief only was not expected to do any work and was not expected to be at his desk more than a very short time each day his assrstant being expected to do all the work time has gone along until the assistants think that some privileges such as their chiefs enjoy ought to be accorded them by congress they think they are not shown enough consideration theythink they ought to be able to be idle and away from their offices just as their chiefs are whenever they want to and have some one else do their work for them and the practice has grown up in the bureaus and in the departments until now it is the second assistant who really does the work the first assistant and the chief being absent a great deal of the time if you do not think that practice has grown up you just pick out some chief of bureau tomorrow morning and ring him up antd see if you can find hillm ring him up about 11 oclock or about 2 or 3 oclock and see if you can find him then when he is reported out ask for his first assistant and it will be very strange indeed if you find him in it is tile secontd assistant who is there attending to biusiness now the coroner has found this out and his assistant has found it out and they think the same consideration ought to be accorded them as congress has accorded to the other bureaus and departments so they now ask for a second assistant coroner to do their work when a man is killed that is the first reason for the bill the second reason is that there are so mniy people being killed now on the streets of washington by automobilps that if any investigation is to be made they need a second assistant coroner to do it since it is beneath the dignity of a chief or a first assistant to perform any real labor at the request of certain citizens i spent some time tlls morning standing and watching along new jersey avenue at the junction of the streets from d street on down to massachusetts avenue i spent some time watching those taxicabs go to the depot you go down there its i did and watch for a few minutes and see the main danger that is o1 tile streets of washington every day and obstructing traffic it is mainly the white and black taxis and the other taxis as well but mostly the white and black taxis stand there as i did and watch how they fail to observe the traffic laws i saw a car this morning which in order to prevent a taxicab from running over italthough it had the right of wayskid over that wet pavement into the sidewalk and had its back bumper broken off because of the contact if it had not thrown on the brakes which caused it to skid but had attempted to exercise its right of way and cross that street the taxicab would have demolished it that ought to stop because of the many accidents we may need another deputy coroner so i did not raise any opposition to the bill and i know of no opposition to it so we will let him have another

woodrow wilson comes in the calendar only three days later than the birthday of the prince of peace that may largely explain why this assembly is here today a small part of an assemblage that at this hour reaches entirely around the world the legislature of oklahoma is only a very small unit in a day of worldwide mourning there is not a people beneath the skies who do not bow their heads at this hour and as we assemble in this stately hall to pay tribute to an american citizen similar audiences are assembled around the world to pay tribute to the greatest apostle of peace that has lived in these 2 000 years why is it may i ask you that not only 4xmericans but english and french and scotch and irish the people from polar snows to tropic zones are pausing at this moment to pay at least a tribute of silence to one who has gone down into the valley of the shadow why is it that the world stands with uncovered head and lifts a prayer of thanksgiving to the god of nations that woodrow wilson has lived on earth you must find that answer in the yearning hearts of a stricken multitude you must find it by the desolated fireside where the devastating heel of war has trod you must find it in the farspread cemeteries where the little white crosses look up so pitifully on this day of peace you must find it in the gospel of the nazarene who more than 2 000 years ago preached the gospel of peace on earth and good will to men we have met today to commemorate the life and public service of an american president discarding the indiscriminate eulogy which has long since become the proverbial blemish of funeral orations i desire to speak for a little while of mr wilson as he really was or at least as he seemed to me noble were the words of cicero when lie told us that it is the first and fundamental law of history that it shall neither dare to say anything that is false nor fear to say anything that is true nor give any just suspicion of favor or disaffection no less high standard must be invoked when considering the life and public service of woodrow wilson a great man of a great epoch whose name is blended with the renown of american arms and the civic glories of the cabinet and the congress hall a son of the south who became the head of a nation more populous and more extensive than was ever governed by a cmsar and the commander in chief of armies many times greater than napoleon ever led to war no man was ever subjected to sterner ordeals of character or closer scrutiny of conduct he was in rpublic gaze for 20 years and in the fate that at last overwhelmed him and overwhelmed his administration he stood erect and dauntless and as unshaken as a tower he conquered himself and forgave his enemies but he bent to none but god i could not nor indeed would i divest myself of those identities and partialities which makes me one of the people of whom lie was the chief in the supreme struggle for civilization but i desire to think for a moment of the greatest figure of his century who came into the world when he was most sorely needed and who has now finished his work and gone to the great beyond woodrow wilson was 4orn in staunton va he studied at davidson college and princeton he practiced law for a little while in atlanta he studied government at johns hopkins he was a teacher of government in many institutions he finally became president of princeton university governor of new jersey president of the united states and the dominating figure of a world crisis as a student in college as a professor in the university as president of a great institution as governor of an imperial commonwealth as president of the greatest republic in all the tides of time and as the dominant figure in a world council he dedicated himself to the service of mankind on the 4thof march 1913 when hundreds of thousands of people assembled at the national capital to attend his first inauguration lie had the moral courage and vision to say in the presence of officeseeking persons this is not a day of triumph it is a day of dedication then and there as in the past he dedicated himself to the public service he dedicated his office to the service of his people 11e dedicated his nation to the service of the world ruin wounds and death became his portion and so it is today as he goes down to be claimed again by the clods of the valley that every flag in christendom is i dipp1edingrief except the flags his legion conquered in the bleeding days of war service was the secret of his life but peace was his obsession we remember the criticism of 1916 when he refused to rouse the guns that slept on tile rio grande we remember the criticism of watchful waiting indulged in by people who did not know the truth he alone in the capital of his country knew that the dice of death had already been cast in the palace of potsdam and nothing but a miracle could hold back the hordes of war he endured the criticism the misunderstanding the misrepresentation and far removed from public gaze in his solitary chamber he wept in silence prayed in silence held the hand of god alone finally he was called upon to paint the vessels of a free republic in the shameful color of a barbers sign to protect them from the sleuths of the sea or to bear the flag as his fathers had borne on the sweeping fields of war time and again he pleaded that the cup of grief might not be pressed to the lips of the american people letter after letter was written to the house of hohenzollern imploring them to respect the laws of nations as al american people impatient and misunderstanding criticized his policy of tardiness or watchful waiting finally god brought the american people face to face with the realization of this problem that we must save the civilization of the old world or lose the freedom of the new it was then that the drum sounded the notes of mobilization and it was then that the american public girded itself for war as we stand today amid these battle flags and think of the great captain of the century who has gone to meet his maker a stone is rolled away from the sepulcher of memories and all the burial places of history yield their dead again we hear the order for registration and we see millions of young american manhood crowding to the registration offices we see them board the trains to go away to far away cantonnents to prepare themselves for the ghastly game with death we see them on the fields of training we see them going down to sea in ships crossing a darkened ocean in darkened vessels entering an alien port landing on alien soil and listening to an alien language they did not understand we see them again at gaudrecourt at barsuraube and tours preparing for the death grapple with the enemies of civilization we see them on tile long night march up to the front where the boys died in their tracks of sheer fatigue just as boys from chandler died we remember again the 18th of july we remember the bulletin sent out by the french high command bulletin no 1 germans again advancing french fighting gallantly but retiring americans holding bulletin no 2 germans still advancing french fighting desperately americans counterattacking bulletin no 3 great numbers of dead as the americans advance bulletin no 4 there are no germans but the dead and wounded south of the marno that was the answer of an american president to tile world that would not respect tile rights of civilization then the first administration was gone and in the stress of war we have forgotten the triumphs of that administration we have forgotten that between 1912 and 1916 years the quadrennium that 1ie first ruled this republic that 11e forced into the statute books of tile united states tile most progressive measures advocated in the campaign of 1912 by two of the greatest men that ever served the human race woodrow wilson and theodore roosevelt we have forgotten that in the stress of war and the bitter reactions of peace and we have forgotten much of his second adminislration the war having ended he went across the seas he went to write tile gospel of the nazarene in the statute books of the world he met the people of ancient nations lie met the wily welshman representing the british crown he met the old tiger who more than any other one man had saved france from her enemies he met orlando of italy he met representatives of many other great nations and he laid on the council table of the hall of versailles the same philosophy that was planted on a skullshaped hill on a cross between two thieves is it wrong to say blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god then woodrow wilson was wrong is it wrong to say as ye would that men should do unto you do ye unto them likewise then woodrow wilson was wrong is it wrong to say they who take the sword shall perish by the sword then woodrow wilson was wrong is it wrong to say thou shalt love thy god with all thy heart and soul and strength and mind and thy neighbor as thyself then woodrow wilson was wrong he came back to america to make his last battle he toured the western states and on the borders of oklahoma gods hand touched him and he became a martyr for the sake of principle and for the sake of peace abraham lincoln became a martyr for an ideal under the demoniac assassins bullet woodrow wilson was a martyr just as lincoln though he died a lingering death that extended for more than four weary years he died a martyr the american people could not understand his philosophy he presented to them problems which they had never heard they could not grasp the meaning of an eternal truth understand this today my friends the most dangerous thing that man can do in so far as his own peace and welfare lire concerned is to bring to the world a new idea a new philosophy or a new thought but dont misunderstand the logic of history you can kill the protagonist but you can not kill his philosophy if you could destroy ideals and ideas if you could destroy reforms and reformers by the assassins bullet or the flaming stake we today would be breechclouted savages worshiping wooden gods if murder could kill philosophy jesus christ would have died in vain if murder could kill philosophy the truths would have died long ago so while the unleashed passions of a misguided world and the bitterness of a maddened era murdered woodrow wilson tile philosophy he preached on earth is alive today and can not be checked by personal abuse the assassins bullet or the misrepresentations of an embittered time just so sure as the philosophy of the prince of peace is destined to live throughout ages the world will some day learn that we must save the nations from tile greed of war if we would save civilization and save humanity he would be a poor citizen and a poor american who would endeavor to interject questions of a political nature into a solemn occasion of this character but let us consider just a moment the background of the battle for the adoption or rejection of the treaty of versailles if you can understand that you can understand why woodrow wilson is dead today and not alive consider if you will in the pale light of these peaceful days the arguments presented against tile league ratification the argument of senator sherman of illinois that this is an organized effort to turn the civilized nations of the world over to the domination of the vatican contrast that argument if you will with tile argument of senator boaah that our ratification of the league covenant means the domination of all nations by the british empire which incidentally is the greatest protestant nation on earth consider the argument of senator reed of missouri that if we accept the covenant of versailles we pave the way for a world domination by the black races of the world hear again the argument made by more than 20 senators that this is a league for war and not a league for peace contrast that argument if you please with the argument presented before the senate committee on foreign relations by judge cohalan and bourke cochran that we oppose the league covenant because its adoption by the american nation will prevent all wars and we want the united states to wage war o1 the british empire to free ireland when you view in these peaceful hours and this late date those contradictory arguments you can look beyond the stirring scenes of the colnvention hail and senate chamber and public foruma and realize why woodrow wilson died it has been said everywhere never challenged or denied and never explained that one of tile leading united states senators who today is a member of the senate said in a council of his partisans woodrow wilson has brought back from europe the greatest state paper of modern times if lie secures its ratification by the american people his party will become the dominant party of our generation we must not permit that to be done ve must destroy the league and in order to destroy the league we must destroy woodrow wilson i do not know and i do not care whether those words were ever spoken but the spirit that would have expressed itself in such language lay behind the campaign of defamation that seat the great virginian to his grave every hiding place was open nothing was sealed or sacred to those who opposed the principles that lie sought to incorporate into law they went amid the hills of ceorgia and circulated the foul cannard that he had failed to erect a monument over the ashes of his first love and many people believed that falsehood even unto today no member of his family was exempt from the shrugging of shoulders and the shaking of heads his wife and his daughters were sneered at throughout the country that the league covenant might be defeated on tile 6th day of december 1919 a certain united states senator said i will be one of a committee to break down the white house doors and prove to the world that woodrow wilson is feigning sickness in order to capitalize sympathy and later on the same day he went uninvited this united states senator uninvited and unwelcome passed the attendant at the white house door then an attendant by the bedside of i dying statesman had rolled back the covers that lie might see whether the president of the united states was feigning illness that senator has been heard of recently ils name is albert bacon fall the campaign succeeded because the world was sick we were caught in the backwash of unexampled carnage finally a giant frame was broken down but his spirit remained ulcowed 0 great heart standing all alone so long amid the storm and wreck of bitter years unscathed by floods of calumny and hate unswerved by treachery unbalanced by fears led like as one before the altar stone to bleed a living sacrifice for hosts but do not mistake this occasion the clods of tile valley have claimed their own the frame that we called woodrow wilson has been returned to its kindred dust but a spirit stands today in this council hall bidding the sons of freedom of worldwide democracy of universal peace be of good cheer because an idea never has never can and never will die during the great sepoy rebellion in british india the sepoys took cawnpore and murdered every soldier woman and babe in the garrison they swept down the goomtl river and lald siege to the city of lucknow and 12 long weeks the people of that historic city shut in from all the outside world endured all the horrors of starvation all the terrors of bombardment they hoped for a season that havelock would come to their relief but finally that hope died away at last a little scottish lassie jennie brown wrapped herself in a soldiers pladdle and wasted by fever and by hunger threw herself on the ground to rest for a little while but suddenly she sprang to her feet and shouted dinna you hear it dinna you hear it it is the slogan of the highlanders the campbells are coming the cannoneers paused at their guns and listened but all their dull lowland ears could hear was the knell of vengeance that came from the sepoy lines but again the lassie shouted and will ye na believe it and will you na believe it it is the slogan of the highlanders i hear the pipes of gardons men i hear the clan call of the macgregor the campbells are coming they listened again and faint and far beyond the goomti they caught the skirl of the scottish bagpipes havelocks men were on the march and ere morning dawned the scottish front ranks had cut their way through the sepoy line and brought relief to the dying garrison of lucknow gentlemen do not misinterpret the truth of history the immortal purpose born in the brain of woodrow wilson is listening even now to the skirl of the bagpipes that beat a eulogy that reaches around the world and every son that has lied for freedom and every soul whose blood has consecrated those flags will know that the purpose for which he lived the gospel that he preached and the philosophy lie taught is as deathless as the sword of god silent seems the great avenger historys pages but record one death grapple in the darkness twixt old systems and the word truth forever on the scaffold wrong forever on the throne yet that scaffold sways the future and within the dim unknown standeih god within the shadow keeping watch upon his own the restless tides of humanity will continue to sweep over the land of battles the ages will rush on and rift the hills roll the waters flash the lightning weigh the sun the white sails of commerce shall thicken on our rivers and the black smoke of increasing factories darken our skies remnants of lives scarred from the battle will be interwoven with the hosts of freedom the sons of america will bear that flag as their fathers bore it to make the bounds of freedom wider yet but no braver ones will ever rise than those who sleep beneath the reddened sod fromn the valleys of lorraine to the beaches of flanders and none will come forth of braver heart or cleaner purpose to lead them in the battle to dust we give his body now the ages receive his memory they have never failed to do justice however tardy to one who stood by his people and made their cause his own we but forecast the judgment of the years to come when we say the world will recognize woodrow wilson as the master spirit of his century in the eyes of him to whom a thousand years are as a watch in the night the war and the century in which it came are but as a single throb in the breast of time and when in the future ages the myriads of this great world shall look back through unclouded vision the smoke and stain of slander shall hayv vanished from woodrow wilsons name the tall chieftian who led the hosts of freedom

farmer named joseph d stevens in this lease the war department had a right to dig a ditch across this tract to straighten a small stream called the washita river which makes a bend into the reservation at this point this river is not what we usually call a river it is a deep ravine a deep canyon through the valley the river bend is directly in front of the pumping plant and when the river gets on the flood 3tage it eats into the bank and has gradually eaten its way almost to the pumping plant it probably now is about 150 feet from the pumping plant the war department in order to change the course of the river desires this land for the cutting of a ditch to divert the trend of this river from this pumping station the lease which was made in december 1923 expires on the 30th of june of this year the ditch has been dug the river channel has been straightened and unless the war department exercises its option to buy this land on or before the 30th day of june of this year the owner of the land will find himself in the following condition he has surrendered possession of the land the ditch has been cut the lease will expire he will have lost the land and will have no recourse the department promised mr stevens that the lease was only temporary and it would pay him for the land as soon as the money was made available last winter i introduced an amendment to the war department appropriation bill providing for the purchase of this land a point of order was made that the amendment was not germane to the reservation because there is a river between the land and the reservation if that point of order was good then it is not good now because since that time the ditch has been cut and the channel of the river has been changed and the land is not now cut off by the river this matter was presented to the war department and the department has made an effort i understand to get approval of the item from the budget bureau the budget bureau held that it had no authority to include the item in the bill the war department is without authority to make the purchase unless authorized and i am now seeking by this amendment to authorize the closing of this transaction between this farmer and the war department the war department can not make payment until they have authority the budget committee can not insert the item without authority and congress is the only place where authority can be granted if this course is not followed it will take a special act of congress authorizing the appropriation and then a special item in some future appropriation
