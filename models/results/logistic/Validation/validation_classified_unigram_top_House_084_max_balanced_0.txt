allotments for farmers pointing to the other road is a sign go this way to spend billions for two reclamation projects which will grow more farm products to be supported as far as i can determine the administration has not yet achieved the miracle of going in two directions at the same time and i should like mr eisenhower to explain if he expects congress to achieve such a feat in formulating legislation that will benefit the national economy here we are confronted with two conflicting policies both endorsed by the president one policy calls for sharp reductions in farmprice supports and a decrease in agricultural acreage the other policy calls for spending enormous sums of public money to build two extremely costly desert reclamation projects which would produce more farm products to be supported by the nations taxpayers i feel sure that the administration leaders realize they have created a dilemma that can lead to serious difficulties for them i also feel that the nation is

of people who have met disaster it is commonly believed to be the right thing to do here in america we have responded many many times in the past if we do not restore this 330 000 to the program it

debate and i have listened with great interest to the comments that have come from men who have a dedicated concern about this problem i speak to you myself out of a wealth of educational experience i was the 1916 summer session teacher at sunny point schoolhouse district no 7 illinois township pope county ark i had reached the mature age of 17 i had only 81 pupils enrolled so you know that i imparted a lot of information that summer and acquired a lot myself it was a little oneroom schoolhouse and i could not find room to seat them all but i can say to you today on the basis of that experience and contemplating the conditions that have been presented to us today that this nation cannot long endure halfseated and halfsheltered i must confess that i am a bit envious of the members of the house committee on education and labor its members have produced a great piece of legislation and have participated in a dramatic forward step in rounding out a federal policy on education i am glad to give this measure my enthusiastic support while i have reservations as to some of its provisions particularly those which appear to bypass the states in the extension of credit to districts i am convinced that its formula for a grantinaid is basically correct and that it meets our responsibilities in the present emergency we cannot be sure of course how the bill will look when amendments have been acted upon and naturally i will reserve judgment on some of these very difficult questions that have been presented but i fear that in a discussion of some of the technical points we may lose sight of the crucial policy decision being made and might fail to do a constructive job in what is perhaps the no 1 problem in the united states some of my colleagues have spoken as if we were entering a new field i do not agree that this is the case as early as 1787 the first year in which we operated under a federal constitution there were federal grants to education so it is not a new program this is not the first study that has been made of federal and state functions in public education recently for example the commission on intergovernmental relations the kestnbaum commission of which i had the privilege of serving along with my friends the gentleman from new york and the gentleman from iowa attempted to approach this problem with an objective attitude there was little emotion in the discussion we gave to the problem over a period of months i would like the record to show that the kestnbaum commission recommended that where there is a proven need for school building construction federal assistance be extended to the states i am not prepared to say today on the basis of personal knowledge that the need exists in every state i know it exists in the state of arkansas but the committee finds it exists everywhere to me one of the most interesting phases of this debate is that two of the leading proponents from opposite sides of the aisle the gentleman from pennsylvania and the gentleman from pennsylvania come from a state which would contribute more to this program than they would receive from it obviously we will not do a good job from the national standpoint if we base our decisions solely on the effect on our individual states this bill meets established standards for grantsinaid it is a states rights bill it provides for a specialized program only and it is definitely limited as to time and the amount that may be expended there is a wholesome interest throughout the country in redefining more precisely the functions of government the kestnbaum report contains interesting historical data on federal assistance for education the commission pointed out that the concept of primary responsibility by the states and localities for elementary education is basic in our government that principle is unimpaired by this bill the commission found however that the federal government has long been interested in public education the land grant program of 1862 advanced by mr lincoln projected a federal interest into school problems in succeeding legislation notably the smithhughes act of 1917 the vocational education programs in which the distinguished chairman of the house committee mr barden has been so influential and more recently public laws 815 and 874 all evidence a deep concern on the part of the federal government for the effectiveness of our school system those who designed the patterns of our government recognized the relationship of education to free institutions james madison put it like this a popular government without popular information or the means of acquiring it is but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy or perhaps both and as the gentleman from new jersey reminded us george washington in his farewell message asked the citizens of the young republic to promote those institutions that make for diffusion of knowledge if in the simple society of the nineteenth century leaders in the federal government recognized a relationship to the problems of education certainly we of the twentieth century constantly made conscious of the interdependence of communities and states should be equally responsive to it some of my friends from the same area i am honored to represent say that the states are able to meet this problem assuming that they could this policy would impose great hardship upon many states and would disregard the principle of equalizing tax burdens consider the contrast between the poorest area and the wealthiest area within the nation in 1950 areas of the 9 most favored states had 22 percent of the nations children and 30 percent of the nations income the less favored area had 8 6 of the children and 1 6 of the income in other words in that favored area there was 19 times the income and 21 2 times the children so the favored area gets an advantage of 71 2 times per child over the least favored region the language read to you by the gentleman from alabama was as clear as it could be on the question of limiting federal authority over the schools as i tried to indicate it is a specialized program it does not deal with general aid it does not even touch the problem of curriculum and personnel it does not deal with ideological questions when you provide brick and mortar to build schoolhouses for children you escape many of the problems that defy solution the gentleman from california put his hand on one important phase of the legislation yesterday and again today i refer to the mobility of people california has a severe problem but the states which supplied her new population were left with problems too mobility of wealth is another element to consider not only in the nation as a whole but within each of the states there are islands of distress in the wealthiest state moreover the favored states will benefit from the building up of schools in the less economically favorder states one of the best speeches i ever heard in support of federal legislation in this field was at a kiwanis meeting in pennsylvania the speaker said pennsylvania will contribute more than it will receive but people who come from the less economically favored states to live and work among us will as a result be better prepared for our industrial life and will be greater assets to us it would be money well spent for us pennsylvanians at one stage of the discussions pertaining to aid for schools the theory was advanced that only the extremely lowincome states should be the recipients of federal aid if the equalization principle could be applied with perfect precision that might be true but i am glad that in this building program it was found advisable to include every state for the emergency is nationwide according to the united states office of education figures in 1952 we had 1 million classrooms needing 312 000 additional classrooms to house our 8 881 000 children nearly onethird of the children enrolled in 195253 were affected by the classroom deficit at the beginning of 1954 there was still a classroom deficit of more than 300 000 increased enrollments require 50 000 new classrooms annually with obsolescence requiring 8 000 additional classrooms we are building 50 000 to 60 000 classrooms annually meeting growth needs but not reducing the deficit the cost of 300 000 classrooms is 10 to 12 billion so we can see the importance of federal assistance to eliminate the shortage this bill would provide arkansas with 22 907 488 over a 4year period a significant contribution to overcoming the classroom shortage in my state but obviously leaving the major responsibility to the state and local government educational agencies thus the theory on which this legislation rests is unassailable the kestnbaum commission classified the historic grantsinaid programs as those first to support stateadministered activities that carry a primary federal obligation second to stimulate activities that should remain state functions but carry certain national aspects and third to equalize throughout the nation the opportunities and advantages that should be governmentally sustained it is fair to say i believe that this legislation is impressed to some degree with all three of these motivations the declaration of the kestnbaum commission to which i alluded in support of schoolbuilding construction rested upon a compromise it reads as follows the commission recommends that responsibility for providing general public education continue to rest squarely upon the states and their political subdivisions the commission further recommends that the states act vigorously and promptly to discharge this responsibility the commission does not recommend a general program of federal financial assistance to elementary and secondary education believing that the states have the capacity to meet their educational requirements however where upon a clear factual finding of need and lack of resources it is demonstrated that one or more states do not have sufficient tax resources to support an adequate school system the national government through some appropriate means would be justified in assisting such states temporarily in financing the construction of school facilitiesexercising particular caution to avoid interference by the national government in educational processes or programs the need is great and the proposed remedy will go far toward meeting it for that reason i favor this legislation"], [7.301568984985352e-05, 0.49992698431015015, 0, "i ask that you direct the witness to answer

somewhat unique position of being down here in the well today urging the house to pass foreignpolicy legislation which i think will support the administration at the present time house resolution 370 which i introduced on january 12 and which was unanimously reported by the foreign affairs committee on march 13 is designed to lend the support of the house of representatives to president eisenhower and the administraiton in certain respects of this governments foreign policy as the state department said the department is in complete agreement with the premises from which the resolution proceeds and with the aims expressed in its operative paragraphs these are indeed the policies of the united states government in the formulation and implementation of which the department of state has been largely concerned adoption of the resolution would support the department in its firm intention to promote these policies by all practicable means in his state of the union message on january 5 president eisenhower made the following remarks which form the basis for house resolution 370 in all things change is the inexorable law of life in much of the world the ferment of change is working strongly but grave injustices are still uncorrected we must not by any sanction of ours help to perpetuate these wrongs i have particularly in mind the oppressive division of the german people the bondage of millions elsewhere and the exclusion of japan from united nations membership we shall keep these injustices in the forefront of human consciousness and seek to maintain the pressure of world opinion to right these vast wrongs in the interest both of justice and secure peace i should now like to discuss the three specific international injustices to which house resolution 370 refers first of all the oppressive divisions of the german korean and vietnamese people the presidents message only referred to the division of the german people the house will recall that when the four heads of government from the united states the united kingdom france and the soviet union met at geneva last summer there was an expression of agreement that germany should be reunified by means of free elections this was put in the form of a directive to the foreign ministers for the october meeting at geneva and at that time we the british and the french put forth specific plans which would provide for the reunification of germany in a framework of european security and by means of free elections in both west and east germany of course the house will also recall that the soviets refused to provide for free elections in east germany since they feared that their east german satellite government would be overthrown it is the soviet union therefore that is directly standing in the way of a unified germany today however the pressure of world opinion may yet force a change in the soviet resistance if we focus and continue to focus public attention on this question as the president did and as house resolution 370 does the soviets may eventually be unwilling to shoulder the responsibility for continuing to keep germany divided the language of house resolution 370 also points to the division of the korean and vietnamese people which in my opinion is no less a grave international injustice than in the case of germany the united nations itself has consistently supported the objective of a unified korea in 1947 this government proposed the holding of free elections throughout korea under u n supervision a proposal which was then adopted by the general assembly and which has been endorsed repeatedly however the communists have rejected this idea very likely for the same reason as in germany again it must be our stated policy to focus world public opinion on this grave injustice at the recent 10th general assembly a united states resolution was adpoted in reaffirmation to these objectives and soviet opposition thereto was overwhelmingly defeated in korea no less than in germany we must continue to show the principles for which we stand and how they are being prevented and thwarted by soviet obstructionism and communist reluctance to see their satellite regimes take their own chances in a free election the present division of the vietnamese people was effected through the 1954 geneva conference to which the united states was not a party the house will recall that the accords reached at that time envisioned the eventual reunification of vietnam through free and secret elections conducted throughout that country it has become plainly evident however that in vietnam as in germany and korea the communists have no intention of permitting free elections in that part of the country which they control again it must be shown that we stand for the right of peoples everywhere to a free choice of their own political institutions just as it must be shown that in each case it is the communists who continue to deny that right of free choice i hope that the passage of house resolution 370 will serve to reemphasize this fact before the eyes of the world the second international wrong covered under this resolution is the exclusion by the soviet union from membership in the united nations of japan the republic of korea and the republic of vietnam this is of course through the use or the misuse of the veto power the presidents remarks only referred to japan and the original language of the resolution was drafted accordingly however the committee felt that south korea and south vietnam are equally qualified for membership in the u n and that their exclusion by soviet vetoes was no less of an arbitrary injustice than in the case of japan the house will recall that the soviet union vetoed the admission of south korea in april of 1949 and december of 1955 the admission of vietnam in september of 1952 and december of 1955 and the admission of japan in september of 1952 and twice in december of 1955 this government has of course fully espoused and endorsed the admission of these three countries to united nations membership and the attention of the world should again be directed to the fact that they are being blocked only through soviet intransigence this is yet another objective of house resolution 370 the third injustice mentioned in this resolution the continued existence of millions of people under communist bondage is one which has many times been brought to the attention of the house and of the congress yet i believe its reemphasis is important at this time this government has repeatedly condemned the suppression of human rights and political freedoms among peoples who were formerly free and independent it raised the matter with the soviet union last summer at geneva and again in october at the foreign ministers conference no satisfaction was gained but the anxiety and concern reflected in the soviet reaction gave ground for much speculation concerning the true conditions among the captive peoples the house will recall that when president eisenhower sent a message of encouragement to the captive peoples last christmas mr khrushchev protested violently against what he termed internal interference in the affairs of the satellite states the house will recall that mr hagerty in reply issued the statement that the peaceful liberation of the captive peoples is and remains a goal of united states foreign policy in the midst of the developments both political and ideological which are taking place today within the soviet union developments whose effects could conceivably be felt among the captive peoples it is important that we again reassure them that our hope and belief in their peaceful liberation and political freedom remains constant and unchanging in view of what has occurred in the past it is also important to remind them that this government will make no agreement which would in the slightest degree tend to confirm their present temporary state of captivity and slavery the fact that we consider this captivity as one of the great international wrongs existing in the world today was clearly stated by the president last january 5 and deserves to be repeated by the house today it is so important mr speaker and my colleagues to convince these people of our hope and concern for their freedom that we cannot repeat these sentiments too often in retrospect therefore the adoption of house resolution 370 today by the house will signify the following that we recognize that there are in this modern world grave injustices to many peoples and many countries which still remain uncorrected that we are convinced that the united states government and the american people whose representatives we are must not by any sanction of seeming accession help to perpetuate these wrongs it will mean that we believe that the present oppressive divisions of the german korean and vietnamese people constitute unjust and oppressive denials of the desire of these people for and their inalienable right to reunification of these respective countries under terms and conditions which guarantee political freedom selfdetermination and independence for all free election for example should be a prerequisite it will mean that we believe that the exclusion of japan the republic of korea and the republic of vietnam by the soviet union from membership in the united nations constitutes an arbitrary and inequitable act which is contrary to the best interests of these three countries as well as the united nations itself the three countries mentioned here are fully qualifie l for membership in the united nations and i believe they are not only more qualified than countries such as communist poland and communist czechoslovakia for example but i believe they are better qualified for membership than is the soviet union itself it will mean that we recognize the fact that there are millions of people throughout the world who still exist in bondage under soviet and chinese communist tyranny it will mean that we believe that such conditions as all of the foregoing threaten the achievement of international peace and security toward which the policy of this government and the entire free world is directed it will mean that we believe that this government has a duty to keep these injustices in the forefront of human consciousness and it will mean that we support this government in seeking to maintain the pressure of world opinion to right these vast wrongs in the interest both of justice and a secure peace therefore i urge it to be the sense of the house of representatives that it shall continue to be the policy of the united states government to exercise its leadership and moral strength in the righting of these international wrongs and injustices that still exist in the world today in closing i would like to express my thanks to the distinguished chairman of my committee the gentleman from south carolina whom we shall sorely miss here after this year as well as to the leadership on both sides for their kindness and cooperation in permitting me to bring this resolution to the floor of the house today i have sometimes heard it expressed that in matters dealing with foreign policy the house of representatives tends to find itself overlooked or bypassed i think that the passage of this resolution today will show that the house is also aware of its responsibility in this important field and that it is in support of president eisenhower in his announced intention to keep these wrongs before the conscience of world opinion and to seek to ally the pressure of world opinion to right these wrongs i urge the adoption of house resolution 370"]]}
