inflation taxes and pollution affect everyone indeed there is a feeling americans are being cheated despite our material affluence for what has happened is that while national wealth has increased the lions share of it has gone into fueling americas military machine a staggering monolith that has come to have its own lifefree of public appr6val or congressional review what this means is that we have allowed our tax dollar to be wasted on costly weapons systems that do not really increase americas defense while our domestic needs wallow in perpetual fiscal crisis and if we have been guilty of procuring useless new weapons the miliz tary establishment is also guilty of violating our trustindulging in wasteful practices costing billions and allowing contractors to earn excessive profits indeed although the threat to our national security has not increased in recent years and we continue to have the worlds most powerful military machine defense spending continues to escalate while our real national priorities are ignored the latest harris survey indicates that over half of the american people place defense expenditures on the bottom of their list of spending priorities what americans want is more money for job training the fight to curb crime medical care improved schools and better housing and the battle against pollution the facts are that in fiscal 1970 health education and welfare spending totals only 3 2 billion while the swollen defense budget is peaking 82 billion social spending will equal about 11 2 percent of the federal budget defense combined with the 16 5 billion interest for postwar debts will account for over 60 percent of the budget so when americans complain they are not getting their fair share of americas wealth they need only look to the defense budget for congress recognized its commitment to help create a decent life at home but we have allowed ourselves to be bled for wasteful armaments the gap between amounts congress authorized and what wasactually appropriated for domestic social programs this year totals some 6 billion and it is estimated that over 30 billion would be needed to meet the full cost of domestic programs within the next 3 years however the funds for combating crime aiding education and improving the enviroriment have been absorbed by the military machine with procurement rising 37 billion in a decade to say nothing about the multibilliondollar cost of fighting in vietnam but let me make it very clear criticizing military spending does not mean the united states should compromise its defenses the fact is our military superiority over the soviet union has reached the stage of overkill and alleged stories of russian buildups are pure fantasy which if believed could only lead us t6 escalatiag the arms race to doomsday proportions the unitedstates polais nuclear submaririe fleet is unmatched we have three times as many ships as the russians do we have the only intercontinental bomber force as well as numerous advanced strategic armament systems unknown to communist russia and we have the worlds largest army 3 5 million soldiers is there any chance of our defenses being depleted or our security slackened obviously not but theres an awful lot of waste inefficiency and false assumptions in that defense budget that should be eliminated the review of defense spending should start with h r 14000 the 21 4 billion military research and development and procurement authorization before us what is involved is our efforts to assure more efficient and economical allocation of funds for defense programs that are essential to the national security probably about 10 billion is at stake we are also concerned about the post vietnam division of the 30 billion being spent on the war the needs of the poor the environment and the oppressed taxpayer must be met yet defense industries are pressing for new weapons to avoid i5roblems of economic conversion such as lower corporate earnings but behind the public debate at issue over defense spending is the nature of our future defense postures from an isolationist fortress america to a global pax americanathe administration is hard at work designing postvietnam foreign policies and assigning defense dollar costs to each which could create defense budgets ranging from 35 to 115 billion for the 1970s if many of the dubious strategic systems incorporated into this hastily illconceived procurement authorization bdfore us are approved ultimately they will cost the nation billions and threaten to accelerate the nuclear arms race i lend my support to prudent efforts to curtail the senseless escalation of americas military machine and the dangerous staging of global confrontations inherent in these unilateral defense buildups simply stated the defense department has not presented congress with sufficient tational explanations for why we should siphon off billions needed to meet the aspirations of americans at home the safeguard abm the csa transport the legally questionable chemical and biological warfare program the reliability of the advance manned strategic aircraft the credibility of the shortrange attack missiles and the necessity of new naval buildups all of them are vulnerable to the reasoning of sane men suggesting that for too long congress has given the pentagon carte blanche to do as it pleases if the problems plaguing us are going to be solved then i believe we better justify every tax dollar allocated for defense spending to the american taxpayer if we want to restore trust in the defense department and more importantly in the belief that we have the resources to secure the promise of america"], [0.9223558753728867, 0.07764412462711334, 1, "i thank the

declared a disaster area due to the extraordinary rainfall and floods it was the intent of congress that the small business administration provide loans to disaster victims the johnson administration led the public into believing that federal funds would be available for loans to small businesses damaged or destroyed by natural disasters most businessmen who have applied for small business administration disaster loans have been told that they are not eligible or that there is no money available this is a gross misrepresentation by the federal government it is cause for great frustration and disillusionment to the devastated small businessman trying to dig his business out of the mud and to rehabilitate himself under present conditions the small business administration disaster loan policy is a disaster in may 1968 the small business administration administratively denied lowinterest loans to any victim who could arrange a private loan at the higher going rate of interest or who had any asset which could be converted to cash small business administration policy practically requires the businessman to sign a paupers oath before he can participate in the small business administration disaster relief program the johnson administration revised its sba loan policy and procedures because of the budgetary strictures the johnson administration got in a budgetary bind so it cut the heart out of the sba so the small businessman who is devastated by disaster is receiving no help the sba revised its procedures administratively to deny loans it could now well revise its procedures to grant loans in a declared disaster sba should grant lowinterest loans to all defined disaster victims to the full extent of their documented lossless of course insurance entitlements sba loans should be made to all declared victims regardless of their business or personal assets or their ability to borrow privately sba loans are not grants all loans are repaid a declared disaster is a disaster to every victim of flood all disaster victims need help the more financially responsible the disaster victim the more likely he will repay the sba the full amount of any loan sba loans must be prompt and uncomplicated by redtape the simpler the procedure and the fewer the prerequisites for qualification the more helpful the sba loan program will be to the disaster victims the present 3percent interest sba loan is unnecessarily low even small businessmen who suffer great disaster do not ask such lowinterestrate loans in todays interest market interest at 2 percent below the fha interest rate would satisfy the disaster victims and not cost the federal government so much during periods of high interest rates the current fha interest rate is 71 2 percent under my proposal the sba interest rate would be 51 2 percent an alternate interest rate could be a rate equal to the governments cost for borrowing money during the year of the loancurrently approximately 5 percent either interest rate would be appreciated by the bona fide small businessman neither interest rate would cost the government more than it is required to pay to borrow the money an sba policy of providing 5 2 percent interest rate loans for the full amount of the net loss of a declared disaster victim would put the sba back in the disaster relief business be most helpful to the disaster victim and cost the federal government very little other than the administration of the program many disaster victims in my congressional district have experienced similar frustrations
