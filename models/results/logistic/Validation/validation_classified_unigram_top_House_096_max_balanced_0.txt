only of our colleagues in the house but the american people that there are ideas that we can pursue as my friend from georgia has eloquently pointed out the republican party has a major disagreement with the current administration and with the democratic party majority in congress we believe that with proper economic policy we can have full employment without inflation they do not i am pleased to join my colleagues in this special order to explain that the republican party is offering policy alternatives which can increase productivity and employment and reduce inflation at the same time the economic policies of the administration and this congress have clearly failed inflation has raged above 13 percent during the first 11 months of this year productivity has dropped employment is slowing chrysler has come to us for a bailout and others will follow the housing industry steel industry thousands of large and small businesses across the country are teetering on the brink of collapse others have already gone under it is hard to find anyone in washington today who will admit anymore to believing that unemployment and recession are the answer to inflation but all of our policies are still based on that assumption the budget recommended by the administration and adopted by this congress over the united objection of the republican party can be summarized in one sentence in order to get inflation back down to 10 6 percent next year federal policy will be to throw more than 1 million americans out of work the idea that higher tax rates unemployment and wageprice controls are necessary to stop inflation is based on the notion that spending is what causes production employment and growthfederal spending private spending deficit spendingbut that it also unfortunately causes inflation so the answer to inflation is to restrain federal spending and private spending through higher taxes and wageprice controls and slow down the economy but across the potomac a couple of hundred million americans are under the impression that economic growth is what happens when hard work thrift and ingenuity are rewarded and none of these virtues ever caused inflation we believe that americans understand the nature of inflation and growth better than our economic policymakers inflation means too much money is being created by the government and too few goods and services are being produced by americans to stop inflation we must hold down the administrations creation of money which is occasioned by congress excessive spending but that is only half the story we need higher production more growth and more jobsnot less efforts to control wages and prices and to raise tax rates on americans are literally counterproductivethey are disincentives to production and inflationary in themselves congress and the administration are not doing their job of stopping inflation americans are ready and willing to produce if only the government will let them this is how the republican party views the economic situation and this is the nature of our recommendations first we need acrosstheboard reduction in all income tax rates which are a tax on all individual productivity work saving investment enterprise we must also make it the law to index or adjust the income tax brackets every year for inflation to stop inflation from pushing everyone into higher tax brackets and index capital gains tax or abolish it second we need to stop our outdated tax law from forcing businesses to overstate profits and pay too much in taxes by understating the true cost of depreciation and inventory replacement we must adopt measures to adjust each of these for inflation by accelerating asset depreciation and permitting replacement cost accounting third we need to restore some sanity to the field of federal regulation although the government consistently fails to regulate what it ought toa constant value for the dollarit is overregulating everything else in sight there is no excuse for any control on wages prices interest on saving energy or anything else when such controls are binding they cause shortagesshortages of gasoline shortages of unitedstates crude oil shortages of savingand when they are not binding they cause surpluses of aggravation and inefficiency in the field of health and safety regulation congress should rewrite the laws and demand that regulatory agencies base their policies on costbenefit analysis and congress should limit the cost of compliance with federal regulations through some sort of annual regulatory budget finally we need to get the money supply under control by making it clear to the federal reserve that it has only one taskstabilizing prices both the price of domestic goods and services and the price in dollars of other strong currencies the fed should ignore interest rates and measure its success by two criteriaappreciation of the dollar against the german mark and swiss franc and the slowing of the unitedstates producer price index the federal reserve will be materially helped in doing its job of stopping inflation if the congress does its job of limiting spending and restoring incentives for production employment and productivity this is the republican economic programmeasures to restrain the creation of money and ease up on tax and regulatory policies to encourage production with this formula we believe we can once again have full employment without inflation we challenge the democratic party to outline the reasons it believes we cannot have a strong economly and a strong dollar and to outline the policies which flow from that belief then let us put them both to a vote on this floor and before the american people in november in reality this is not a republican idea it is the american idea but we propose to offer it to the american people in 1980"], [0.007548391819000244, 0.9924516081809998, 1, "committee of conference conference report on h r 111

district ratio of 1to1 however before we create this new allpowerful bureaucracy in washington let us look at past experience the last time congress was asked by the administration to create a new federal department was in 1977 to solve our energy problems president carter asked for and received a cabinetlevel department of energy with a budget of 5 billion in only 2 years energy has progressed from a problem to a crisis and the department of energys budget has increased from 5 billion to 11 billion overregulation of the oil and gas industry by the doe has caused domestic production of oil and gas to decrease to the point where we now import half of our oil requirements by creating a new department of education the same crisis will occur in education that has occurred in energy the educational problems in this country are not caused by a lack of federal intervention but from too much federal involvement under the programs of the new frontier the great society and the educational modernizations of the 1960s education in america drifted away from the basics of reading writing and arithmetic furthermore the federal government became involved with education through forced busing affirmative action quotas and enforced educational experimentation which has greatly interfered with the discipline and authority of school principals and teachers this bill not only centralizes educational policy at the federal level but it also mandates the new department shall run schools they will be in charge of all military base schools and indian schools which means they will have the dual capacity of creating and carrying out policy their standards on books and courses for federal schools could become federal guidelines for all public schools who receive federal money past experience would remind us that federal guidelines usually become federal regulations results show that as federal intervention in education increased scholastic achievement decreased in 1964 and 1965 when the federal government first decided to become involved in local eduational activities the scholastic aptitude test sat averages were 473 verbal and 496 math for a 969 total score every year since there has been a steady decline in our students test scores in 1977 and 1978 the sat averages were 429 verbal and 468 math for an 897 total we must reestablish leadership in the local school board it is interesting to me to see how many organizations are opposed to the creation of an allencompassing department of education the aflcio the washington post the christian science monitor the american federation of teachers the national catholic education association and my state school board of texas all oppose the new department at a time when federal interference is ruining our educational system by causing mismanagement creating higher costs decreasing teacherprincipal discipline and preventing a return to the basics in education we do not need to enlarge the federal governments role in education at a time of rampant inflation and huge budget deficits we do not need a new bureaucracy that costs 14 billion a year to maintain and is guaranteed to grow all the money will just be used to increase the federal regulation of education and the country does not need and cannot afford any more federal regulation let us sum up why the creation of a department of education is no good for the united states a separate department means more spending in 1977 congress created a department of energy with 5 billion in 1979 the energy department got 11 billion and energy had grown worse from a problem to a crisis the federal governments active intervention in education began in 1964 school achievement has gone downhill ever since as sat grades decreased from 969 total in 1964 to 897 in 1978 this bill puts the department in charge of schools teachers courses and curricula at military bases and indian schools we should anticipate that these rules will

following goals first curtail general revenue sharing to state governments second extend general revenue sharing to local governments for 1 year rather than 5 years in the form of an annual authorization subject to appropriations and third require a study by the gao of the relative value and duplication of federal direct grant programs versus federal revenue sharing programs to state and local governments this bill revenue sharing amendments of 1980 recognizes the simple fact that when the federal government is operating with a budget deficit there simply is no revenue to sharethere is only debt with the fiscal year 1980 federal deficit estimated at some 40 billion or more we are in no position to spend nearly 6 9 billion of the taxpayers money each year on an item such as this recently we have heard that tax relief is not timely because we need to balance the budget but we also hear that balancing the budget is difficult because about threefourths of it is uncontrollable due to entitlement programs 6032 co general revenue sharing is just such an entitlement program if it is extended for 5 years as some have proposed congress will have no control over this budget item during that period and as a consequence some 6 9 billion a year will be added to the federal deficit we cannot fairly call the budget uncontrollable if we refuse to control it revenue sharing to the states alone accounts for about 2 3 billion of the annual total despite the fact that at least 45 of the 50 states have experienced budget surpluses consistently in recent yearssomething the federal government has not had since 1969 even if future economic conditions change this situation states have the power just as they always have to increase taxes or reduce spending in order to keep their budgets balanced they too must accept their responsibility revenue sharing to local governments is a different case since they do not enjoy the same powers as the states when it comes to raising revenues likewise their recent fiscal history has not been as favorable as that of the states nevertheless i believe this portion of the revenue sharing program should be removed from the entitlement category and funded as a annual appropriation by the congress in order that spending priorities for all federal programs can be considered however worthy their case may be local governments revenue sharing money also comes from taxes if we are to control taxes and spending this aspect of revenue sharing must receive the same strict scrutiny as the state portion overall my opposition to revenue sharing is based on three major points first revenue sharing has not replaced other federal expenditures aimed at the states and localities it has supplemented them this additional money comes from additional taxes for every plus sign in this case revenue sharing money there is also a minus sign somewhere in this case in our pocketbooks we are paying for these programs through higher taxes my second reason for opposing revenue sharing is that the program has not functioned entirely as originally intended as the ways and means committee noted in its report accompanying the original revenue sharing act the funds made available to state governments are designed to encourage them to expand their revenue sources in other words the bill helps the states to help themselves but as we have seen the exact opposite has resulted instead of enhancing their revenueraising procedures states have used their share of revenue sharing funds to offset what otherwise would have been reduced state

the bill will become law its enactment is vital to the veterans administration and our nations veterans on may 19 by a vote of 406 to 1 the house passed and sent to the senate h r 7102 the veterans administration healthcare personnel act of 1980 on june 5 the bill passed the senate unanimously among other things the bill would increase the special primary and incentive pay for certain physicians and dentists employed by the veterans administration it would authorize the establishment of a scholarship program for physicians and nurses a program similar to those being effectively utilized by the department of defense and the department of health and human services the bill contains various pay and other incentives for nurses and other veterans healthcare personnel so critically needed by the agency we all know the difficulty the department of medicine and surgery is having in recruiting and retaining young highly skilled physicians it is also experiencing extreme difficulty in recruiting and retaining skilled nurses the situation became so critical in the early 1970s that in 1975 congress found it necessary to provide additional pay incentives for certain physicians the physicians and dentists pay comparability act of 1975 authorized the administrator to pay up to 13 500 in special and incentive pay to hardtorecruit physicians the average payment made under current law is about 7 000 h r 7102 vetoed by the president would increase the special pay for the first time since 1975 a 5year period when the inflation rate has been staggering although the president in his veto message states that he is concerned about attracting and retaining excellent va physicians he says the current salary and benefits are more than sufficient to accomplish this neither the administrator of veterans affairs the chief medical director nor anyone within the agency agrees with the president when the chief medical director appeared before our committee on april 16 of this year to explain his difficulty in recruiting and retaining highly qualified physicians he stated that a large majority of those leaving employment with the veterans administration are leaving because of noncompetitive salary fringe benefits and retirement benefit considerations he further stated that recruitment is becoming increasingly difficult with periods required to recruit averaging almost 10 months and recruitment for some medical specialists taking between 1 and 2 years in many cases in fiscal year 1979 the agency spent about 18 million to contract with private physicians to provide certain critical services such as radiology pathology anesthesiology and similar services hopefully when fully implemented this bill will save that 18 million and more i will not take too much time of the house to discuss the merits of this legislation we clearly established the need for the bill back in may i am frankly puzzled and at a loss to understand the action of the president he obviously did not listen to his administrator of veterans affairs his chief adviser on veterans issues mr cleland knows and the president should know that several hundred beds have been closed in some va hospitals because of a lack of nurses in a report to the committee in july the chief medical directors office informed us that more than 400 beds had been closed because of nursing shortages the report stated that more than 200 beds had been closed in the state of california alone yet the president vetoes a bill that is specifically designed to fill those vacancies and to reopen those beds the committee has also been advised through a recent survey of all va hospitals that there are currently 723 physician vacancies and 1 051 nursing vacancies if funds and personnel were available based on current patient demand these hospitals could use 1 482 more physicians and 4 716 more nurses yet the president says the bill is not neededthat current salaries and benefits are enough i wish he would tell that to needy sick and disabled veterans who are being turned away from va hospitals and outpatient clinics the president also states that the bill is too costly i do not know where he got his cost figures for this bill he says the special pay for physicians alone would cost 80 million during the next fiscal year that is simply not true according to the congressional budget office the special and incentive pay for all physicians and dentists in the bill that passed the house in may would be 40 million the cost of the amendments worked out with the senate which the president vetoed are even less finally the president failed to mention a major costsaving provision contained in the bill he makes no reference to an amendment supported by the committee on the budget that would realize projected savings of 109 million in the next fiscal year he does not mention that this costsaving provision more than offsets the cost of the increase in physicians and dentists pay if enacted the bill will save more than 50 million next year i do not understand where the president is coming from on veterans issues he has been criticized by many veterans and some organizations for being insensitive to veterans needs i am beginning to understand their feelings through the office of management and budget he has continued to reduce healthcare personnel in the last 2 years his policies have brought about reductions of more than 6 000 positions congress by legislative mandate forced him to add back 3 800 of those positions last year the appropriations committee has added another 1 000 in the fiscal year 1981 appropriations bill to help restore the cuts that he has made we know that more than 5 000 beds have been closed during the past 2 years while patient demand is at an alltime high these actions do not support the presidents statement that during his period in office he has worked with the va to insure that the health care provided to our veterans is the finest in the world i submit there are thousands throughout our land who feel his policies have substantially reduced the agencys ability to provide adequate health care for our veterans it is regrettable the

presidentelect and to the next congress in their efforts to reduce expenditures they will have to make the bitter and the difficult determinations they will have to advise congress and congress will have to act on them so we did not decide and determine where specific cuts should be made what we did was to take the correct accurate estimates of what outlays would be not only in the total aggregate of 648 billion but also in the functional breakdowns in the various functions of government and we applied the correct numbers there and then we assessed an arbitrary reduction across the board excluding defense and interest on the debt and offsetting receipts because of the realities of trying to reduce those three functions recognizing that it is impossible to reduce those three functions and we assessed the reduction pro rata across the board to all the other functions the next question that faced us was how much should the reduction be below the 648 billion we could have cut the entire 43 billion deficit we could have reduced that entire amount and been in balance that would have been improper that would have been unrealistic and to try to reduce expenditures by 43 billion would have imposed an impossible burden on the incoming administration and on the incoming congress it would really and truly have been sandbagging so clearly we did not adopt that course how much then should we reduce it what would be a sensible attainable goal in reductions we came up with the figure of about a 2percent reduction we were guided quite honestly and frankly to a great extent by the fact that the presidentelect himself has indicated that he thought 2percent reduction in federal spending could take place in fiscal year 1981 as a matter of fact one of his advisers i
