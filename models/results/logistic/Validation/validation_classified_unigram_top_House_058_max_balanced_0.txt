in this particular but in several other particulars the president of the united states nominated by the republican party and elected by the people is beginning to assume a distinctly democratic attitude in the first place we read from the newspapers that sooner or later he is going to have at your hands a revision of the tariff downward that he is going to stop certain exploitations of the american consumer for the benefit of the foreigner that he is going to prune off some of the excrescences and abnormalities of the present tariff law clad tidings these are to a longsuffering people then we hear in the next place that the president is not so bitter in his denunciation of democratic opposition to government by injunction in fact that he has gone so far as to say that an injunction ought not to issue when labor troubles arise unless it be after notice and after hearing or opportunity to be heard i particularly welcome this step toward the democratic position because although the position taken by the president and his attorneygeneral with regard to injunctions in labor troubles is a questionable position and one that will require very serious thought in order to settle it right to the satisfaction of the people yet the position itself proves a fortiori the justice of the demand we make in connection with this bill that temporary restraining orders shall not issue to supersede a rate prescribed by the commission except after notice to all parties litigant and ample opportunity to be heard i can imagine an occasion when a mob maddened by injustice dealing out destruction to life and to property might have to be dealt with quicker than the delay that a legal notice would necessitate but if it be right to require notice and hearing in connection with what is called the inherent judicial equitable right of injunction in labor troubles then a fortiori it is right to demand them in a case like this where there is in the interim power given to enable merely a decreased percentage of a certain freight rate which the railroad would like to collect to be collected i begin to hope that the time will come when your president will see that it is altogether absurd to keep on a peace footing 20 000 more soldiers than are needed for any practical purpose and to see that it will be well enough to save the money required for that purpose about twenty millions a year and devote that money to the development of internal improvements rather than to a wasteful war expenditure but that is not all i read lately in the presidents message that he is assuming a position that i am afraid some of you republicans will regard as dangerously close to one of mine i remember not so many long months ago making a speech upon the floor of this house and attempting in my ineffectual way to draw a picture of the manner in which we treated cuba and the manner in which we treated the philippes and i dubbed it two pictures and i asked the american people to look upon this and then upon that and see vhith they liked most at that time i was met with sneers ve all were we were little englanders in america and you boasted of going a worldpowering attaining steppingstones in the shape of islands around the earth with our flag shaking in every breeze in every latitude and longitude to the stirring beat of the drum now here lately i see in the presidents message that he hopes to welcome the day when the philippines can be treated like cuba moreover the other day in the committee on ways and means the most sagacious man connected with his administration governor taft expressed the same hope there was one difference between usbetween him and ushim and the democracy as well he wanted the filipinos treated like the cubans but he is not willing yet or as be says he is not able yet to give exact dates at which we shall begin so to treat them we can and will give the date andwith its givinga temporary bridge government between our rule and their independence now i know you well enough to know or well enough to hope rather that you will not need much more than a inarkedout pathway by your president to follow him you are so absolutely nonpartisan you are so fond of what is american whether it be democratic or not that when the president of the united states wants you to do democratic things if they be right things you are going to fall into line behind him not because he is president not because he is a republican but because he is outlining the proper policy for the american people i have that thought of confidence in you because sitting here for long years i know how absolutely nonpartisan you are there is not a man on that side of the chamber who would not welcome from the democratic nazareth even a good measure if it were good for american people therefore i take no stock in the talk that has been going on on the floor lately about your not standing up to the president of the united states because he has gone over to a certain extent to the democracy my friend the gentleman from ohio tells us that it is the habit of the democratic party to find out where the republicans camped last year and then for it to camp there the next year that old thing i have heard often and there has been some truth in it because the democracy has known frequently when a fight was lost and now i find and the country finds that it is you who are camping this year where the democracy camped last year i find that you are going to camp more and more by the silent but not expired fires of the democracy but there will be this difference my friendsthe democracy will camp with you democrats are not going to give up things democratic because you or the president advocates them they are not to turn their backs upon things democratic because a republican either in or out of the white house has seen the light of truth and of proper legislative progress now i hear some little pessimism however as to how you are going to behave i hope there is nothing in it i am told that you will not follow the president unless he remains partisanly republican i hope that it is not true and if it is true then the sort of railroad legislation you want and you want it just as soon as possible is a bill that shall devise some sort of automatic coupler between the white house and capitol hill now my friends i am not going to make assertions about the past position of the democracy upon this question without proving them i am not going to read now but i am going to insert in my remarks almost a page from the report of the industrial commission page 426 of that report for 1902 here it is within two months after the establishment of the interstate commerce commission it began to interpret the law as giving it not only power to investigate matters of freight rates but also to prescribe and enforce the remedy for existing evils the exercise of ratemaking power however was directed entirely to the correction of such abuses as came before it on complaint the commission distinctly refrained from claiming the right to prescribe the rate in first instance as is shown by its decision in the delaware and hudson canal company case this limitation upon its right to prescribe rates fully recognized by itself is clearly shown in its statement in the cincinnati and chicago freight bureaus decision as follows this commission is not primarily a ratemaking body the carrier is left free to arrange its own tariffs in the first instance we sit for the correction of what is unreasonable and unjust in those tariffs no question either on the part of the carriers of the commission or the courts was raised as to the validity of this action within the limits named it was not until almost ten years after the institution of the commission in fact that its right in this respect was contested the first shadow of doubt seems to have been expressed in the decision of the supreme court in the socalled social circle case adjudged in 1896 this case involved the reasonableness of rates from cincinnati to the town of social circle ga as related to the rates to atlanta and augusta on either side disregarding other phases of the case which concerned the interpretation of the long and short haul clause the commission had when the case was first decided in 1889 ordered a reduction of the rate from cincinnati to atlanta from 1 06 to 1 per 100 pounds this case was carried to the supreme court where decision was finally rendered in 1896 purely as an obiter dictum the court discussed briefly the interpretation of the original act in respect to this ratemaking power it expressed a reasonable doubt in the premises even going further and confessing inability to find any provision of the act that expressly or by necessary implication confers such power it does not seem clear whether by this statement thecourt had reference to the arbitrary prescription of rates in first instance to the carriers or merely to action of the commission in prescribing rates after complaint in order to redress grievances then i am going to insert as a part of my remarks a bill introduced by me after consultation with democrats upon this side as expressing the democratic pqlicy upon this identical question on december 10 1903 stopping now in connection with the bill only to say this that that bill contained these three vital principles which are the principles of the presidents message and the vital principles of the davey bill presented by us now as a substitute to wit that where the commission declares an existing rate off it shall have the power to declare another rateon secondly that that rate shall become operative the original bill said immediately the davey bill says after twenty days notice by the commission and that it is to remain operative continuously until set aside by the final judgment of some court of competent review or appeal read your presidents message and you will see that that is just exactly what was in it that is not all i am going to insert in the record and i willf read a little bit of it now not only that bill but some remarks of my own which i made upon the floor in advocacy of that bill on january 21 1904 and i will read the following now among other things said by me on january 21 1904 but will quote later the balance of my remarks on that occasion we propose upon this side to say this that whenever the interstate commerce commission pronounces a given rate unreasonable they shall have then and there the power to fix in its stead a reasonable rate and this rate shall be operative until on final judgments by proper proceedings in the proper federal court the finding of the commission shall be overruled it is not arming them with the power to make an omnibus schedule all over the country but wherever on question raised by complaint or otherwise they declare a given rate to be unreasonable they shall then have the power to state what is a reasonable rate and furthermore that that rate shall he operative until it is set aside by due process of law that is all i do not think myself that any small body of men could arrange or ought to be empowered to arrange an omnibus schedule for so vast a country with such divergent sectional interests as ours are you going to stand pat against this plainly just demand of the interstate commerce commission too after listening to that tell me whether the president has or has not toemarked the foot track of the democracy by the almost identical utterance in his message listen further this is the bill to which i referred with the further remarks made by me at the time on this subject a bill to empower the interstate commerce commission to fix transportation rates in certain contingencies be it enacted etc that when hereafter the interstate commercecommission shall declare a given rate for transportation of freight or passengers unreasonable it shall be the duty of the commission and it is hereby authorized to perform that duty to declare at the same time what would be a reasonable rate in lieu of the rate declared unreasonable sec 2 that whenever in consequence of the decision of the interstate commerce commission a rate has been established and declared as reasonable and litigation shall ensue because of such decision the rate fixed by the interstate commerce commission shall continue as the rate to be charged by the transportation company during the pendency of the litigation and until the decision of the interstate commerce commission shall be held to be error on a final judgment of the questions involved by the united states court having proper jurisdiction that is h r 6768 introduced december 10 1903 in commenting on it and urging its consideration then i added it merely asks that the present absurd condition of things in connection with the interstate commerce commission be done away with i refer to this condition the interstate commerce commission has power to declare a given rate when the question concerning what it ought to be is before the commission to be unreasonable and to forbid the railroads from collecting that rate say it is 50 cents the railroad changes it to 49 cents the commission declares 49 cents unreasonable and the railroad changes it to 48 cents each time theshipper or a new shipper must lodge a new complaint and so on if the railroad chooses ad infinitum there stands that interstate commerce commission acting under a law so puerile and childish that the commission has the power to declare a given rate or charge unreasonable but is without any legal power to declare what rate would in its stead be reasonable that is not all as a consequence of the puerility of the law when the commission declares 50 cents unreasonable let us say then the railroad can immediately have it reviewed in another court or otherwise they instigate litigation and motions demurrers bills crossbills etc go on and on and on and in the interim the railroad is benefited by being permitted to continue charging the rate declared unreasonable the railroad receives the benefit of the doubt of what the final judgment may be and not this tribunal erected by this great government the shipper must pay in pendente lite to the railroad paying what the interstate commerce commission has denounced as unreasonable my friend mr adamson of georgia the senior democratic member of the committee on interstate and foreign commerce has introduced a bill simply embodying all the recommendations of the interstate commerce commission that and nothing else you need not adoptall of them but some of them are surely worthy of adoption some of them ought to be indorsed will you stand pat against all of them now i see before me a manthe

him to his preentproud political eminence in that notice of contest contestant alleges th t 13 584 men voted for george howell who had not resided in the election district where they voted the

statements or allegations are so wild rash reckless and erratic that no rational mind can conceive them tobe true if they are true there was not a legal vote cast for george howell out of 13 600 there may be some element of truth in each and every allegation made by the contestant and if there is i desire that it be carefully weighed by the house but his boldest allegation one that imputes gross fraud contains not a single grain of truth contestant sets forth as his strongest allegation that 21 245 bal lots marked with the circle at the head of the democratic column were counted fbr george

marked and counted for george howell in the testimony of 6 500 witnesses you cant find one these facts and figures may form no part of the majority report but they have been sent broadcast over this

he said that these terminaltrack and sidetrack systems should be legislated out of existence this republican bill has not got a word to say about it nor has the davey bill the hearst bill covers both of these points absolutely but to prevent all shadow of doubt mr shacklef od and myself took the liberty of adding two amendments expressly in terms covering these two identical iniquities and providing for their suppression now why did not the eschtownsend bill include this i will tell you the gentleman from michigan said upon the floor of this house that the eschtownsend bill was a compromise so it is you can not keep corporate influence out of any political partyrepublican democratic prohibitionist populistif you organize them from now until the day of judgment it may be in one party more than another but it will insert itself into every political party some but when he said that i firmly believe i charge no bad faith upon the gentleman or upon his side of the chamberthat this corporate influence impressed itself so upon the minds upon the individuality upon the sentiment and upon the consciousness of those gentlemen that they do not make this bill go as far in remedial legislation as the situation demands why a double appeal why this interminable litigation why not put into their bill that when the orders of the commission are violated deliberately that the court can either fine or imprison the hearst bill does that why what do these people who make up a great corporation and a great trust care about a fine of ten or twenty thousand dollars after a civil judgment is obtained but you have got to convict the corporation before you do even that who would want to unreasonably imprison a citizen of this country who would care to take a man of high standing and wealth and unnecessarily degrade him but why not put in this legislation direct notice to these men that they are not so high or so rich or so powerful or so high in their social influences that they are above the laws of the land why not write it into this legislation that if they willfully violate these laws that a court can fine or imprison as it sees fit why not hold this rod this whip if you call it that over the heads of the violators of the law whether they be big or whether they be little then sir you would see a situation in this country similar to that which has been exhibited in england where they do not pay much attention to the question whether violators of the law are big or whether they are little when whitaker wright put out his false prospectuses to the british people and outrageously fooled and swindled them what did the english government do it arraigned him in court tried him like a common felon convicted him and in order to escape the penitentiary he suicided in the court room it is the willful and repeated violator of the law that imprisonment should be inflicted upon i aim my remarks at no railroad man i have some good friends among these railroad gentlemen some of my relatives are engaged in railroading own stocks and bonds and are actively engaged in the management of those corporations i would not reflect upon them and i have no reflection to make upon any of those distinguished gentlemen in the land many of whom i honor for their high social position their great character their great minds and their great abilities i freely concede it and i make no insinuations no indirect charge nothing that will reflect upon any railroad man of this country i merely say write into the laws of the land that anybody holding these vast instrumentalities for good and evil who shall willfully trample upon the rights of the people of the land shall suffer punishment by imprisonment as well as fine that is all i say and the eschtownsend bill is deficient in that while the hearst bill contains that alternative so that wherever a violator of the law has broken it willfully the court can apply the imprisonment feature what judge unless he was a lunatic or an absurd fool would think of taking any man of high standing and good character and subjecting him upon a mere whim or for an accidental violation of the law to the imprisonment feature never but if that man be he high or low willfully violates the laws of the land willfully does what the president of the united states says is wrong what these two political parties ought to say is wrong why not make him amenable to a criminal statute if he has willfully and wantonly done it and repeated it why not make him liable to the criminal featme of this statute as well as subject the corporation to a fine the hearst bill accomplishes that i was astonished and amazed at the declaration of my friend the gentleman from alabama who is not here now when he said that the worst feature of the hearst bill and that which he objected to more than any other was that it provided that the interstate commerce commission should compel these lines of railway to furnish cars to the people on their lines why he spoke as if that was some indefensible and outrageous attempt to perpetrate a fraud upon the rights of the railway i say that unintentionally the best friends that the railroads wantonly violating the laws of the land have in this body are my honest friend from alabama and gentlemen who superficially think as he does why that clause in the hearst bill was put in there to cure the evil growing out of the facts disclosed in mr hearsts suit against the coal trust it there appeared that the coalcarrying roads who own the railroads who own the mines in pennsylvania who own 90 per cent of the unmined anthracite coal in that state who own all the means of transportation except over two railroads who have complete power to put up and put down the price of coal whenever they pleasetheir own freight agent the freight agent of the reading railroad testified that whenever they saw fit they canceled their tariffs and cut off the supply of cars and stopped running them just as soon as the coal trust got the markets of new york loaded up with their coal they cut off the supply of cars and there is no law to prevent it because the present statute

it there is the outrage in it there is the wrong in it just as soon as the market supply in new york begins to sag then they put on these tariff rates again and away go th6 cars of these six consolidated companies bearing their own coal to the markets of the world just the moment that they get that market filled up and just about the time the independent operator finds that cars are running again and begins to make application for cars they cut off their tariff schedules and stop furnishing cars that clause was put there by somebody who is a good judge of what is going on in this

it will be seen that by the monopoly granted by this bill there is a margin of 7 60 per ton to be appropriated by the vessel owners and the cordage trust on such terms as they may agree upon before the point of outside competition is reached the fact that the interests of the philippine treasury as well as our own farmers are ignored does not seem to influence the advocates of this measure one can not read the testimony taken before the committee without being impressed by the deplorable fact that the only interests that received any consideration at the hands of the committee were the vessel owners and the cordage trust the rights and interests of the filipinos and the american consumers were not taken into account and barely referred to i shall print with my remarks the first three sections of the pending bill which relate to the subject under discussion if 6ur legislation were such that we could reasonably expect to develop our trade relations with the philippine islands if congress had shown the least disposition to comply with the recommendations of secretary taft to remove or at least reduce the tariff against philippine products i should vote for this bill with pleasure there would then be some justification for extending our coastwise navigation laws to the philippines when we extended our coastwise laws to alaska to hawaii and to porto rico we had already established free trade between the united states and those outlying possessions or conferred it by the same act that extended our navigation laws but by this bill without reducing or repealing the tariff on philippine products we say that such trade as may exist in spite of the tariff and it will necessarily pe confined largely to the importation of manila fiber shall be monopolized by the american vessel owners we prohibit the filipino vessel owner from carrying the products of his own industry of his own country to our shores no such enormity has been proposed by the legislation of any governing country since the days of the american revolution this bill is in effect a shipsubsidy measure except that instead of paying the subsidy out of the united states treasury it is taken in part from the philippine treasury and in part to be borne by the american consumer had this bill provided a direct subsidy to american vessel owners i doubt very much whether the republican leaders would have ventured to bring it forward just before the presidential election the other subsidy propositions we have been informed are to rest until the short session of congress but i want to embrace this opportunity to reiterate my oftexpressed conviction that there is no justification for any form of ship subsidies at least so long as we pursue our present policy of trade restriction if i have heard it once i have heard it a score of times from the lips of republican members on this floor during the present session that every importation of foreign products or foreign goods although taken in exchange for our own products is a misfortune and a calamity one may well ask if it be a national misfortune for a vessel to bring a cargo of foreign products or of foreign goods to our shores to be exchanged for our own productions then why tax the people by subsidies to invite misfortune upon what standpat principle can you justify a policy that if it effects any result it will be to put more vessels in commission and to bring more foreign products and more foreign goods how can our republican friends escape the inconsistency of advocating more vessels and more cargoes when they deprecate as a national calamity every cargo that is landed do they intend paying subsidies for carrying ballast their position makes logical the generous solicitude of the fond mother in the song of our boyhood days mother may i go out to swim yes my darling daughter hang your clothes on a hickory limb but dont go near the water if we want to make it profitable for american ships to engage in the philippine trade let us give them work to do let us give them cargoes to carry we could well use the philippine sugar tobacco and other products against which we now maintain an insurmountable tariff wall if we owed obligations of duty to cuba we owe such obligations in an infinitely greater degree td the filipinos while colonists of spain the filipinos had untramneled access to the spanish market with their sugar with their tobacco and their other products they have been excluded from that market and are deprived of access to ours if we would make them customers for our products our flour our meats and our industrial goods we must take theirs they have no stores of cash to pay for our goods they can only take them by exchanging their own and that as was well expressed by the late president mckinley is the law of all trade in its first annual report the philippine commission had hopes that the 25 per cent reduction of the dingley tariff would help philippine trade the second annual report in 1901 demanded of congress a 50 per cent reduction in its third annual report 1902 the commission urged the reduction of at least 75 per cent of the dingley rates of duties upon goods imported into the united states from the philippine islands on pages 6 and 7 the commission presents the following argument in support of its petition second we urge the reduction of the duties imposed on goods and merchandise imported into the united states from the philippine islands so as to make them not more than 25 per cent of the duties imposed by the dingley law the reduction of only 25 per cent and the absurdly small effect of that reduction upon the trade between the islands and the united states shown in the collection of little more than 11 000 of duties in five months demonstrates that if any benefit at all is to be conferred upon the philippine islands by such action the percentage of reduction must be largely increased o we feel confident that a reduction of 75 per cent will not result in a dumping upon the american market of either tobacco or other commodities so as perceptibly to affect that market while on the other hand the ability to sell in the markets of the united states will be of the greatest encouragement to the woefully depressed agriculture of the philippine islands under the conditions which we have described the reduction of 25 per cent instead of being an aid to us in winning the good will of the philippine people if it is not followed now by further reductions will lead them to believe that we are merely going through the form of a concession which amounts in fact to no concession at all that the united states is merely keeping the word of promise to the ear and breaking it to the hope listen to the commission again as to the amount of the reduction required to give urgent relief we think that a 50 per cent reduction will not give any substantial relief and that nothing short of 75 per cent will accomplish a useful purpose it is a mistake to suppose that the severance of these islands from spain has made no difference in the markets to which their tobacco and sugar growers may look on the contraryd with the separation from spain the sugar and tobacco growers have been deprived of markets which were of great assistance to them and it seems only fair and just that the united states should substitute its own markets for the spanish markets that was the condition in 1902 civil governor william h taft chairman of the commission furnishes in a separate report the following facts touching the depths of the industrial depression for which relief was prayed war and pestilence had destroyed 90 per cent of the carabaos the draft animals of the islands with which agriculture and rice culture in particular was conducted the rice acreage was therefore reduced 75 per cent and a people who at one time produced rice enough for their own food consumption and more were compelled to spend about 15 000 000 to buy food with which to live the price rose from 4 to 7 a picul of 137j pounds in the footsteps of war cholera swept the islands with a record of 100 000 deaths whole villages and agricultural districts were depopulated by cholera smallpox the bubonic plague and beriberi and agriculture and business were demoralized with agriculture the only industry prostrated ladronism was a powerful temptation in order to escape famine said governor taft it is not certain whether in the present depressed state of agriculture with the temptations to ladronism the constabulary will be able without the aid of the military to stamp it out were there any attractions to agriculture were there prosperous conditions in the country it would not be a troublesome matter to deal with but when want and famine are staring pec pie in the face the life of the freebooter offers to the desperate and the weak a very great attraction finally congress was importuned for 3 000 000 with which to cope with pestilence and famine while bond issues were resorted to for internal improvements the commission now comes forward with its fourth annual report detailing conditions in 1903 and praying congress for the fourth time for tariff relief in its recommendations to congress under date of december 23 1903 it places tariff reduction as the first requisite in the bill of relief measures the commission begins its statement to congress as follows the commission therefore has the honor to recommend that congress be requested to enact legislation as follows first legislation which shall reduce the tariff on sugar and tobacco imported from the philippine islhnds to not more than 25 per cent of the present dingley rates on tobacco and sugar imported from foreign countries discussing the agricultural conditions and the necessity for tariff relief the commission says on page 4 the conditions with respect to sugar and tobacco continue to be very unfavorable and the arguments in favor of a reduction of the dingley tariff upon these articles to 25 per cent of the rates of that tariff on sugar and tobacco from the philippines grow stronger instead of weaker in taking up the subject of the coastwise trade the commission protests against the application of the coastwisetrade law of the united states to the philippines on the ground that to give a monopoly of the carrying trade to american bottoms will increase the carrying rates already too high but if congress is bent on applying the coastwisetrade law the commission falls back on tariff concessions and demands as a consideration for this necessary increase of freight rates that congress shall strike down the tariff wall made by the dingley tariff in the matter of the importation of sugar and tobacco from the islands to the mainland in this connection the commission says page 8 the commission of course can not present any objection to legislation which shall unite more closely the philippine islands with the united states in bonds of amity and mutually beneficial business relations but it most urgently and earnestly invites your attention and that of congress to the great injustice which will be done to the islands if the law which limits the means of communication to american bottoms between the united states and the philippine islands does not at the same time and as a consideration for this interference with the natural laws of trade and the necessary increase of freight rates strike down the tariff wall made by the dingley tariff in the matter of the importation of sugar and tobacco from the islands to the mainland the people of the islands may well ask what advantage are we to get out of association with the united states in a business way if our trade is to be used only for the purpose of increasing the business of american ships while the limitation of the coastwise laws by increasing the freight rates will reduce the business that we now have with that country does not every consideration of justice require that if the philippine islands are to be treated as a part of the united states and subject to the coastw se laws they should enjoy the same freedom of trade with the united states which is enjoyed by every other part of the united states to which those coastwise laws are made applicable we respectfully urge therefore that as a condition and as a consideration for making the trade between the islands and the united states coastwise trade the duty on sugar and tobacco should be reduced to not more than 25 per cent of the diugley rates the disaster that has befallen the sugar industry of the philippine islands during american occupancy is shown in the fact that during the last six years of spanish rale the exports of philippine sugar averaged more than 500 000 000 pounds per annum as compared with an average of 120 000 000 pounds during five years of american rule a shrinkage of over threefourths in 1893 under spanish rule the exports reached the high mark of 585 800 000 pounds while in 1901 they were shrunken to 77 000 000 during the past year there was some increase in volume but governor taft states that far from this being an index of increasing prosperity the planters axe more deeply in debt at the close of the 1903 season than at any previous time in their history bad as was the condition immediately after the close of the spanishamerican war it is apparent from the picture drawn by governor taft and the philippine commission that the condition of the sugar and tobacco planters under american rule and dingley tariff walls has been yearly growing worse says governor taft on pages 53 and 54 of the recent report the planters have been steadily losing ground since 1on and have only been encouraged to continue the operation of their estates by the hope each year that their products would he admitted to the markets of the united states at a much more favorable rate of duty than is now imposed the shipments to the united states have been very small 71 000 000 pounds of sugar were exported last year in vessels which cleared for the delaware breakwater for orders a very small proportion of this was shipped into the united states the larger portion being carried into canada or england and all the sugar entering the united states except one cargo which was allowed to enter free during the brief period when there was no import tax on imports from the philippine islands resulted in a heavy loss to the shippers the islands of panay and negros are among the most ticky opuated and the inhabitants and business interests depend directl irectly upon the sugar industry which is at this time in an exceedingly precarious condition and unless something is done by congress to relieve the situation there must be a total industrial collapse in those provinces were there admitted to the united states three or four hundred thousand tonsand there is no likeihood that in the near future the exports of sugar from the islands t the united states will reach an such sumit would not have any effect upon the price of sugar in the united states bat it would greatly increase the prosperity of the two important provinces named sugar is also raised in pampanga cavite and laguna hut not so successfully as i negros and panay the conditions prevailing i the islands of negros and panay are typical of those throughout the islands the growth of sugar in formosa is aptto interfere very largely with the sugar trade of japan which already is hampered by a heavy duty tobacco the falling off in the production of leaf tobacco has already been alluded to as well as the causes for the same i can not too strongly urge the necessity for the reduction of the dingley tariff in its application to goods imported from the philippine islands toss per cent of the rates therein imposed iam confident that neither in the sugar market nor in the tobacco market will the effect of the amount to be introduced be materially injurious to any interest in the united states while at the same time it will be of the greatest importance to the prosperity of the islands and will be a most convincing argument with the people of the archipelago to show the real interest that the people of the united states feel in the welfare of the filipino people when the united states is compelled to import from threefourths to fourfifths of its sugugaconsumptionsomething like 2 000 000 tons a yearit is strange indeed that it can not permit even 10 per cent of those imports to be furnished by its own colony to keep the latter from ruin and famine as to the fear of competition because of a possible low cost of labor in the philippines we find on page 170 of the 1902 report of the commission inthe t estimony of captain of engineers robert mcgregor united states army relating to an investigation of labor conditions the following statement at present considering wages and efficiency work costs about 20 per cent to 25 per cent more than in the united states how completely we have removed from the filipino his spanish sugar market is shown in the fact that in 1900 not a pound of filipino sugar found a market in spain while in 1901 the exports to spain were just 149 pounds valued at 12 were it not for the more liberal treatment and welcome markets of great britain hongkong china and japan our sugar planters in the philippines would have no market for their sugar of 163 000 000 pounds exported in 1900 over 58 000 000 went to hongkong 52 000 000 to japan nearly 30 000 000 to great britain 16 000 000 to china and even 6 000 000 to egypt whereas just 311 782 pounds got over the bristling dingley tariff wall of 80 per cent ad valorem into the united states refusing to admit from the philippine farms the sugar product we are unable to market in the philppines our breadstuffs provisions hardware machinery clothing and dry goods we have not only done what we could to destroy the planters ability to buy but we have so completely alienated him that he has no desire to trade with us governor taft states on this last point that the trade of american merchants in the islands is confined almost exclusively to the army and the handful of american civilians whereas the foreign merchant has the entire filipino trade the number of americans upon whom the american merchants can rely he estimates at not more than 20 000 whereas the number of filipinos whose trade might make a most lucrative business in these islands is 7 000 000 and this trade goes to foreigners says governor taft page 50 of the report in regard to the relations between the american merchant and the filipino consumers the sale of cotton goods is almost wholly with the english houses today the handling of hemp which is the largest export of these islands is almost wholly confined to foreign houses there is not the slightest reason why this business should not be done largely by americans especially in view of the fact that the united states is the largest purchaserof hemp in the world it requires the investment of a very considerable capital the construction of warehouses in the various hemp provinces and the establishment of friendly relations with the hemp growers and buyers in each province the american business man in the islands has really up to this time done very little to make or influence trade he has kept close to the american patronage and has not extended his efforts to an expansion of trade among the filipinos until this is done and more american capital is brought here for the purpose we can not hope that the imports from the united states to the islands wll be increased in very large proportion such is the picture drawn by leading republican officials of the commercial and industrial conditions brought about under republican rule and in a large measure the result of republican partisan policies is the prospect any better for the future under the regime of stand patism the only gratifying feature of our recent philippine discussions to my mind is the fact that our republican friends are more and more eliminating hypocritical references to destiny and the discharge of christian duty in their consideration of pending measures they now justify their philippine regime for it can hardly be said that they have formulated any policy if they have they refrain from disclosing iton the score of necessity to maintain our prestige in the far east and for the profit that will inure to our commerce on the score of profit much might be said in addition to the original cost of the investment which is conservatively estimated at 500 000 000 we have an annual charge on the treasury of upward of 50 000 000 on account of philippine expenditures direct and indirect and what have we to show on the other side of the ledger for this terrible drain upon our wealth and industry we have some twenty millions of commerce four millions of exports in round numbers largely for the use of our government officials and employees some fifteen millions of imports principally manila fiber our statistics show by comparison that we would probably have had this or a larger trade bad the philippines remained spanish certainly if we had permitted and conserved their independence the questions which now confront us are not the wisdom or unwisdom of past action but how we charged with the present responsibility of administering public affairs can best alleviate the intolerable conditions that exist retrieve the errors of the past as far as may be and inaugurate a policy that will redound to the credit of our own people and to the benefit of the filipinos to me it seems that this can be accomplished not by imposing further shackles to trade but by removing the barriers which now prevent that commercial intercourse which to my mind presents the only hope for the amelioration of present conditions as to the democratic side of this house i need hardly say that we stand ready by voice and vote to further any proposition brought forward by the majority for furthering friendly intercourse between the philippine people and our own you have tried the methods of warepressionand now you propose monopoly we ask you to give the instrumentalities of peace and good will a trial these are my individual views andi repeat that i believe them in accord with the membership of this side of the house instead of granting the tariff relief which would revive philippine industry and extend the market for our own products it is the deliberate aim of this bill to further hamper the trade and to impose additional burdens upon the two peoples congress last year voted 3 000 000 with which to save the victims of our tariff policy from famine ladronism and starvation three millions more are now asked for to relieve industrial distress during the present year congress is asked to vote a bond issue of 5 000 000 with which to undertake internal improvements for the relief of the philippine people when governor taft frankly tells us of course if the dingley tariff were reduced and an impetus given to the business in the islands by the increased production of sugar and tobacco and other sales in the united states the increase in the revenues would probably keep pace with the increase in expenditures then why do we deny such relief why do we burden the filipino with monopoly instead of extending him the means of selfhelp i know you are determined to stand pat you may ease your conscience by occasional charity from the national treasury but sooner or later the good people of the united states will repudiate the policy that imposes intolerable burdens upon us and tends to perpetuate a condition of pauperism and crime in the unfortunate islands"], [0.8895699605345726, 0.1104300394654274, 1, "ir chairman the good of the postal service as well as a desire to do justice to the postoffice clerks should prompt such legislation as will establish a fixed system of promotion the need for a definite system of classification has been recognized by every postmastergeneral since the time of general lames in 1881 extracts from the reports of former postmastersgeneral are herewith submitted exhibit no 1 these extracts from reports demonstrate that it is the opinion of those competent to pass upon the matter that there should be a reclassification of salaries of postoffice clerks then why should congress refuse or decline to act upon the recommendations contained in these reports in exhibit no 1 will be found a memorial that was addressed to the postmastergeneral by the clerks association on the 24th day of november 1903 this memorial sets forth in detail the unfair conditions that surround the postoffice clerks and the injustice that the lack of system subjects the postal service t6 salaries of letter carriers are fixed by law600 for the first year s00 for the second year and 1 000 for the third year of service the hours of carriers are limited by law to eight the railway mail clerks receive 800 for their first year of service and 900 for the second year after which promotion is rapid the railway mail clerk works one week and is off one week but the present law for postoffice clerks provides for a minimum salary of 400 per annum with no provision of a definite nature for promotion the hours of the postoffice clerk are not limited and frequently as many as twelve hours of service are exacted in one day prior to july 1 1899 congress simply made a lump appropriation for the purpose of clerk hire in postoffices the sum varied each year in amount but about the period mentioned 1899 would average 10 000 000 annually it was the custom to turn this amount over to the superintendent of the salary and allowance division to be apportioned among the many different postmasters throughout the country the evils of this system were set forth in the report of postmastergeneral howe in 1882 which is submitted herewith exhibit no 1 in 1899 congress evidently recognized the iniquity of such a system adopted the plan of making the socalled segregated appropriation and has continued this plan up to the present time these segregated appropriations aimed to fix the number of clerks that might be employed at any given salary but the recent investigation of the postoffice department demonstrated that the mere segregation of the items of appropriation will not establish system or prevent wrongdoing the investigation of the postoffice department simply developed the fact that the salary and allowance division paid no attention whatever to the limitations provided in the segregated appropriations for clerk hire it seems very evident that no definite estimate of the true and exact number of clerks in each salary grade was ever submitted to congress in the report of the salary and allowance division for the fiscal year ending july 1 1902 exhibit no 2 a statement of the number of clerks promoted in each grade is submitted this statement is entirely inconsistent with the provisions made by the preceding congress the fact that this report of the salary and allowance division was a public document shows that no attempt was made to conceal the fact that the law was violated this failure to observe the intent of the law should have been taken cognizance of by the committee on expenditures in the postoffice department of the house of representatives whose duty it is under the rules of the house to exercise supervision over the expenditure of such appropriations the second session of the fiftyseventh congress acting on the estimates submitted by the postoffice department aimed to provide for the promotion of more than 7 000 postoffice clerks last year the investigation of the department showed that the estimates submitted were not a true indication of the actual number of clerks in the different grades as a result of suddenly attempting to comply with the provisions of the segregated appropriation after so many years of failure to comply more than 3 000 deserving postoffice clerks were denied promotion because it was found the grades to which they were to have been promoted were already filled notwithstanding the estimates to the contrary as submitted to congress the socalled segregated appropriations for clerk hire now run from 18 000 000 to 20 000 000 annually there is practically no system for the distribution of the vast sum some one man is responsible for the work and no matter how honest or capable he may be he can not make a just and equitable distribution of this sum of money under this system favoritism or worse is bound to exist some postoffices receive greater consideration than they are entitled to and many receive practically no consideration at all the need for a revision of the present system was so apparent that the postmastergeneral appointed a commission composed of seven postmasters and the first assistant postmastergeneral and superintendent of the salary and allowance division to look into the subject of reclassification for postoffice clerks this commission met in washington on december 22 1903 and a copy of their report is submitted herewith as exhibit no 3 this commission adopted a resolution asking favorable consideration for the theory of annual promotion for the great rank and file of the clerks as the correct solution of the present bad conditions exhibit no 4 an extract from the current report of the postmastergeneral states that the number of clerks in each grade now complies with the number stipulated by congress this report states that the end was achieved by taking advantage of the 5 per cent transfer clause in the law now in an extract from the current report of the first assistant postmastergeneral exhibit no 4 the present number of clerks in each grade is supposedly set forth but the fact that the 5 per cent transfer clause was taken advantage of is evidence within itself that the number of clerks in each grade now can not be what the estimate of the first assistant would indicate as his figures are the exact figures of the appropriation bill of last year the point in this is that congress does not get an accurate estimate of existing conditions no matter who is in charge of the salary and allowance division no good results can be expected without the adoption of a system that will be fair to all and establish like conditions in cities of the same class the investigation disclosed the fact that many influences were constantly working on the salary and allowance division to acquire special favors for some individual or for some particular office the investigation actually produced evidence of the existence of a promotion syndicate operating in new york city and the vicinity for the purchase of promotions through a supposed washington connection fourth assistant postmastergeneral bristow in his report on the investigation rec mmendetl that congress enact some restraining legislation to apply to the division of salaries and allowances even should the division of salaries and allowances comply with the letter of the law as provided in the

extradition of fugitives from justice it is necessary that there maybe a proper administration of the criminal laws of the country but where life and liberty are involved and a condition of public excitement exists in a state such that the courts are unable to conduct fair and impartial trials it is the solemn and humane duty of a governor to refuse a requisition from that state until reason has resumned its sway and the excitement has abated that the discretion of the chief executive officer can not be controlled is a corollary of the old doctrine of states rights you can not compel the chief executive officer of a state to exercise a discretion this way or that without controlling or embarrassing the administration of state affairs that is democratic doctrine now governor durbin was elected to the high office he now occupies by a majority of nearly 80 000 of the voters of the state of indiana my recollection is that in the state platform in the campaign of 1900 the republicans of indiana indorse unqualifiedly the administration of governor mount including his refusal to surrender governor taylor to the kentucky authorities under the then existing circumstances governor durbin has the reputation in indiana and throughout this country of being not only a lawabiding but a vigilant lawenforcing governor as chief magistrate he has used the power at his command to arrest and disperse mob after mob in the state of indiana in my judgment he has done more in enforcing the criminal laws of the state and protecting life and property against violence and lawlessness than any other governor that has honored the position he occupies since the days of the great morton governor mount refused the first requisition and he was prompted in his action in some degree by the sincere belief that taylor had been lawfully elected governor of the state of kentucky that he had been ousted from the office by the highhanded and revolution ary proceedings of his political adversaries and that it would be a recognition of the validity of the contest to surrender the real governor of the state to the one who had unlawfully usurped his seat besides this before governor mount had had an opportunity to act upon the request of governor beckham claiming to be the chief executive of the state of kentucky governor beckham had arbitrarily refused to recognize a requisition issued by governor mount for a fugitive then in the state of kentucky a number of days before the request was made upon governor mount to surrender governor taylor to the kentucky authorities he made a requisition upon the governor of kentucky for the arrest and surrender of rudolph gossman a convict who was about to be released from the frankfort penitentiary and who was under indictment for a

treasury of the united states it seems to me there is a radical distinction between the proposition of opening and dedicating a street and the proposition of caring for that street after it has once been dedicated to public use i do not believe that it was the intention of the act of 1878 that the government of the united states should buy from the residents of the district of columbia their property for streets and then take care of the streets afterwards i remember one case where we passed a bill for the opening of s street where a property owner owning a large tract of property through

the government of the united states is to pay onehalf of this expense the cost of opening these streets will be very largely increased because of the fact that the payment for it is coming out of the

condemnation of the land taken for the street this does not include any part of the expense of grading or paving or improving onehalf of that does come out of the general treasury but i submit that

of a member of congress to look after the interests of his constituents in the departments as it is to come here and take part in the deliberations of this house is it the purpose of anybody to cut off these people from communicating with the departments through their members in congress if a constituent of yours has a claim or some business matter to attend to in one of the departments are you going to tell him to come to washington or hire an attorney to attend to this matter if you do you relieve members of congress of more than onehalf of their duties your correspondence is reduced threefourths these hundreds of trips made to the various departments during the year by each member of congress these hundreds of dollars paid for car fare cab hire and extra help could be dispensed with members working from ten to eighteen hours per day including sunday as most do would practically have nothing to do but attend committee meetings and sessions of congress and from five to twelve hours work is all that would be required i have made an estimate and believe that i have written more than 90 000 letters during my five years in congress threefourths of these letters have been pertaining to matters pending in the departments i have been in constant correspondence with nearly 1 100 soldiers in my district some of you probably have more applicants than i have my distinguished friend and colleague has stated the proposition clearly concisely and exactly to the point and unanswerably and more ably than i can in this language here is a custom grown up from the earliest days of the republic that makes the member of congress the means of communication in thousands and thousands of instances between the constituents interested and an executive department they have no other agent here to represeut them but ourselves they frequently believe that they are the objects or subjects of maladministratn or neglect they believe that they have rights that are not observed how natural it is under this custom to write to their representative and it is our pleasure to serve them they know they have a friend here in him who will take an interest in their welfare and their withheld rights how many thousands of times have your constituents written to you gentlemen that they have a claim before the pension bureaua claim tlat has been neglected sometimes they will tell you that for ten years that claim haslain there unattended to and urge upon you that time is flying fast with them that they are approaching the end and that if that claim is to have attention that will be beneficial to them it must be now and urge you in the name of humanity in the name of good comradeship in the name of old friendships and mutual kindnesses as their representative to see to it that something is done in their behalf how often does it occur to them that they have furnished the proof that is abundant for the allowance of their claim their agent is hundreds of miles from the capital they ave norepresentative here but you are you to be denied the right to the pension office to examine these proofs to say to the man thathas itin charge that perhaps has laid it awaythat there is proof ther that entitled theeaimant to the affirmative action of the government how often does it happen that you are called upon to call attention of the department to the fact that this statute is one that should have liberal construction rather than a narrow technical one that is often givendtoit the officer has a judgment to render and you urge him to do justice to your constituent if the statements contained in this report are a violation of duty if they indicate crime on your part is not this other what isthe difference the requests of our constituents are many very many requests for aid in securing action or favorable action on pending pension claims come to me in great numbers there are thousands of them every year there are reuests concerning 1rural free delivery additional clerk hire in postoffices additional rents for postoffices additional allowances for fuel and for lights for information or services concerning public lands indian claims patents claims for money for aid in procuring puhlic employment to aid in securing promotion for alimost all conceivable things indeed one constituent by letter asked me to submit for him a case in the supreme court of the united states are thes e t i more than a thousand every monthto be thrown in the wastebasket for my part i strive to render the service if i can and write the result to my correspondent in all instances i think that you could find but few persons in the eighth iowa district who would complain that their representative either neglected his correspondents or was neglectful of their requests as has been stated by the distinguished gentleman from iowa othey have no other agent here to represent them but ourselves and how natural it is for them to write to us and it is always a pleasure to serve them are you going to deprive the soldiers of this country of the aid a member can give them the process of securing a pension is slow enough uder the present rule an inquiry sent to the pension bureau by a member of congress is answered promptly the information is forwarded the claimant with your advice as to how to proceed all claimants are not familiar with the pension laws and i dare say that more confusion and delay is caused by confusing the evidence called for under the different laws thar in any other manner and in making these calls and writing the letters it is not for the purpose of exerting any influence it is to aid the claimants to properly present their claims and with a view that the case he adjudicated speedily and the bureau passes upon the claims upon their merits what is true in the pension bureau is true in every other bureau and department of this government if members named in this report are guilty of wrongdoing or violating any rule or law then every member who has called or written a letter to the pension bureau urging consideration of a soldiers claim regardiess of merit is equally guilty i have as all of you have many claimants who are impatient and justly so who think that their claims are not adjudicated as speedily as they might wish or expect but what would become of them if they were to resort to the slow process of correspondence or through an attorney here in washington if for instance a soldier writes the department his letter is answered in its regular order thousands of letters are received every day and my understanding is that often it takes months before a reply is received if he applies through an attorney here in washington this attorney has thousands of cases and they are allowed to call for the papers in a case certain days in a week and for a certain number of cases i believe they are limited to one day per week and not more than three cases in one day i believe wednesday is their day if an attorney has 3 000 cases it would take 1 000 wednesdays before the last case would be reached under the present system a member sends a call slip usually a day or two in advance the papers are made available for his personal inspection and a member or his secretary may examine the papers on file and the claimant is advised what is required to complete his case and how to proceed thus saving the department a vast amount of work and expense in examining these cases for the claimants not only are cases thus more speedily reached and passed upon but it is a large saving to the government in my humble efforts i have succeeded in having upward of 800 pensions allowed or increased many have been rejected i certainly claim no credit of securing the allowance of a single one of these claims through my influence they have been allowed by the department because the evidence has warranted allowance and if i deserve any credit it must be for doing my duty in advising and helping the claimant to complete his evidence which would enable the department to promptly dispose of the case during my five years in congress i have received 220 petitions for the establishment of rural free delivery and have written thousands of letters to the people in the district giving them what information i could on the subject i have written hundreds of letters and have made hundreds of calls to the department urging speedy and favoralble consideration and giving it such information as i could to aid it in properly and satisfactorily establishing the service by the 15th of next month we will have about 180 of these routes in operation serving approximately 18 000 families distributing 108 000 per annum to the 180 rural carriers under the present salary or 129 600 under the new salary proposed now is this 129 000 to be

only to bring out to this house and to the country the fact by the term deficit the average person understands that the government owes the amount of the deficit over and above the money in the treasury available to meet the current expenses of the government and in my opinion this average understanding of the term is the correct one but i am not concerned about the word but only the fact as a matter of fact no such deficit exists on the contrary there is now in the treasury of the united states after laying aside one hundred and fifty millions as a reserve fund to maintain the gold reserve as shown by the statement of the united states treasury on the 13th day of february 1905 which was the day before yesterday the very considerable sum of 141 885 831 32in round numbers one hundred and fortytwo millions but this does not include the sum of 56 482 048 37 set down in the treasurers statement for february 13 as a treasury liability under the designation of disbursing officers balances as to the treasury of the united states this is a liability but as to the government of the united states it is an asset being money on hand in the treasury and subject to or liable to the check of the disbursing officers of the government to meet the current obligations of the government the same thing i take it might be said of the item in the same statement under the hehd of postoffice department account then again under the head of receipts expenditures redemptions etc we find the sum of 24 683 404 52 as excess of expenditures over receipts for the current fiscal year this too has been in the treasury statement deducted from the available cash balance of nearly one hundred and fortytwo millions so that in estimating the probable excess of expenditures over receipts for the current and ensuing years we should either decrease the estimate of eighty or ninety millions made by the gentleman from maine by at least the sum of 24 683 404 52 plus 56 482 048 32 which would make 81 165 452 84 or we should increase the sum of 141 885 831 83 by 56 482 048 32 which would give the sum of 198 367 880 15 as the available cash balance now on hand to defray the running expenses of the government that is to say as the real and true surplus instead of a deficit now in the treasury of the united states over and above the one hundred and fifty millions of gold reserve i shall add to my speech as an appendix the treasury statement from which 1 have taken these figures and the estimate of the secretary of the treasury showing an estimated excess for 1906 of more than the socalled deficit for 1905 does this present any occasion for the delivery of jeremiads is there necessity for alarm can any adverse criticism of the state of the countrys finances or of the dingley tariff law as a revenue provider be based on this showing the treasury department of the united states now tells us and for years has told us that the sum of fifty millions as an available cash balance in the general fund is necessary as a safe working balance now a safe working balance is not a minimum but something which may be even encroached upon slightly and occasionally at least without danger otherwise it would not be either a safe balance or a working balance if it were so near the danger line that it would be unsafe to touch it or even approach it it would not be safe and if no part of it could ever be employed it would be mere courtesy that would denominate it a working balance it will probably not be claimed that administrative officers in stating to the appropriating powercongresshow much they need as a working basis considering the safety of the public service and their own convenience in its administration are likely not to put the amount high enough i think therefore we may justly conclude that the sum of fifty millions is just what it is represented to be a safe working balance it will not do to extend forever the factor of safety already made quite high enough by including therein the factor of administrative convenience and having laid it down that it will not do to have generally on hand a smaller working balance than fifty millions to go on and say that we must not approach within another twentyfive millions of the fifty millions there would never be any end to this sort of thing and our condition would never be deemed safe on the score of sufficiency of revenue until we had invaded another realm of adverse criticism more deadly still viz that where we could be justly charged with having piled up in the treasury a dangerous surplus gentlemen will remember this line of criticism of republican revenue laws it is easier to make than the other one by our iniquitous tariff laws we will be told for so we have been told before we are withdrawing the money of the people from the pockets of the people and from the legitimate channels of trade and commerce thus impoverishing the people and impairing the general credit discouraging new enterprises and investment in established ones and encouraging lavish appropriations of public money for unworthy and even improper purposes and leading to public corruption in high places the existence of a dangerous surplus in the treasury was the main issue of the campaign of 1888 when benjamin harrison was elected president his election was unexpected to many republicans because our party had been put on the defensive by this very issue in his letter of acceptance in 1888 mr cleveland said in these circumstances and in view of this necessary effect of the operation of our plan for raising revenue the absolute duty of limiting the rate of tariff charges to the necessities of a frugal and economical administration of the government seems to be perfectly plain the continuance upon a pretext of meeting public expenditures of such a scale of tariff taxation as draws from the substance of the people a sum largely in excess of public needs is surely something which under a government based upon justice and which finds its strength and usefulness in the faith and trust of the people ought not to be tolerated while the heaviest burdens incident to the necessities of the government are uncomplainingly borne light burdens become grievous and intolerable when not justified by such necessities unnecessary taxation is unjust taxation and yet this is our condition we are annually collecting at our customhouses and by means of our internalrevenue taxation many millions in excess of all legitimate public needs as a consequence there now remains in the national treasury a surplus of more than 130 000 000 no better evidence could be furnished that the people are exorbitantly taxed the extent of the superfluous burden indicated by this surplus will be better appreciated when it is suggested that such surplus alone represents taxation aggregating more than 108 000 in a county containing 50 000 inhabitants taxation has always been the feature of organized government which is the hardest to reconcile with the peoples ideas of freedom and happiness when presented in a direct form nothing will arouse popular discontent more quickly and profoundly than unjust and unnecessary taxation our farmers mechanics laborers and all our citizens closely scan the slightest increase in the taxes assessed upon their lands and other property and demand good reasons for such increase and yet they seem to be expected in some quarters to regard the unnecessary volume of insidious and indirect taxation visited upon them by our present rate of tariff duties
