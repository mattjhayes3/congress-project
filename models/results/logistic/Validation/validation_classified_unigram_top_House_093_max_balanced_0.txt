armand hammer and his deals with the soviets to see how incredible this offer was on april 12 of this year occidental petroleum corp signed the largest commercial agreement in the history of sovietamerican trade armand hammer is the chairman of occidental petroleum corp before the announcements of the recent deal occidental petroleum was enjoying less than an encouraging business reputation armand hammer was born may 21 1898 in new york city to julius and rose robinson hammer he graduated from columbia university in 1919 and received an m d degree from the college of physicians and surgeons columbia university in 1921 his father julius hammer was a longtime member of the socialist party in 1919 when the socialist party split and two communist parties were formed from the left wing factionthe communist party of america and the communist labor partyjulius hammer joined the communist labor party benjamin gitlow who served as a national communist party leader until 1929 identified julius hammer as a member of the new york city committee of the left wing of the socialist party which later formed the clp in january 1919 the soviet government appointed ludwig c a k martens as its official representative he opened an office in new york at 110 west 40th street according to gitlow the establishment of this soviet pseudoembassy was made possible by the generous financial assistance of julius hammer gitlow further stated that hammer was an adviser to martens after the formation of the communist labor party during the summer of 1919 gitlow reported the communist labor party first established its national headquarters in cleveland but soon afterwards moved to new york where its headquarters were established at 108 east 12th street in a house rented for us by dr julius hammer who not only paid the rent but later bought the house and turned it over to our party while this was going on armand hammer was a student at columbia university however he was closely involved with his fathers political and business activities julius hammer a physician had invested all of his savings in a small company that sold shampoos mouthwashes and pharmaceutical chemicals during armands sophomore year his father told him that the business was in such bad financial shape that unless something could be done to revive it armand would be compelled to leave school as a result armand and his older brother harry began working in the business armand continued to attend columbia while working in 1919 the firm invested money in antiseptics et cetera and when prices rose made a good deal of money on august 16 1919 the new york world reported that dr julius hammer was being held on 5 000 bail after being indicted for first degree manslaughter as a result of the death of a woman upon whom he was performing a criminal operationan abortion on june 24 1920 during the course of hammers trial the new york tribune and the new york world both reported that a juror on the case had reported to the judge that a man had offered him a 10 000 bribe for a favorable verdict in the hammer case the judge continued the case after hearing the juror joseph l maher state that a man had approached him and told him that he knew where there would be 1 000note not 10 000 as originally reportedwaiting for him if he would hold out and prevent an agreement on the jury in the case the juror later stated that it was his belief that the man who attempted to bribe him was interested in another case similar to dr hammers and believed that a favorable verdict in one would influence the other the new york tribune and new york sun of june 27 1920 reported the arrest of thomas sheehan in the bribery charge the tribune also reported a group of doctors coming to the defense of hammer julius hammer was convicted of manslaughter first degree and sentenced to state prison for 31 2 to 15 years after hammers conviction a number of doctors who purportedly had made statements defending hammer denied that the statements attributed to them were authentic district attorney martin of bronx county stated that he was investigating this matter the new york tribune of july 24 1920 reported that district attorney francis martin of bronx county sought to have william cope committed for contempt of court for refusing to answer questions of the grand jury cope a former newspaperman had refused to answer questions concerning his work as public relations man for julius hammer during the abortion trial among the questions he refused to answer were who paid you the 100 a day in the hammer case and who employed you as publicity man in the hammer case in the meanwhile leaders of the communist labor party including benjamin gitlow were arrested on criminal anarchy charges gitlow tells in his book i confess how he was released on bail after dr julius hammer supplied 10 000 worth of liberty bonds gitlow was eventually convicted and was sent to sing sing after a famous case that went up to the supreme court in his book gitlow describes the situation he found after being transferred back to sing sing at one point during his term in jail gitlow wrote back in sing sing life was more pleasant there we found dr julius hammer serving a sentence for an illegal abortion having been betrayed to the authorities by political enemies presumably dr hammer financed martens soviet bureau had joined the communist labor party and had generously helped to finance its activities in addition to hammer there were also isaac r ferguson and charles e ruthenberg who had both been sent to sing sing for five to ten years these three had arrived in sing sing while we were in dannemora but soon after our return a fourth communist newcomer came a russian comrade named paul manko the last communist prisoner to arrive in sing sing during our stay there manko an ordinary rank and file member of one of the russian branches was arrested for distributing leaflets indicted and convicted as a dangerous red leader and sent to sing sing he was obviously a psychopath and probably a paranoic he had delusions that there was a cosmic plot afoot to poison him and hence refused all food and drink the keepers treated him gently and with consideration we politicals delegated dr hammer who as a physician understood his mental condition better than any of us who moreover spoke russian to persuade manko that no one was plotting against him but that proved the most unfortunate choice we could have made for manko detested hammer as the alleged seducer of his wife that was apparently another of his phobias instead of listening to hammer he threatened to settle scores with him in russia as one bolshevik to another moreover the very next time his wife came to visit him he created a scene scolded her in voluble russian at the top of his voice and the poor woman left dumbfounded and in tears we were quite sure that she was perfectly innocent of her husbands charges and that manko having improvised the seduction charge against hammer to protect himself from the doctors intervention played the irate cuckold to the bitter end with the consistency of a maniac as late as 1929 gitlow collected communist party dues from julius hammer who was at that time in moscow in 1929 benjamin gitlow jay lovestone and hundreds of their followers were expelled from the communist party for not supporting the position taken by joseph stalin an examination of the first volume of the lovestoneite magazine revolutionary age november 1 1929 to march 15 193010 issueswhich listed hundreds of lovestoneites expelled from the cpusa did not list julius hammer among them had hammer been expelled from the party his name would undoubtedly have been listed because of his prominence in the movement in later years julius hammer turned up in some communist fronts in december 1944 he was listed as a member of the committee for the celebration of the 20th anniversary of the icor association this group which has been officially cited as a communist front by california and massachusetts state committees had the responsibility of raising funds for the soviet jewish autonomous republic of biro bidjan hammer was listed in the december 1944 issue of its official magazine nailebn which means new life in 1945 he appeared as a stockholder for the people radio foundation inc which was cited as a communist front by attorney general tom clark this group which was controlled by the international workers order had as its purpose the establishment of a procommunist fm radio station in new york city in february 1946 julius hammer was listed as a member of the national board of the american committee of jewish artists writers and scientists a communist front which has been officially cited by the california committee on february 25 1946 he also served as a sponsor of a testimonial dinner given by this organization for communist party member albert kahn julius hammer died in 1948 at age 74 according to the new york herald tribune of october 20 1948 his wife rose robinson hammer died in 1960 according to the new york times of february 18 1960 while his father was in prison armand hammer went to the soviet union he arrived there in 1921 although we know from the confidential financial report cited above that he was fairly wealthy he was definitely not a millionaire but appears to have indicated to the soviet authorities that he was boris reinstein an american communist brought armand hammer in contact with lenin on

from columbia in 1921 and 1922 he anxious to begin practicing medicine hamsecond mer decided that this ambition could wait a claimed year or so and volunteered for medical relief ncession work he was sent to russia the soviet was that he then still in its infancy and hammer quickly saw that the chief need of russia was good alist and food and plenty of it so at the age of 23 he performed the difficult task of persuading the gov the young government that it should allow st that i him to organize his own american export rained no company this device was a necessity because the country had no gold and it was imperative that russian materials be exchanged for food with other nations carrying out the duties of his company hammer obtained the russian agencies for ford motor unitedstates rubber and other leading companies products one of his export items was white oak staves used in the united kingdom for aging scotch and in germany for beer barrels the soviets were in fact not short of gold as lenin explained in an article in pravda november 67 1921 entitled the importance of gold now and after complete victory of socialism we must save the gold in the r s f s r russian soviet federated socialist republic sell it at the highest price buy goods with it at the lowest price when you live among wolves you must howl like a wolf while as for exterminating all the wolves as should be done in a rational human society we shall act up to the wise russian proverb boast not before but after the battle in late 1922 hammer was back in moscow a member of the american communist party charles recht writing in the communist party magazine soviet russia pictorial for march 1923 told of attending the celebration for the anniversary of the russian revolution november 1922 dr armand hammer and his brother victor hammer were with recht and other american communists on that date armands brother victor left a son in the soviet union the new york times of july 23 1956 reported that victor hammer had just returned from the soviet union after a reunion here with his soviet citizen son whom he had not seen for 30 years the times dispatch dateline moscow reported that victor hammers son was also named armand and that victor was a prominent art dealer in new york and operated the hammer galleries with his brother armand armand hammer has had two public relations type pieces in the new yorker magazine the first on december 23 1933 described his version of his life in russia and promoted the sale of the czarist crown jewels which hammer had brought back other promotion articles for the sale of the romanoff jewels appeared in most newspapers and magazines some samples are included here as exhibits 16 a b and c from the washington post february 13 1932 the new york post january 3 1933 and time magazine august 21 1933 a similar promotion piece was printed in the new york daily news on february 16 1941 when hammer was selling the hearst collection in cooperation with gimbels department store despite the public relations hoopla promoted by hammer on the value to american business of his soviet deals there is some indication that he had difficulties the new york times of august 18 1927 reported that his asbestos concession had suffered from competition with sovietowned deposits of superior quality and that hammer had gone into the pencil manufacturing business on november 22 1927 the new york times reported that dr julius hammer head of a hammer inc was in the united states seeking a halfamilliondollar loan for the pencil factory the chicago daily news of march 6 1929 reported that armand hammer had been attacked in the soviet press for attempting to share 4 000 of his millionandaquarterdollax turnover with employees of the pencil factory apparently profitsharing was not considered appropriate by the communists other financial information on armand hammer shows a number of interesting items in exchange for his efforts in behalf of the soviet union hammer received favors from the soviets including in 1925 a virtual monopoly on the manufacture of lead pencils from wood obtained in america through the medium of his allied american corp profits in 1 year amounted to more than 1 million hammers pencil manufacturing business was sold to the soviet union in 1930 hammer lived in russia for 10 years and allegedly had profited by some 9 million when he gave up his concessions after returning to the united states hammers activities included an interest in an original a hammer co inc in new york city which along with importing staves used in the manufacture of barrels and other russian goods acted as an investment house and had been known to operate in the stock market late in 1935 that company discontinued activity under the original name and for a while did business as hortense galleries he also had a number of other interests in this country to protect themselves against inflation armand and a younger brother victor had been investing part of their profits in art objects mainly jewelry silverware and other items that had once belonged to the russian royal family when the hammers left russia they took all this treasure with them some of this merchandise was disposed of through hammer galleries inc of new york city of which armand hammer was president in 1944 it appears hammer saw a new opportunity when he learned that the american distilling co was about to declare a dividend of one barrel of whisky per share he bought 5 000 shares on marginand to make his 5 000barrel dividend go further he mixed the whisky with alcohol made from potatoes purchased from government surpluses it was reported that the blend was sold to the wartime whiskyparched public and to other distillers to produce the alcohol he began buying distilleries in 1956 he sold the nine distilleries he had purchased for over 10 million also hammer bought a farm in red bank n j and began breeding aberdeen angus cattle the cattle business turned out to be a bonanza a giant champion bull named prince eric in 3 years sired 2 000 calves and earned 2 million for hammer in 1953 most of his cattle were auctioned off at a 3day sale that brought more than 1 million after taking over occidental petroleum in 1957 he headed a syndicate that bought the mutual radio network becoming president and chairman of the board he sold his interest in mutual in september 1958 to give his full attention to occidental petroleum in 1956 hammer had moved from new york to california where he swiftly spotted a new opportunity this was occidental petroleum which was a 33yearold petroleum producer whose shares had plunged to a value of 20 cents each a friend approached him and asked him to finance two wildcat wells in bakersfield calif for 120 000 dr hammer was told of the tax advantages in oil and he decided to take a chance both wells came in much to his surprise the management of occidental then asked him for 1 million to obtain 11 oil leases in los angeles and in 1957 asked him to be president of the company hammer received a major interest in the company and later merged it with gene read drilling inc in 1963 occidental expanded into fertilizers and has since added chemicals coal plastic and other products the companys activities are worldwide with activities extending into such areas as canada alaska libya mexico belgium venezuela ghana and peru recently hooker chemical corp a leading chemical company became a whollyowned subsidiary of occidental petroleum corp through an exchange of occidental securities with a market value of 800 million the only incident of hammer publicly taking a political position at variance with a soviet position was in 1940 when he advocated the lendlease program where american destroyers were exchanged for british bases this was during the sovietnazi pact when the soviets were opposed to our giving britain any military aid the washington news of november 29 1940 reported a meeting between armand hammer and president roosevelt at which time hammer promoted the lendlease deal hammer has frequently been accused of at least shady if not illegal activities the new york times of october 12 1968 reported that the late hale boggs of louisiana had accused three executives of the occidental petroleum corp of attempting to bribe him hammer answered that the charges were false and outrageous the los angeles times of april 18 1968 reports a 50 million lawsuit against hammer by an occidental petroleum shareholder which charged him with various violations of federal securities laws the los angeles times of march 6 1971 reported that occidental petroleum had announced that a new york federal district court has formally entered a consent decree permanently enjoining the company and its board chairman armand hammer from violation of federal antifraud regulations hammer and occidental consented to the injunction but denied any wrong doings or rule violations in the past the wall street journal of november 27 1967 carried a lengthy report accusing hammer and occidental petroleum of fraudulent publicity in promoting the companys stock the newspaper stated the critics make these charges quarterly earnings reports sometimes have made it appear the companys operating income was rising faster than was actually the case a blizzard of press releases has excitedly reported the same goods news items twice or more on some occasions notsofavorable items havent always been disclosed as fully or as promptly some public statements havent been entirely accurate the wall street journal report indicated a number of instances where hammer had manipulated publicity on his own behalf an insight into hammers personal finances was provided by his 1941 to 1952 income tax return which he submitted to the court in connection with his 1956 divorce during this period of time he was certainly worth millions of dollars and admitted in court on may 5 1954 a net worth of 2 million however in 1949 he showed a total income of 25 000 from united distillers of america inc a corporation owned by him in 1950 his income from the same source was again 25 000 in 1951 he showed an income from united distillers of america of 25 000 but also showed 1 038 in dividends and interest and 80 in wages from the first bank and trust co of perth amboy n j in 1952

from hammer said that the meeting was arranged by mutual acquaintance soviet deputy premier anastas mikoyan according to hammer he gave khrushchev good advice about how to improve the soviet image in the united states and promote trade on december 1 1962 the new yorker magazine carried an interview with hammer in which he promoted his close association with soviet officials and he boasted that khrushchev had mentioned him in a speech some months before the soviet propaganda magazine soviet life for april 1965 published a friendly interview with hammer that he had given to a soviet correspondent at a 5day conference in moscow of businessmen held november 1964 armand hammers whole life has been one of wheeling and dealing and using every opportunity to make a profit he has certainly utilized his close relationship with the soviets that dates back to his early communist connections in the 1920s armand hammers soviet concessions were very fortunate to receive meaningful compensation while other concessions were expropriated the hammer debts internal and external were paid by the soviet government adding to the uniqueness of the hammer involvement with the soviet union was the soviets allowing armand hammer to export profits out of that country in 1926 the following remark was made by a soviet spokesman on the topic of foreign concessions in the soviet union on the one hand we admit capitalst elements we condescend to collaborate with them on the other hand our objective is to eliminate completely to conquer them to squash them economically as well as socially it is a furious battle in which blood may necessarily be spilled once again many american businessmen see possibilities for great profits coming from trade with the soviets is there any proof that the situation will be different now than in the 1920s and 1930s then a very few like armand hammer who seemed to have a special relationship with communist leaders profited while others were expropriated all served communist interests in building up the soviet industrial base the soviet dependence on western technology is a subject that needs more exposure"], [0.901984728872776,

certain provisions of the federal law relating to explosives the senatepassed bill is identical to h r 14549 introduced by the ranking member of our subcommittee the gentleman from maine and identical to h r 14018 which i sponsored as the chairman of the subcommittee on crime has stated the purpose of this legislation is to exempt commercially manufactured black powder and certain igniters intended to be used solely for sporting recreational or cultural purposes in antique or replica firearms from the regulatory provisions on explosives contained in title xi of the organized crime control act of 1970 as codified in title 18 chapter 40 our subcommittee considered in detail as did the senate the question of public safety which resulted in the inclusion of the 50pound limitation it is my intention to discuss the present uses of black powder and why the present law must be amended this bill is needed to change the present onerous restrictions on legitimate sportsmen it is urgently needed as our nation approaches its bicentennial in 1970 with the passage of the organized crime control act containing restrictions on the manufacture transportation storage possession and use of black powder the activities of sportsmen who rely on commercially manufactured black powder were severely restricted these sportsmen engage in the use of antique firearms and replicas of antique rifles and cannons in a variety of sporting cultural and recreational events muzzleloading rifles are used in target shooting meets throughout the country at such meets the participants dress in costumes of the colonial and civil war periods and engage in both individual and team shooting competitions with such rifles antique weapons and cannons are used by a variety of civic groups in such ceremonies as flag raising centennial celebrations fourth of july celebrations and even performances of classical music such as tchaikovskys 1812 overture the record compiled by the subcommittee on crime indicates that there are as many as 100 000 sportsmen throughout the country who use black powder in such events indeed it was estimated that there may be close to 200 000 users when persons who do not belong to organized groups are counted these sporting enthusiasts are lawabiding citizens most sportsmen who use black powder are well aware of its dangers and are experienced in its use as the testimony before the subcommittee indicated and from the written statements received by the subcommittee there have been no known accidental explosions of black powder possessed by sportsmen groups the restrictions on black powder in current law have created serious hardship for the sporting user it must be noted that sportsmen can use only commercially manufactured black powder which is of sufficiently high quality and uniformity to allow safe operation of antique weapons purchases of sufficient quantities of black powder for target competitions or other cultural events cannot be made without great inconvenience and substantial expense because of the factors of time distance frequency of use and the limit on black powder available for purchase since the passage of the organized crime control act the sources all but vanished for the sportsmen until 1970 most users of the substance were dependent on an informal system of distribution by gun shops and hardware stores cooperatives and other courtesy suppliers who ordered and stocked limited amounts of the propellant as a service rather than for profit because of the permit limitations and fees and the cost of constructing elaborate magazines for limited storage most courtesy suppliers of this substance have stopped handling black powder this in turn has caused the price to increase significantly these inconveniences have had an unnecessarily restrictive effect on lawful activities of sportsmen unless remedied the restrictions would have a serious impact on the historical reenactments pageants and shooting matches to be held in conjunction with the forthcoming celebration of the 200th anniversary of the american revolution as one witness before our subcomimttee stated this situation is indeed ironic the united states won its independence through the use of blackpowder firearms but presently the law of the united states effectively prohibits the recognition and celebration of that use considerations of safety compelled the subcommittee and the full committee to limit the amount of black powder to be available to 50 pounds thus we have reached a reasonable accommodation of both the lawful activities of the sporting users and the needs of safety i urge my colleagues to support this bill the enforcement issue concerned our subcomimttee treasury regulations have been promulgated under the authority of the existing law this bill is only a limited modification of current law and does not unduly disturb the enforcement powers of the treasury department it is our expectation that the department will promulgate regulations and establish forms requiring sporting users to identify themselves when purchasing black powder and to certify their intent to use the substance only for

us this year h r 9142 the northeast rail transportation bill i say important because failure to pass this legislation today will result in untold hardship for the 100 million people living in the northeast and would have brutal repercussions for the entire economy the economy of the northeast as well as the nation as a whole is intricately tied to the continued operation and reorganization of the six bankrupt railroads of the northeast in question today the northeast railroads handle approximately 45 5 million tons of originating and terminating freight each year about 70 percent of this amount is carried by two major bankrupt railroads the boston maine and the penn central the boston maine has somewhere between 2 675 and 3 000 active shippers and the penn central is believed to handle somewhat beyond this amount for a total of at least 6 000 shippers thousands of shippers in the northeast are dependent on these railroads once it is realized the great dependence that ex ists on the northeast railroads in the 17state northeast region the impact of a shutdown becomes clearer approximately threefourths of all lumber and wood products are transported by rail large amounts of agricultural commodities and vast quantities of fuel for the entire regior are carried by rail what does this mean for the northeast higher housing costs higher food costs fuel shortages in an area already fraught with critically short fuel supplies a 1969 department of transportation survey showed that railroads carried 3 8 million tons of freight per day in the northeast including such vital products as coal iron ore heavy machinery automobiles and parts wood pulp and building materials it is expected that just a shutdown of the penn central alone would affect the entire national rail system glut the highways and push waterways and air carriers beyond their capabilities in fact the northeast rail crisis is not a regional problem but goes well beyond affecting the entire economy senator hartke in his statement in the congressional record of june 25 points outif one of the bankrupt railroads in the northeast ceased operations the consequences could be disastrous to the more than 100 million people living in the region and the nation as a whole for example a study has disclosed that if the penn central were to curtail activity for a period of 8 weeks economical activity in the northeast would decline at a rate of 5 7 economic activity in the entire nation would decline by a rate of 4 and the gross national product would decline by 2 7 percent in more human terms thousands would be thrown out of jobs widespread food shortages would occur and the health and safety of over 10 million threatened and what about the farmer down south who ships his products north certain economic disaster would follow if he suddenly found that his market had disappeared it is incumbent upon the government to maintain an active role in providing adequate rail service and i think the shoupadams bill offers this opportunity in a highly sensible and constructive manner the bill in short mandates consolidation of the bankrupt railroads maintains government expenditures at a minimum and vests control of the new system in a private corporation the northeast and the nation is heavily dependent on continued rail service in the northeast it is urgent that the house act at once on legislation that will keep the railroads going i think that the shoupadams bill h r 9142 represents a comprehensive and balanced approach to the northeast rail crisis and we in this body should waste no more time in passing this urgent legislation i think it is important to mention at this time provisions in the bill pertaining to the northeast passenger corridor the passenger corridor basically comprises the metroliner route from washington to new york and the turbotrain linkbetween new york and boston the improved passenger service is needed for several reasons passenger travel along the corridor is forecast to increase by a minimum of 3 percent per year air routes as well as highways are reaching saturation point along the corridor and expected outlays for these two transportation modes far surpass the estimated cost of a highspeed passenger rail project it is my firm conviction that action by this congress to improve the northeast passenger corridor will prove beneficial in terms of cost safety energy consumption noise and pollution control and in view of our present energy crisis we can hardly afford to do otherwise in conclusion i feel we owe a special debt of gratitude to the two members of this body who have done the most to fashion this excellent legislation and guide it through congress representatives brock adams and dick shoup they have given unstintingly of themselves over the months both in terms of time and a great deal of expertise in this area and we particularly in the northeast are very grateful for their efforts"],
