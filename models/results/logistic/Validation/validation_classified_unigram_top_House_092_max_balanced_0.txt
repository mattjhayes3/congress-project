its director j edgar hoover it has been my feeling for some time that perhaps some rational legislative approach might be appropriate for this situation i am therefore introducing today a measure which in essence would retain the power to appoint an fbi director with the presidentwith the advice and consent of the senatelimit the duration of any such appointees tenure to no more than 10 years and call for mandatory retirement at 65 years of age the president could appoint no one as fbi director who had served 10 years in the position or who had attained the age of 65 further the president would have the power to remove a director at any time it is my belief that individuals who serve the public in highlevel positions should be accountable and responsive to the judgment of the people either directlythrough the elective processor indirectlythrough powers vested in elected officials at various levels in addition those who hold sensitive appointments to positions of great stress and responsibility should be limited in terms of age these beliefs have prompted me to introduce this legislation no responsible individual can fail to acknowledge the herculean task which j edgar hoover has accomplished in building todays federal bureau of investigation prior to his appointment the only federal investigative agency existing in this country consisted of a poorly trained relatively undisciplined and loosely organized group of political appointees begun in 1908 under theodore roosevelt and known as the bureau of investigation this agency had very little professionalism and virtually no facilities when he became director of the bureau in 1924 j edgar hoover promptly got permission to reorganize it from the ground up tough new standards and a model training program soon followed along with steady improvements and additions to the bureaus equipment and facilities today the fbi is a model agency without equal in the precise and scientific world of law enforcement i think we in this country know that we owe the director a great deal of respect and appreciation nevertheless any objective analysis of the powers and prerogatives of a modernday fbi director indicates i think that it is a difficult and sensitive job which should not be held more than 10 years or by a man who is 65 or more years old a basic tradition in this countryindeed one of our founders preceptsis the prohibition against any public servant amassing dynastic or dictatorial powers a president was once elected to four terms now we have the 22d amendment every member of this body must lay it on the line every 2 years regardless of qualifications attitudes age popularity or whatever the voters have their say the president if he chooses to seek reelection must face the same test and his tenure is limited to 8 years no senator can escape the voters judgment for more than 6 years most government appointees are also subject to term limits or at the least being critically reviewed periodically i believe all of these limits are proper and well intended it does not seem proper to me however that an individual backed up by as much power as the fbi possesses and having such broad authority should become a sacred institution at age 76 after 47 years of service no one is indispensable the record would certainly suggest that back in 1924 president coolidge showed good judgment in selecting j edgar hoover as fbi director i regret that i cannot say the same regarding the judgments of our more recent presidents who have followed one another in perpetuating a term of service which i frankly think has gone on too long i therefore believe the limits my bill would impose are in the best interests of our nations future as well as the interests of future directors of the fbi the character and professionalism of fbi personnel would certainly seem to be very high i am sure mr hoover has seen to it that there is no dearth of qualified candidates to succeed him now and in the future with so many controversial statements and charges being presently made about the bureau it appears essential to me that any director should be free of personality cultism or ideological identification modern professionalism and an objective approach to duty should stand as the major factors in an fbi directors selection and subsequent performance i do not think it inappropriate or disrespectful to the present director for me to call for legislation aimed at accomplishing the goals i have set forthfor the fbis competence and high standards are in fact consequences of his original policies to j edgar hoover we owe a great deal including legislative safeguards to assure that future directors will serve with professionalism and within reasonable limits properly restrained by and responsive to the citizens of this country"], [0.8842360973358154, 0.8842360973358154, 0, "for 15 minutes tuesday june 15"], [0.8743121325969696, 0.1256878674030304, 1, "i rise in

years to change it without giving them an opportunity to be heard is not a good example of the legislative process we originally got into this situation because we were trying to prevent windfall
