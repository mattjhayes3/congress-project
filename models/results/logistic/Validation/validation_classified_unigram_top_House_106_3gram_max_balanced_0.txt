tax code a married working couple where both the husband and wife are both in the workforce a married working couple with a twoincome household pay higher taxes under our tax code than an identical couple with identical income who choose to live together outside of marriage is it right is it fair is it fair that under our tax code that 25 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married of course not the goal of this legislation i am proud to say is to wipe out the marriage tax penalty almost entirely for 25 million married working couples i think it is pretty fiscally responsible to take onehalf of 1 percent of a 2 2 trillion surplus to eliminate the marriage tax penalty to listen to my friends on the other side of the aisle you think we would be breaking their piggy bank to take onehalf of 1 percent of a 2 2 trillion surplus to help 25 million married working couples who pay higher taxes jut because they are married i for one and i am pleased to say that 222 republicans and we were joined by 48 democrats who broke with their leadership who believe it is time to eliminate the narriage tax penalty that this house has voted to send to the senate today we are voting on theagreement between the house and the senate we hope the president will join with us to eliminate the marriage tax penalty let me introduce a couple of constituents from the south suburbs of chicago which i represent shad and michelle hallihan they are public school teachers shad is at joliet high school and michelle is at manhattan junior high school their combined incomes are about 62 000 they pay just around 1 000 in marriage tax penalty just because they are married under our tax code now this photo was taken when they were married it was about the time we introduced our legislation about 2 years ago since then shad and michelle have had a little boy little ben and little ben of course is this little guy we hope some day he does not have to pay the marriage tax penalty our hope is for his parents we can eliminate it this year i would point out under this legislation we provide middleclass tax relief for middleclass couples like shad and michelle hallihan this year because our legislation is effective january 1 of 2000 so if the president would join with us to eliminate the marriage tax penalty for 25 million married working couples shad and michelle hallihan would see their marriage tax penalty eliminated this year now under our legislation we do several things we double the standard deduction for those who do not itemize to 8 800 twice that for single filers we also widen the 15 percent bracket to help those who do itemize shad and michelle hallihan are also homeowners and because they are homeowners they itemize their taxes and the only way to help people middleclass families who own a home or give to church or charity or their synagogue is to widen the 15 percent bracket so that they too can receive marriage tax relief under our proposal we eliminate the marriage tax penalty suffered by shad and michelle hallihan think about it in joliet illinois the marriage tax penalty of 1 400 the average marriage tax penalty is one years tuition at our local community college it is 3 months of day care for little ben at a local child care center in joliet it is 3 000 diapers for little ben but it is also if we also think about it if shad and michelle had that money that they currently pay in the marriage tax penalty were able to set it aside in an education savings account for little ben by the time ben is 18 they would have been able to set aside almost 20 000 that they currently send to uncle sam they could put in little bens college fund that is what marriage tax relief means for the hallihans now we have heard a lot of excuses from our good friends on the other side let us do just a little bit so we can say we have done something we have other priorities we want to spend it on but think about this one half of 1 percent of a 2 2 trillion surplus is being given back to middleclass working married couples like shad and michelle hallihan so they can take that marriage tax penalty that currently goes to washington gets spent on other things and use it to take care of their families needs little ben in particular so let us do the fiscally responsible thing let us help middleclass workingmarried couples who suffer the marriage tax penalty there are 25 million of them that is almost 50 million taxpayers who pay higher taxes just because they made the choice of getting married my hope is the president will join with us and sign this legislation the president joined with us when he changed his mind on irs reform he was opposed to it decided to support it he was opposed to balancing the budget now he takes credit for it he was opposed to welfare reform now he takes credit for it my hope is the president will join with us and sign the elimination of the marriage tax penalty the legislation we are going to hopefully pass today we will certainly share the credit with him because it is the right thing to do so again i urge a yes vote i invite every

congress i am pleased that the presidential and executive financial accountability act is before us today the other body was unable to take up this important legislation in the last congress this legislation brings the agencies of the executive office of the president under the requirements of the chief financial officers or cfo act the cfo act was inspired by the realization that billions of dollars was lost through waste fraud and abuse in the federal government each year as chairman of the results caucus a bipartisan team of members focused on ridding our federal government of its major management problems i have seen report after report which has focused on insufficient and inefficient financial management systems that fail to produce consistent and reliable data in fact the general accounting office in a report issued in january of this year gave details about the department of defenses accounting system it reported that over 9 billion in known military operating materials and supplies were not reported that same defense department did not have reliable information on important items of inventory including the number and location of military equipment items such as f4 engines and service craft the cfo act was designed to improve financial management and to coordinate internal controls and financial accounting chief financial officers oversee all financial management activities in their agencies and report directly to the head of an agency on financial matters it certainly is clear that such practices are needed in the white house this legislation fixes a4 oversight in the original cfo act unfortunately the original act never applied to the executive office of the president h r 437 the presidential and executive office accountability act of 1999 will do so in a way that recognizes that unique circumstances of that office exist it will establish a chief financial officer in the executive offices of the president and will review and audit the white houses financial systems and its records the cfo duties are to comply with those requirements set forth in the cfo act but is limited by discretion of the president when the annual fiscal report on the federal government was recently released the government accounting office told us that significant financial system weaknesses problems with fundamental record keeping incomplete documentation and weak internal controls including computer reports prevent thb government from accurately reporting a large portion of its assets liabilities and costs in other words this administration cannot tell you how much money it receives how much money it spends and what it spends its money on what property it owns where that property goes or how much that property is worth there is no evidence that the executive offices at the white house are any different from those reports that have been issued already passage of this bill is another signal to the taxpayers that we will ferret out waste fraud and abuse wherever it is found once again the white house is not immune to this and thus is no different than any other agency mismanagement is found throughout the executive branch also investigation after investigation has turned over evidence of waste fraud and abuse the white house travel office the white house communications agency the fbi files matter are all evidence that the white house

employing nearly 24 million people that is more than all of the fortune 500 companies combined where do we do business everywhere today women own businesses in all sectors of the economy not just in the service sector or the socalled traditional womenowned business areas in fact the top growth industries for womenowned businesses in recent years has been in construction wholesale trade transportation communications agribusiness and manufacturing what is it that motivates women to start their own businesses the national foundation for women business owners surveyed women across the country and found that nearly half stated one of two reasons a great idea for a product or service or the realization that they could do for themselves what they had previously done for an employer frustrations with the corporate environment including feeling unchallenged and experiencing a glass ceiling were also cited as motivation for women to become entrepreneurs the foundation also asked women why they stay in business not surprisingly the greatest reward of business ownership for women is gaining control over their own fate and the greatest challenge of business ownership for women

debate about that in the days ahead my expectation is that there will be a tie vote when another vote occursand it will happen again we fully intend it to happen again fortunately we will have a vice president to break that tie the patients bill of rights issue is very important let me mention a couple of other issues and then i will conclude we also have a responsibility to deal with the farm crisis and we have not done so very well we have a farm bill that doesnt work the freedom to farm bill does not work it has been a failure since it was enacted in 1996 the promise was produce what you want we will sell it overseas and get rid of the farm program and things will be better off since that time prices have collapsed and family farmers have had an awful time trying to make ends meet in most cases they are receiving far less now in real terms than they received during the great depression for their product these are not people who are slothful these are not people who arent being productive they are economic allstars they produce in prodigious quantity the food the world needs so desperately yet the market says by the way your food has no value while people climb trees to pick leaves to eat in countries around the world where there is not enough food family farmers driving a 2ton truck to a country elevator are told by the grain trader your food has no value something is wrong with that what really has no value is the current farm program it doesnt work it is long past time to fix it we are within three or four votes of doing that i encourage help from the other side to give us the votes needed to pass a farm program that provides real assistance for family farmers while we are on the subject of freedom those who wrote the freedom to farm billi didnt and i voted against itshould understand there is something called the freedom to sell the freedom to sell means if you want to give family farmers the freedom to produce whatever lets also give them the freedom to sell their products in markets such as iran iraq cuba north korea and others that have been off limits to them because this country has imposed economic sanctions against countries whose behavior we dont like i am fine with economic sanctions slap them with sanctions but dont ever include food as a part of those sanctions using food as a weapon is unbecoming to this country a country as big and as good and as powerful and as important as this country ought never use food as a weapon the freedom to sell is a pretty important principle whichwe ought to care a bit about there is an

the education system in our country we have the opportunity to do that it is just that we have all of this bickering back and forth we have things that we know need to be done everybody here understands that if you are in a classroom of 15 people there is more learning going on than if there is a classroom with 1 teacher and 30 kids class size matters we have proposals to reduce class size which will dramatically improve education we also understand you cannot learn in schools that are in functional disrepair no wonder there is disrepair in the schools they were built 50 or 60 years ago after world war ii when we had soldiers coming back having families and building schools for their children all across the country many of these schools are still in use today and are in desperate need of repair and remodeling if anyone doubts that take a trip to the ojibwa school on the turtle mountain indian reservation or the cannon ball elementary school south of bismarck nd take a look at those schools and ask yourself whether those schools need help the third grader who walks through the classroom door in the cannon ball school ought to be able to expect the same opportunity for a good education as all kids in this country yet these children dont have the same opportunity we know that yet legislation to improve and modernize our schools languish in this senate because

is the house majority leader dick armey what my friend from north dakota has said is right the majority has never felt good about medicare as my friend has said in 1965 when medicare came into being there really wasnt a need for prescription drugs because prescription drugs were in their infancy and it didnt matter the vast majority of the time whether someone was going to live or die be comfortable or not now how can we the only superpower in the world a nation that is leading the world in research and medical products how can we have a medicare program a program for health care for senior citizens that does not include the prescription drug benefit we cant do that i also say to my friend the reason we are here is this morning a senator came over and gave this presentation and said what my friend from north dakota said sure we want to do something about medicare but i have gotten letters from my constituents saying im against the big government plan this is exactly what we hear on the radio advertisements and the television advertisements that are paid for by the health care industry they want the american people to think that the program the democrats are propounding is a big government plan there could be nothing further from the truth what does this have to do with big government a woman by the name of gail rattigah from henderson nv writes i am a registered nurse who recently cared for an 82yearold woman who tried to commit suicide because she couldnt afford the medications her doctor told her were necessary to prevent a stroke it would be much more cost effective for the government to pay for medications that prevent more serious illnesses and expensive hospitalizations these include but are not limited to blood pressure medications antistroke anticoagulants and cholesterol medications the governments current policy of paying for medications only in the hospital is backward get into health promotion and disease promotion and save money this is a registered nurse from henderson nv i want everyone on the majority side to know they are not going to be able to come over and make these statements as if there is no opposition to it what my friend from tennessee says is wrong he states he has gotten all of these letters saying i am against the big government plan that is because of the radio and tv advertisements from the powerful health insurance industry but the real people are like the 82yearold woman who wanted to commit suicide because she couldnt get medication also i want to spread across this record that my friend from tennessee who came and said we need the republican plan makes the statement that he wants to involve senator breaux in this the majority cant have it both ways they either support the bush plan the plan of the person running for the president of the united states on the republican ticket or they dont support the nominee it appears what my friend from tennessee is doing is trying to have it both ways because the senator from louisiana does not support governor bushs plan the majority realizes that their medicare plan simply can not work because of their nominees 1 6 trillion tax cut proposal senator breaux pointed this out quite clearly today my point is i say to my friend from north dakota people who come here and make statements on the floor need to have substantiation i say the senator from louisiana does not support the bush medicare plan i also say the majority has introduced a proposalso we understand it but it is a medicare prescription drug benefit in name only a new york times writer states all indications are that this plan is a nonstarter insurance companies themselves are very skeptical there havent been many cases in which an industrys own lobbyists tell congress that they dont want a subsidy but this is one of them i take just another minute or two of my friends time the gop plan subsidizes insurance companies not medicare beneficiaries health insurance companies continue to say the republican plan is unworkable the majority tries to give this to the insurance industry but the insurance industry doesnt want it because it wont work charles kahn president of the health insurance association of america has stated we continue to believe the concept of the socalled drugonly private insurance simply would not work in practice i dont know of an insurance company

2 we know there has to be something done with medicare to help senior citizens of this country be able to afford prescription drugs that is all we are saying and we want everyone to know the program put forth by the minority is a program that helps senior citizens it is not something that is means tested but a program that helps all senior citizens not people who make less than 12 000 a year it

and family and country we need more organizations like the boy scouts and we should be doing everything we can to support and encourage them i was a criminal court judge for 71 2 years before coming to congress i was told on my first day as a judge that 98 percent of the defendants in felony cases came from broken homes i read thousands of reports going into the backgrounds of the people before me i read over and over things like defendants father left home when defendant was two and never returned defendants father left home to get pack of cigarettes and never came back several years later i read in the washington paper that two leading criminologists had studied 11 000 felony cases from around the country they said the biggest single factor in serious felony crimes was father absent households everything else like drugs and alcohol was secondary to the absent father problem so many young boys are growing up today without good male role models we need the boy scouts today more than ever before this is a time when we should be doing more for the boy scouts not trying to harass and intimidate them we definitely should not be taking the intolerant bigoted politicallycorrect position of this legislation if this is still a free country then the boy scouts should be free to operate as it has without being discriminated against as this legislation would do i urge all my

my gratitude for yielding me the time i am pleased to support this very appropriate rule for consideration of s 1059 the fiscal year 2000 dod authorization conference report a major piece of legislation for this congress i particularly want to commend the gentleman from south carolina and the gentleman from missouri for their diligent bipartisan very thorough work to make sure that we significantly improve the support given to our men and women in uniform they are the ones doing the hard work they are the ones in harms way they are the ones taking the risk that deserves to be supported to the fullest extent possible i am grateful for the continued close working relationship that these gentlemen have had with the permanent select committee on intelligence in ensuring that our fighting forces have access to the best the most timely and the most accurate intelligence that we can get eyes ears brains are actually very crucial to our national security this legislation reflects our commitment to those capabilities force protection force enhancement force projection these are the results these are the needs and these are what we are getting americans most recently have watched our troops in action in kosovo you might have the impression from what i would call photoop tv that kosovo is some kind of a big win unfortunately the view emerging from the ground in kosovo is not quite so rosy further the administration is pursuing policies that could ultimately endanger the chances for a longterm peace and stability in that region in my view and the view of others official unitedstates policy toward kosovo is in fact built upon three very uncertain principles one kosovo should remain an ethnically diverse province two kosovo should not become independent and three the kosovo liberation army the kla should give up its arms and disband these principles face serious challenges in the field on the ground unitedstates policy refuses to recognize even the possibility that the kosovars will eventually vote to declare independence from yugoslavia that is a possibility that should not be discounted similarly the administration is naively assuming that the kla will simply roll over and disband in my view the unitedstates has no end game strategy for the sake of the americans and our allies on the ground in kosovo i urge the administration to rethink our situation there and base decisions on fact not on wishful thinking as a member of the cox committee i ant satigfied with tha pro vision in this legislation establishing a semiautonomous agency to run the weapons program at the department of energy under the secretarys leadership critics have suggested that this change could cause the sky to fall with respect to public health safety and environmental matters to the contrary i say the cox report demonstrates that the sky has already fallen and our national security has been placed at great risk as a result given the deeply troubling circumstances surrounding reports of espionage at our national labs i believe it is very proper for congress to move expeditiously in enacting new safeguards i am very pleased that the conference report also includes a provision based on an amendment i offered with the gentleman from new york requiring an end to the permanent presence of unitedstates troops in haiti as our defense leaders have made clear the clinton administrations insistence on maintaining a permanent troop presence in haiti has strained an already overburdened military has unnecessarily put our troops at risk there and has focused on humanitarian projects more appropriately undertaken by nongovernmental organizations who are ready willing and able to do the job in the face of our efforts to force a withdrawal by years end the clinton administration has finally announced an end to the permanent presence of unitedstates troops in haiti to be replaced with periodic deployments as needed as is customary everywhere else in the western hemisphere this action does not i repeat does not signal an end to unitedstates military involvement or to unitedstates support for the democratic process in haiti but rather it is a more realistic policy to provide the help haiti so desperately needs as our neighbor in the caribbean lastly members should note that this legislation contains a significant increase in counterdrug funding for dod once again congress has taken the lead to win the war on drugs filling the vacuum left by a justsaymaybe message from the clinton administration and we are getting results

who have been under as much risk as anyone in the world with chinas behavior strongly support the adoption of this bill and view it as a very important step towards achieving a more peaceful resolution of their differences over the next decade i think it is fair to say that there is no question that the concessions the united states has extracted to further access to china are very very strong in florida my home state there will be significant reductions in tariffs on orange juice grapefruit concentrate and fertilizer and the fertilizer industry will begin to privatize over time in china who will benefit under this agreement in 1997 82 percent of the exporters to china were small and mediumsized businesses in my state florida in 1997 52 percent of the exporters to china were small businesses businesses with 100 employees or less we are bringing china into the rule of law one of the things that separates those that oppose this bill from those that support it is how quickly

discriminate against anyone we are doing quite the opposite we are proposing that we create a formula have a period of time here to create a formula that is fair to every veteran in every state of the union that is what this amendment is about i am shocked and appalled that we are under vera presently discriminating against those veterans who served their country nobly and discriminating against them based on which state they live in we have got to end this travesty and we have got to do it today with this amendment now my colleagues have heard some of the numbers here but speaking again for new york and new jersey but also for 22 other states that are dramatically cut do my colleagues hear that it is not normally new york and new jersey there are 22 other states dramatically cut under this vera formula but in terms of new york and new jersey we have the biggest cut we are reduced 40 million not only did we not gain a penny out of the 1 7 billion but we were cut 40 million okay now how does that get evaluated how fair is that how equitable can it possibly be new jersey has one of the oldest veterans populations and if not the highest one of the highest of the special needs veterans i do not understand how anybody can support this kind of discrimination for our region of the country now we have a lot of other things that we could say here but let me in the interests of time draw another conclusion here the bottom line is that vera is unacceptable we must use this time period to correct it and this amendment permits that correction and might i say and i do not know that anyone has referenced this but i will include this in my statement in the record as an insert here that even the gao congressionally mandated study of august 1998 indicated in at least three areas if not more that there were oversights in funding to northeast veterans and they have indicated areas where vera did not allocate resources necessarily properly and i want that to be included here so let me say as firmly as possible we cannot discriminate against these wonderful men and women who have served their country we have got to correct that inequity and correct that discrimination

abortion and forced sterilization for both chinese men and women women all over china are victimized daily due to their desire to bear children let me share with members a few of the methods used in chinas socalled family planning policy that are a matter of record arresting pregnant women and taking them to abortion clinics tied up or in handcuffs incarcerating pregnant women in barracks until they acquiesce to abortions and or sterilizations forcing pregnant women to attend study sessions away from their families until they agree to have abortions carrying out sterilization or abortion without the consent or knowledge of the women while rendering other medical services crushing the skulls of babies with forceps during delivery or injecting iodine alcohol or formaldehyde into the soft spots of their tiny heads as they are crowning so that they are born dead imprisoning husbands until their wives submit to childkilling procedures cutting off food electricity water and wages for couples who refuse to comply with the chinese governments barbaric policies confiscating the furniture livestock and even homes of families who refuse to comply finally demolishing the homes of those who refuse to comply as reportedly occurred in two catholic villages in the hepel province when steven mosher wrote from his research in china he said this from sandhead brigade there were 18 women all 5 to 9 months pregnant and many redeyed from lack of sleep and crying they sat listlessly on short plank benches arranged in a semicircle about the front of the room where he kaifeng a commune cadre and communist party member explained the purpose of the meeting he said slowly and deliberately none of you has any choice in this matter the two of you who are 8 or 9 months pregnant will have a caesarean the rest of you will have a shot which will cause you to abort in order to return home to their families the women had to agree to abort their babies no matter how far along their pregnancies were this is not family planning these are outright human rights abuses i do not believe that this is a prolife or a prochoice issue it is a human issue it is a womans issue it is a family issue this is an issue of blatant government abuse and the united states taxpayers should not in any way be a part of it whether you are prolife or prochoice we should agree that chinas socalled

bill the first principle of the hippocratic oath is to do no harm yet the base bill before us does harm the pain relief promotion act does little to relieve pain instead it focuses on abolishing physicianassisted suicide it expands the authority of the drug enforcement administration agents to judge the practices of wellmeaning doctors this means that even when death results from sincere efforts to provide appropriate pain relief a doctors intent can be questioned last night i spoke with one of my constituents her name is lisa pearlman she was just 22 years old when she developed fibromyalgia this disease causes pain throughout the body lisa said there were days when she could barely function therewere times she could not even pick up her young child she said she went to at least a dozen doctors before she found one who could manage her pain now for flareups she takes pain killers to manage the pain so she can take care of her two young children but what if lisas doctor were too afraid of a criminal investigation to order the drugs that changed her life where would lisa and so many patients be the american pain foundation predicts that the base bill could actually increase the rate of suicide amtong the terminally ill because people who suffer from severe chronic pain will no longer have an alternative by intimidating doctors with pulled licenses and jail sentences the base bill does more to threaten the lives of those who desperately want to live than those who do not want to live it gives drug enforcement agents too much control over decisions that should be made by doctors and their patients i ask my colleagues to consider the lives of people who depend on aggressive pain medication to live it is not our place to come between a doctor and their patient in important decisions i include for the record the following letter from memorial sloankettering in support of the johnson bipartisan bill i urge my colleagues to support the johnson bill i

writing to urge you to oppose h r 2260 the pain relief promotion act of 1999 hyde nichols as a palliative care physician i know that pain is undertreated and that palliative care services are underutilized while h r 2260 is well intentioned it is counterproductive it will likely have a chilling effect on aggressive pain management as the cochairman of the agency for health care policy and research ahcpr expert panel on cancer pain guidelines i know that physicians often prescribe inadequate amounts of pain medicines and use less potent pain medications because of fears of regulatory scrutiny i wish to make it clear that i am opposed to physicianassisted suicide furthermore i feel it is profoundly unfair to provide an option for physicianassisted suicide in circumstances where many patients do not have full access to health care and quality pain management and palliative care however in considering the issue of physicianassisted suicide congress should not tamper with the controlled substances act and endanger patients in need of aggressive pain and symptom management i urge you to support an amendment to strike title 1 and thereby remove the provisions that turn the drug enforcement agency dea into a medical oversight body charged with investigating the intent and purpose in a physicians care for a patient i also urge you to support a substitute amendment incorporating the provisions of the conquering pain act a bill that would constructively promote endoflife and palliative careas long as the substitute amendment includes elimination of the changes to the controlled substances act of title 1 of h r 2260 unless one of these amendments is passed to remove the provisions that would increase barriers to aggressive pain management i strongly urge you to vote against h r 2260 as reported by committee please do not increase the barriers for physicians to provide the pain management palliative and endoflife care that the american public needs
