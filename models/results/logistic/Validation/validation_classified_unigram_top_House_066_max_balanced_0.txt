allowed me in this debate to a very abridged discussion of the railroad bill upon which we are to vote tomorrow i want to call the attention of the country to the fact that within the last few months there have been housed within the city of washington two of the greatest most dangerous and pernicious lobbies ever known in the history of this country one the railroad lobby the unprecedented lobby maintained here by the railroad corporate interests in their behalf and the other the lobby likewise unprecedented maintained here in behalf of the railroad employees under the direction and manipulation of samuel gompers i am sorry to say that during all of these months while the capacity of the leading hotels and especially of the new willard and the raleigh have been taxed to the utmost limits to take care of the personnel of these two big lobbiesone the railroad lobby the other the brotherhoods lobbythere has not been here in the city of washington one single official or one single individual to speak for the people of the united states who has a greater interest in this bill than the people of the united states is not their interest most involved who appears for the people it is in behalf of all the people that i rise to make some observations the guaranties assured railroads in this bill are out of all proportion the guaranties of this bill are beyond what the railroad corporate interests justly deserve and yet they come and say that congress is responsible for the conditions which call for such guaranties that congress took their properties away from them forcibly and without their consent permitted the director general to increase their wage pay roll over 900 000 000 annually they say that while we have had charge of the railroads one man has been able to increase their liabilities by 6ne two and three scratches of the pen of nearly a billion of dollars the railroad owners tell us that by reason of the increased wages alone allowed the four great brotherhoods during the war concerning which the owners had no voice whatever their operating expenses were thereby increased over 900 000 000 annually for which they claim the employees are alone responsible these owners claim that inasmuch as the government permitted the employees to increase such expenses 900 000 000 the government ought to assume full responsibility for its own action by making the railroads whole because of it and we are forced to admit that the railroad owners in this respect told the truth for it is a fact that while our government was engaged in a world war the result of which involved the peace and happiness of all civilization and when the slightest restriction of the full capacity of our combined railroad traffic menaced the successful conclusion of the war upon which not only the united states but all of our civilized allies depended these railroad brotherhoods came to their government with deadlier threats and weapons than used by highwaymen and to mr mcadoo said if you do not pay us 754 00 0 000 in cash we will tie up every road in the land and that mcadoo by a mere scratch of the pen was forced to hand over the cash 754 000 000that came not out of their pockets but came out of the pockets of all the people that is an annual increase that must be made good each year it is a fact that it did not stop there but that these same highwaymen leaders with a like threat the threat of absolute destruction if tyou please said to mr hines give us 67 000 000 more in cold cash if you do not do it it means death to this nation and its institutions and mr hines by a mere scratch of the pen was forced to give them the 67 000 000 in cold cash and it is a fact these organized union leaders again forced mr hines upon demand to give them more millions as a third raise during the war and they are still demanding an other and they say in this bill which has been drawn largely in their behalf that these raises shall stand as it provides that not a single change in tie salaries shall occur prior to september 1 1920 these are the conditions which the corporate interests say the union employees are responsible for and made necessary such guaranties in order to do justice to the people who own their bonds but everything considered i am of the opinion that no such guaranties as are contained in this bill should be granted and that much more than is just and right has been done for the railroads and if i had my way i would make many changes in the bill but on the other hand much more than is just and right has been done for the employees it is the poor suffering public whose rights have been ignored and not protected in this bill i would that the public could have been represented in its making but very unfortunately no lobby appeared for the public the billpaying jones did not seek an audience so full of clamor and insistence was the railroad lobby and the brotherhoodsgompers union lobby that i am much afraid the suffering public was wholly forgotten in the past congress and washington have seen some remarkable republican caucuses we have had in congress during its past history some very remarkable democratic caucuses if you please but never until last night in the whole history of this congress and the nation have we ever had before what is known strictly as a gompers caucus of congressmen if you please why yesterday every congressman republican or democrat who voted for what is known as the anderson amendment had his office rung up and his secretary was told that the congressman should appear that night in the house caucus room as mr gompers was going to address the miembersnot the ones who voted against the anderson amendment they were not so honored yesterdays newspapers told us that mr gompers would give us his ultimatum on the railroad bill but not a single democrat and not a single republican who voted against the anderson amendment now commonly called the organizedlabor amendment was invited to this caucus blood was put on his door and he was skipped congressmen who disobeyed mr gompers and voted against the anderson amendment did not receive this summons and they were not so honored but the ones who voted for the anderson amendment an amendment which we know was just exactl3 what mr gompers and his leaders wanted in the way of legislation they were all told to be there without fail last night and the most remarkable thing about this gomperscongressional caucus was that when telephoning the summons to members yesterday if they happened to be republicans they were then told that the affair was going to be a republican caucus while if they happened to be democrats they were toldat least a number of themthat it was to be a democratic caucusi because when that question was raised last night in the caucusi was not there but some of my gompers friends told meseveral congressmen stood up who are democrats and said that they had been informed it was to be a democratic caucus and a number of republican congressmen stood up and said that they were told that it was to be a republican caucus a caucus for what to hear mr gompers deliver his final orders and

magnificent record of those boys as they went over the enemy trenches and brought victory to the old stars and stripes or if i should speak of the many good patriotic citizens of this country who came to washington to assist our government in that great hour of trial i would be referred to as a patriot and a statesman but if i should happen to call attention to the thousands of cars and automobiles that are standing out in the sunshine and the storm between here and baltimore or if i should call attention to the millions of dollars worth of deteriorating foodstuffs now in the hands of the war department and if i should perchance call attention to the fact that there were men who came to washington with flags on the lapels of their coats and attached themselves to the war department under the guise of patriotism and out of their services made great profits and whose unconscionable profits in some instances have been shown by the excessprofits tax they paid then i would be referred to as a partisan as one mal on this committeei am a republicani signed the majority report because i believed that while it may not be exactly true in every word so far as the grammatical construction is concerned it points to serious facts that are confronting the american people today and it is strange indeed to see our friends across the aisle who have stood ever since i can remember as the particular champions of the consumers of this country forced into a position where they are undertaking to defend the activities of big business as a republican i believe in big business i believe whlen big business is properly handled it is to the advantage of the consuming public of america and i have never been against that but when big business will undertake to set the prices that our government shall pay for the things to feed our soldier boys and after they have filled their pockets with gold as shown by the diamonds worn by their families and the excessprofits taxes that they pay and then when the war is over and our government undertakes to dispose of the surplus we find those men gathered in the room of the secretary of war undertaking to dictate to him the policy that lie shall pursue in getting rid of this surplus stock in order that it may not disturb their business it behooves the people to awaken from their slumber i have got only a few minutes ad i want to say this in conclusion my friends the high cost of living is only an incident the amount of food concerned in this is but a mere bagatelle but the thing we want to take note ofand that is why men will support this resolutionis the fact that whenever the american people discover that their government has so degenerated from a nation of freemen that the officials of our government are taking their orders from and are subservient to the great combinations and interests of this country our land is in danger there is a ure and just way to handle such problems and if not so landled and the rights
