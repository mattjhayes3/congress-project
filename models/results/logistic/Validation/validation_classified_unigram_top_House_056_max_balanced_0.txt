{"top_correct": [[0.005691587924957275, 0.9943084120750427, 1, "i feel duly grateful for the courtesy shown me by the house in according me a portion of the brief time allotted for the discussion of this bill and will avail myself of this final opportunity to pay my respects to the administration and the political issues it has engendered this is the closing day of the fiftysixth congress which will go into history famous for the good it has avoided and the evil it has accomplished it has been my fortune good or bad to participate in a negative way in all that has been done and after resumming my part i can truthfully say that i have cast no vote which i feel ashamed of or for which i have been called upon to apologize i have protested by speech and vote against the objectionable legislation which has been enacted but i have found the majority at all times merciless in their intolerance heedless of our warnings and deaf to our protests responsibility is largely measured by opportunity and with its limited opportunities and the utter helplessness of the minority under the arbitrary rules of the house more could not be expected of this side of the chamber or of a new member and in taking my leave of this body after so brief a service i am reminded of the inscription on the gravestone of the 6weeksold infant i was so quickly done for i wonder what i was begun for it seems to me that this would be an opportune time to review some of the issues of the late campaign and see whether or not all that we predicted has not been confirmed three great issues were presented representing cardinal principles of the democratic party we denounced the single gold standard and proclaimed our allegiance to the ancient and righteous principle of bimetallism we arraigned the trusts and charged the republican party with being in league with them pledged to afford the people no remedy against their rapacity we warned the public against the dangers of imperialism so manifest in the policy of the administration relative to cuba and the philippines and lurking in the very shadow of the republican platform these questions have not been settled but are living issues and like banquos ghost will come up to haunt the republican party in the future the country basking in the sunshine of general prosperity which came inevitably in the course of things not by reason of the republican administration but in spite of it was loth to distulrb existing conditions was content to let well enough alone and assumed the risk of arresting in the future the tendency toward imperialism rather than run the risk of unsettling business conditions which always attends as an inctdent to the change of administrations do not deceive yourselves my friends the people have not approved your policy of imperialism and when that question shall be fairly presented unhampered and uncomplicated by individual necessity and temporary expediency the voice of the american people will be heard in one triumphant acclaim against the infamous policy which you have so assiduously endeavored to fasten upon the country the theory of bimetallism has been vindi cated by events which may be misleading now but which will be fully understood and appreciated in the future bimetallism means more standard more basic money the necessity of which was admitted prior to the phenomenal increase in the production of gold in alaska which in the light of history can be only temporary this increase in the output of gold has supplied the place of silver for the time being and brought relief and prosperity to the country the production of gold last year was more than double that of both gold and silver in 1896 when the money question so intensely challenged the attention of the world let us hope that this enormous output will indefinitely continue but if not beware of silvers demand for restoration as standard money good times and bad times alternate as day and night as sunshine and shadow as the hill and the valley we are now enjoying the high tide of day the sunshine upon the hill crest but as we scan the horizon we see the ominous gathering of financial clouds and hear the awful rumbling of a commercial storm i have often heard it predicted of late that the strenuous commercial conditions prevailing throughout this country at no late day will reach a climax and culminate in the most distressing and farreaching panic the world has ever known i pray that this cup may pass but unless something is done soon to curb the avarice and the rapacity of commercial greed we will awake some day to find our worst hopes realized and our country in the throes of chaos and anarchy i am no pessimist i am an optimist and trusting and believing in the wisdom the intelligence and the infallibility of the american people i know a remedy will be found ere it is too late no hope can be indulged during the incoming administration president mckinley and his party are wedded to the commercial interests are controlled and dominated by those influences and will continue to foster and encourage them in the future as they have in the past the trusts will continue to feed and fatten upon the vitals of the people monopoly will continue to absorb the resources of the country and commercial cupidity and greed will continue to hold high carnival enforcing extension exacting tribute and demanding subsidy at the hands of a puny administration and a servile congress what has become of your boasted promises to suppress the trust evil you have full poweryou have the executive and both branches of congresswhy does not the senate pass the antitrust bill which passed this house last session for campaign purposes as we then charged and you now confess in a speech upon this floor last may i said the republican party did not intend to pass any measure designed to suppress the trust evil i then used this language the only excuse and justification claimed for the philippine war is that it vill extend american trade and commerce all at the instance of the great trusts and monopolies which are sapping the lifeblood of our nationand right here permit me to digress long enough to inquire why no antitrust legislation has been enacted by this congress why has every bill introduced for the suppression of these gigantic and monstrous evils been suppressed by the majority i understand you have introduced a constitutional amendment of some kind but that was done i venture to say for the purpose of tiding the question over the presidential election you do not intend to legislate against the trusts and your amendment is only an excuse and a makeshift you intend to rely upon platform promises rather than performance when you have the present power and opportunity tell me has not the prediction i then made been fulfilled answer me was that bill passed for the purposes of the campaign only were you in good faith or were you merely exploiting your pretenses for the purpose of hoodwinking and cajoling the people into voting to continue your reign of plunder and robbery let me call your attention to the fact that both the democratic and the republican platforms last campaign declared against the trusts the republican platform proposed some vague uncertain and indefinite remedy against this evil i would invite you gentlemen of both the democratic and republican parties to read the republican platform and its friendly allusion to the trusts it does not pain me to say that the republican platform against trusts is insincere and was not adopted with a view to its enforcement in the case of mr mckinleys reelection and was not intended to commit the leaders in the republican party to the enforcement of existing antitrust laws or the enactment of new laws to suppress the trust evil recently when standing upon the platform of a car the porter came to me and gently tapped me upon the shoulder and said 1mister you must not stand upon this platform i said sir what is thisplatform for and he replied this platform mister is to get in on sir i never fully understood the full purport and meaning of that definition of a platform or what a platform was really intended for until i reread the declaration or plank in the republican platform against trusts and then i discovered for the first time the full purport and meaning of a political platform especially a republican platform that they are not made to stand on but made to get in on when republican spellbinders during the campaign went about the country telling the people they undertook to provide a remedy against the trust evil last session of congress by a constitutional amendment and that they were defeated in their project by the democratic minority they no doubt deceived many and left the impression that the proposed amendment was necessary and that the democratic minority in congress was hostile to all legislation against the trust evil let me read that amendment and then point out the objections to it which induced almost the whole of the democratic minority in congress to vote against it here it is congress shall have power to define regulate control prohibit or dissolve trusts monopolies or combinations whether existing in the form of a corporation or otherwise the several states may continue to exercise such power in any manner not in conflict with the laws of the united states i assume that congress already has ample power and authority to suppress all trusts doing an interstate business and that a constitutional amendment is wholly unnecessary trusts are foreign or domestic that is those which do a business wholly within the bounds of a single statethe state of their originand trusts which do an interstate business every state legislature has ample and full power to suppress every local or domestic trust doing business wholly in the state of its origin and the federal congress has no power to interfere with any such trust monopoly or combination and should have none we desire that the several states of the union shall continue to exercise that power that they shall not be limited or prescribed in the power which they may exercise toward the suppression of all local and domestic trusts monopolies and combinations that no restriction of congress that no definition of a trust that no regulation or control of trusts which congress may see fit to adopt shall abridge or interfere with the right of the state of illinois or any other state to protect itself against any local or domestic concern of that character i assert that congress already has ample and sufficient power to protect the several states of the union against a trust monopoly or combination existing or incorporated in another state and to prevent it from doing business outside of the state of its origin and that a constitutional amendment is wholly unnecessary to afford federal interference and relief against this evil let me call your attention to the wording of the proposed amendmeut it provided that congress shall have power to define trusts monopolies or combinations now if congress should have the power to define a trust it could place upon these combinations in restraint of trade a very liberal or a very strict detinition and influenced by trust agents and lobbyists could so define the trust that even the standard oil company would not come within its definition and every state legislature would be prescribed limited and bound by the definition for by the very terms of the amendment the states could act only in harmony and nct in conflict with the law of congress thereby depriving the people of any and all remedy by means of state legislation against a most iniquitous evil it provides that the states shall not exercise such powerthat is the power to define to regulate to control to prohibit or to dissolve trustsexcept that they do so in compliance with the laws prescribed by congress and hence if thq congress should so define a trust as to permit all combinations of capital organized for the purpose of limiting production and arbitrarily fixing prices to continue to do business the states would be powerless to exercise a remedy against that character of combinations whether they are domestic or foreign and would be wholly without a remedy because the states would be limited to the remedy afforded the people by the definition placed upon trusts by this body the result would be to abridge the power of the states to make state legislatures wholly subservient to the will of congress and subject to the definition placed upon trusts by the congress and to deny the people any other remedy than that which congress would sea fit to afford against the trust evil the only remedy heretofore afforded against trusts has been through the several state legislatures and we insist that the power to enact and enforce antitrust laws shall not be abridged or denied to the states but that the states shall continue to exercise unrestricted power concurrent with federal authority and not be subject to any limitations or restrictions of congress the republican party are under obligations to the trusts they receive contributions for campaign purposes from these unlawful combinations the republican party is said to be always true to its friends true to its obligations i must confess the republican party was never known to betray a trust and they will not be so ungrateful in the next four years to come as to prosecute their best friends the men who furnish them the money by which they hope to corrupt the ballot box they will not be so ungrateful to mark hanna and his friends as to put a straw in the way of the trusts i want to go a step further i would impress upon your minds that we are involved in complications growing out of the acquisition of the philippine islands by reason of the demand made by the trusts by monopoly and by commercial greed the negotiations for the philippine islands and their acquisition was demanded by the trusts that they might have a new field to exploit and insist that the whole people of the united states shall maintain a standing army shall be compelled to support the government in its policy of imperialism and militarism that commercial greed may reap a harvest by reason of this demand upon the part of the trusts the administration controlled and dominated y mark hanna and men of his character negotiated for the philippine islands and paid 20 000 000 for their cession to the united states i have often been asked the difference between thomas jefferson expansion and mckinley imperialism let me define the difference when thomas jefferson negotiated for the louisiana territory it embraced the mouth and the whole western bank of the mississippi river mr jefferson knew it was safer to acquire the louisiana territory that we might avoid foreign complications and future wars he negotiated for the louisiana territory that we might control the mississippi river its tributaries and its mouth remember that when we secured all that vast domain known as the louisiana territory it was vacant unoccupied and practically uninhabited territory it lay at our very door inviting the footsteps and the ax of civilization when we acquired that territory mr jefferson required that there should be incorporated in the treaty ceding it to the united states this declaration that the future inhabitants of the louisiana territory should be citizens of the united states that was not imperialism that was not creating colonies that was not profaning the constitution defiling the declaration of independence or prostituting the american flag but was a wise provision for the extension of the constitution and the blessings of free government and free institutions to all that vast expanse of vacant territory to be occupied by our own people and to be erected into states of the american union extending the blessings of free government from the mississippi river to the pacific ocean contrast that if you please with mckinley imperialism when we acquired the philippine islands they were not necessary to avoid foreign complications or future wars but were calculated as results have shown to involve us in the very character of wars and complications which we sought to avoid and in fact have avoided by the louisiana purchase they were not contiguous territory but lay 8 0c0 miles across the sea they were not vacant unoccupied and uninhabited territory but were populated more densely than any rural portion of the united states populated by a people alien in race alien in color alien in religion alien in tongue alien in customs and education alien in all that ought to be common between the citizens of the same republic but that is not all let me impress upon the minds of my republican friends that the treaty ceding the philippine islands to the united states does not provide that the inhabitants shall be citizens of the united states but it does provide that the civil rights and political status of the inhabitants of the philippine islands shall be determined by congress if we keep the philippine islands we must determine in what capacity we will retain them when congress determines their civil rights and their political status it will determine whether they shall be citizens of the united states or whether they shall be subjects if you make them citizens you will confer upon them all the constitutional privileges all the rights and all the blessings of free government which you yourselves enjoy there can be no distinction between american citizens whatever their race color or previous condition of servitude every american citizen is entitled to the same privileges the same rights the same immunities under the american flag the world over you can not discriminate between them if you make the people of the philippine isands citizens you give to them all the privileges which you and your children possess and enjoy you must admit the products of those islands free of duty to our markets in competition with the products of the american farm and factory you must give them representation in the congress of the united states thatthere shall be notaxation without representation you must give thema voice in the government that we may not impose upon them a government against their consent in violation of the plain letter of the declaration of independence you must erect them into states of the american union you must admit the brown men of the philippine islands into your home into your political society into your business affairs with the same rights that you yourselves possess and enjoy you must tear down the chineseexclusion act and admit the pauper labor of the philippine islands in competition with the free labor of the united states are you now readyare you preparedare you willing to make the brown men of the philippine islands citizens of the united states if you do not make them citizens you must make them subjects subjects of a free republic denying them the constitutionof the united states imposing upon them a government without their consent enforcing the payment of taxes without representation to make them subjects you must maintain a standing army that you may enforce your government without consent and taxation without representation at the point of the bayonet there are but twokinds of governmentgovernment by consent and government by force government by force is imperialism government against will and sustained by military authority is foreign to the institutions of the united states and in violation of constitutional rights when mr mckinley was first elected president our standing army was but 25 000 men after the spanishwar had closed after victory upon sea and land adding renown and luster to the american army and navy after the volunteer soldier had returned to his peaceful pursuits and when no war was imminent in the philippine islands mr mckinley asked congress to give him authority to increase the standing army to 100 000 men why that the republican policy of government by brute force might be extended to the philippine islands that an army might be in readiness to hold these people in subjection that they might be governed as england sought to govern the thirteen american colonies prior to the american revolution not only that the trusts and the combinations in the united states demanded an increase in our standing army that they might feel more secure in the possession and enjoyment of their illgotten gains that a standing army might be stationed at every industrial center to enforce government by injunction and to awe and deter and bulldoze union labor and the american workman to make them citizens of the united states is to endanger our civilization to make them subjects endangers our form of government because it is a departure from the principles which have guided us to prosperity in the years that have passed let me call your attention to what expresident harrison has said at the time of the porto rico tariff bill discussion in this house when it was proposed to tax the porto ricans without representation in violation of the constitution which requires that taxation shall be uniform throughout the united states mr harrison said i regard it a serious departure from right principles i do not stand here appealing in behalf of the brown men of the philippine islands they are a matter of small consequence to you and to me as compared with the future of our country and of posterity all humanity sympathizes with them but my heart bleeds for my own country and for my own fellowcitizens extend to them a policy such as proposed by mr mckinley a colonial policy after the style of england impose upon other people a government by force sustained by the military power create colonies recognize government by brute force and you have taken not only the first but an irretrievable step in the direction of imperialism not only threatening the liberties of other people not only depriving the brown men of the philippine islands of their rights and of their liberty but in the end jeopardizing and threatening the liberty the institutions of our own country you can not extend despotic power to other people without in the near future the seed you plant returning to curse you at home and it is for and on behalf of our own country and our own people that i plead against that departure from our form of government under which we have grown prosperous and great i am opposed to a large standing army because it begets a spirit of intolerance and of tyranny at home and abroad i am opposed to maintaining an army of 70 000 men in the philippines to crush the spirit of liberty and the germs of free government there the volunteer soldier is a republics best defender the mercenary soldier is a machine while the volunteer soldier fights for a principle and dies for a just cause i am opposed to a large standing army not only because it tends to subvert free institutions but because of the enormous expense entailed our republican friends drunk upon the lust of empire and imbued with the spirit of conquest and commercial aggrandizement propose by this bill to maintain an army of 100 000 men at an expense of 170 000 000 a year during the last year of mr clevelands administration the total cost of our army was but 23 000 000 a year and now it is proposed to appropriate seven times that amount for the ensuing year we were told during the campaign that mr mckinleys election would witness immediate cessation of hostilities in the philippine islands if the war is over why the necessity of increasing the army why this immense expenditure of money i submit the following estimate of the costs of our army and navy including pensions for the year 1891 as compared with that of great britain france germany and russia army navy pensions total united states 1901 170 000 000 78 000 000 144 000 000 392 000 000 great britain 115 0 000 135 000 000 15 000 000 265 000 000 france v17 000 000 57 000 000

warn our republican friends against the extravagance in public expenditures which has characterized the mckinley administration whatever may be the fundamental issues in the next general election whether it be bimetallism trusts or imperialism one you must meet will be willful extravagance and corruption the watchword of 1904 will be retrenchment and reform let me contrast the expenditures of the cleveland administration with that of the mckinley administration i would invite your attention to these figures year amount per cent 1893 383 477 954 49 5 78 1894 367 595 279 83 5 43 1895 356 195

avoiding an extra session the senate has seen fit to extend certain powers to the president in relation to the cuban situation which are greater than that exercised by any sovereign upon the earth and yet we are told that imperialism is a myth and a fraud i am opposed to this bill not only because it begets a spirit of intolerance and tyranny not only because of enormous expense of maintaining a large standing army not only because it may and will be used as an engine of oppression in the philippine islands but because it is a violation of the solemn pledge given cuba and the world in the following resolution of congress when war was declared against spain i will read it that the poople of the island of cuba are and of right ought to be free and independent and that the government of the united states hereby recognizes the republic of cuba as the true and lawful government of that island hereby disclaiming any disposition or intention to exercise sovereignty jurisdiction or control over said islands except for the pacification thereof and asserts its determination when that is accomplished to leave the governmept and control of the island to its people by this bill the united states seeks to exercise sovereignty and jurisdiction over the island of cuba and absolute control of its foreign relations the sacred words of that resolution borrowed from the declaration of independence are no guaranty against its violation by the republican party and the country is about to witness another act of perfidy on the part of congress by the passage of this bill that will go far to convince the world that our boasted love of freedom and independence is but a sham and a fraud"], [0.010692179203033447, 0.9893078207969666, 1, "no i mean mark twains owl from maine if the government will hand out a thousand dollars or 25 000 to a national bank upon the deposit of bonds why not pass out a thousand dollars to some poor man who is unfortunate enough to own only one bond answer that in your own time i repeat it and you dare not answer and i repeat my first proposition that this is not a coinage bill and that it is purely a nationalbank bill and nothing more nor less the purpose of this bill is not o much tofasten the gold standard upon us as it is to fasten the national banks upon us now i make this prediction that the time will come when you will confess that this bill had things in it that the gentleman from indiana did not understand and that no man on the committee that reported it here understood and that no man who went down to atlantic city last spring to come back with this bill understood in 1896 there was a shortage in the money supply and as usual falling prices and hard times resulted from this condition the democrats and other reform forces in order to remove this disastrous condition advocated a larger money supply and had the courage and honesty to declare that this could most surely be done by returning to the money of the constitution bimetallism and they were frank enough to tell the people in words and figures that they agreed with lincoln in the ratio of 16 to 1 and that they also agreedwith lincoln in his last public utterance on the 14th day of april 1865 wherein he said the more gold and silver we mine so much the easier we make the payment of the national debt i am going to encourage that in every possible way in strange contrast with abraham lincoln who wanted the payment of the national debt and other debts made easier by directing the whole people as well as the million disbanded soldiers to the mining of gold and silver we see today the administration of william mckinley recommending that this house pass the bill we are today considering and which as stated by the gentleman from connecticut has been recommended by the national bankers association in other words the administration in this measure as well as every other measure which has come before this house shows itself unhesitatingly and unmistakably in favor of anything demanded by the national banks the trusts and other forms of organized greed while abraham lincoln from whom this administration claims to be a legitimate heir proclaimed to the people not only of this republic but to the world in his first annual message to congress thatlabor is prior to and independent of capital capital is only the fruit of labor and could never have existed if labor had not first existed labor is the superior of capital and deserves much the higher consideration in other words abraham lincoln believed that labor is the superior of capital while this administration by every act demonstrates that it believes that capital is the superior of labor i have already stated what the democrats the populists and lincoln republicans stood for in 1896 the mckinley republicans and hanna democrats contended that fallihg prices were a distinct advantage that the dollar could not be made too good that it could not be made to buy too much that if dollars could be made so scarce that one of them would buy 4 bushels of wheat instead of 1 bushel or 10 bushels of corn instead of 3 such a dollar would be an honest dollar and more sound and more reliable than the dollars advocated by jefferson jackson and lincoln the gold worshipers in 1896 argued ihoughout that memorable campaign that to increase the volume of money to make more dollars would be to cheapen them and would be doing an injustice to those holding insurance policies or dedosit books of the savings banks or mortgages or bonds or other evidences of credit tlroughout the past week the advocates of this bill have boasted much of prosperity and are particularly profuse and elaborate in claiming that the increase in the volume of currency which we now have is to the honor and glory of the very party that argued against an increasing currency three years ago no man will undertake to point to any legislation of this administration and claim that such legislation is responsible for our increased volume of currency unless he is willing to have either his honesty or intelligence questioned by those who hear him since 1896 the volume of money has increased in the united states from natural causes such as shortage of crops and famines abroad which produced in the united states increased exports of commodities and increased imports of cash in addition to this we have had an increased output of gold in our own country and in consequence of this increased volume of money an era of rising prices has followed stimulating industry and business thus proving the principles advocated by the democratic party in 1896 and under these conditions the farmers and laborers of the land would have shared much more of the fruits of this increase had it not been that the republican party has promoted and developed an empire of trusts which by the power of monopoly hold down abnormally low the prices of labor and the prices of the products of the farm and the mine while on the other hand the prices of all articles manufactured by the trusts are thrust up beyond all reason conscience or decency thus trusts counteract and prevent profits which should accrue to all legitimate laborers farmers and business men from the increased volume of money the owners of these trusts are not satisfied with the mere control of the output of all the commodities which enter into the food clothing and shelter of humanity today we see their great and allcontrolling influence at work in what ought to be a free and independent parliamentary body crude indeed must be the legislator here who can not see that the hand of the attorney of the national bankers association has written this currency bill so that the same men who control the output of tin and wire and nails shall also control the output of money the organization that moves this body and dominates the majority side of it contends that the 80 000 000 american citizens can not make a good dollar out of silver but that 3 600 national bankers can make good nmoney out of paper and the paper based not on labor but on the debt of the government in other words the bankers association that is responsible for this bill has made a sight draft on the majority side of congress and the passage of this bill must be delivered before the close of banking hours next monday the gentleman from iowa spoke of delivering this bill as a christmas gift to the business interests of the country he evidently considered that the 3 600 national bankers are the only business interests of the united states and for some reason his party has a debt of gratitude to pay in the form of a christmas gift is that debt the debt created by the gigantic corruption fund of 1896 in addition to opening the eyes of many by your catering to the bankers you will by this act emphasize the doctrine we have maintained as to the blessings which follow an increasing currency either you must concede this or you must confess that the additional 10 per cent of currency herein provided for national banks to receive upon deposit of bonds is purely for the benefit of the banker and not for the public good and while you are bragging about prosperity are you not afraid someone will ask you why you meddle with a currency system that was in force at the time this prosperity blew in upon us are you not afraid that it may be necessary to write upon the tombstone of your party this epitaph which the persian king ordered to be placed over his gravei was well but wished to be better took physic and died in no other firstclass country in the world is the speculative class in control of the range of prices as it is here in the united states in germany austria and russia the government controls entirely the range of prices within the country by controlling the bank rate in england it is the commercial class that controls the bank rate and thereby the range of prices no banker is permitted to become a member of the board of directors of the bank of england bagehot emphasizes this in his volume entitled lombard street in france the control of the price level is maintained by a coinbination of representatives of the commercial classes and of appointees of the government while in the united states the speculative class controls the range of prices by controlling the volume of money and the bank rate and the same class by the agency of trusts also controls the output of shops mills and factories and thus are enabled to dictate the wages of labor and in due time they expect and intend to destroy every labor union in this republic and when they have done this they will have destroyed the one remaining class who still have some conception of the meaning of the expressions free speech free thought free press free schools and a free ballot when they have blotted out 6f existence the organizations of labor they will have destroyed the last hope of a free government this bill is framed in behalf of the national bankers association and this association after the passage of this bill will be the most powerful and arrogant trust on the face of the earth it will be the oligarchy that will eventually convert the american republic into one of the several forms of despotism which have characterized the decay and destruction of all the efforts and all the hopes of the philosophers and the patriots of the centuries gone by in their struggles for free government the policy of the reform forces in this country is to adopt a system of finance which will take from the speculators the control of the money volume and prices it will continue to be our battle cry in the future as it was in the memorable campaigns of andrew jackson and william jennings bryan that the national banks must go out of the governing business for my part i know of nothing that will go farther toward opening the eyes of the voters of the land than the fact that every man on the republican side of this house has been driven in under the lash of the caucus whip to confess his absolute subserviency to the national bankers association in 1878 at the passage of the blandallison bill in 1890 at the passage of the sherman law in 1893 at the repeal of the sherman law and in the presidential campaign of 1896 the monetary discussions among the people of this republic continued with increasing intensity and each time that the matter came before the american people the differences grew apace until the plutocratic element of the old democratic party joined the wallstreet end of the republican party and the lincoln republicans separated themselves from their old associates and identified themselves with the jeffersonian democrats and populists and other reform forces of the country today there are two welldefined parties we of the one espouse the cause of the farmer the merchant the small manufacturer the miner the wageearner and all other producers and creators of wealth you champion the cause of the speculators whose greed for dollars has made them as blind as misers to the just rights of man the reasonable comforts of the homes and the education of the children of the plain people the honest and industrious millions the aims and schemes of your party as now constituted all tend to intrench in castles and palaces the lords and barons of trusts whose power is already so gigantic that when compared with the power of the feudal lords of the dark ages the latter sink to the stature of pigmies the aim of the reform forces is to destroy not only the money trust but all the trusts that fatten in this land of liberty and your united vote as you walk up and register the same on monday next like dumb driven cattle under the lash of the national bankers association will in itself be such an object lesson that it will be easy for the people to understand and interpret your complete subserviency to the money power and your complete idolatry and worship of the golden calf i take the liberty unauthorized though i be to challenge you now to release your imperial president from his vineclad porch in canton ohio in the next campaign and let him meet if he dare in debate on any rostrum our standard bearer william jennings bryan i challenge you now to prepare your chief executive if you dare to come before the people and defend his policy n placing the entire money volume of the land within the control of the national bankers association and i challenge you now to prepare him to explain this repudiation and destruction of the greenback which was good enough and honest enough to pay abraham lincolns hundreds of thousands who sacrificed their lives and their health that the union might live you have talked about prosperity if war and foreign complications cause prosperity then let us like the romans carry our spears and battleaxes into every clime and every nation if commercial greed and trade justify our course in the orient why not look after additional trade in europe also why not offer eng land 20 000 000 for ireland telling her we need the island as a coaling station in order to extend our commerce and to carry our flag across great britain and the continent if england refuses to accept the 20 000 000 let us shoot benevolent assimilation into her and all the while increase our prosperity what has your party done for prosperity what legislation has made prosperity we voted in the fiftyfifth congress 100 000 to pay for free transportation of the food that was donated to the starving millions in india that famine was so farreaching in its horrors that it was said that 12 000 000 human beings were swallowed up in its greed was that famine the result of anything the republican party did if you could go down and ask the spirits that sank beneath the earth in that trying ordeal i think they would say that that was not an act of providence but they would rather impute it to the imps of hell you claim the credit of it for the republican party on that side of the house you may have it if you desire as a result of that famine and other shortages of food in the eastern part of the world we have largely increased our exports of farm products and in return have received large imports of cash and increased our circulating mnedium and there is a temporary betterment of conditions you complain that each one of us does not stand here and reaffirm the chicago platform does not repronounce the name of bryan does not declare that he is for each of them and you say that therefore we have abandoned them must we stand here each day and repeat the multiplication table or be accused of abandoning that does the preacher each sunday preach on the texts thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness thou shalt not commit adultery and if he does not repeat these sermons each sunday do you say on monday morning that he is in favor of all of them and that he has abandoned his opposition to them that is an absurdity that is childish talk 1 say to you that so far as i am concernedand i know i represent at least 16 to 1 of the democrats on this floor when i say itwe are in favor of the reaffirmation of the chicago platform of 1890 rapplause on the democratic side we are in favor of renominating william jennings bryan andin addition to reaffirming the chicago platform we shall declare against trusts militarism and imperialism and add a plank against slavery and polygamy in the sulu islands and a plank against the british alliancean alliance that is now open and apparent great britain is shooting down liberty in south africa while you are shooting it down in the philippine islands that is evidence sufficient that both governments are operating upon parallel lines the first blossom of liberty in the orient is to be cut off by the republican party of the united states and the first substantial struggle for liberty in africa is to be shot down in its infancy by the queen of england while the czar of russia is asking for peace if things are not upside down how can the republican party stand impotent and silent while england is shooting to death a republic in south africa and while under the military and imperialistic power that patronage has delivered to the president here the crime of crimes is being committed in the philippines under the stars and stripes of the union the president at madison wis said only one small fraction of one smell tribe is resisting our authority in the orient aye my friends and the president is sending an army there of 75 000 men to subdue one small fraction of one small tribe an army larger than sherman had when he marched to the sea an army larger than grant needed to take vicksburg an army larger than lee surrendered at richmond is now called into requisition and kept there for nearly a year to subdue one small faction of one small tribe is this the source of your prosperity does anyone believe if general miles had been sent to the philippines a year ago with full power to restore peace that he would not have secured it long since without the waste of life and health and treasure expended in a war which john sherman exsenator edmunds exspeaker reed carl seburz senator hoar exgovernor boutwell and thousands of other republicans think an unnecessary an uncalledfor and an unjust war aside from passing the dingley mother of trusts you have also passed a bill under which yiu have sold two hundred millions of bonds and in that way your nvar with spain drew from the vaults and hiding places an additional volume of currency which by the storms of war was scattered throughout all the avenues of business and trade in addition to this you have burdened the people with stamp taxes and war taxes that are taking from their meager pockets hundreds of millions of dollars to carry on a war against liberty on the other side of the earth that will be the shame and humiliation of the american people for generations to come and will require us in some sane moment to apologize to the spirits of washington jefferson jackson and lincoln aside from the legislation i have already mentioned what if you please has the republican administration done since the 4th of march 1897 as i recall it its first act was to coax and wheedle john sherman out of a seat in the senate promisinghim a place in the cabinet is this the source of your prosperity a little later on you unceremoniously kicked the sage of mansfield the nestor of the republican party out of the cabinet without daring to give to the world your reason or excuse for the same is this the source of your prosperity you remained impotent and whined that you would have peace at any price although a spaniard insulted you with the charge that your president was nothing but a low politician is this the source of your prosperity your administration sent the maine injanuary 1898 carrying the stars and stripes as an emblem of good will to spain rather than as a ray of hope to cuba struggling for independence although in the st louis platform you professed sympathy for cuba in her struggles to free herself from european domination you sent our good ship maine as an encouragement to spain and as a result of it 266 american lives were sacrificed to spanish treachery is this the source of your prosperity in your st louis platform you also promised the old soldiers who saved the union that they should receive fair treatment and generous recognition whereas in fact throughout these three years you have left almost neglected 600 000 applications of the old soldiers for pensions and today are practicing the same policy of delay in the treatment of our soldiers in the spanishamerican war who came home permeated with diseases imposed upon them by the beef trust and the horse doctors is this the source of your prosperity after attorneygeneral mckenna was sent from the cabinet to a place on the supreme bench you took into the cabinet as attorneygeneral a man who was governor of new jersey the home and stronghold of these pirates known as trusts and syndicates who like pirates of old day and night scan the seas to loot and plunder other vessels too weak to cope with them and this attorneygeneral promptly discovered that the laws against trusts were impotent and unavailing is this the source of your prosperity after eagan had been courtmartialed and found unworthy of a place in the american army your president restored him to a full salary of 85 500 a year for the next six years and 84 125 a year for the remainder of his life in all he will draw from the national treasury 75 000 if he lives his natural expectancy although he will never render another days service to our government is this the source of your prosperity your beef trust and horse doctors murdered about 4 800 men while the spaniards only killed 350 is this the source of your prosperity you humiliated and subordinated that man who won the most magnificent naval victory that the world has ever seen winfield scott schley is this the source of your prosperity you have subordinated and humiliated general miles whom abraham lincoln promoted for deedsof skill and heroic courage from battle to battle until he had climbed up the ladder of military fame from a clerk in a store to that of brevet majorgeneral of the united states army is this the source of your prosperity you ignored and humiliatedscores of military leaders and experts trained at west point and in the indian wars at an expense of millions of dollars and subordinated such as these by putting politicians in the army saddles is this the source of your prosperity if you have done anything to produce prosperity answer me if you please and tell me what it was you will live to be ashamed of your record one gentleman talked about prosperity and the consequent result of the election in 1898 in the last congress you had the advantage of the reform forces by 57 votes in this house we are in the minority by only 13 votes is this an evidence of your prosperity we are satisfied with the progress we have made and now in closing let me give you all my new year greeting in the language of howard s taylor of chicago did our liberty bell ring in vain was our declaration a lie must we turn to the old world again with the penitent prodigals cry must we arm us and march in the

republican party is wrong on the issue and in favor of the trusts i believe every intelligent man and impartial citizen in this country will concur in this conclusion the republican party is insincere in the position it now assumes for party purposes and political advantage the present attitude of the republican party on the trust issue like its past is too flimsy and too transparent to deceive anyone the republican party has been in power for nearly four years and it has done nothing against the trusts on the contrary it has aided them and stood sponsor for them the republican attorneygeneral clothed with ample power by your own admission has failed and refused to bring a single suit against the trusts and monopolies why did he not enforce the law now on the statute books you answer that the law is ineffective i reply why have you waited nearly four years to amend it the law now on the statute books against trusts is clear and plain and the highest court in the land has passed on its validity and sustained the constitutionality of its provisions the antitrust act of 1890 declares that every contract or combination in the nature of a trust in restraint of trade and commerce among the several states and territories or with foreign nations is a conspiracy illegal and void and punishable by fine and imprisonment under this antitrust act it seems to me every trust in the united states can be prosecuted for violation of law the charter annulled and the men behind it punished for conspiracy every trust by its very nature is in restraint of trade and commerce and in violation of this law if you will read the antitrust act of 1890 and the decisions of the united states supreme court in the transmissouri freight case and the addyston pipe line case the conclusion will be irresistible to the logical mind that the fault is not so much with the law as it is with the men who are sworn to enforce the law the law so far as it goes is all rightthe donothing attorneygeneral is all wrong the imperative mandate of the day is enforce the law and every trust in the country will dissolve whenever the trusts have been brought before the courts and their true character shown they have been declared illegal in my opinionand i say so advisedlythe department of justice under the present law can institute and successfully maintain actions against every trust doing business in the united states the law is clear and plain and the facts are within the knowledge of all and too obvious for controversy it has been said by some unthinking persons that there are good trusts and bad trusts that we shonld applaud and commend the good trusts and denounce and condemn the bad trusts under the law this specious argument is untenable and the men who make it are the hired attorneys and the special pleaders for the trusts or they are facetious fellows poking fun at the victims under the law of our country trusts are criminal and there is no distinction between a socalled good trust and a socalled bad trustbetween a big trust and a little trust every trust is contrary to both the spirit and the letter of the law to seriously contend otherwise as a legal proposition would be preposterous if we did so by analogy we might as consistently assert that there were good pirates and bad pirates if robbery is criminal it is immaterial so far as the crime is concerned whether the robbery is a big one or a little one the violation of law is the same under the last democratic administration there were a number of suits instituted against trusts by the democratic attorneygeneral and carried to a successful determination but under your present republican trust attorneygeneral you have not begun or instituted a single suit under this antitrust act now what is your answer to that that it is not effective if you say the antitrust act is not effective against trusts and monopolies in restraint of trade between the states and territories i point to the decisions of the united states supreme court in the addyston pipe line case and the transmissouri freight case those two deeisions demonstrate conclusively that if the republican attorneygeneral had done his sworn duty most of the great trusts which have been organized since the republican party has been in control of the government would not now be robbing the people but would be out of business you pretend now for political purposes that you are against trusts do you suppose anybody believes it do you suppose that you can humbug the people in regard to your position on trusts you know and i know and every other intelligent man in this country knows that the republican party is owned and controlled by the trusts the real difference between the republican party and the democratic party today on this issue is that the trusts own and control the republican party and the democratic party want the people to own and control the trusts or destroy them entirely now during the three and onehalf years you have been in power if this act of 1890 was not sufficient wasnot broad enough and strong enough to put down the trusts why did not the repubican party when they had the control of both branches of congress and the executive why did it not bring in some legislation to make that act more effective so that the republican attorneygeneral could enforce it no for three and a half years you have accepted favors from the trusts and you have protected the trusts if i had the time i would tell you something about the trusts for i know something about them i want to say now however at the eleventh hour just as congress is adjourning after you have received all the benefits from the trusts you can get after you have done all you can for the trusts you want to deceive the people and hoodwink them with this preposterous constitutional amendment you wait until six days before congress adjourns knowing this amendment can not pass and then you bring in an arbitrary rule to pass it a rule that violates every parliamentary precedent a rule that does gross injustice to the minority a rule that prevents us from offering an amendment a rule that prevents us from offering a substitute a rule that compels us to vote aye or nay on your trust deception and you have the audacity to say you are against trusts right here i want to say that i am now always have been and always will be unalterably opposed to trusts monopolies and combinations ever since i have been in congress i have been fighting trusts but if i had my way now you would not fool the peop e with this kind of cheapjohn trust politics i would not perdfit you to put the democrats in a hole but we would put you in a hole when you bring in this absurd constitutional amendment for political buncombe if i had been running this side of the house i would say let us all vote for it and let us show the country what frauds and hypocrites these republicans are we would pass it and it would go to the senate and your trust republican senators would bury it as they buried the other resolution we passed for the election of united states senators by the people why do not your trust republican senators pass that resolution and give the people the right to elect their senators the republican party is absolutely insincere on this question its record for the past four years proves it it does not want this amendment to pass it is drawn in such a way and it is oftered in such a manner that the republicans know beforehand the democrats can not consistently vote for it you offer it as you do and at this late day because you know it can not pass if you thought it could become a law you would oppose it yourselves you are trifling with the country and playing practical politics to deceive your deluded followers the people who will ook into this matter will not be fooled they know which party today favors the trusts and they know they will receive no relief until this republican trustowned and trustridden administration is driven from power and a democratic administration under the leadership of william j bryan comes into control of the government let us pause here and briefly consider the facts today about two hundred trusts control wholly or in large part every conceivable product and industry of the country these gigantic conspiracies and combinations called trusts constitute in my judgment the greatest and the gravest menace at the present time to our democratic institutions they control the supply monopolize the product and dictate the price of almost every necessary of life they force out of legitimate employment every year thousands and thousands of honest toilers they limit production enhance prices reduce wages and arbitrarily write the terms of their own contracts they destroy successful competition paralyze honest industry assassinate struggling labor and hold the consumers of our country in their monopolistic grasp they levy tribute like robber barons of old on every man woman and child in the republic they blight the poor mans home darken the hearthside of his children cloud the star of youths legitimate hope and destroy equal opportunity they control state and national legislation escape taxation and evade the just burdens of the government while their agents construct and maintain tariffs to suit their selfish ends and greedy purposes they imperil traffic stagnate trade regulate foreign and interstate commerce declare quarterly dividends oii watered stock and make fortunes every year by robbing the people their tyrannical power rapid growth and centralization of wealth is the marvel of recent times and the saddest commentary the future historian will make on our legislative history they practically own run and control the government and defy prosecution for violation of law if their power of concentration and centralization is not speedily checked and they go on for another quarter of a century like they have in the past few years i believe our free institutions will te destroyed and instead of a government of the people by the people and for the people we will have a government of the trusts by thie trusts and for the trusts how much longer will the people consent to be robbed and submissively permit a continuation of this outrage the trusts have their being and grow by special legislation they live and wax fat by governmental favoritism if the question is ever presented whether the trusts shall run the government and enslave humanity or whether the people shall own the trustsnot for the benefit of the few but for the good of all and to free the industrial massesthen i shall vote with the people in favor of government ownership of tr usts they must either be destroyed or owned and conducted by the people for the benefit of all all legislation bestowing special benefits on the few is unjust and against the masses and for the classes it has gone on until less than 8 per cent of the people own more than twothirds of all the wealth of our country it has been truly said that monarchies are destroyed by poverty and republics by wealth if the greatest republic the world has ever seen is destroyed it will fall by this vicious system of robbing the many for the benefit of the few let us pause again and briefly consider the situation the total population of the united states is about 75 000 000 the total aggregate wealth of the united states according to the best statistics that can be procured is estimated at about 65 000 000 000 and it appears and no doubt much to the surprise of many that out of a total population of 75 000 000 less than 25 000 persons in the united states own more than onehalf of the entire aggregate wealth of the land and this has all been brought about during the last twentyfive years by combinations and conspiracies called trusts fostered by special legislation and nurtured by political favoritism the centralization of wealth in the hands of the few by the robbery of the many during the past quarter of a century has been simply enormous and the facts and figures are appalling threequarters of the entire wealth of our land appears to be concentrated in the hands of a very small minority of the people and the number of persons constituting that minority grows smaller and smaller every year impartial students of these startling facts and statistics can hardly escape the irresistible conclusion that a conspiracy exists and has existed for some time to convert the government of the united states into a powerful oligarchy of wealth consisting of a few thousand multimillionaires who will own and control all the other people the plutocrats the trusts the monopolies and the syndicates seem to be supreme and legislate for their own interests their own benelit and their own protection if it continues the yeomanry of our country will soon be reduced to a condition of industrial serfdom more pitiable than ever existed before in the history of the world the money power the trusts and the favored few of the land threaten the perpetuity of our free institutions by subsidizing the pulpit buying the press seating wellpaid attorneys in legislative halls and courts of justice stifling free speech and the right of lawful assembly and stretching out their tentacles to the colleges of the land to crush professors who have the courage of their convictions and dare to tell the truth regarding economic and social principles the trusts must go should be the battle cry of the people in the coming campaign what is the remedy my friends i hear many suggestionssome good some bad but let me ask what is the matter with the remedy we now havethe remedy of the antitrust act of 1890 whenever that remely has been applied it has been effective whenever we have had an official courageous enough to invoke the power of that act it has been adequate and successful to crush the trust the people who oppose and condemn trusts will receive no encouragementfrom this trustridden and trustowned administration the republican attorneygeneral is the mere creature of the trusts and will take no action against them the republican partyin all its power stands fearlessly for trusts and is openly and boldly supported by trusts every trust in the country was for william mckinley for president in 1896 and every trust will zealously and loyally aidhim in 1900 if you ask what for i answer for value received for the blessing of a pliable secretary of the treasury and a derelict attorneygeneral for a lively sense of favors yet to come and above all and beyond all for mark hanna who runs the republican machine for the benefit of the trusts and who turned down in ohio an honest and fearless attorneygeneral who was brave enough to do his duty and courageous enough to make an attempt to enforce the law against the standard oil trustthe greatest the most relentless and the most coldblooded monopoly of them all the republican party is the party of plutocracy it stands today for economic errors that rob the many for the benefit of the few for financial heresies that centralize wealth and paralyze industrial freedom for political policies that enslave the masses the republican party spurns the people rides roughshod over the constitution tramples on the rights of man turns to the wall the picture of the great emancipator and laughs to scorn the declaration of independence to sum it all up the republican party stands for hanna and the republican party is hanna what a difference between the party of lincoln and the party of hanna the democratic party is the party of the plain people it is opposed to trusts to monopolies and to special privileges it stands for the supremacy of the law it helievea in freedom of thought freedom of speech freedom of action freedom of trade and free institutions it believes in the constitution in fostering commerce unfettering trade establishing industry aiding enterp rise maintaining equal opportunity defending liberty unshacking the mind and the conscience and handing down unimpaired to future generations the blessings of our free institutions while the republican party is in power the trusts will flourish like a green bay tree when the democratic party comes into power a democratic president will appoint a democratic attorneygeneral who will enforce the law against the trusts and they will dissolve and disapr ear like mist before the rising morning sun and be gone forever now my friends a few words in conclusion we are entering a most momentous political campaign to determine the question whether the trusts or the government shall survive whether the people or the plutocrats shall rule whether this land shall continue to be a government of the many for the many or an oligarchy of the privileged and for the favored few you ask me what the outcome will be i can not tell but i believe history repeats itself that god in his infinite wisdom raises up a man from the plain people for every crisis and in the pending crisis we have such a man a born leader of men whom we can all trust and whom we can all follow and who will lead us to victory and rescue the people from the money lenders and the money changers a hundred years ago the democratic partythe party of the plain peopleafter a most momentous campaign came into power under the matchless leadership of its famous founder thomas jefferson and the impetus his administration gave to popular government carried forward free institutions unimpaired for a century we are beginning another momentous campaign under the leadership of a second thomas jeffersonthe stalwart the fearless the gallant and the intrepid young leader of nebraska william j bryanto test the perpetuity of popular government and of our free institutions and by the grace of god and the powerof the free men of america he will win and the impetus his administration will give the government of

afternoon my judgment differing as it does from that of chairman of the naval committee is that the minority of that committee is justly entitled in conjunction with the senate to the credit of the reduction in the price which the government pays for its armor plate below the price formerly paid the government now buys it for 90 per ton less than it paid for it twelve months ago as i understand it is well known to this house that when the naval committee of this body presented the last naval appropriation bill that bill had no reference to an armorplate factory and it is also well known that the minority members of the committeethose of us who signed the views of the minority filed with that billhad contended for such a provision to be incorporated in the bill unless the price of armor plate was reduced the chairman of the naval commi tee and every other gentleman on the committee must remember that the minority members contended for such a provision but the majority refused to incorporate it in the bill being defeated in the committee we brought the fight into the house we fought it as best we could and if we had had the assistance of the gentleman from illinois and his friends we might have succeeded in incorporating it into the bill before it left the house but we had it not and the bill left the house without any provision such as we had contended for it went to the senate and that body placed in the bill a provision similar to the one that we had advocated here i take the liberty of reading from the remarks which were made by me in the house in the presence of members of this committee on may 29 of last year and which went undisputed because in every word they were correct i for one am in favor of erecting a government armorplate factory not because i believe in the government going into such businesses for i do not believe in it i believe in the democratic doctrine of buying what the government needs from private concerns providing the government can buy from private concerns at fair prices but rather than be held up by the throat by these armorplate factories and compelled to pay their exorbitant prices i favor the governments undertaking to make her own armor plate every member upon this side of the house who agrees with me in this matter believes in buying the plate from private factories if it can be bought at a reasonable price every one of us believes in buying the best armor and every one of us believes in putting to sea the best ships there is no dispute in the committee on these questions the only question is whether we shall continue to pay 545 per ton as these armorplate factories demand or whether we shall undertake to get our armor plate at something like 300 per ton by the government building its factory further but the senate has amended this bill by uroviding for an armorplate factory and when that is done the gentleman from west virginia here today tells us the secretary of the navy has received from the armorplate factories a letter with which thre e e acquainted in which the factories indicate their willingness to reduce the price but how much he says not tot express to the aval committee of the house they did not express their willingness to give us a reduction on the great amount of armor that we are to buy until after the senate had shown a determination to put the provision in the bill for an armorplate factory a provision that we had contended for in the house when the question reached that stage this house under the leadership of the chairman of the naval committee wheeled into line for a provision for an armorplate factory under certain circumstances now why did the minority members oppose the proposition as it finally passed it was not because oe the effort to reduce the price of the armor plate reduction in the price of armor plate had been the sole object of our contention the opposition to the provision as passed was shown iun the last speech which i had the honor to make on this side of the house and we based the opposition upon the ground that you were placing in the hands of the secretary of the navy a discretion to buy the armor plate at any price he might see fit to pay we believed that it was too great a power to place in the hands of any one man and that such a discretion should not be intrusted to anybody our proposition was that we should propose to pay so much for the armor plate and if we could not get it at the figure fixed by congress then that the secretary of the navy be directed to erect an armorplate factory of our own that was the difference between us and the majority at that time the great purpose of the minority was to get the armor plate at the lowest possible price and i believe i am justified in saying that if the proposition of the minority had become the law of the land we would have gotten this armor plate a great deal cheaper than even the 90 per ton reduction which i understand has been granted by the manufacturers the fight made by democratic members against the exorbitant demands of the armorplate factories in my judgment saved the government 90 a ton on every ton of armor plate used in the construction of our ships although we were defeated in our main proposition"], [0.02004706859588623, 0.9799529314041138, 1, "i have but a moment or two and i beg the gentleman not to interrupt me the

limitations of this debate it is impossible to discuss the various provisions of this bill and their probable effect upon the people with that care and intelligence which its importance to the country demands containing as it does provisions which have never been discussed in congress or before the people and coming to this house from a republican caucus without the consideration or report of any committee the members on this side of the chamber had a right to expect that the gentleman in charge of this bill would in the beginning of this discussion give a fair and clear statement of its provisions but notwithstanding that gentleman who opened the debate and participated in the formation of this bill had unlimited time by the courtesy of this house he was satisfied to close his remarks with his carefully written defense in favor of the gold standard and i insist that up to this hour here on the closing day of this debate some of the most important provisions of this bill have not even been referred to by gentlemen on the other side of this chamber it seems to be part of the republican policy in this discussion to make the people believe that beyond the first section of this bill which is to establish the gold standard it is a most innocent measure and of but little consequence to the country notwithstanding the assertions made on the other side that the time has come when the goernment should be clear and explicit upon this subject this bill does contain ambiguities and uncertainties in some of its provisions but i want to assure the members of this house that those uncertainties will not be found irk that part of the bill written for the benefit of the bondholders the few lines in section 2 of this bill which transfer from the pockets of the people to the vaultsof the bondholders millions and millions of dollars without any consideration whatever are as clear and explicit as the english language can make them the first part of sbction 2 provides that all existing obligations of the government as well as those hereafter issued shall be paid in gold coin all these government bonds were issued under laws which authorized them to be paid in coinsilver as well as gold all the government bonds referred to in this bill were issued sold and purchased with the distinct understanding that they were payable not in gold alone but in coin which meant silver as well as gold and asnow remember it is so written in the face of the bond itself and i remember very distinctly that in the fiftythird congress when the president of the united states then engaged in negotiating a loan for the government sent his appeal to that congress urging its members to give the secretary of the treasury the power to issue bonds payable in gold coin claiming that such bonds could be sold for several million dollars more to the syndicate with which he was then about to deal than bonds issued under the law as it then existed it was well known to the members of that congress that the syndicate itself stated thbt they were willing to pay several million dollars more if congress would authorize a gold bond but that congress refused to authorize the issue of gold bonds i voted against the proposition myself the statement of the gentleman from ohio given as a reason why he and others voted against issuing gold bonds is no answer to the contention which i am about to make it is well known that that syndicate purchased those bonds not as gold bonds but as coin bonds and bought them for several million dollars less because they were payable in coinsilver as well as gold so have the other obligations referred to been issued sold and purchased with the understanding that they were coin obligations payable in silver as well as gold this bill converts all these coin obligations into gold obligations thereby adding millions and millions of dollars to the value of these bonds and every million that you add to the value of these government obligations is taken away from the pockets of the people thereby requiring that much more of their property and their labor to dis charge this indebtedness an unsuspecting people bbfore their own eyes today are being robbed of millions and millions of money by the acts of their representatives upon this floor this alone ought to be sufficient even in the eyes of the republicans and certainly in the eyes of a gold democrat who has always claimed to be fair between debtor and creditor to defeat this bill but that part of section 2 which follows is not so certain and i call the attention of the gentleman in charge of this bill to that portion which i am about to read and trust he may yet find time to give this house the benefit of his construction i read from section 2 at the bottom of the page and all other obligations public and private for the payment of money shall be performed in conformity with the standard established in said seotion which is the gold standard what do gentlemen mean by in conformity with the standard established in said section unless they mean that these private obligations are payable in gold coin or in its equivalent which is almost as burdensome if not quite so all these obligationsstate county railroadaid bonds notes and mortgagestoday are payable in silver as well as gold ido not overlook that which follows there is a provision afterwards which seems to have been suggested by some western republican whose eloquent words in behalf of free silver were still ringing in his ears and they had to put in the following nothing herein 6hall be construed or held to affect the legaltender quality of the silver dollar or of the subsidiary or minor coins what is a fair construction of these provisions it is this that all these private debts now payable in silver at 100 cents on the dollar shall after the passage of this bill be paid in gold coin or its equivalent and if silver is to be a legal tender under this bill it must be a legal tender at its gold value and not its coinage value now no man can tell what the effect of this bill will be upon the two dollars if a great and sudden exportation of gold or a change in the condition of our monetary system from the passage of this bill or any other cause should send gold to a premium and silver to a discount the debtor today who has a right to pay his obligations in silver at 100 cents on the dollar must pay it in gold or the equivalent of gold though it should take 125 or 150 in silver to pay 100 of his indebtedness i regret that i have not more time to dwell upon this section but there are so many mean things in this bill outside of this section that i must pass it by while it is impossible even for a republican to tell what will take place under this bill we can see after reading its provisions what may take place this bill transfers into this division of issue and redemption every silver dollar in the treasury the greenbacks the silver certificates the treasury notes and all the silver dollars including the dollars coined under the act of 1890 which after the passage of this bill will have no duty to perform in the monetary system of our government for the notes issued on aecount of them will be redeemed in gold coin under this bill the secretary of the treasury will have power to withdraw from the circulation of the country every dollar of greenbacks amounting to 346 000 000 every dollar of treasury notes under the law of 1890 amountingin round numbers to 100 000 000 every silver certificate now issued amounting to about 400 000 000 and over 800 000 000 of the currendy of the country can be locked up out of the circulation under this bill without another dollar more of gold in the country than you had in the beginning and you know it it is no answer to say that for every paper dollar that goes in a gold dollar will be paid out when the gold dollar is received to redeem the paper dollar it is taken out of circulation you must get your gold to redeem this paper currency from increased revenues or the sale of bonds and it comes out of our money in circulation in either case so you will have no more gold than you had in the beginning if you can not see contraction in this you may be able to see contraction in the republican party after the passage of this measure it is too clear for any dispute that our present volume of currency may be contracted over 800 000 000 under this bill and we ought to know from the experience of past panics what such a contraction means such an unfortunate condition will make money scarce and higher and property and wages lower it will bring such misery and distress upon the people that they will again rise in their majesty and power to condemn the party that brought upon them these great afflictions but this is not all under this bill it is possible for the secretary of the treasury to lock up in his vaults every silver dcllar by exchanging gold for it and as you may buy the same gold a dozen times to accomplish this redemption or exchange it does not follow that you will have any more gold coin in the country than you had in the beginning but if the secretary should choose the other course and decide to again pay out silver dollars received in exchange for gold coin then the silver dollar under this bill may be used to accomplish the wicked purpose of stealing gold from the treasury and forcing a new issue of bonds just as the greenback has done for years under the policy of the gold standard and i call the attention of all gold democrats to the fact that we still have this endless chain only of silver instead of paper and the statement of the gentleman from indiana that when the holder of silver had the right to exchange it for gold he would lose his desire to do so is no answer to the contention i make when they had the right to exchange greenbacks for gold they were not satisfied with the mere right but took their greenbacks to the treasury to get out gold not because they liked gold better than greenbacks but because they liked bonds better than either and the same mischief may be practiced in this bill by using silver dollars instead of greenbacks i want to say to the gold democrats on this floor if you want to vote against your party and with the republicans on this measure then look only at its first section but if you desire to vote with the democratic party in this house and are hunting for good causes to do that then sirs whatever may be your opinion on silver you can find many strong and valid reasons as democrats for voting against this bill if you will only look beyond its first section the distinguished gentleman from ohio and i hope he will not consider me out of order for attempting to talk on the bill itselfthe distinguished gentleman from ohio criticizes members on this side of the chamber for endeavoring to discuss the freecoinage question and not confining themselves to the bill before the house yet i submit that from the beginning to the end of his remarks he nowhere comes within cannon shot of this measure of course we on this side of the house did not expect the distinguished gentleman from ohio who is always burdened with the weighty affairs of the administration to go into a detailed discussion like other gentlemen whose burdens are less onerous on this floor the gentleman from ohio criticises us for discussing free coinage and the chicago platform and the gentleman from minnesota criticises the members on this side of the house for not indorsing the chicago platform every time they get an opportunity there is just this difference between a democrat and a republican a republican is subject to such frequent changes on the money question it is important that he should express his opinion not only at every session of congress but between times as often as possible in order that his people may know where he stands while a democrat has honest convictions and is not turned from them by every change of the wind it was only in february 1891 at toledo ohio that president mckinley in criticising expresident clevelands opposition to silver said during all these years at the head of the government he was dishonoring one of our precious metals one of our own great products discrediting silver and enhancing the price of gold he endeavored even before his inauguration to office to stop the coinage of silver dollars and afterwards and to the end of his administration persistently used his power to that end he was determined to contract the circulating medium and demonetize one of the terms of commerce limit the volume of money among the people make money scarce and therefore dear he would have increased the value of money and decreased the value of everything elsemoney the master and everything else the servant he was not thinking of the poor then he had left their side he was not standing forth in their defense cheap coats cheap labor and dear money the sponsor and promoter of these professing to stand guard over the poor and lowly was there ever more glaring inconsistency or reckless assumption he believes that poverty is a blessingto be promoted and encouraged and that a shrinkage in the value of everythingbut money is a national benediction behold this great republican champion of the silver dollar as then parading in sheeps clothing but see him now in the true livery of the wolf following as closely as a child ever followed its mother in what he now considers the golden footsteps of mr cleveland let this benedict arnold in finance forever stand convicted by his own eloquent and forcible words in order that this severe indictment presented by mr mckinley against mr cleveland for trying to demonetize silver may be adapted to present men and present conditions let it be amended by striking out the name of the old defendant grover cleveland and inserting the name of the new defendant william mckinley and by striking out the name of the old prosecutor william mckinley and inserting the name of the new prosecutor william j bryan then your honor we are ready for trial if i had time i would be glad to express my convictions in favor of the free and unlimited coinage of both gold and silver at the ratio of 16 to 1 and emphasize the fact if possible that i am stronger for that proposition today than ever before but sir you can not deceive the country this is not a contest against the free coinage of silver it is a contest in favor of national banks against the greenbacks the treasury notes all the paper currency of the government and every silver dollar now in circulation over 500 000 000 silver dollars already coined defended by mckinley the first and destroyed by mckinley the second why this reckless assault upon all our money of the country except the gold and bank notes does it not show that one of the main purposes of this bill is to take away from the peoples government the right and power to coin money and issue currency and turn it over to the national banks sir as a representative of the people upon this floor i am unwilling to assist in turning this high function of government over to these money changers i am unwilling to make the people of this country dependent upon the sweet will and selfish interests of these banking corporations for a sufficient volume of money with which to transact their business it is undemocratic it is unrepublican it is unamerican in principle once this great power is completely in the hands of these corporations and it will be much harder for the people to regain it then than to retain it now you give to these selfish corporations the great and dangerous power to make the peoples money and by uniting with other great trusts and combinations to carry out their own purposes they will soon be making congressmen senators and presidents and i am not sure they could do much worse in making presidents than the people have for the last few years the republicans are encouraged to retire the greenbacks and destroy all our silver dollars at this time by the increased volume of gold coin now in the united states what has brought about this increase of gold and with it an increase of prices it is due in part to the large increase in the annual output of gold for the last few years and to the large importation of gold caused by a large balance of trade in favor of the united states but what assurance have we that such conditions will continue who can look into the secret chambers of the earth and say that this large production of gold will continue our experience with new gold discoveries in the past proves just to the contrary and what assurance have we that the large balance of trade in favor of the united states will continue this is due more to short crops in other countries and abundant crops in our own than any other cause what right have we to expect that the almighty will continue to send his famines upon other nations and his blessings of bounty upon ours the republicans in this discussion have had much to say about our large volume of gold and the present prosperity of the country no one rejoices more than myself to see the people prosperous under any and every administration but whatever of prosperity we do enjoy at this time is due largely to conditions over which the republican party had no control they will hardly claim credit for the worlds large increase in the annual production of gold or for our abundant crops which have done so much to increase our balance of trade and our importations of gold from other countries it is true that the republican tariff laws have created trusts all over the country and by their selfish combinations they have greatly advanced the prices of many manufactured articles but if the country enjoys any genuine prosperity it has come not on account of the legislation or administration of the republican party but in spite of them conditions caused by the present and recent wars have also had their effect upon prices but the fact that we have an increase in our volume of gold and with it an increase of prices only proves that which the advocates of free coinage have always claimedthat an increase in the volume of money would give us better prices and better times and whether that increase comes from gold or silver coin makes no difference but our present prices do not depend upon our gold alone but all our silver dollars and government currency are assisting gold in the various channels of trade now if under the provisions of this bill all our silver dollars our greenbacks and other currency should be withdrawn from circulation will this not at once so increase the demand for gold as to greatly increase its value and reduce the value of everything else even if our present supply of gold should remain with us but we have no right to assume that our present supply of gold will continue for any great length of time the production of gold at the mines is always uncertain our large balance of trade may under a wise providence and in spite of president mckinley be turned against us and whether this should occur or not we must remember other great countries are scrambling for gold to maintain the gold standard and conditions are liable to arise at any time in some of these goldstandard nations to suddenly increase the demand for gold and cause much of our own supply to disappear in fact we are threatened with such conditions now gold is no respecter of persons or nations and will go in the future as it has in the past to the highest bidder our gold does not belong to the goveriiment but to its private holders and they will permit it to leave us whenever it is to their interest though it should produce a panic in our own country so we may have plenty of gold today and tomorrow it may take the wings of the wind and fly to the uttermost parts of the world and if conditions should arise that would take from us our gold and leave us with the standard only how much better to have silver dollars than no dollars at all it is this uncertainty which makes it unsafe to depend upon gold alone as our primary money and calls for both metals in our coinage system and our currency of whatever kind or volume is certainly safer and sounder when based upon both metals for its redemption than it is based on one alone which is liable to be diminished at any time by causes over which we have no control again the passage of this bill certainly destroys all hope of bimetallism by international agreement and international bimetallism must be entombed in that great cemetery already filled with the broken promises of the republican party but there will be at least one virtue in the passage of this measure it will prove to the country what hypocrites the republican leaders were in 1896 when they pretended to favor bimetallismsilver coin as well as goldin order to secure the votes of thousands and thousands of good silver republicans in the west and south who really believed that their party was acting in good faith and trying to bring about bimetallism this bill will certainly be a disappointment to many of the men who have helped to place you in power i am sorry that such an odious measure was ever prepared for the consideration of congress but if it had to be prepared how becoming in its authors to go just as far east as po sible for its creation how becoming it was that this republican committee should assemble just as near the feet of the british crown as the eastern coast of our republic would permit in order that they might receive not only the advice of the bondholders of new england but of the agents of the money lords of old england as well some of the provisions of this bill exhibit all that selfish greed that characterizes the vital force in republican politics to day it is full of burdens to the debtor classes of this country and outght to be defeated but sir there is this consolation to this side of the house and to the country if this bill is not beaten it will beat the republican party and make william j bryan president in 1900"],

gentleman from massachusetts has done is to talk all or nearly all of the republican members off the floor of the house and yet i presume that was not particularly his fault the gentleman unquestionably has done the best he could with the record he had and with the case presented he talked fiftyfive minutes about generalities and then he said i am now going to talk about something that has to do with the case the right of a free ballot a fair count and to have the result correctly certified were among the most important principles for which the american revolution of 1776 was fought the perpetuity of our bepublic largely depends on the fidelity with which these principles are maintained every state in the union has guarded these sacred principles by the enactment of laws that make it a felony for any elector to sell his vote because in doing so his misconduct affects the right of a free ballot the most sacred privilege granted a free people if the individual elector is a felon because he casts a vicious ballot what is the attitude of a member of this house who by his vote thwarts the will of the majority of a congressional district and overturns the certificate of the proper and duly chosen officers and gives a seat in the great american congress to one who has not been elected 1 am not the keeper of any mans conscience save my own but feel constrained to say that where much is given much is expected and the misconduct of the member who interferes by his vote and changes the will of the electors of a congressional district has committed a greater crime in the sight of all true americans than the elector who only corrupted his own ballot i desire to follow this extraordinary statement which conveys a very strong insinuation with the statement that no member can vote for this majority report without voting to change the will of the voters of the ninth congressional district of north carolina in making this statement i do not mean to offend or attack the integrity of the gentlemen who signed the majority report and mr speaker and gentlemen on the right if i were to make that assertion on any other subject than that of politics instead of members being off in the cloakrooms away from the sound of my voice you would all be here looking me in the face and saying do you mean what you have said if you mean it you have either offended me as a representative or else what you have said is not true i have not meant to do the first and i am ready to prove if i may not to you as members of the housei am ready to put into the record the proof to the country that the latter charge is true i make this statement in order that i may challenge the attention of the house to the discussion of the merits of this contest without assuming any superiority on my part but attributing everything to the weakness of contestants case i promise that this discussion shall demonstrate the frailty of contestants cause and the merits of contestees contention and his right to retain the seat i feel like i may demand and expect of this house a fair and judicial determination of this contention for i know the fairness of the members the contestee is in a position to challenge the sense of justice of the other side of this house he was a member of the fiftysecond congress and many members will remember the contestedelection case of rockwell vs noyes in which the contestee arose above the party whip and voted against his party the vote is 35383541 the contestee was also a member of the fiftythird session of congress and the same thing occurred see congressional record of that session page 8455 in the contestedelection case of english vs hilborn may he not expect a fair and impartial hearing of his case at your handsyou who so applauded him when according to the dictates of his judgment and conscience he voted against his party brethren in his behalf i beg of youdare to be just firm to your word and faithful to your trust is it too much to ask and expect of the great american congress let justice be done though the heavens fall let us examine this case in detail not as partisans but as fair and impartial triers the gentleman from massachusetts who has just closed the argument adverts to something that occurred down in the committeeroom i do not remember it as he stated it in fact i remember it entirely the opposite but what are we to try this case upon are we totry it upon the record uponthe sworn testimony or are we to try it upon the fact that the gentleman from massachusetts remembers that a lawyer in the committee room said one thing and the gentleman from indiana remembers it another way or are you to try it because a gentleman who was arguing the case on the one side in the committee room made a mistake and stated what he did not mean to state and then took it back as the gentleman from massachusetts states or put it stronger if you will say that he did not know what the law is and stated that it was mandatory and did it knowingly and purposely will you therefore say the law is a mandatory statute or will you look to the authorities and determine the question as to whether or not it is a mandatory statute i will undertake without claiming any ability to myself but at tributing everything to the weakness of the case of the contestant show you the contestant has no ground upon which to stand i will say now to the gentleman from alassachusetts and any other gentlemen on the floor on the other side of this house if 1 state any proposition so that it is not understood i want you to ask any questions about this record from the start to the finish it will not confuse or disturb me it is the truth we have the right to look after and if any of you think i have misstated the record i have the record at my left the pages marked and it will not disturb me and we will get an honest investigation and an honest inquiry into this case in gods name hasthe time come in the great house of representatives that i may not do it the house of representatives who frequently do not read the reports at all who do not listen to the discussion who vote simply because he happened to be the party nominee to which you or i belong i thank fortune i have been without any such temptation being with the minority i have been contending for the sitting member i have presided over courts and have always thought i could rise above some such action i want to say too and gentlemen of the house i loo k forward with great pleasure to the next session when i think the shoe will be on the other foot and i do not question that many of you gentlemen probably the most of you will be here the next session i want to say to you and to the gentleman from massachusetts and the gentleman from michigan the chairman of this committee you may hold me to the proposition that i now make when 1 take the oath again that i will support the constitution of the united states and faithfully execute the laws i will try to do it in contestedelection cases as honestly and as conscientiously as in any other duty called on to perform that maybe sentiment but if the purity of the ballot box is the issue if an honest election is at issue if my democratic brethren down south have carried on an election as charged in this case and corrupted the ballot box by bribery by violence by the purchase of votes and fraud i hope that i may never be so partisan that i can not see it and if upon the other hand as i believe the record in this case shows some gentleman who has had a seat on this floor and tasted the sweets undertakes to take advantange of the situation like the old thief who committed the larceny himself running down the road and crying stop thief at the other fellow i hope i may be able to determine the real thief i know when you are in the minority gentlemen you will then be willing to reason about this class of cases better than now it is not regarded as a republican district the democrats carried itin 1884 1886 1890 1892 and 1898 the republicans carried it in 1888 the fusionists in 1894 the republicans in 1896 the contestant did not have the united support of the

not nominated as the choice of his party every candidate that aspired to the noinination was given a place in the employment of the government and left mr pearscn without any opposition to the nomination but his nomination created great dissatisfaction many prominent republicans openly opposed him and very few of them warmly espoused his cause he had been a gold man and a silver man and a gold man again he had been a republican a democrat and an independent and a republican again he had made bitter speeches on all sides of questions that were before the people and was looked upon as a political adventurer who had been honored enough by the republican party a large per cent of the republicans hoped for his defeat q what have you to say about opposition growing out of postoffice appointments in buncombe county andthe failure to answer letters of his constituents a there was a great deal of talk and complaint about his fail ure to answer letters and his appointments to postoffices aroused considerable opposition to him 1 understand that at skyland postoffice there was so niu6h opposition to his appointee that it was impossible for them to rent a house for the office and office had to be kept in a covered wagon atarden the opposition to his ap ointee was equally as bitter there was also considerable dissatisfaction aout the asheville postoffice in clay county w s

congress in your opinion and that mr pearsons defeat was due to the fact that a number of leading republicans in the ninth district wanted him shelved a no sir i did not say it anywhere i have said time and again that in my opinion mr pearson was too big a man for the republican party and that others who would like to have been the recipient of his nomination intended to elect him by as small a majority as possible in order that he might be shelved that in so doing they had evidently miscalculated the intentions of such men as old man roberts hunt and the like and thereby caused his defeat w

consent of both our people and the people of puerto rico it has become a part of the united states if it is not fully now a part of the united states it certainly must become so if congress legislates with reference to it this being the status of puerto rico it would be clearly unconstitutional to pass this bill as the congress has no power under the constitution to lay and collect duties imposts

other constitutional right which the people of that island enjoy under the constitution such as citizenship trial by jury and all other rights affecting their person and property such exercise of power would be imperialism in its most radical form and therefore would practically overthrow and destroy the constitution and vest arbitrarily all power concerning all the territories and their

certain people that american naturalized citizens and especially those of german birth indorse the administrations policy of imperialism i may be pardoned to deny this statement let it be remembered that the love of liberty and local selfgovernment is not only implanted and inborn in every german heart but is interwoven in his history and embedded deep in his character and his race that his ancestorsnot onlyrepelledroman aggression under arminius and destroyed the legions of varus in the teuteburgerwald but that they carried the germs of civil liberty from saxony to albion that they not only stood sponsors at the birth of trial by jury and representative government but have ever defended them on the battlefield and in legislative councils at home and abroad not only are they lovers of personal liberty but of civil liberty as well and wherever the german has gone he has carried with him his love for freedom for free speech and for religious tolerance and his devotion to local selfgovernment while he is a good and loyal soldier in the fatherland as well as in his adopted country he is not an admirer of militarism or imperialism but devoted rather to the arts of peace and orderly constitutional government more especially is this so with the great majority who emigrated to the united states their motive in leaving the old country was largely due to the desire to enjoy greater freedom in this great republic and to cast their fortunes with those who are here engaged in the upbuilding and maintaining of free institutions for themselves and their posterity how natural then that they should oppose the present policy of militarism and imperialism in this country identified as they are with our principles of constitutional government they are especially zealous in perpetuating them both on account of their historical antecedents as well as from political choice and the idea of subjugating foreign peoples at the risk of overthrowing constitutional liberty is utterly repulsive to them nearly every german newspaper in the united states is antiimperialistic and directly opposed to the permanent retention of the philippines or governing their people as a colonial dependency and the establishment of a large standing army i believe i can safely say that the thousands of american citizens of german birth in texas and those throughout the united states are thoroughly opposed to this new doctrine of the administration and that the foremost leader among them the hon carl schurz is outspoken in his opposition against this strange and unamerican policy many who supported mr mckinley in the last presidential election will not do so again but if i read the sign of the times aright will cast their votes for democracy and constitutional government in the coming presidential election the present bill if it becomes a law is the entering wedge to imperialism because it destroys and overthrows constitutional government and leads to absolutism whatever maybe its results it is the beginning of the end to republican institutions whatever you may call the government it will establish you may retain the name of the republic but you will have an empire in fact and therefore i want to protest against its passage on behalf of democracy of constitutional liberty and in the name of the many thousands of germanspeaking americans who love their country and who are unwilling to indorse imperialism a colonial policy angloamerican alliance or the alliance of the united states with any foreign country on earth"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.9456861466169357,

revenue by that bill to pay the expenses in puerto rico he said we would raise about 2 000 000 in revenue and he said that amount was needed he said the proposition of gentlemen on this side would result in a tax on the treasury of the united states to that amount and an appropriation to that amount would have to be made out of our treasury and he was opposed to it today by his own confession in his amended bill he admits there will be a deficit of 750 000 to be followed by an appropriation from the united states treasury to run the government in puerto rico now let us go further the whole proposition has been presented on the question of revenue what do we find we find that the people in puerto rico are willing to raise more revenue than is necessary to pay all the expenses there by the estimate submitted including appropriations for schools colleges and roads and internal improvements the total is about 2 000 000 how do the people of puerto rico say they are willing to have that sum raised by extending the customs laws and the internalrevenue taxes there they manufacture one million and a half gallons of rum there every year the tax upon that under our laws by extending our internalrevenue taxes there would amount to a million and a half dollars a year at least they consume in puerto rico a million pounds of tobacco every year made into cigars and cigarettes put the internalrevenue taxes on that and that would amount to a million dollars a year that would make two million and a half dollars of revenue raised simply by extending our internalrevenue laws there500
