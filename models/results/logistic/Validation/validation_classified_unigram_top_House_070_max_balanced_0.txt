cotton i am sorry we do not have a protective tariff on cotton because the story can not be told with quite so much pleasure and satisfaction but yet it is pretty good in 1922 the index of cotton was 168 and but one month in that whole period of time with no tariff whatsoever and that the month of october 1920 when the index upon cotton was not higher than it was in 1922 in october of 1927 it was 169 now to sum it all up my good friends i trust that the logic the cold logic of these figures that are impersonal and have nothing of a political flavor in them whatsoever may speak the cold hard

united states in 1922 the index was 176 and in october of last year that index had decreased to 151 in other words the purchasing power of the farmers dollar had been improved and 14 is the percentage of decrease in the price of the products which he has to buy putting it now in a final word and in the terms that the farmer himself usually uses his commodity dollarin other words the amount of his commodities that he would have to exchange for commodities of other kinds that he buys according to the old plan of trade and barterhis commodity dollar was a 70cent dollar in october 1922 and in october last it was a 92cent dollar or an increase in the relative purchasing power of the farmers commodity of 32 per cent since 1922 my friends this is the whole story molded in cold impersonal

and just because we may at some time be semiprepared partially prepared it is said we will not wish to fight other countries we have never fought for any save a just cause we have never sought to acquire other lands through war we have no predatory designs upon other countries i have seen too much since 1917 of the horrors and ravages of war not to want this country the youth of this country the older men and women of this country to be prepared to defend themselves in every possible way in my opinion if we had been prepared at the time of the world war if we had been prepared at the time of the sinking of the lisitania we would have entered that world war earlier and thereby saved untold suffering it is my opinion that russia would have remained with the allies and that the war would have ended much sooner than it did and we would have saved millions of lives and millions of dollars life is very dear to the people who are left behind life is very necessary often in value to the country in 1917 while abroad talking with members of the french and british missions and the members of the foreign commissions sent to this country as to what lack of preparedness meant to the allies i learned how very near complete disaster came i know that they felt the fear of complete disaster because they could not produce rapidly enough the machinery of war and they needed more men a canadian officer said that when he saw our first men at fort myer preparing to go across to win the war for the world tears of gratitude streamed down his face believing in our strength and power to save the allies i can not bear to think that this country is not intelligent enough to maintain preparedness i know my pacifist friends are just as desirous of peace as i am and just as sincere ill their convictions only we do not agree as to the way by which we can maintain peace i am afraid to think that we are not as well prepared as we should be in ships and munitions i want to make a silttement to show how long it takes a manufacturing plant to make certain things necessary in making munitions and in making the other machinery of war"], [0.0012192130088806152, 0.5012192130088806,
