for the first 6 months of 1954 but people in my district do not accept the administration philosophy they do not believe that what is good for general motors is necessarily good for the nation in fact a general motors contract caused very serious unemployment and distress in my district when a tank contract was shifted to gm the prosperity now being enjoyed by big monopolies is of little comfort to the millions of workers and their families who must live on inadequate unemployment insurance benefits it means much less to those whose unemployment insurance checks are running out tax advantages voted by this administration to monopoly interests have permitted increased profits to empires like du pont general electric and general motors despite reduced sales yet the eisenhower leadership has refused to make adequate improvements in unemployment insurance benefits or to aid the average citizen with tax relief or a public works program the rush by this administration to give to the special

republican administration when it assumed the solemn responsibility of guiding this great and powerful nation on january 20 1953 president eisenhower and the republican party were looked to for vigorous and creative leadership what a disappointment we all have suffered as we look around us at the end of the 83d congress we see that the grand hopes of our people and of friendly peoples in foreign lands have been crushed on the bitter walls of disillusionment we witness confusion instead of confidence we see dismay and uncertainty instead of pride and courage in the 20 months since the eisenhower administration and the republican party c 975 took over we have seen our country undergo an amazing transition we have seen our government lose prestige and power throughout the world we have seen our influence as a leading nation diminish and here at home we have seen great segments of our economy struck down if there is one word in the english language that would properly describe this republican administration it is the word inept for my colleagues this administration has bungled our foreign relations through an ineptness that astounds those of us who even though in the minority in congress want to protect this great government want it to occupy the same eminence it should occupy in world affairs and want it to survive above all else but the sad fact before us is this since the eisenhower administration took over this government has not won a battle on a foreign diplomatic front on domestic issues the eisenhower administration has exhibited an ineptness in considering what is best for all the people an ineptness magnified by its desire and programs to benefit selected groups groups of tremendous wealth and privilege groups that ignore the increased power of the masses of working men and women and the millions of farmers who provide the food and fiber which create the basic wealth of this nation if i were addicted to making predictions i would say that if the eisenhower administration and the republican party continue on the course they have adopted the reaction of the people of this country will be dangerous this socalled eisenhower business administration and republican congress have proved by their programs and actions that they are strictly for big business the measures they have espoused and enacted which could be classified as of benefit to the people are merely extensions or modifications and expansions of policies and laws which originated in previous democratic administrations i refer to housing reciprocal trade social security mutual aidall of which were initiated by democrats and all of which were once denounced and fought by republicans the voters of this country cannot be fooled forever they know the republicans realized that they would have to have something to use in their political campaigns that they would have to have some bait to try to attract voters so they can stay in power the people also know by now however that the eisenhower administration and the republican congress have done a big joba big job on the farmer the consumer the laborer and the family with a small income the administration and the republican congress have driven down prices for farm products and have driven up prices for the consumer they gave bigmoneyed people handsome tax advantages over the people who earn their income by toil and all this my friends is what our republican colleagues hail as stabilized economy we democrats do not want a stabilized economy for this country we democrats want a thriving and growing economy for this country a stabilized economy is easily recognized as the old republican squeeze playsqueeze the little fellow and make the big fellow bigger it is a visea vise to get the last dollar from the consumer and to pay the least dollar to the farmer and worker if the republican congress and the eisenhower administration had paid as much attention to the problems confronting the nations future security as they have paid to their program to reduce the american farmer to the state of hooveradvocated peasantry and to their program to reduce labor to the impotent state of hoover poverty we would feel safer in our position in world affairs yes my friends it is a sad fact that many good people voted for a change in 1952 and it is a sadder fact that many of them have gotten a change with a vengeance when the republican candidate for president and republican orators went all over the country in the fall of 1952 they denounced the trumanacheson foreign policy they ate up the agreements of yalta potsdam and teheran blood raw every morning for breakfast since coming into power i presume somebody in the state department read the provisions of these agreements and understood them i have heard nothing about them sincenot even a suggestion of a change in them neither do i hear the republicans repeating their campaign calls for a change in the trumanacheson policy the fact is that since this republican administration came into power no attempt has been made to change the trumanacheson policy but they did make one change they administer it in a sorry fashion i am sad to say the republicans have administered it in such a blundering way that we now have fewer friends in the world than we ever had in the history of the united states yes we have witnessed a new aggressive power rise in communist countries due to republican faltering steps in our foreign relations we are now witnessing failure upon failure in asia and europe through ineptness we can see a drift away from american leadership abroad a drift of once friendly nations to the powers on the plains of asia neither the people of america nor the peoples of friendly or unfriendly nations know from the welter of conflicting statements by republicans in the executive branch and republicans in the legislative branch who is speaking for this nation on international affairs but the unfriendly nations do see clearly that in this confusion the republican leaders do not know what they are doing or where they are going and my friends the reds are taking full advantage of it this 83d republican congress ended its deliberations with a smidgen of positive legislation and with a mass of problems unsolved through ineptness and the lack of constructive ideas on what to do unfortunately for the people of this great country in a perilous period yet unequaled in our history this 83d congress will blot our record with the reputation of having worked harder and produced less original legislation than any of its predecessors the republicans hailed their legislative program as dynamic and forwardlooking it was as dynamic as the dodo as forwardlooking as yesterday it was not conceived for the benefit of the best interests of all the people but for big business and the l5rivileged people of all the major legislation enacted only five bills would fall into the category of positive law in the first session the tidelands oil and emergency refugee bills became law in the second session the st lawrence waterway the revision of the tax structure and the democratic anticommunist bills were enacted it was in the maze of socalled minor legislation that the republican party and the republican administration did most of the work for the privileged people and big business excepting of course the vast advantages granted them in the revenue revision act what about the remainder of the presidents program that became law again i say it was either extension revision or modification of basic laws enacted in previous democratic administrations without the help of the democrats who voted in the interest of the people much of this part of president eisenhowers program would have gone the way the rest of his program didthe bills he proposed which were either defeated sidetracked or ignored by the republican leaders in the position of responsibility the record shows that the republicancontrolled congress repudiated certain proposals of the partys elected leader scorned many of their and president eisenhowers bright campaign promises abandoned pronounced principles and handed their chief bitter morsels of compromises yet the republican administration and the republican press have the audacity to hail these compromises as victories as an american as leader of the democratic minority in the house i cannot take partisan comfort from this record dismal as it is distorted as it is by republican publicists and apologists who brazenly hail defeats as victories and embarrassing compromises as achievements it is to me a solemn and tragic spectacle that portends ill for our country and for our people i have now served longer in the congress of the united states than any member presently sitting in the house of representatives i do not contend that this endows me with any special wisdom it is an accident of fate which leaves me in this position of seniority after so many other of our colleagues have left this scene out of that long experience of more than 40 years however has grown the deep conviction that the continued existence of our free political institutions rests upon two bulwarks first the twoparty system second party responsibility it is with grave sense of sorrow that i say we have seen those foundations shaken and weakened and the future of our nation threatened the republican party entrusted with the reins of government at both ends of pennsylvania avenue for the first time in 20 years has demonstrated in 20 months its complete inability to govern it has revealed an ineptitude that is shocking to those of us who have devoted our lives to the service of our people excepting in its determination to advance big business over the interest of the mass of individuals the republican administration has disclosed a complete lack of unity an utter division of aims and goals it has unveiled an unparalleled vacuum of leadership it has uncovered a rash of conflicting elements and contentious views it has brought before the american people the spectacle of a republican president pleadingand often pleading in vainwith a republican congress to support his proposals it could be that since the republicans labored so long and so faithfully in the fields of the minorityhurling stones at constructive democratic measurestheir power to function as a responsible majority has atrophied it is evident whatever the cause that the republican party has spawned a generation of habitual obstructionists as varied as the fish in the seaobstructionists who are incapable of acting cohesively and constructively the gop today is not a unified political entity it is a conglomeration of splinter groups each of which considers that it and it alone should rulerule not only the party but the nation for this great democracy the situation in the republican party is pitiful the american people tell us that they are confused by the erratic gyrations of this republican congress and this republican administration well they should be deliberations of this congress have been hampered and impeded and actually stalled by constant conflicts which have raged between republican conservatives and republican progressiveswith the middleoftheroaders fighting both the republican nationalists and the republican internationalists have engaged in constant catanddog fights while the republican interventionists and republican isolationists cut each other up then we see the republican chief executive using hammer and tongs on his own forces in the gop congress to try to get what he wants the picture of the republican party strife was not painted by the democratic minority the republicans did it themselves an artist at least an amateur artist himself president eisenhower recognized the painting in a desperate and almost frantic appeal to end the freeforall republican fracas president eisenhower publicly called for more political fusion and less political fission bitter seeds of collapse have been sown by republican dissension and the fruit will be a sour crop of disintegration to me it is a dire warning that our american way of political life is endangered by a breakup of what purports to be the conservative political party under a system of two strong and unified political parties this nation has grown and prospered we democrats are alarmed over the growth of splinter parties under the republican banner over the desertion of principles of the founders of the party and the failure to follow their elected chief for we know the wisdom of the doctrine of two unified parties it has been proved in the history of other countries where splinter parties have strangled parliamentary action and their nations have been reduced to impotency as a result this is the most crucial of all times for the united states yet we find ourselves with an elected leader who does not lead because the men and women in his partys rank and file refuse to follow even though these people wear the republican insignia they ignore the discipline of party responsibility wander off on tangents and desert their party standard how can the republican leadership have the audacity to ask the voters of america to elect more irresponsibles to congress in november how can they ask the voters to compound an existing evil president eisenhower voluntarily set the standard by which the american electorate is to decide on how to vote in november on the recent date of august 4 the president announced at his press conference that the issue of the 1954 election was the enactment of a program based on the republican platform the record shows that in contrast to the republican pledges to the people in the 1952 national convention their platform is now in shambles in foreign policy the platform promised for america a dynamic initiative a course of action animated by courage selfrespect steadfastness vision purpose competence and spiritual faith what have we had for the past 20 months we have had indecision instead of initiative we have had timidity instead of courage we have had abasement instead of selfrespect retreat instead of steadfastness blindness instead of vision bungling instead of purpose and incompetence instead of competence we have witnessed a startling exhibition of evasiveness of alternate threats and withdrawals of contradictory statements from immature voices high in republican circles voices that have not quit sounding off despite repudiation by their chief executive the vice president of the united states announced one day that american ground troops were going to be sent to indochina another day the white house denied it massive retaliation was threatened against red aggressors by the secretary of state yet the reds march on and prove his words empty the president asserts we can find a means of peaceful coordination with the reds even as they gain ground and our position in the world grows graver yet almost at the same time the republican leader of the senate calls for war against red china to cap the climax of indecision and lack of determination or ideas of how to meet the situation the secretary of defense takes a new look at the latest defense new look and pronounces that it is all political and not a military matter in the midst of this whirligig came the fall of dien bien phu the surrender at geneva the abandonment of 12 million peopleonce free peoplein indochina to communist slavery and an uneasy truce dictated by the reds a truce as shaky and as unsure as the truce the chinese wrung from us in korea after all this the brave and almost forgotten words of the 1952 republican platform come to haunt us as an echo of a once great party that platform promised our nation will become again the dynamic moral and spiritual force which was the despair of the despots and the hope of the oppressed i say again if there is any one word that can fully describe this administration it is the word inept by the most recent ineptness of this administration we have not only lost face in asia but we probably have lost all asia we have lost prestige in europe where our allies are confused and confounded by the evershifting actions and statements of the republican administration threats by the secretary of state to retaliate against friendly nations have alienated the once warm friendship they held for us these nations have given evidence of wanting to go their way on independent paths and that has given aid and comfort to our enemies potential and actual and my friends what has happened to that republican platform pledge of liberation imagine the disillusionment of enslaved peoples in communistcontrolled countries when they recognize that the republicans also have failed on that one to be honest we must stamp the word failure on that flowing republican platform promise we will come to enjoy the reality of peace to speak on republican promises and republican performances is like shooting fish in a barrel take the field of foreign economic policy in which the republican administration promised trade not aid president eisenhower surely knows by now that we must encourage the free flow of international commerce that we must buy from other countries if they are to get the dollars needed to pay for goods bought from us he must know also by this time that international friendships are built upon trade and good will and not upon threats of reprisals president eisenhower did embrace the reciprocal trade policy instituted a score of years ago by a democratic administration but his republican party wedded to high protective tariffs fought him down in the first session the reciprocal trade act was extended for only 1 year with the aid of democrats who furnished more votes for it than the republican majority the president was placed in the negative position of promising his republican leaders that he would not negotiate any new trade pacts and that he would destroy the bipartisanship of the federal tariff commission by surrendering to demands to put an additional republican protectionist on the majority side only with the help of the democrats did the president succeed in getting another bare 1year extension of this act in the second session again we democrats provided more votes than did the republicans amid much ballyhooing the randall commission was created a group of businessmen and legislators to bring forth recommendations for promoting trade abroad he endorsed its recommendations for a 3year extension of the trade act with additional power for the president to reduce tariffs and for a reduction in taxes on american corporations doing business abroad on this the republican congress handed the president one of his most severe rebuffs it tossed the tax and tariff proposals out of the window on national defense the republicans slogan makers promised a new look and more boom for a buck ignoring the tense international problems in the eastern hemisphere the president and his economyminded coworkers looked at national defense from a dollar angle and not from the broad view of national safety since then the republicans have vacillated on national security as much as they have on foreign policy the secretary of defense announced the nation was going to have fewer war planes and better defense he said he was going to economize by cutting the 15495 fighting forces and that this would produce more safety for the nation how can you reconcile these statements the president went along on this program which purported to prepare for any type of war with emphasis on retaliatory atomic attacks economy was the key but safety was sidetracked by last may events in the far east disclosed the weakness of the plan the administration took a new look at the new look and since then they have been looking over old problems and new problems manpower goals destined to go down now are to go up defense spending was to decline now it is to rise the air force was to have fewer fighting wings now it is to have more fighting wings nearly as many as the truman administration said were needed universal military training is out one day in another day and denied by the white house until at least after the november elections the republican platform had pledged we will strip itour preparedness programclear oflack of coordination on national economy the republican platform said our goal is a balanced budget a reduced national debt the budget has not been balanced the national debt limit has been increased by 6 billion to 281 billion large annual deficits continue we saw the unusual situation of the republicans promising to balance the budget cut taxes stop deficit spending and reduce the national debtand then claim credit for a percent reduction in individual income taxes the democrats had provided to take effect on january 1 this year at no time after world war ii did the then president truman ever recommend deficit financing the fact is that the truman administration despite the cost of the korean conflict operated the government on a cash basis for the 8 years 1946 to 1953 inclusive cash operating income of the government exceeded operating outgo by 6 862 000 000 excepting 1949 1952 and 1953 a surplus in revenue was recorded at the outset this administration instituted a hardmoney policy it boosted the interest rate on new government securities and withdrew support from outstanding obligations certain government bonds dropped 10 percent in market value the smart operators and bankers grabbed these lowpriced securities thereby boosting their interest return the secretary of the treasury and his other hardmoney advocates soon were forced to abandon this policy and began to support the bonds through purchases president eisenhower using his influence on the federal reserve board supposedly an independent agency created by congress and on the treasury shifted to a softmoney policy to counteract the effect the hardmoney policy had on business employment and the economy as a whole the republicans wanted to avoid an economic recession since then the federal reserve system has pumped money into the economy booming certain securities on the stock market many far beyond their true earning value if such an operation had been undertaken under a democratic administration the republicans would have condemned it as inflation in the first session the republican congress dealt a defeat to the president when it rejected his plea to increase the national debt limit from 275 billion to 290 billion this session granted the administration a temporary 1year increase of 6 billion after refusing to fulfill a request for a 15 billion permanent increase the republican platform advocated an economy of full production in december 1952 the last month of the democratic administration the federal reserve boards seasonally ad justed index of industrial production stood at 133 percent of the 194749 average the accepted base of 100 percent for june of this year it was 124 percent a drop of 9 percent another promise was eclipsed by performance fewer people were working in july of this year than in the same month in the last year of the truman administration in july 1952 the number of jobless was at 1 942 000 in july 1954 the jobless numbered 3 346 000 an increase of 40 percent and the working force is increasing a million a year republicans dismiss the increased unemployment as conditions resulting from soft spots in the economy individuals without jobs or income may be soft spots for the republicans but idle workers are in a depression of their own this administration pays more attention to the manufacturers and their profits than to the condition of the workers it points with pride to profits after taxes of manufacturing corporations in 1953 described by a joint report of the federal trade commission and the securities and exchange commission as 6 percent higher than in 1952 to counteract the decline in earnings of workers and income of farmers we democrats sought to get the republican congress to increase the personal exemption on individual income taxes from 600 to 700 this would have saved the taxpayers around 2v2 billionmoney which could have been used to buy food and goods thereby stimulating business activity and more employment but the republicans defeated this effort they succeeded in winning however on a proposal to exempt from taxation a portion of income from dividends on stocks thereby giving relief to individuals on unearned incomemore relief than granted to persons who work for a living the republicans dropped the excessprofits taxes on corporations this benefited the most profitable of corporations because of the 450 000 operating in this country only about 50 000 were paying excessprofits taxes while the republicans did reduce excise taxes by 990 million they continued for a year the korean increases in excise taxes amounting to 1 077 000 000 making the socalled excisetax reduction actually an increase of 87 million the republicans sought to make those excise levies permanent but we democrats mustered enough strength to defeat that move which would have saddled the people and business with these levies forever the republicans also continued for another year the corporate tax rate of 52 percent to bring in 2 billion the peacetime rate previously was 42 percent now the republicans continue to claim credit for the 11 percent tax reduction on individual income which we democrats provided for in the 81st congress what the republicans did on this was purely negative the individual incometax payers will save 3 billions through positive action taken by the democrats yet the republicans claim they did it the republicans also allowed the socialsecurity taxes to increase from 3 to 4 percent on payrolls half to be paid by the workers and half by the employers on agriculture the republicans made big promises in the 1952 campaign at the national plowing contest in kasson when he was a candidate mr eisenhower stated that he not only favored 90 percent of parity on farm commodity prices but he favored 100 percent in the market place for 1954 but at brookings s dak later he placed no time limit on his pledge after the election president eisenhower changed his mind he went all out for secretary of agriculture bensons proposal for flexible price supports from 75 to 90 percent whenever a minimum is set on price supports it automatically becomes the maximum the eisenhower administration put full pressure on congress to adopt the flexible provision republicans were told that if they reenacted the democratic 90 percent rigid price support for the basic commodities of cotton corn wheat rice tobacco and peanuts president eisenhower would veto the bill thereby placing into effect the old aiken act passed by the republicancontrolled 80th congress this would have made the maximum price support 75 percent the republican compromise of 82 percent was adopted in view of this threat despite the fact that it was a compromise president eisenhower hailed it as a victory over the farm bloc in congress this victory over the farmers and the farm bloc in congress comes at a time when farmers are getting 20 percent less for their prdoucts than they were getting 2 years ago this means another cut of 7 2 percent to producers of the basic crops the victory was a repudiation of the presidents own campaign promises for the republican platform said we favor a farm program aimed at full parity prices for all farm products in the market place the republican party will create conditions providing for farm prosperity and stability in 20 months secretary benson accomplished an unprecedented thing they turned the town people against the farmer i think this effort to turn the townfolks against the farmer was one of the cruelest things i have ever heard of why they did it is pretty obvious they did it for political reasons and they used the false argument that governmentheld farm surpluses increase the cost of living this discreditable and demagogic tactic will rise to haunt the republican party even though they did it because they are trying to lure into the gop fold the huge vote in the vast cities across the land the republicancontrolled house committee on agriculture repudiated the false argument that stored farm surpluses increased the cost of living in a special study of the problem the committee found that while the prices the farmer receives have dropped the retail prices paid by consumers have risen out of each dollar spent by the housewife for food produced in this country the report said the farmer receives 44 cents gross or 14 cents net after paying the cost of production including gasoline fertilizer seed labor trucks tractors and other supplies thus with a heavy investment and for the labor of himself and his family the farmer gets but 14 cents of each consumers dollar a small margin the 56 cents of the consumers dollar goes to the processor the middleman and the retailer a typical example cited by the committee was wheat it reached a peak price of 2 81 a bushel in january 1948 the average price of a loaf of bread was then 13 9 cents wheat is now 1 91 a bushel and the average price of a onepound loaf of bread has increased to 17 cents who are the profiteers under the republicansbig business the great mass of consumers and the struggling farmers do not profit the republicans pledged a stabilized economy in their campaign pledges the cost of living has been constantly increasing the costs have been increased not only on food but on utility rates as well the vast power companies and the telephone companies have increased their rates the price of gasoline has raised the cost of transportation and hikes have occurred in almost all lines of services this accounts for increased earnings by certain elements of industry president eisenhower embraced the principle of the housing program initiated in previous democratic administrationsa program which has made it possible for millions of young couples to acquire homes for millions of city dwellers to move out of slums into modern healthy apartments the republican party has made promises for improved housing and slum clearance president eisenhower asked congress to authorize the construction of 140 000 units of lowcost housing but the republicans rebuffed him 75 percent of the gop members of the house voting against his recommendation the republicans cut his request down to 35 000 lowcosthousing units just onefourth of his request on the straight rollcall for the 140 000 units only 51 house republicans voted for the presidents program and 150 voted against him on the same vote 124 democrats voted for the 140 000 units while 61 voted against in other words 662 percent of the democrats voted for his proposal and 75 percent of the republicans voted against it yet the compromise on 35 000 units was hailed by administration ballyhooers as a victory for president eisenhower it seems that the republican publicists around the white house are trying to brainwash the american people to a point where one must ask when is a victory a defeat and when is a defeat a victory the answer could be in republican administration propaganda certainly the republicans cannot claim a victory for the president on his proposals they rejected first revision of the tafthartley labor act second statehood for hawaii and alaska third the trade not aid program fourth the health insurance program fifth give 18yearolds a vote sixth the internal security proposals the republicans did revise and extend the socialsecurity program instituted by the roosevelt administration in 1934 and passed by democrats despite the gop cries of socialism and radicalism when the socialsecurity proposal was brought before the house 20 years ago every republican member who voted voted to kill the measure on a motion to return it to the committee on ways and means even the revision was a compromise as compared with the request of president eisenhower who proposed to cover 10 500 000 in the oldage and survivors insurance system the republican congress slashed the coverage dealing the president another blow it did raise the monthly benefit payments in the belief that this would be politically adroit it was a strange scene in the house for us democrats to see this program espoused by reactionary republicans who had denounced the socialsecurity system as socialistic and radical in the days of roosevelt and truman the mutualsecurity program also initiated by the democrats to aid european asiatic and other countries to combat communism in the early post world war ii years was continued after the republicans cut the presidents proposal to 2 7 billion the president needed democratic assistance in both sessions to defeat the republican isolationists in the session just closed 141 democrats and only 118 republicans in the house supported mr eisenhower both the president and the republican congress displayed their opposition to public power as embodied in the tennessee valley authority and great federal projects that have brought cheap power into western regions which have since prospered the determined efforts of this administration to give away to big business electrical power developed by taxpayers money and the federal governments great timber and oil reserves and grazing lands are revealed in policy and legislation much of this has been accomplished through socalled minor bills rushed through in more or less disguised form to benefit selected groups and special interests which contribute substantially to republican campaign funds during his presidential campaign mr eisenhower pledged in tennessee to support the tennessee valley authority he later reversed himself and cited tva as creeping socialism his recent order to the tva to let its facilities be used by a new power corporation set up after he entered the white house was a shocking act not in my memory has a chief executive taken such a drastic step particularly when an established government function was involved this development has caused alarm among many people especially since the administration has committed itself to a giveaway policya policy by which private interests in many lines are acquiring projects developed at taxpayers expense for the benefit of the entire country the administration giveaway policy would have gone so far as to let business take over government patents on atomic energy which truly belong to the taxpayersthe taxpayers who contributed 10 billion to the development of this source of limitless energy only the determined efforts of the democrats in congress prevented this policy being written into law as a part of the revised atomic energy bill the republican party is determined to take care of its own thus legislation to bolster the shipyards by authorizing modernization of old ships and the building of new merchant marine vessels unneeded while thousands of wartime and postwartime vessels rot at their hawsers has been speeded through congress in the final days of the session now let us go back for a brief review of the dynamic and forwardlooking republican program the major bills enacted were as i said before originally instituted

by this congress the tidelands and st lawrence waterway bills had been before congress for a long time and before world war ii we democrats initiated a study looking to the revision of the revenue bill but were interrupted by the emergency of the allout war in the early forties the emergency refugee bill was supplemental to previous refugee legislation enacted by the democrats after world war ii this administration said it wanted an anticommunist law but then it became apparent that the kind of law wanted by the administration was a weakaswater measure which would have slapped the communists on their wrists and told them not to be naughty boys the strong anticommunist bill finally enacted into law was initiated by the democrats and passed over administration opposition it answers effectively the republican charge that democrats are traitors to their country a falsehood of the lowest type throughout this congress the republicans have shown hostility toward veterans of our wars and legislation benefiting them they have clipped appropriations where possible and blocked measures proposed to improve the condition of the veterans throughout this congress the lack of resourcefulness of the republicans has become more and more obvious the absence of vision has become more pronounced and the negative approach to critical problems confronting the nation is glaringly

states to act favorably upon certain proposals that since have been heralded by many by the then president and the members of the democratic party as the cornerstones of the accomplishment of that time i refer particularly to the interim aid to france and italy the greekturkey aid the marshall plan those were all passed because we republicans responded without regard to politics while the house

of foreign action without regard to partisan advantage i might say that after the defeat of the 80th congress when we went back into the minority i was not called back to the white house to be consulted about any matter of foreign policy until things began to go bad in korea let me say that instead of there being rejection of democratic advice that we endeavored to keep the democratic leadership informed and have sought and received their advice this administration has gone farther i say without any fear of contradiction than any administration in history to keep the democratic side informed as to what is going on again i sayand i am not critical of the democratseveryone ought to want our foreign policy to succeed to the end that this great country of ours avoid further

protection from flood damages which are likely to occur however in the hearings the question of authorization at the present time arose and the solicitor for the department of the interior ruled a short time ago that there was no authorization for this appropriation i cannot help but disagree with the opinion of the solicitor but i have consulted with the parliamentarian and am advised that in view of the solicitors opinion the chair would be constrained to rule the amendment which i have proposed would be legislation on an appropriation bill and that such a provision in the bill would be

of the total cost which would be properly allocable to flood control the dam was constructed all of the cost was charged to the irrigators and is being paid by them the only feature of the dam which would be allocable to flood control and therefore nonreimbursable is the cost of the spillway before that was constructed the war intervened and the completion of the dam by the construction of the spillway was postponed throughout all these years it is our contention that this portion of the work having been authorized in conneotion with that reclamation project and not completed it is still authorized and appropriations may be provided therefor in this bill the statute under which the dam was constructed and under which we contend it should be constructed is the act of august 11 1939 53

that our great freedomloving republic should remember this libertyloving people now dominated by the communists permit me to briefly review lithuanian history and its gallant struggle to remain free during the middle ages lithuania whose boundaries extended from the baltic to the black sea was one of the great nations of europe later lithuania and poland were united under a common monarch and when poland was partitioned in 1795 russia occupied lithuania for 123 years lithuania remained under oppressive russian domination and any ideas of a liberal and democratic nature which had been attained under the polish union were ruthlessly suppressed by an intense policy of russification the study of the lithuanian language was prohibited and the lithuanian press was abolished however despite this bloody reign of terror the indomitable spirit of independence persisted and the growth of the underground movement in the country prepared the people for eventual freedom which came after the end of world war i it was during the german occupation that lithuania proclaimed her independence on february 16 1918 and by december 1922 she received de jure recognition by all the great powers for a period of 20 years definite progress was made in political economic and cultural fields and lithuania took her rightful place in the family of nations however independence was shortlived the nonaggression pact signed between hitler and stalin in 1939 by which those two dictators agreed on a division between them of the smaller countries of eastern europe spelled the doom of lithuanian independence the collapse of poland brought about by the german and soviet invasions was followed by soviet territorial demands upon lithuania which set into motion forces that led to her complete seizure in june 1940 almost all the leaders of the country and other patriots were either deported to russia or ruthlessly murdered the consistent and determined efforts of the lithuanian people to achieve freedom was evidenced when the germans invaded russia in june 1941 they revolted against their soviet oppressors and set up a provisional national government however a new oppressor the nazis quickly extinguished any form of independence consequently the underground now turned its efforts against nazi tyranny unfortunately the later withdrawal of the german forces wasnot to be the end of lithuanian suffering for in october of 1944 when the soviets drove the nazi invader out of the country they converted it into a soviet republic remembering the mass deportations under initial soviet rule over 80 000 lithuanians fled to the western zone of germany and the soviet secret police screened the whole population and deported all persons suspected of enmity toward the soviet regime nevertheless despite seemingly insurmountable odds the lithuanians continue to resist soviet oppression evidence presented before the house baltic committee last december indicates that the old underground organization which was so effective against the germans and russians during world war ii is still operating effectively in fact it has been estimated that more than 30 000 lithuanians have been murdered for being members or suspected members of the underground however despite these severe losses new members quickly fill the ranks one leading member of the lithuanian government in exile has stated that he dreams of the day when his country will be a free member of the united nations but until that day comes active and passive resistance will continue until the countrys liberation or the extermination of the lithuanian people in the light of such determination and devotion to freedom in the presence of such courage and love of country we can all join with president eisenhower when he voiced the present administrations feelings in a message before the baltic freedom committee congress held in new york in june he stated that the seizure of the baltic states was in violation of solemn treaty agreements and that we would maintain our steadfast policy of continuing to recognize the diplomatic representatives of the independent baltic republics and secretary of state john foster dulles when he said in a statement before a committee of the house the baltic peoples in the face of every imposition retain their will to be free and maintain their steadfast opposition to
