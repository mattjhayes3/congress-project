purchased under this act shall in fact have an epa rating in excess of 22 miles per gallon the amendment also provides for a waiver of that provision in the event that the administrator of the general services admidnistration determines it is necessary for a special mission or a special purpose the reason for the last section is because they have emergency vehicles police vehicles and other types of emergency vehicles which may not meet that particular requirement however for a normal standard passenger automobile it should in fact exceed an epa rating of 22 miles per gallon in addition to that it excepts from the vehicle provision the vehicles for the president of the united states the vice president and their families and the secret service the reason being of course that they have specialtype vehicles which would require extra protection that would not reach the limitations as required in the act i might point out that since i have started to offer this type of amendment i have been getting a lot of communications in my office about private chauffeurs and abuses of the federal exchequer people have been dropping in to my office and dropping off statements to me showing where
