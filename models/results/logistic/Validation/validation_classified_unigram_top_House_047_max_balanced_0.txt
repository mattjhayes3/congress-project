late letter reminds me of our conversation on the constitutionnlity of the power in congress to impose a lariff for the encouragement of nanufactures and of my promise to sketch the groads of the cnfident opinion i had expressed that it was among the powers vested in that body the constitution vests in congress expressly the power to lay qat collect taxes duties imposts and excises ajid the ptwer to regulate trade that the former power if not particularly expressed would have been iii eluded in the latter as one of cite objects of a general power to regulate trade is not necessarily impugned by its being so expressed examples of this sort cannot sometimes be easily avoided ant are to be seen elsewhere in the constitution thus the power to define and punish offenses against the law of nations ineuludes the power afterward particularly expresset to tmake crules concerning captures fran offending neutrals so lo a power to coin money woul doubtless include that of regulating its value had not the latter power been expressly inserted the team taxes if standing alone would certainly have included duties illposts and excises in another clause it is saiti no tax or duties shall lte laid on sexports o here the two terms are used as syonyntous snt in anotherclause nihere it is said no state shall lay alyitlpest or duties c the terms imposts and duties are synonymous pleonassms tautologies and the promiscuous use of terms and phrases differing in their shades of meaning always to be expounded with reference to the contract and under the control of the goiteral character and manifest scope of the instrument in which they are found are to be ascribed sometimes to the purpose of greater caution sometimes to the imperfections of language and sometimes to the imperfections of manhimself inthis viewof th subject it was quito natural however certainly the general power co regulate trade might include a power to impose duties on it not to onlit it in a clause enumerating the several modes of revenue authorized by the constitution in few cases could the ex majori cantela occur with more claim to respect nhor can it be inferred that a power to regulate trade does not involve a power to tax it from the distinction made in the esiginal controversy with great britain between a power to regulate trade with the colonies soda power to tax them a power to regulate tra e between different parts of the empire was confessedly necessary and was admitted to lie as far as that was the case in the britts parliament the taxing part being at the same time denied to the parliament and asserted to be necessarily inherent in the colonial legislatures as sufficient and the only safe depositories of the taxing power so didcult was it nevertheless to maintain the distinction in practice that the ingredient of revenue was occaaionally overlooked or disreartded in the british regulations as in the duty on sugar and molasses imiported into the colonies aai it was fortunate that the attempt at an internal and direct tax in the case of the stamp act produced a radical examination of the subject before a regulation of trade with a view to revenue had grown into an established authority one thing at least is certain that the main and admitted object of the parliaeaentary tegudatious of trade with the colonies was the encotragement of tianofactinres in great britain lut the present question is tnconnected with the former relations between great britain ard her colonies which were of a peculiar a complieated and in several respects of an undefined character it is a simple question under the constitution of the united states whether the power to regadate trade with foreign nations as a distinct anti substantive item in the cllmorated powers embraces the object of encouraging by duties restrictions and prohibitions the manufactrres and products of tem contry and the afimative must be inferred froni the following considerations 1 the meaning of the phrase to regulate iire nmusabesogt in the general rse of it in other words in the oiects to which the power was 5encrally underetooel to be applicable when the phrase was inserted in the constitotion 2 the power has been understood and used by all commercial and aaanfacturing nations as embracing the object of encouraging manufictures it is believed that not a single exception can be nauted 3 this has been particularly the case with great britain whose commercial vocabulary is the parent of our own a primary object of her commercial reglotions is well known to have been tie protection anti encouragement of her manufactures 4 such vwas understood to be a proper use of te power by the states most propared for manufacturing industry while retaining the power over their foreign trade such a use of the power by congress accords with the intention and expectation of the states in transferring the power over trade from tenselves to the government of the united states that was cmphatically the case in the east ca the more nanufacturing members of the confedlraey hear the langutge held in the convention of massachusetts by mr dawes an advocate for the constitution it was observed our manaufactures are another great subject which has received no encouragement by na tional duties on foreign muantlactures ant they never can by anyaithority in te old confederation again if we wish to encourage our own mtanufacatures to preserve our own comnerce to raise the valte of otir own lands we must give congress the power in question by mr widgery an opponent g 1 1 we hear is that the merchant and farmer will flourish and that tile leciltanic ati tradesman are to anake their fortunes directly if the contitutiot goes down the convention of massachtsetts was the only one in new england whose debates have been preserved except a portion of the convention of connecticut bet it cannot be doubted that the sentiment there expressed was common to the ether states in that quarter more especially to connecticut and ihode island the most thiclhy peopleti of all the states and htaving of course their thoughts most tnrnodto the subject of mnnufactures a like inference may be confidently spplied to nosy eaney whoso debates int convention have not been preserved l the populous and tnnlitincttring state of pennsylvania a partial account only of the dertate having been published netiiig certain is known of what passed in her convention on this point but miule evidetce mar be fouid elsewhere that regulations of trade for the encouragement of mtanuuactnres were considered as within the power to be granted to the new congress its well as within the scope of the natinsal policy of the states south of le1nasylvania the only two iii whose conventions the debates have been ptreserved are virginia and isorth carolina anti front these no adverse inferences call be drawn nor is there the slightest indicstion that either of the two states farthest south whose debates in convention if preserved tave net been made public viewed tile encouragement of manufactures as not within the general power over trade to be transferred to the government of the united states if congress has not the power it is annihilated for the nation a policy without example in any other nation and not within the reason of the solitary one in our own the example alluded to is the prohibition of a tax on exports which resuited iom the apparent inpossibility of raising in that mode a revenue frot the states proportioned to the ability to pay

demanded it is not relief to those who are burdened it is a reduction i n the wrong direction a reduction of taxes without relief to the masses of the people this legislation will be regarded by the great body of our peoplethose engaged in the development of our agricultural and the vario011 industrial interests of our country those busy workers who lay broad and deep the foundations of prosperity and whose broad shoulders bear the burdens of taxationas one more response by the republican party to the demands of the moneypower every effort miade by the democtatic side of the house to

by a solid vote from the republicanside with one or two honorable exceptions king caucus wasinvokedto bind your conscience upon this measure you there solemnly declared that no amendment wasto be permitted that no substantial relief should be given to those who need it but only the capitalists and corporations should receive consideration at your bands this fact will not escape the attention of the people and i am greatly mistaken if inany of you will not find it hard to give your constituency a satisftctory explanation when called upon as you surely will be this measure is in full accord with the legislation the republican party has given the country affecting the banking corporations and moneypower during the last twenty years the people will not fail to remember that the same power that dictates and demandsthis legislation denmandedthe exception clause in the legaltender act the result of which was a tremendous discount upon greenbacks to the great detriment and injury of the country they will remember that when the national banking system was organized their circulation was limited to 300 000 000 but the bankers came forward anl demanded unlimited circulation and the republican party willingly granted it the people will remember that the banks constituting the moneypower of the country were required to keep on deposit 25 per ceint of their circulation but they regarded that as an onerous restriction they came forward and demanded that they be relieved from it and in obedience to the demand the republican party hastened to remove the restriction to the extent of 20 per cent requiring them to keep oii deposit but 5 per cent the people will remember that the bonds were payable in the lawfil money of the united states but the gentry were fearful that they might be paid in greenbacks and they demanded that their bonds should le miade payable in coin and it was done they also demanded that their bonds should be exempt from taxation and that was granted their bonds being payable in coin could be discharged in silver as well as gold they did not like this so they secured the passage of au act demonetizing silver thus making their bonds payable only in gold thereby destroying onehalf of the money of the country and doubling the value of their bonds as well as the debt which the people must eventually pay neither will the people fail to remeumber that it was these bondholders and moneysharks whose power is so potent in securing the passage of this bill who secured the repeal of the law levying an income tax this was the only tax that directly reached the bondholder and the capitalist of the country the people will see in the light of past legislation for the special benefit of the banking interest of the country that this nmcasure is a fitting sequel to what has gone before this congress underthe lash of a republican caucus in obedience to the demands of the moneypower are by this bill to remove the last remnant of taxation upon banking institutions whereby they were compelled to contribute something toward defraying the expenses of this government and liquidating our large national debt there is scarcely a member in this house but what would be willing to remove the stamp tax on bank checks drafts orders and vouchers as well as the tax on matches but in removing these taxes which should be removed you couple it with the removal of the tax on bank capital and bahk deposits and the reduction of taxes on cigars and cigarettes as well as a reduction of the tax upon dealers and rectifiers of whisky and dealers and manufacturers of tobacco coupled with these prov lons the whole bill becomes odious in the extreme and an insult to the great mass of taxpayers in this country it is legislation for the benefit of the few and against the many it is of the same class and a fitting companion for that legislation given to the country by the republican party for the past twenty years under which has been built up the great corporations and monopolies which have robbed the people of more than two hundred million acres of the public domain and are fast absorbing the entire wealth of the land they havevirtually taken control of the government they dictate all legislation in which they are interested and as in this case they command and it is obeyed it is well for us to remember the warning words of daniel webster that great statesman and expounder of the fundamental principies of our government when he said the freest government cannot long endure where the tendency of the law is to create a rapid accumulation of property in the hands of a few and to render the masses of the people poor and dependent neither should we as legislators disregard those just and patriotic sentiments uttered by gencral jackson in his veto message of the united states bank when he said it is to be regretted that the rich and powerful too often bond the acts of government to their selfish purposes distinctions in society will always exist under every just government equality of talents of education and of wealth cannot be produced by human institutions in the full enjoyment of the gifts of h6aven and the fruits of superior industry economy and virtue every man is equally entitled to protection by law butwben the laws undertake to addto these natural and just advantages artificial distinctions to grant

my present purpose to say that it is a system of taxation under which duties are laid upon several thousand articles of imported goods including the commonest necessaries of life it is a tax levied upon all the articles which enter into general consumption and at an average rate of 42f per cent last year there were imported into this country of dutiable commodities in round numbers 463 000 000 upon that amount of imported goods this tariff imposed in rormci numbers a tax of one hundred and ninetyeight millions the percentage is easily ascertained it requires no argument no illustration to show that this immense taxation falls at last upon those who consume the imported goods thisisthe direct effect of the tariff but there are other consequences of the tariff which are still more momentous the cost of importedgoods being augmented by this direct effect of the tariff the american manufacturer can increase the price of his goods without paying the tax this is the indirect effect of the tariff and is commonly called protection the present tariff which was framed during a state of war is relatively higher now in a time of profound peace than it was at the time when war was flagrant in the country the lapse of tince the mutations of trade and other causes have reduced the price of dutiable commodities in all the countries of the world and yet the tariff rates remain the same a tax which may be reasonable at the time it is imposed becomes onerous and oppressive when the value of the property upon which it is levied has been greatly diminished now let us with these preliminary statements pause to calculate the aggregate burdens borne by the various industries of this country under the incidental operation of the tariff assuming that there is an annual cousumption of four thousand millions of domestic or american commodities a very high authority has recently estimated that onefourti of that sun or 1 000 000 000 represents the added or increased value due to the american tariff another authority equally respectable assuming that five times as much of american goods is consumed as of importedgoods reaches the same result the two hundred millions of revenue derived from the tariff multiplied by that figure producing exactly the same result without intending in any wise to cast discredit upon the accuracy of these estimates but in order to be entirely fair let us throw off twothirds of the sum and make our calculations upon that basis it results that the protected classes make for themselves by the operation of the tariff nearly 50 per cent more than the government itself does indeed well may it be said as was frankly stated by the gentleman from ohio the other day that this tariff system has become a tariff for protectionwith incidentalrevenue the doctrine has been avowed upon this floor for the first time within my knowledge for one hundred years the tariff discussion has gone on in this country ten times the tariff question has been under crucial tests and under exhaustive discussion both bythe house and senate the question has been fought upon a thousand fields in congress in the courts on the hustings everywhere by men great and small by webster clay calhoun and benton and yet never before as far as i am aware has any man dared to declare that under our constitution a tariff can be laid for protection only and under whichrevenue to the government shall arise bymere accident a tax ot for revenue is as absurd as it is unconstitutional the doctrine that congress can enact a tariff only for revenue keeping in view its influence upon our own industries has been too long settled to admit of reargumiset with me at least it is rcs adjudicata in order to exclude cheap european goods from our markets and command high prices for american products we pay annually to our protected classes over 300 000 000 and to the government less than 200 000 000 by the operation of the tariff you give annually to the beneficiaries of the tariff six times as much as you paid last year to the widows and orphans and maimed victims of the war it is a civil list unprecedented in the annals of mankind you give to the heroes who fought for the union and escaped its casualties your thanks and nothing more to the grim veterans of the tariff you give more than all government federal state county and municipal throughout this country costs the people this aggregate bounty is greater than the vast and elaborate fabric of our liberties itself cost us last year if this sum had been collected by the government it would have extinguished our public debt long ago now let us add to this calculation the incidental revenue of 200 000 000 which the government receives from the tariff and we have the grand total of taxation upon the people which no empire on earth however rich or extensive or despotic ever dared to inflict upon its subjects either in peace or in war our surplus cotton brought us from europe last year 220 000 000 our surplus wheat corn and flour brought us 230 000 000 more and yet the wholeof this vast surplus amounting to 450 000 000 would not pay the annual cost of the tariff to the american people it costs us annually twice as much as all the property of every kind in the state which i have the honor in part to represent our surplus revenue alone if maintained at the rate of last year would according to the estimate of the president in his annual message pay our entire debt in ten years if we could add to that the principal cost of the tariff we could pay that debt in less than three years i think sir it is time to calculate the value of the tariff gentlemen say that the country has prospered notwithstanding the tariff i deny the statement so far as my constituents are concorned the protected classes have undoubtedly prospered but admitting for the sake of the argument that the other classes have prospered also would it not be air o inquire how much more they wonld have prospered if these enormous burdens had been alleviated we are told that the tariff protects american labor the pretension is an iagenious effort to enlist the victims of the tariff in its support it has been exposed and exploded many times hitherto in this debate but even if it were true that the tariff fosters american labor it could not be claimed that its beneficence extends beyond the protected classes you may make employment and wages for tailors hatters and shoemakers but in order to do it you make all other laborers and other people pay more for their clothes hats and shoes in order to help one poor man you tax a hundred more and the profits go into the pockets of the manufacturer the tariff duties are so high that imports ate actually prohibited by lowering the rates we can increase the imports and thus increase the income of the tariff to the government these propositions are selfevident the statement of them is a sufficient demonstration of their truth such is the eternal fitness of things that by lessening the burdens of the people we can augment the public revenues on account of the present prohibitory dities we have had to devise the odious system of internal taxation in order to supplement our customs if we will but reduce the scale of tariff taxation we can secure ample revenue from that source alone and abolish the excise system i commend this view to my colleague who i believe supports this bill historical precedents have been cited to j ustify this system of unjust burdens the gentleman from pennsylvania in a recent issue of the international review gives us an inventory of nations ruined by free trade and as if more authority were needed if i am not mistaken the gentleman from iowa who reported this bill adds the weight of his sanction to this list of modern instances turkey ireland and india are the countries said to have been desolated by free trade from my limited study of history i had been led to believe that a succession of calamitous wars had devastated these countries the armies of england for two or three centuries under cromwell and others have marched up and down ireland destroyingthe energies and resources and freedom of a proud and gallant people leaving in their stead confiscation poverty and despair the loss of her ancient fabric of liberty probably had some influence on the condition of ireland and it is not to be forgotten that this same american tariff inflicts upon the linens and other products of that poor miserable desolated country a duty of 35 and 40 per cent let not the tariff charge its own sins upon free trade i had thought that the brave sobieski prince eugene of savoy and the hungarian chiefs had rescued europe from the domination of the turks and hurled them back demoralized andimpoverished toward the east whence they came isolated surrounded by hostile foes who would not assimilate with them or trade with them tyranny taxation and other asiatic practices completed the decadence of turkish power in europe you might as well say that free trade destroyed tyre and sidon i how the history of the world would have been changed if babylon the great nineveh and carthage and rome could havehad the genius to invent a high protective and prohibitory tariffl if i had selected in the whole range of history a single country which afforded the most conspicuous evidence and the most obvious example of a country ruined by the want of free trade i should have gone at once to india that country for over a century was governed entirely by a trading company known as the east india company a monopoly as remorseless and as withering as the american tariff that country was despoiled by restrictions by warren hastings by lord clive by war famine pestilence tyranny and taxati1 against this indictment of free trade i can prove an alibi gentlemen would have england enact against her own home industries tariffs in ireland and in india restrictions in some parts of the same empire against the other parts the same gentlemen who complain of this feature of british statesmanship would hardly consent that each of the states which compose the american union should protect its industries by a tariff of its own i beg leave also to cite a little piece of history it is none the less impressive because it relates to new england the stamp tax had been repealed upon the advice of dr franklin who represented the province of pennsylvania as a sort of embassador to the mother country he had also given his opinion to parliament that the colonies would cheerfully submit to the payment of customs duties on imports and the first tariff for america was then enacted imposing a tax on tea glass paper and a few other articles the people of boston replied by compelling the first collector of customs in this country to seek safety on a british manofwar and when the first cargoes of tea taxed by that tariff arrived in boston harbor the people of bostonmark it sirdisguised as savages went on board overpowered the crows and pitched the tea into the bay that was thefirst kuklux operation ever recordedin american history i to resist that tariff th6 thirteen colonies went to war and resorted to revolution would it be amiss for me to claim in the face of those who denounce free trade and canonize the tariff that the spirit of free trade is akin to the love of freedom and that it struck the very first blow for american independence i have been trying by a somewhat diligent study of this subject to ascertain how my constituents are benefited by a tariff for selfish considerations i observe are not entirely ignored in discussions of the tariff the millions of men white and black who work not six months but twelve months of the year who toil through the blazing heats of the southern summer and in winter still wipe the sweat from their faces the men who make the material for the clothes of all mankind material good enough for the prince and cheap enough for the peasant how are they blessed by the tariff let me speak plainly they barely make a living while they pay bounties of 20 30 and 40 per cent to prosperous manufacturers on everything which necessity and decency compel them to buy the very implements of their tireless industry ay sir even cotton goods the fibers of which their own hard hands have made can be bought far cheapeo in any other country on earth than in their own it is well that this system of taxation is maskedand disguised and like other pickpockets accomplishes its ends by stealthy indirection it was brutus sir who said i by heavrn i would coin my heart for gold and i would drop my blood for drachmas before i would wring from the hard hands of peasants their vile trash by any indirection the gentleman from ohio was kind enough the other day to allege one instance in which the producers of cotton are generously treated under this system of taxation if i did not misapprehend him he stated that cottongrowers can purchase their ties at 2 or 3 cents per pound and sell them with their cotton at 11 or 12 cents per pound even if this were true the history of the matter would show that it is a grace by omission and not by commission and i believe the gentleman himself has a bill pending in this house by which he proposes to revises away even this little estray of inadvertent exemption from taxation but thestatement of the gentleman is not plausible enough to mislead or deceive when the farmer takes his cotton to market inclosed in bagging and bound in iron ties he sells the bale in gross at so much perpound for convenience now let us resolve the matter into its elements let us suppose the farmer were to itemize the transaction and sell the net cotton and the bagging and ties on a bill of particulars the cotton would bring a hrgherprice and the bagg ng and ties would bring less than they cost or go to the rubbish heap that would be the result if the cotton was specifically tared in every transaction i hope the gentleman will reconsider his purpose to inflict upon our people an aggravation of this sacrifice why should we postpone to the next session or the vext congress the revision of the tariff the gentleman from pennsylvania in the same article to which reference has already been made says evidently speaking of the protected indust ies are not our resources superior in extent diversity and value to those of any other nation i are not that aggregation of enterprising irmmigra ts and their descendants known as the american people as ingenious industri is and thrifty as the people of any other country i i answer yes and i agree with him at least so far as the protecte i classes are concerned the beneficiaries of the tariff then are no longerwealk they are the most prosperous of all our people they have all the advantages which marvelous inventions have created they have culaved steam and educated it into a trainea artisan and coal and iron are the swarthy bondmen of accumulated capital they hav the experience of the last half century which so far as the mecha real arts are concerned is worth more to them incomparably more than all the experience of ll other ages of the world on the ot tor hand the people are overtaxed as i have shown and the public revenues are redundant there is more information on the subject of the tariff within our grasp than ever before there is still in the other branch of congress the father of the system whose name it bears and here in this hall is the honorable gentleman from pennsylvania who has himself stated that he has just been rewarded with the ambition of his life the distinction of presiding over the deliberations ofthe committee charged with the consideration of this subject there are other gentlemen here whom it would be invidious perhaps to mention in such company who have not studied this subject in vain we have the most elaborate census the country has ever had we have the most perfect system of reports and statistical information pressures can be seen the direction and force of currents can be noted at a glance we can as with a map of our commerce outspread before us trace through our wide domains and throughout the world all the phenomena of our trade for last year yesterday and today and confidently calculate the probabilities of the future this bill is a proclamation of the failure of representative government after a century of experience the purpose plainly stated is to give to the lobby the initiation ofa great reform you proposeto transfer our duty to the representatives of the tariff you might as well intrust the reformation of utah to the council of latter day saints or mongolian immigration to the six chinese companies protection is the sovereign power of taxation conferred on private individuals and this bill proposes to arm it with the still further power of legislation such greatness doth hedge a kingl con gress has been supposed to consist of senate house and lobby but if we look to the sources of political power hereafter we may describe the constituent bodies as the people and the tariff the gentleman from ohio has candidly said that he would vote to confide this review of the tariff to those who would be 1 favorable to the american system and we must needs import duty free from our enemies in england this tribunal of eaperts as a supplement to our statesmanship in the land of its birth its members once had the power to vote in cornmittees of parliament let us rehabilitate and enlarge this decaying institution let us construct an annex to the capitol i believe that word too is a foreign importation and give the tariff a parliament of its own i am in some doubt where to locate this new tribunal under our constitutional system i am not sure whetter it is to be an upper chamber to congress or whether it is to be the tail end of the cabinet i if this is to be the result of sending our statesmen abroad let us hereafter pay a little more attention than we have done to the consular and diplomatic bills this is a scheme not merely to glide over the fall elections but it is intended to perpetuate the tariff without incurring direct responsibility for its outrageous and monstrous burdens it is diplomacy injected into the body of our politics the member chosen to report and defend the hill has been most fitly selected our statesmen once preferred direct and manly methods modern politicians seek their ends through a circumlocution office we are not only asked to vacate our functions but we are asked to confer on the executive the selection of these now lawgivers of the tariff if we should reluitantly conclude that better materials for a ways and means committee can be found among the people than the speaker has been able to find on the roll of those whom the people have selected for this service shall we complete our humiliation by a surrender of our traditional and constitutional power over the revenue to the appointees of the president and the senate 9 if we are not ourselves adequate to the task to which the people have appointed ns we ought at least to reserve thepoor privilege of choosing our own counselors but we are told by the gentleman from iowa that congress consists of politicians and therefore cannot be trusted to reconstruct the tariff how much better shall we escape the influence of politicians by this bill is the white house quarantined against the politicians i arraign no individual i indict no man but i affirm that the very worst form of servility to party infects the executive department of this governaient from the bench of the highest court on earth down to a village postoffice appointments are made with unvarying subservience to party the inauguration of a president is merely the coronation of a faction invested with the external trappings of power he is merely the executor of the will of those who made and can unmake him and when it comes to a question like this unhappily political considerations are reenforced if reenforcement were needed by other influences those who are interested in the perpetuation of the tariff have grown very strong under its operations while those who seek its modification have been impoverished by it sir in all countries and in all ages of the world the poor have very little influence with power but aggregations of immense wealth in individuals companies associations monopolies banks pools and syndicates when they unite their confederated power what interest of the poor and weak can they not dominate here in congress we can in the face of the people try conclusions at every stage of public question we watch for the better reason we areaceustomed to look more at the sources of political power here the minority have some rights and in the last resort can defeat iniquity by the potency of silence hero both sides of a great issue can be heard and better heardthan in any place under the government congress can if it will the president cannot if lie would in his eloquent peroration the gentleman from iowa discounting somewhat the music of the spheres delighted all who heard him with his tribute to the sweet strains of machinery and labor imitating one of the prettiest legends of antiquity his speech was an apotheosis of the tariff and his bill provides the immortal nine who were to sing its praises the expert muses of the tariff andtheyare tobe calleda commission if the american people have not forgotten too much that word is enough when it goesdown to the grave of its ancestors and is buried under the family name let its epitaph beverbum sat the wonderful multiplication of inventions has been so rapid in this country that we may well pause and contemplate the future of labor and capital in this country the tde of immigration which now reaches our eastern shores and swelled by the young men of new england who fail to find profitable employment under the shadow of the tariff spreads over the rich plains of the west and from the wilderness rise great and prosperous states like sudden apparitions but when the area of cultivable land is covered with our expanding population and cheap homes for immigrants are no longer attainable then our dependent classes will multiply and our laborers will have to compete with the machines with which an undue development of mechanical genius has superseded american labor then we will require free access to all the world for the sale of our surplus products it would be a wise statesmanship which shall anticipate that era not now far distant and begin at once the preparation for a free commercial intercourse with all the world mr brummaddressed the committee"], [0.05755341053009033, 0.9424465894699097, 1, "we have been informed by the friends of the national banks that within the next two years three hundred and ninetythree of these institutions will cease to exist by reason of the expiration of their charters that sixtyeight millions of their circulating notes will be retired that the monetary circulation of the country will to that extent be contracted that two hundred and seventeen of these banks expire in one day and that fiftyfour millions of the muchdreaded contraction will take place in the brief period of twentyfour hours we have been told how patriotic the banks were during the war and how faithfully they stood by the country and supported its arms in its darkest hour of peril what a vast burden of taxes they have cheerfully borne since the war what small profits they have earned and what constant and faithful friends they have been to the widow and the orphan if the national banks must cease to exist they ask us where is there a house of refnge where the poor may find a safe depository for their little earnfings these are not all of the good things that stand to their credit as the account has been stated by their zealous friends but before webecome too deeply engrossed in the investigation of these statements we must solve a fundamental question that arises and confronts us at the very threshold of the inquiry i say fundamental because it relates to the foundation on which the banking system stands that foundation laid twenty years ago is now sinking and the superstructure is sinking with it when a man prepares to build a house the first thing he does is to secure a safe and permanent foundation the superstructure cannot stand when there is nothing for it to stand on here we have a great financial superstructure erected twenty years go and built upon a vast national debt that it was thought by the statesmen of that day would last like the english debt forever but the calculation of the architects has come to naught and we are paying that debt at the rate of one hundred and fifty millions a year if the interests of the people shall control the councils of the nation in a few years that debt will all be gone what do the friends of the system propose as a substitute for the foundation it will not do to say that that question is premature and that we are beginning to borrow trouble before it comes it is not premature it is trifling with the question to so evade it it confronts us today and we must grapple with it now it is first in order of time and it is first in order ofimportance four iudred and fi fty millions of the national bonds on which the banking system stands are subject to the call of the government this very hour and the government is calling them in and paying them off at the rate of from twelve to fifteen millions per month if we live to see the 1st day of july 1884 and our revenue system is permitted to stand till that time without change we may congratulate the whole country that that whole sum will be extinguished and gone two hundred and forty millions of that four hundred and fifty millions is today in the vaults of the national banks to secure their circulation and government deposits when that is done what basis is to be substituted for the banks to stand on what foundation has the gentleman from massachusetts the chairman of the committee secured to serve as a basis for his banking system surely we are not building up a system today to be torn down tomorrow will he say that the banks can buy up the bonds that maiure in 1907 and bank on them that cannot be done the premium on them is too great it is today 21 per cent and it is steadily rising last year when we were discussing the 3 per cent funding bill the preimmium on these bonds was 14 per cent these bonds will become more valuable as the other bonds are paid off and they are left alone in the market for banking and large investments every dollar of the call bonds we pay still raises the value of the 4 per cent bonds the law of supply and demand governs their price just in proportion as the supply decreases the value increases these 4 per cent bonds will probably go to 40 per cent premium will the banks give 140 000 for 100 000 of bonds upon which they could only draw 90 000 currency the investment will not pay and no one understands that fact better than the bankers the 44 percents due in 1891 are at a premium of 14 per cent and there are only two hundred and fifty millions of them what then are we to do the foundation of the system is giving way and there are only two things which can be done either we must let the system and the foundation on which it stands tumble together or we must make the foundation secure the people of this country are not going to be left without some kind of paper circulation the time is forever past in this country when its vast commercial business will be done solely on a metallic circulation that was the idea of our grandfathers when the orcart was the vehicle of exchange instead of the railroadthat was before the days of steam and electricity before the time of the telegraph and the steamengine before the time when men talked beneath the sea from due coutinent to another that was the policy that antagonized wildcat banks and shinplasters but happily for the peopie of this country knowledge is still extending its boundaries and we have learned that convenience is a thing of value the people of this country are too wise to return to a purely metallic circulation when they can have a paper circulation based on gold and silver and convertible into it at the pleasure of the holder as they will never return to a purely metallic circulation so they will never go to the other extreme of a purely paper circulation but they will have a paper dollar based on a gold and silver dollar and redeemable in it at the pleasure of the holder a paper dollar thus based is equally valuable with gold and silver and has the superior advantage of convenience now then what are we to have for the basis if we retain the national banking system we must perpetuate the debt my colleague in his terrible arraignment of the banks every word of which was true ought to have crowned the climax of his speech by reiterating the charge of general jackson that they were constantly conspirig to perpetuate a national debt upon the people he showed the motives that always impel them it is not always philanthropy nor patriotism nor is it always a sleepless devotion to the widow and the orphan they do not look to the interests of the people as we do for we are the servants of the people our interests are thc interests of our constituents the interests of the banks are directlylthe reverse their interest is to keep the debt and keep the people taxed year by year to pay its interest of forty or fifty millions for their benefit the interest of the people is to pay the debt and repeal the tax and keep their earnings in their own pockets the banking system is at war with the interests of the people it is a monopoly that lives and thrives by the spoil and plunder of the working masses the friends of the banks on both sides of the house clamor for the continuation of the debt when we oppose the system and complain of the unconscionable taxation imposed upon the people to feed it and enable it to live they rush to its rescue how they do sympathize with the people how earnestly they too desire to stop the exorbitant taxation that now oppresses the country they will stop the tax that pays and keep the tax that perpetuates the debt if we propose to take some of the tax off of food and clothing off of the coat or shirt or hat or shoes of the laboringman or off of the sugar and rice and salt he eats or the implements with which he labors and which are necessary to sustain him and his family you gentlemen in the interest of monopolies would stand uphere face to face withus and fight us to the death you are willing to take the tax off of whisky because it does not aid any of your monopolies but you show your sympathy with the poor farmers by reporting a bill increasing the price of fencingwire and cottonties in the interest of a halfdozen manufacturers inpennsylvania and ohio you are proposing to make the fencingwire so necessary to our prairie farmers cost them over 2 000 000 per year more than it does at present you are proposing to increase the price of iron cottonties so that they will cost the cottongrowers 600 000more than they do today how you do love the people the gentleman from new york his colleague the gentleman from pennsylvania and all the other side of the house are zealous friends of the banks the advocates of banks and high tariffs are confederated why do you not come out boldly and defiantly like alexander hamilton whose disciples you are and demand a strong governmentso strong that its administration will be beyond the reach of public opinion so strong that the will of the people and the peoples welfare are not to be regarded in making its laws why do yon not say at once that the government ought to be based on an aristocracy of wealth i why do you not tell the people that it is necessary that corporations constituted by the association of a few rich men should control the currency of the country and that laboring people ought to yield cheerfully to a tax of forty or fifty millions annuallyto pay interest on the debt that supportsthe banks why do you not tell them that monopolies are necessary to good government and that the masses of poor people must be content to pay the taxes and let the wealthy enjoy the fortunes accumulated from them by legislative robbery to keep up your present system of banking you must stop paying your debt and continue it from year to year and from generation to generation the people now living must bow under its burden and bequeath the curse to their children and this great wrong must be committed alone for the gratification of the greed of monopolists and moneychangers is there no other system of convertible paper money which we may adopt without keeping up a perpetual debt we have in full practice another system and in my judgment the best that any country has ever had it is the same policy on which the bank of england issues paper and that is a dollar in paper is issued on a dollar in coin in its vaults and redeemable in coin at the pleasure of the holder the bank of england issues on gold we issue on silver and we have in circulation today sixtyeight millions of paper redeemable in silver what better basis for paper circulation than that and let me tell you for i am afraid you have almost forgotten that there is alaw on our statutebooks that authorizesthe secretary ofthe treasury toissue gold certificates for gold coin and bullion why is it that we have no gold certificates in circulation as well as silver certificates because the statute on silver is mandatory and on gold it is construed by the secretary to be directory during the suspension of specie payment when thetreasury note was at a discount the secretary for the benefit of the pacific slope executed this law and we had twentyone millions of gold notes in circulation but when in november 1878 the treasury note and the gold dollar were at par the secretary the steadfast friend of the national banks saw that the great body of gold in our circulation would flow into the treasury and be exchanged for gold notes and thus drive the nationalbank notes out of existence and he suspended the execution of the law all the gold notes that came to the treasury were taken up and no more issued and they are out of existence the nationalbank notes treasury notes and silver certificates have taken their places the people will not use the metallic dollar either gold or silver when they can get a paper dollar just as good because the paper dollar is equal in value to the coin and possesses the advantage over the coin of greater convenience people in this day who use large amounts of money will not take coin if they can procure paper as good as coin a man who has to carry ten or twenty thousand dollars to some distant place to make payment will not use coin and put it on a wagon and hire a guard to go with it when he can get a bill for that amount as good as that amount in coin and putit in his vest pocket and no one know anything about it this is the reason why the people put their silver in the treasury and took silver certificates and that is the reasbn that they put gold into the treasury and took gold certificates and they would do it again today if permitted to do so if the language of section 254 of the revised statutes were so changed that the secretary was required to receive all deposits of gold coin and bullion and issue certificates for it as he is for silver the whole question of paper money would be solved the discretionary power he has under that section should be taken away so vast a power as that should not be left in the hands of any one man in any country this is not a government of orders and proclamations but of laws made by the representatives of the people the secretary of the treasury kept the greenback at a discount by refusing to receive it for custoins dues he brought it to par by a treasury order to receive at the customhouse no officer in this government ought to be permitted thus to play the r6le of a mexican official and raise or depress the values of a whole country by a mere treasury order suppose we change the word authorized in that section to required the gold coin and bullion in this country would go directly into the treasury if the discretion reposed in the secretary had been used for the benefit of the people there never would have been onehalf of the nationalbank notes in circulation that there are today if we would now require the secretary of the treasury to execute that law in two years onehalf of the nationalbank notes would be out of circulation he refused to issue the gold notes because it was against the interest of the banks he is opposed to the circulation of the treasury notes because it is against the interest of the banks the president the secretary and the committee on banking and currency are trying to stop the coinage of silver and the issue of silver certificates because they are in the way of the banks they tell us that the banks can supply all the circulation required for the business of the country but we are told that it is very dangerous to intrust so important a power to the representatives of the people so we were told in 1877 that it was very dangerous to intrust the representatives of the people with the counting of thevotes cast for president and vicepresident and so we were told a few weeks ago that it was very dangerous to intrust the representatives of the people with the revision of our present tariff these are the same old arguments that were made by alexander hamilton in 1787 he said then that the people were not capable of selfgovernment he thought that our democratic fathers were trying to organize the elements of anarchy into government he did not believe that a government based on the popular will could live he did not believe that the people had intelligence enough to support it but here we find it as they formed it and left it and though it has passed a century of sunshine and storm it still endures history has dispelled all the doubts that gathered about the mind of mr hamilton a hundred years ago but his disciples are still telling us every day that we are not competent to discharge the duties devolved on congress by the constitution they tell us that this is a great business question thatmustbe attendedto by business people that it is a great business question i am free to admit it is a business question of the very greatest importance to the people our english fathers regarded these questions as great business questions and so great that they would never permit the house of lords to touch a tax bill and our fathers when they framed their constitution of government thought so too for they said that their representatives alone should originate them why isit that it is being constantly sought to get these questions out of the reach of congress there is but one answer to the question it is because those who are interested in defeating the popular will desire to get out of the power of the peoples representatives they know the representative is responsible to the people and it is not so easy to succeed with him as it would be with their own creatures they wanted the electoral commission because it would do what congress would not do it would defraud the people out of the chief magistrate whom they had chosen they wanted the tariff commission because it will be the slave of the protected monopolists they wanted corporations to issue currency because it would be beyond the control of the peoples representatives they will exercise the powers you give them for their own interest when it is to their interest to expand the volume of currency they will expand when it is to their interest to contract they will contract their interests are always opposite to the interests of the people whenever congress is called upon to exercise some power plainly granted by the coustitution for the general welfare we are met with all sorts of evasions it is too dangerous too delicate it is a business question and we are not competent but the very things that congress has been prohibited from touching you seize without any compunctious visitations of conscience you can rush into the states and seize their ballotboxes you can tear down their judicial tribunals you can hunt down their people for alleged crimes that federal courts have no authority to try you can release guilty criminals from the bands of state authbrity in short when it is to the interest of party congress can do all things and it is omniscient as well as omnipotent but when it is proposed to exert some power plainly and palpably granted for the promotion of the interests of the whole country then the advocates of privileged classes tell us that congress is stupid and incompetent when congress in the interests of moneyed corporations proposes to invade the rights of the people they are zealous advocates of centralization when congress proposes to exercise some power confided to them by the constitution to prevent some great wrong to the people then they are zealous advocates of state rights you invade the rights of the people in their homes you deprive them of personal liberty you seize and control their local governments all these rights which they have positively withheld from your touch you ignore and you deal with them at your ipleasure as though the government was unlimited in its power now i cannot see how it is that some gentlemen contend that the government is not to be trusted with issuing and regulating the currency of the country while at the same time the national banking system which they favor and which they say is the best and safest system of currency in the world is based upon the government issue of currency and that is based on the government issue of bonds the nationalbank note is redeemable in the treasury note and that is nothing but the promise of the government to pay a gold and silver dollar the bond the treasury note and the bank note all rest upon the same foundation the foundation of each is the stability of the government and the integrity of its administration the treasury note is every whit as sound as the government and the nationalbank note can be no sounder the difference between the two is not the security that argument is only used to mislead it is that the volume of treasury notes will be issued by and controlled by the representatives of the people in the promotion of the interests of the people and the bank notes will be issued by the banks and controlled by the banks in the interest of the banks and this is the whole case now we have been told andi thought it was a good joke until it was repeated two or three times that two years ago when the banks contracted their circulation 18 000 000 in less than two weeks it was done because they became alarmed and rushed to the treasury and deposited their circulation and withdrew their bonds we were told by the gentleman from new york that the country was brought to the verge of a panic and its business interests menaced with ruin by this action of the banks does not that show that such an institution ought not to exist why did they contract their circulation and thus imperil the business of the country and threaten with destruction the fortunes of thousands it was because congress in the interest of the people was passing a bill to refund the matured debt at 3 per cent and keep the bonds in the control of the government so they could be called and paid at its pleasure the interests of the people required the debt to be extinguished the interest of the banks required it to be continued the welfare of the people deumanded that the bonds while out should draw the lowest interest while the welfare of the banks demanded the highest rate of interest the banks therefore to compel the government to yield the welfare of fifty million people to their interest contracted their circulation and threatened the whole commercial interests of the country with ruin the ruin they planned was averted by the government expanding the currency as fast as they contracted it but they compelled the president to veto the bill but the gentleman from new york says the action of the banks was precipitated by alarm alarmed at what what frightened them the supremest danger that could possibly have overtaken them would only have stopped their existence if it had been realized if congress had done its utmost it could only have given them back their bonds and taken up their notes we could not hang the stockholders nor confiscate their estates if congress bad been seeking to inflict upon them the greatest injury in its power it could only do what they did for themselves do you think if congress was gravely considering the question whether or not it would hang some man that he would become so alarmed that to escape the terrible danger he would rush to the gallows slip the noose around his neck and habg himself that is just what the national banks did only they had it in their power to take back their lives agaiu they incurred no risks no losses in surrendering their circulation but if they had not been counteracted in their wicked schemes they would have drawn down the business of the country in a whirlpool of ruin no sir they were not alarmed that fallacy is too flimsy they were cool collected determined and selfpossessed they were fatally bent on mischief and the government whose power we are told is so dangerous came to the rescue of the people and saved them from the disasters to which they had been devoted by the safest and best monetary system in the world the friends of the banks tell us that a great calamity will ensue if we do not pass this bill that panic and distress will surely come by the contraction of the currency that they assume must follow the refusal to recharter now i do not believe that the currency will be contracted one dollar how can it be i repeat it sir that the circulation will not be contracted i do not mean to say that the aggregate amount of money in the united states will not be less but i mean that the aggregate amount of that money that is in circulation will not be changed the money in circulation is not the money hoarded in the vaults of the treasury of the national and savings banks and other moneyed institutions bat it is that which is flowing back and forth in the channels of trade like froightoars performing the same office of exchanging the products of the country from the man who does not want them to the man who does if there were three times as many freightcal in the country as were needed for transportation and a tenth of them were destroyed by fire it would not affect the transportation business because their places would at once be supplied by the reserves of the companies as my friend from new york says money is a tool of exchange so is the steamengine and the freightear now if these sixtyeight millions of nationalbank notes are in actual circulation and their bonds are called for payment how are these notes to be got in will some gentleman tell me how the sixtyeight millions are to come back into the coffers of the banks so that they can be delivered for redemption i pause for a reply none have replied then none have i offended if the notes of the banks are out in circulation among the people performing their office of exchange they can only be gotten in by putting other money in place of that that is called if the sixtyeight million of bank notes is out the banks are indebted to the holders that much money and they have their promises to redeem like other people and if they redeem their notes by paying the holders sixtyeight millions of other money there certainly is no contraction there suppose sixtyeight millions of barrels bf water were taken out of the potomac river today do you think that the mean tide of the river would be reduced below what it is now i i do not because the reserves from the ocean would flow in and fill up the void as fast as it was made so it would be with the circulation so that it is plain if the notes are in circulation and they are called they can only be gotten by putting the like amount in their places and there can be no contraction if the notesare in the vaults of the banks and are called they are only exchanged from one vault to another in neither case do they have any effect upon the business of the country all political economists are areed that money hoarded has no effect on prices of property ir the bankers take back their bonds and surrender their currency from their vaults it is only a change of so much property from one place of deposit to another but suppose the sixtyeighty millions were actually taken up out of circulation is there any other reserve to take its place what is to become of the one hundred and eightyfour millions of surplus funds of the banks the gentleman from illinois who is a banker tells us all this surplus will be scattered and go into other enterprises does that look like contraction from the vaults of the banks themselves three dollars will go out where one comes in and this is the statement of a friend of the banks and a supporter of the bill how much money is there in the united states in round numbers fifteen hundred millions of dollars the director ofthe mint informs us that last november there was seven hundred and fortynine millions of coin the comptroller tells us that there was at that time seven hundred and twentytwo millions of treasury notes and bank notes and we have sixtyeight millions of silver certificates in 1875 there was not exceeding half that sum and when the country was suffering for want ofa sufficient medium of exchange and we were trying to resume the coinage of silver we were told by the friends of the banks that we were going to have money so cheap that one would be obliged to take a wheelbarrow to carryhis money when he went to market this was the result predicted if we increased the volume of circulation it has been increased since then a hundred percent and the wheelbarrow is not yet in sight bank notes and treasury notes were all the money we then had in circulation paper money was below par and what little coin there was in the country was hoarded and did not come into the current of circulation if the sixtyeight million of bank notes should be retired do you not suppose that from the vast hoards of money locked up because there is no safe investment for it and because the channels of circulition are supplied enough will flow at once into circulation to fill the place of the retiring tank notes it is contended that large amounts of this money are loaned out on mortgages and the banks will have to call it in and then great distress will be occasioned to thousands of debtors all over the country but that argument is like the rest and the answer to the others is the answer to this the debtor borrowed from one bank and gave his mortgage he has only to go across the street to another bank and make a mortgage of the same property and get the money to redeem his mortgage to the bank whose circulationis called he only changes his creditor and his condition remains the same the only difference with him is he is a debtor for the same amount to a new creditor if the bonds of a bank in new york are called for payment and the bank requires its debtor to come up and settle the debtor goes to another bank and says here is a piece of property on which a bank across the way has lent me money at 6 per cent that bank is obliged to stop business i want you to take the mortgage on this property and let me have the money to pay my debt to the other bank the debtor is thus accommodated without any distress the country is full of money and it is anxious for investment and there is no probability whatever for any disturbance by reason of a refusal to recharter the expiring banks the gent man from maine who wishes to continuc the bank circulation tells us that the people are surfeited with silver and want no more this he infers from the fact that there are three and a half millions less silver now in circulation than there was last january if the gentleman had followed that fact far enough he would not have drawn from it the inference he mid in the tall and winter months when our large crops are nmmving to market all the money in cirelation and all that can be added to the ordinary circulation from reserves that are accessible are brought into active use at that season of the year the paper money nearly always becomes exhausted and merchants and bankers have to uso heavily the reserves of gold and silver two years ago paper money was at a premium over gold in the south while the cotton crop was moving in the summer whon the emergency is past the cola returns to the treasury and paper performs the ordinary uses of cireilation but i return to the idea that we must change our system of paper currency that fact is becoming apparent to all no party dares to go before the intelligent peopte of this country and advocate the perpetuation of a public debt for the purpose of having it as a basis for a national banking system any party that would go before the country on such a declaration of policy must be overwhelmed with a waterloo defeat we must have some system of paper currency independent of the national debta paper currency convertible into gold and silver at thepleasure of the holder and i know of no better system than that of thomas jefferson from whom i have learned all mylessons of government ie favored a national treasury note i do not care whether it be a legal tender or not if it is convertible at the pleasure of the holder into gold and silver coin that is legal tender then it is practically a legal tender because any holder of the paper can got at his pleasure the coin with which it is payable and which is legal tender"], [0.06133192777633667, 0.9386680722236633, 1, "i should think they would want to vote upon a proposition which proposes to bring these rates back in the

and i think the discussion of the relations which these roads occupy toward the federal government has not been entered upon any too soon i fear the countgy is not well informed in regard to this railroad system and i believe sir that this discussion is fortunate in many respects as it will furnish information to congress and the people of the extent and character of some of the subsidized corporations which congress has organized and of their rights and franchises and their relations to the government it has been asserted here from time to time on many occasions for years that the large body of wealth known as the union pacific railroad system involving six great corporations was built by congress through subsidies subsidies in bonds coupled with a large grant of the public lands and that these great roads from the pacific ocean to the missouri and their great branches connecting them with the whole railroad system of the country have been built out of the resources of the united states by public grants and also that the wealth which is now annually accumulating as the result of these grants is the outgrowth of the subsidy of the nation and the public resources and that these corporations have not invested any of their own wealth in these great works and yet up to this time so far as i am informed no gentleman has denied the that still my friend from new york and my friend from mississippi discuss this subject as though congress was laying its hand upon private corporations and private wealth and seeking to make them subordinate to interests of the government we are not dealing with private interests or estates this act of 1862 independent of the anendatory act of 1874 established the fiet beyond question that notwithstanding the imperative necessity that was believed to exist for political as well as commercial reasons for closer intercourse between the atlantic and pacific states and although it was pressed both in 1862 and 1864 with unexampled earnestness and persistency congress was not unmindful of the rights and interests of the people or of the fact that vast public resources were being invested in a public enterprise placed in a certain degree under private control that might seek to use these resources for exclusively private and personal aggrandizement nor was congress unmindful of the power that such an aggregation of wealth might attain therefore to make it apparent to all time that those national grants to these corporations were intended to be subordinate to the federal government and public interests and that these corporations were public agents identified with national objectsnot independent private enterprises without relation to government but administering resources which in a just degree ought to inure to the benefit of the american people congress incorporated the very provision into this act which has been quoted as an argument against the power of congress to regulate the rates which ought to be paid to these corporations by the federal government for transporting government property the language employed especially in view of the general provisions of the act declaring the public object of organizing these corporations does not admit of any misinterpretation here are the words and the better to accomplish the object of this actthe public purpose of the subsidies and the corporate franchisethe better to accomplish the object of this act namely to promote the public interest and welfare by the construction of said railroad and telegraph line and keeping the same in working order and to secure to the government at all times but particularly in times of war the use and benefits of the same for postal military and other purposescongress retains the power toadd towould not congress have been unmindful of the interest of this nation if language as prudent and pertinent as that had not been embodied in the act add to alter amend or repeal this act the promotion of the public welfare then inspired the act and yet gentlemen have been discussing this subject this national interest as if congress was seeking to invade the rights of private parties and to imperil the rights of property so secure under our government mr clairmaan congress can not hesitate in legislating upon this subject now that it is brought to their attention congress can not hesitate in providing that this vast body of wealth should with due regard to the rights of private stockholders who have admitted interests in this propertythat this body of wealth should be made to contribute in a just degree to the purposes for which the wealth was granted that should not admit of dispute congress has reserved the powerand it would have been criminal if it had not reserved itcongress has reserved the power to determine to what extent and in what manner these great resources shall with due regard to the rights of the individual stockholders and the holders of the securities issued by these corporations be treated as a trust held for great public purposes and congress must determine in what manner and to what extent they shall contribute to the object of the grant the promotion of the public welfitre this proposition can not be denied unless gentlemen assume that the subsidy to these corporations was simply a munificent gift to favored citizens the supreme court can not in view of decisions already delivered question the power of congress to determine the question at issue to put a legislative interpretation on a law in whichthe power to that end is expressly reserved and yet congress can not go beyond the general scope design and purpose of the law and must act as it were judicialy in determining the public purposes within the scope of the charter of these corporations these resources shall promote it must be conceded that congress can not justly destroy and greatly impair franchises it has granted i make no such claim but i do claim that these corporations shall be treated as public corporations and subject to such reasonable regulations for the public benefit as congress shall determine to be just the small number of gentlemen in whose hands this great property has been vested under the legislation of congress have realized from it in net earnings during the fourteen years since the completion of these roads the enormous sum of 148 097 632 over one hundred and fbrtyeight millions of wealth net earnings of this magnificent subsidy not applied to the extinguishment of the debt of the united states which was the basis of this wealth not applied to refund to the government the 39 000 000 of interest which an overtaxed people have paid tbr those corporations but applied to the building up of the overgrown and imperial fortunes of the citizens who have administered your public subsidies can the countiry be astonished that the grand equality the pride of our fithers which characterized the condition of the american people in material wealth a quarter of a century ago is fast disappearing that citizens are enabled to invest in your public securities and otherwise fabulous sums of money and become the owners of baronial estates in lands threatening our republican institutions by the vast centralization of wealth and the power it commands when the outgrowth of subsidy is continued it is not at all surprising when congress legislates fortunes and grants subsidies and when the public object of the subsidy is declared by law gentlemen on this floor are willing to assert that private and personal interests are to be first consulted that grants for public purchases grand as they may be are not to be treated as designed for the benefit of the government and people but as creating and involving only private rights too sacred to be impaired i am glad the committee on appropriations has brought forward this measure to test the rights of the government i would like to say to my friend from new york in all fairness that while no sentiment has been expressed here unfriendly to ample and complete justice to these corporationsnot an utterance so far as i have heard expressing other than a just consideration for the rights of the men who are fbr the time being the administrators of this public subsidy and parties holding private interests in those corporationswould it not be the part of wisdom on the part of these corporations whose growth and power are in the judgment of considerate men becoming a source of peril to our form of government would it not be the part of wisdom on their part not to resist those reasonable and public duties those moderate returns to the government which congress in the exercise of power expressly reserved may think proper to impose upon them is it not the part of wisdom to do this rather than to attempt to hold on to this imperial wealth and refuse that any portion of it shall be appropriated to the common benefit or even to the extinguishment of the rapidly growing and enormous debt which the government assumed in their behalf can they afford to ignore the public purposes for which thm great subsidy was made can they afford this for myown part whilei would as representative of the people seek to do perfect and complete justice to these corporationsfor this great government can not afford to act unjustly through any of its departments and especially its legislative departmentswhile i would seek to extend as perfect justice to these corporations as i would the humblest citizen demanding justice from the government before the american congress i will not consent for my own part by my voice or vote that institutions so endowed with imperial wealth and high franchises for public purposes and to promote the public welfare shall be permitted year after year to compel the people burdened with taxation to pay the interest on their debt now swollen to more than 39 000 000 while they appropriate the millions of dollars of the net earnings of this subsidy to swell their own fortunes and ican not sit silent and permit them to complain in the presence of the american people that a measure so mild as this pending measure so trivial of burden upon an imperial subsidy is an act of oppression i am surprised that my friend from new york a gentleman generally so considerate of public interests and public duty should have thought it proper to raise the voice of complaint that corporations so endowed and subsidized for the public welfare and with such vast resources growing out of public benefactions should have a reasonable demand made upon them by congress to transport the public property upon the roads built by the resources of the people for onehalf of the compensation paid to companies for like

ordindnce which person shall be challenged by the judges of election when presenting himself to vote and rejected unless he satisfy said judges that lie was entitled to register and said board shall also place on said books the names of such persons as in their judgment have been improperly rejected by the recorder of voters they shall sit from day to day not exceeding ten days until they have completed their labors and their proceedings shall be printed daily in the paper doing the city printing they shall each be allowed the sum of si per day for their services it is true that the state legislature of missouri in 1877 enacted a general election law three sections of which are as follows sec 4380 all cities and towns in this state containing 100 000 inhabitants or more shall be cities of the first class sec 4385 any city or town in this state existing by virtue of the present general law or by any local or special law may elect to become a city of the class to which its population would entitle it under the provisions of this article by passing an ordinance or proposition and submitting the same to the legal voters ofsuch city or town at an election to be held for that purpose not less than twenty nor more than thirty days after the passage of such ordinance or proposition and if a majority of such voters votingat such election shall ratify such ordinance or proposition the mayor or chief olicer of such city or town shall issue his procamation declaring the result of such election and thereafter such city or town shall by virtue of such vote be incorporated under the provisions of the general law provided for the government of the class to which such city belongs which class shall be determined by the last census taken whether state or national sec 4389 any city of the firstelass in thisstatemay become a bodycorporate under the provisions of this article in the manner provided by law c then follow the provisions for governing cities of the first class and lbr registration and elections therein it is proper to state however that it has never been claimed by the contestee that saint louis ever elected to acceptthe provisions ofthislaw or elected to become a city of the first class or in any way designated its wish desire or intention to accept these provisions it became a bodycorporate by virtue of its scheme and charter adopted in 1876 and has continued so to act to this day neither was it claimed that the provisions of the act of the legislature of 1877 governed or controlled the election of 1880 nor were these provisions of the act of 1877 respecting registration of any force or effect in said city the last city ordinance was adopted subsequently to any act of the general assembly it contains forty and odd sections and prescribed an entire scheme regulating elections and providing for registration in the city and was the only law by which registration was had in that city these views are supported by mr bell the city counselor a man who is admitted to be of eminent legal ability his views will be found on page 1814 of the record the constitution of the united states article 1 is as follows the times places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof but the congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations except as to the places of choosing senators the question raised therefore in this case is wasthe registration law of saint louis under which the election of 1880 was held legally enacted and were its provisions applicable to the election of a representative in congress could the people of missouri by a constitutional provision delegate to the city of saint louis the authority to pass a registration law applicable to that city only the constitution of the united states having expressly declared that the manner of holding elections for representatives shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof could the state legislature or the constitution of missouri delegate its authority to any other power to any other body that the election was held under the provisions of the charter was not denied that the registration law by which a large number of voters were deprived of their right to exercise their franchise was enacted in 1878 was not disputed that enough legal voters were thus stricken off to change the result is not in doubt the committee believe that so much of the ordinance as made registration a prerequisite to voting was illegal was unconstitutional had no binding power and that all legal votes rejected by virtue of this ordinance should be counted that there may be no mistake in regard to the exact situation of affairs i shall run over in a half dozen sentences the exact situation and shall leave it to any gentleman upon that side of the house who sees fit to examine the question whether or not the city of saint louis could by a city ordinance provide that registration should be a prerequisite to voting when there was no law upon the s tatutebook providing such a regulation and applicable to saint louis the constitution provides that residence in the state for a given time and residence in the district for a given time entitles a citizen to vote and not a word about registration nothing except residence the city of saint louis under the constitutional provision authorizing it to enact a scheme and charter passed a registry law making registration a prerequisite for voting it is true that that scheme and charter has been published in the laws of the state as compiled by a joint committee but it was compiled by that committee without any authority of law they placed the charter there not by direction of the legislature but because they thought it ought to go there and the registration law as passed by the city of saint louis under the scheme and charter was never ratified by any legislative body other than by the municipal legislature of the city of saint louis but we are told that the state in 1877 passed a registration law and that it passed one applicable to cities of the first class and cities of 100 000 inhabitants were cities of the first class and we are asked to take notice of the fact because saint louis has more than 100 000 inhabitants therefore she falls within the provisions of the general law but it is to be marked that the same enactment of the legislature provides that a city must in order to become a city of the first class accel t the provisions of the law providing for cities of the first class saint louis is not a body corporate by virtue of that enactment but it holds its charter by virtue of the constitutional provision permitting it to adopt the scheme and charter under which it has existed since 1876 xlv227 and as i remarked a moment ago mr bell a man of eminent legal ability who had been city counselor for two years prior to 1880 testified under oath that the election in the city in 1880 was held not under any law of the state but by virtue of the charxter and of the amended ordinances passed in july and august 1878 let me ask any democrat is it possible that a city of any class can pass a registration law making registration a prerequisite of voting when the constitution of the united states says that the legislature of a state shall prescribe the manner of holding elections for representatives and when the constitution of the united states delegated that power to the legislatures did it mean that the legislature or the people of any state might redelegate that power to any city to any town or to any municipality i think there is no man upon the other side of the house who will go the length of saying that any city by virtue of any state constitution or any legislative enactment can adopt a system of registration imposing upon voters regulations other than those imposed upon them by the constitution of their state or by the legislature thereof the committee believe that the registry clause was illegal was unconstitutional had no binding effect and that all legal votes rejected by virtue of the provisions of this clause should be counted but we hold that these names thus stricken off should be counted even if the law was held to be constitutional and binding for the further reason at the first meeting of the board of revision it adopted the following resolution resolved that when a member of the board of revision presents a list of persons found on the list furnished him by the recorder of voters with dead removed not found vacant house duplicate not a citizen or any other word or phrase to indicate that the person is not entitled to vote his name being on the books of the recorder the board of revision shall take immediate action on such names and instruct the recorder of voters to erase such names from the registered list of voters in his office by this resolution that board delegated its exclusive power to each of its members and in advance agreed that whatsoever names any of its members presented to be stricken off should be stricken off without any knowledge or testimony the recorder of voters who was ex officio clerk of the board swears that the business was done as follows namely the clerk called ward 1 when the reviser from that ward sent up a list of names which was not even read the clerk merely stated the number of names on the list when by virtue of the above resolution and without further action by the board they were stricken off no other member of the board but he from the first ward ever hearing the names read or knowing what names had been stricken off the same action was had when ward 2 was called and so on through the whole twentyeight wards record page 131 this was also proved by nearly all the members of the board called by the contestee as witnesses in his behalf see record pages 1792 1824 1825 and 1844 it is undisputed the board sat from one to two hours each of the eight days and in that time struck off over 12 000 names from a registration of about 60 000 the fict also appears that the reviser for the fourth ward of this district that ward in which most of the above disfranchised voters lived left his entire work of revision to irresponsible deputies whose work was sent in and the names reported by them were stricken from the list of voters in the manner above described the testinmony of one michael burke shows that he was one of these unsworn deputies and reveals the frauds by which republicans were intentionally stricken off the lists he also swearsand his evidence is wholly u ncontradictedthatthere was an understanding and agreement between all these deputies that they should act together in practicing these frauds see record page 71 and fbllowing it nill be borne in mind that the law not only does not recognize these deputies but specifically provides that this work of determining the qualifications of voters should be done by these revisers sitting as a court and acting judicially on actual knowledge or competent testimony and by a majority vote the testimony shows that one hundred and fiftyone of the men stricken off were legal and qualified voters many of them being old residents and that they did all in their power to entitle them to vote the committee hold that their votes should be counted by the house the said voters had done everything the law required of them they had exhausted their remedy they had registered and gone to the polls and offered to vote but their names having been stricken off they were not allowed to vote the principle is well established and was adopted by this committee in the case of bisbee vs finley present congress that where judges of election improperly refuse a qualified voter the right to vote his vote will be counted here we submit the reason of that rule will apply as well to this case where the voter has done everything in his power and the primary wrongful act was committed by the registration officers m crary on elections sections 10 11 and 383 fully sustains this view in the following language a case may occurwhere aportionof the legal votershave withouttheirfaultand in spite of due diligence on their part been denied the privilege of registration in such a case if the voter was otherwise qualified and is clearly shown to have performed all the acts required of him by thelaw and to have been denied registratlon by the wrongful act of the registering officer it would seem a very unjust thing to deny him the right to vote in elections for state officers however tnder a constitution or statute which imperatively requires registration as a qualification for voting it may be that the voters only remedy would be found in an action against the registration officer for damages see also sections 11 and 383 it will be observed that judge mccrary after stating the general doctrine says thatin elections for state officers however under a constitution or statute which imperatively requires registration as a qualification for voting it may be that the voters only remedy would be found in an action sgainst the registration officer this refers exclusively to state officers while the office for which it is intended to count these votes is not a state officethat the united states constitution has given this body full control over the question as to who are its members and in the state of missouri neither the constitution nor any statute in force in saint louis makes registration an imperative prerequisite or qualification see constitution 1875 heretofore cited the constitution of the united states having declared that the legislatures of the several states shall provide for choosing members of congress and the constitution of missouri having authorized the general assembly and that alone to enact a registration law we hold that so much of the ordinance as made registration prerequisite to voting has no binding force or effect and is invalid we therefore rely upon the language of mccrary section 11 thatin the absence of any positive law making registration imperative as a quailfication for voting it is a very plain proposition that the wrongful refusal of a registering officer to register a legal voter who has complied with the law apd applies for registration ought not to disfranchise such voter the offer to register in such a case is equivalent to registration this would be held to be the law upon the wellsettled principle that the offer to perform an act which depends for its performance upon the action of another person who wrongfully refuses to act is equivalent to its performance furthermore these votes 151 thus illegally stricken off should be counted upon another ground following a wellestablished principle of law the proof in this case shows that the board of revision by whom the above voters were disfranchised acted at the outset and throughout their entire proceedings in absolute violation of not only the spirit but the letter of the law which gave them authority the ordinance explicitly says that this board shall meetfor the purpose of examining the registration and making and noting corrections therein as may be rendered necessary by either their knowledge of errors committed or by competent testimony heard beforethe board a majority of said board shall be necessary to do business by a resolution adopted at the beginning heretofore cited they declared they would neither hear testimony nor act upon the knowledge of the board thereafter names of voters were stricken off the list without even being read to the board and merely upon the recommendation of an individual member who in many cases as the proof shows adopted without question knowledge or examination the reports of his unsworn and unauthorized deputies when it is borne in mind that no actual notice was given to the voter thus stricken from the list and that even if he had such notice there existed no remedy or law by which he could be reinstated the necessity of holding this board to a strict execution of its powers will be apparent it will be observed that the ordinance conferred upon the board of revision the power to examine and revise the registration list prepared by the recorder of voters and making and noting corrections therein to correct his errors or omissions but the law nowhere empowered them to correct or revise their own it is a wellsettled doctrine of law that as to courts not of record and other bodies having judicial functions no presumptions arise as to jurisdiction or the regularity of their proceedings and that any judgment rendered by such court or body not in strict conformity with the law is void this board of revision as shown by the record acted from the beginning to the end in utter disregard and violation of the law this ordinance gives the board power to strike from the registry lists by a majority vote and either on the knowledge of the board officially or by competent testimony heard before the board the names of those only who have removed from the election district for which they registered or who have died the resolution divested the board of all its functions it gave each member individually the right to not only strike off the dead and removed but it gave him the right to strike off those not found it gave him the right to write vacant house against a mans name and that man was disfranchised it gave him the right to strike off duplicate names it gave him the right to strike off all who were in hisjudgment not citizens and lastly it gave him the right to strike off any one whom he thought for any reason ought not to voteand to do all this without any testimony without any knowledge as to whether it was right and without any notice to him whose name he struck off and then the board beforehand sanctioned all this told each reviser to do whatever he would it as a board would stamp it as the act of the board it will be seen by this ordinance that this board besides striking off the names of those who had removed out of the precinct where they lived when they registered and the names of those who had died were required to note the fact opposite the name of any person charged with having registered in a wrong name or who for any reason is not entitled to registration under the provisions of this ordinance which person shall be challenged by the judges of election when presenting himself to vote and rejected unless he satisfy said judges that he was entitled to register this board was precluded from striking off the names of these persons its only duty was to make note against them and then the judges of election were to judicially examine into the qualifications of these voters so the board not only violated and defied the law but by its acts it prevented the judges of election from examining and determining the questions which the ordinance explicitly referred to them if this board had been a court of general jurisdiction even then its acts would have been absolutely void because of its failure to proceed in accordance with law we therefore hold that the action of this board in striking off the names of the above voters was illegal and absolutely void and of the same effect as if done by any unauthorized party again the pr6of shows that the action of the board of revision from its inception operated as a fraud upon all who were improperly stricken off by them and that there was actual fraud on the part of some of those to whom were improperly delegated the duties and finctions of the whole board which fraud resulted in striking off and disfranchisement of these voters this opportunity for fraud is evidenced by the illegal resolution adopted the manner in which the board did its work and by the employment of unauthorized and unsworn deputies the actual fraud is shown in the uncontradicted testimony of michael burke one of the above deputies in the fourth ward of this congressional district who unblushingly tells how he struck off of the list republican voters of his understanding that he was hired for that purpose and agreement with other deputies to do the same work in their wards in the fact that of the 12 000 names stricken offthe contestee after keeping in a conspicuous place in theleading democratic paper of saint louis an advertisement for all democrats who had been wrongfully stricken from the registration list to appear and give their testimonyonly obtained three who were qualified voters in the fact that in numerous instances as shown by the testimony some members of a family were stricken off said list and members of the same fimily left on and in each of such instances the republicans were stricken off and the democrats left on in the fact that five months after the election herein as is shown by the testimony another election was held in saint louis before which a presumably fair registration was had and at which every republican candidate was elected by a very large majority whereas at this election the democratic candidates for president and governor each received a majority we therefore hold that as fraud vitiates all things the frauds above enumerated vitiated the action of said board of revisers foreach and all these reasons and because it seems just and right that where a legallyqualified voter has done all that the law requires of him in order to vote but he has been deprived of the privilege by the default neglect or fraud of any officer of election his vote should be counted and because it seems to us that these voters were in the eyes of the law on the list of voters furnished the judges of election having been stricken off by illegality and fraud we hold that these votes should now be counted for contestant in addition the committee held that 35 other votes should be counted if valid they had complied with the registration law of said city having previous to the election registered their names before the proper officer that on the day of election they offered their ballots at their respective and proper polling precincts in taid city all said ballots being for contestant that their names were each and every one of them found on the polllist at the precincts where they offered to vote but for various trivial and insignificant reasons such as for instance the misspelling of names or the incorrectness of numbers and in some instances for no reasons whatever the judges refused to receive their votes and they were not received or counted the committee also counted 8 votes as follows that they had never registered andvoted in the city of saint louis that on the day of election they were registered at the polls of their respective and proper precincts by the registering officer duly appointed for that purpose that they offered their ballots for contestant for representative in congress from the third congressional district of missouri but the judges refused to receive and count their votes and they never have been counted the committeealso counted 86 votes as follows the legislature of missouri in 1877 adopted the following act which both parties to this contest state was in force in saint louis in 1880 and so conceded by all parties an act to provide for the exercise of the right of voting by persons who have failed to register be it enacted by the general assembly of the state of missouri as follows sectix 1 in all state county and municipal elections hereafter held in any city of this state having a population of 10000 inhabitants or more noerson shall be deprived of the right of voting at such election by reason of aving fklhed to register provided that in all cities where registration is required by law the party offering to vote but who from any cause has failed to register before he offers to vote shall be on the day of such election registered by a special registrar of election appointed by the judges of election for that purpose at each precinct as a qualifiedvoter in a book to be kept for that purpose and the ballot of such voter shall be received and counted at such election and such registrar shall return to the register of voters of such city the list of such voters so registered within ten days after such election ptovided the said registrars shall ho sworn as provided for the recorder of voters and the books shall contain the written or printed oath as required in the regular registration books approved march 30 1877 the evidence shows that eightysix citizens of saint louis were at the date of the election legal and qualified voters of the state of missouri and city of saint louis and said third congressional district that they never had registered or voted in the city of saint louis that on the day of election they offered at their respective and proper polling precincts and before the officers appointed to register voters and receive and count the votes to register under the above law and vote for the contestant but the officers whose duty it was failed and refused to register them or to receive and count their ballots and their ballots were not received and counted by the judges of election and they never have been counted there were also 23 ballots cast for contestants but not counted having this caption namely chronicle selected ticket a ticket made up of names of persons on both the republican and democratic regular tickets the election officers threw these 23 votes out on the ground that the ticket was designed to deceive the voter and in doing so claim to have acted in accordance and within the letter and spirit of the following law in force in missouri each ballot may bear a plain written or printed caption thereon composed of not more than three words expressing its political character but on all such ballots the said caption or headlines shall not in any manner be designed to mislead the voter as to the name or names thereunder any ballot notconforming to the provisions of this act shall be considered fraudulent and the same shall not be counted the committee held that the words used in the caption were in no way calculated to mislead or deceive a voter and accordingly counted the same evidence on pages 952 and 897 of the record which is uncontradicted will be fbund showing that 10 votes cast for contestant were thrown out and not counted by the judges merely upon the ground that the contestants given name was not on the ballots the pwoof shows that no other man by the name of sessinghaus was a candidate at that election in that district for any office hence we follow the unbroken chain of authorities as cited by mecrary and hold that these 10 votes should be counted for contestant at one precinct in the said district it appears from the evidence page 612 of record there were cast by legally qualified voters fifteen ballots having the caption greenback labor ticket but with the nominee of that party for congress scratched out in pencil and the name of contestant inserted none of which ballots were counted by the judges of election the evidence is wholly uncontradicted we think the above votes should be counted for contestant the intention of the voters being plain and the ballots being legal in precinct 148 the testimony shows that the board organized under the law to foot up returns made by the judges of election counted for contestant 141 and contestee 58 that appearing to be the figures on the pollbook of that precinct the undisputed positive testimony of a majority of the officers of election at that precinct is that contestant received 149 votes and contestee 52 and that those were the figures certified to and returned by the judges the contestee called no witnesses to disprove this testimony and if it had been false it could easily have been shown we therefore conclude either that a mistake was made or the figures were intentionally changed after leaving the hands of the judges and that in either event it should be corrected this adds 8 votes to contestant and takes 6 from cofitestee see record pages 1748 6745 823 and 6689 there was also voted at that election a ticket headed hancock independent ticket upon which the name of contestee was printed but scratched out and contestants name inserted in pencil this ticket was thrown out by the judges see pages 779 and 791 it seems plain that it should be counted for contestant at precinct number 74 a ballot was cast as shown by the evidence page 985 which was made up of the tickets of the two parties cut in the middle and pasted together thus making a complete ticket with only one name thereon for each office it had on it the name of contestant for congress this ballot was thrown out and not counted by the judges we think it should be counted for him the voter evidently knew what he was about and it was his privilege to vote for whom he pleased as to precinct no 39 the contestant urged persistently and introduced much testimony to support his position that this precinct should he thrown out but we are constrained to differ with him we find that the evidence of intimidation hardly comes up to the standard provided by the precedents cited by mccrary and hence we conclude that it must stand we find however that twenty men all colored who were qualified and legal voters and duly registered and who had done all that the law required of them who were entitled to vote at that poll went there and offered to vote but were refused for various trivial reasons many of them being frightened by abuse and driven from the poll it is admitted by contestee and the proof is positive and uncontradicted that a minor louis hain cast his vote for contestee and that it was so counted we therefore take one vote from contestee see record pages 1232 and 1754 in conclusion therefore the committee found and so reported thgt these 358 votes should be added to those reported for contestant and deducted from those returned for contestee which leaves the net result as follows votes as returned for contestant 9290 add 358 total 9 648 votes as returned for contestee 9 487 deduct 7 total 9 480 majority for contestant 168 in arriving at this conclusion the committee gave the benefit of every doubt to contestee and arrived at the conclusion that the contestant should be seated i would inquire how much time i have remaining"], [0.8976280689239502, 0.8976280689239502, 0, "i would not insert a cent i would not change it if the property was

ships for all the world we might have great success under this section and just as the world is buying ships of great britain it might buy them of the united states and consequently it would not be a satisfactory result to the treasury of the united states to be called on to pay onethird the value of every ship built by an american shipbuilder which the owner intended to sell the next day after it got its register to some foreigner and it was intended to limit to american citizens in this way that if the american citizen ever sold that ship in ten twenty or thirty years before he sold it he should be obliged to pay back the bounty he had received and surrender the register i think that amendment is very desirable to the section but the majority of the committee did not deem it expedient to adopt it they did not believe the objection was a practical one they believed it was not difficult to answer the question of the gentleman from new york and it is that for some years to come we could calculate the amount of money taken from the treasurywould not exceed from a million to two million dollars a year because we have to take into consideration the number of shipyards we have and not only the number of shipyards but the mechanical appliances for the creation of ship materials and after such consideration we did not believe it is possible under the operation of this section to build ships faster than to take a million or two million dollars a year and that was the reason why we did not abolish the tonnage tax it was because the tonnage tax which is paid principally by the british and german ships amounts to a million and a half a year and we thought for some years to come we should levy that tonnage tax to make up this other amount never doubting it would pay the bounty for ten years to come leaving to congress if ships are built too fast and the privilege is abused to confine it within bounds that at least was the judgment of the majority of the committee and

interest in the bill now under consideration for should it become a law in the form reported by the committee my state would be deprived of half of its representation on this floor if this deprivation should result from the passage by congress of a fair and equitable apportionment bill i could not properly complain however deeply i might regret it liut the hill reported is not fair and equitable on the contrary it is unfair and unjust it proposes not to increase the representation of a state rapidly growing in population and in all the elements of prosperity but to reduce it since march 1873 florida has been entitled to two representatives in this house this bill gives to her but one and yet during the last ten years florida has increased in population nearly 44 per cent being a larger increase than that of any other state east of the mississippi river this new method as it is called and new it is indeed so changes the bill which passed the house of representatives of the fortysixth congress that the states of california rhode island and florida each lose one representative and the states of new york pennsylvania and illinois each gain one these great states are increased in representation at the expense of the smaller ones named this bill also changes the methodwhiclh hasbeenpursued by congress in the apportionment of representation for forty years heretofore the plan has been as the members of this house are aware to determine first what the number of representatives shall be then divide the whole population of the states by that number and the quotient resulting will be the ratio or the modulus as mr seaton calls it then divide the populations of the states respectively by this ratio and the aggregate of the different quotients thusobtained will be the minimum number of all the representatives this mininium number will be less than the number of members or representatives originally determined upon and to make lp this difference additional representatives are assigned or given to those states having the largest fractions fractions of the ratio have been recognized in apportionmnt bills for the last four decades and rightly recognized following that plan now with a house of 320 members the ratio woudl ie 154 285 dividing the population of the states of new york pennsylvania illinois california rhode island and florida respectively by this ratio we find that new york with a population of 5 082 871 would be entitled to 32 members leaving a fraction of 148 761 penusylvania with a population of 4 282 891 would be entitled to 27 members leaving a fraction of 117 196 illinois with a population of 3 077 871 would be entitled to 19 members leaving a fraction of 146 456 california with a population of 864 694 would be entitled to 5 representatives leaving a fraction of 93 269 rhode island with a population of 276 571 would be entitled to 1 representative leaving a fraction of 122 246 and florida with a population of 269 493 would be entitled to i representative leaving a fraction of 115 208 applying the rule heretofore observed that is of giving additional representatives to the states having the largest fractious these six states each would be entitled to an additional representative new york would be entitled to 33 pennsylvania to 28 illinois to 20 california to 6 rhode island to 2 and florida to 2 but let us see what this bill prepared in accordance with the new method proposes to do it proposes to give to now york 34 representatives to pennsylvania 29 to illinois 21 to california 5 to rhode island 1 and to florida 1 that is new york shall have a representative for every 149 496 of its population which is 4 789 less than theratio pennsylvania shallhave a representative for every 147 685 of its population which is 6 600 less than the ratio and illinois shall have a representative for every 146 565 of its population which is 7 720 less than the ratio california shall have a representative for every 172 938 of its population which is 18 703 more than the ratio rhode island shall have a representative for a population of 276 531 which is 122 246 more than the ratio and florida shall have a ropresentative for a population of 269 493 which is 115 208 more than the ratio now in the ease of new york if you will multiply 4 789 by the number of representatives the bill gives to that state namely 34 you will find that new york will have representation in this house for 162 826 persons not in the state pennsylvania in the same way will have representation for 191 400 not in the state and illinois for 162 120 persons not in the state while in califoinia there will be 94 269 persons unrepresented here in rhode island 122 246 and in florida 115 208 in a word this bill proposes to give to new york with a population less than nineteen timesthe population of florida a representation thirtyfour times greater than that of florida to pennsylvania with apopulation less than sixteen times the population offlorida a representation twentynine times greater and to illinois with a population about twelve times more than that of florida a representation twentyone times greater the constitution provides that representatives shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers but this bill seeks not to apportion them among the states but among the districts of the states and by such an apportionment to give to three states a representative ashasbeen said without a constituen t in my opinion the easiest andfairest way to apportionrepresentation is to apply the simple rule of three that we learned when boys at school and which has been explained so fully by the gentleman from rhode island now i desire to allude to some remarks made yesterday by the gentleman from pennsylvania he said it is desirable that the people should know well their representatives and that representatives should be close to theirpeople i most heartily agree with him but how i ask should the bill he advocates become a law can the 1 representative it gives to florida be close to his people that state having an area of 59 268 square miles"], [0.868691548705101,

committee were unanimously of the opinion that it is a just one the evidence upon which the report is based is substantially matter of record so that although the claim ears the marks of antiqnity as has been suggested by my friend from new york still the committee had no doubt that the evidence the truth of wbich has not been assailed was conclusive in favor of its allowance as detailed in the report and which has been quite accurately stated on this floor by my colleague on that committee now sir i shall never vote to rejecta clainm against the tnited states in favor of any state or individual which i believe to b just and honest and which has been fully proved because it is suggested that the statute of limitations ought to le interposed against its payment this government is too great too just and too beneficent to take advantage of a creditor and refuse to pay an honest debt on such a plea until some evidence is adduced to contradict the facts stated in the report or to show that the premises upon which it is founded are erroneous i shall be surprised to see this claim defeated here why sir if the claim be just it ought to have been paid long ago when first demanded and the fact that its payment has been so long delayed is discreditable to the govenimentiather than a sonid objectionagainst its present allowance the reasons which often justify a plca of the statute of limitations between parties in courts of law are not necessarily applieabletoaclaim of this character there was and is no statute of limitations barring this claim of the state of georgia against the general government if the state hl been allowed to maintain a suit in the court of claims or before some other legal tribunal and a certain time given in which to prosecute and it had failed to do so then such a claim would be and ought to be barred and i should ordinarily objcot to relieving the claimant from the result of such negligence i would object to special legislation the purpose of which was merely to defeat the operation of the statute of limitations but the case supposed is not the one before the house the state of georgia has had no opportunity to present this claim before any legal tribunal all that georgia could do was to come before congress and pray for reimbursement this it has done repeatedly during the past twentyfive years the senate committee on revolutionary claims in the fortythird congress made favorable report upon it and say this claim was not embraced in the settlement made between the united states and the state of georgia because at the time iw was not acknowledged by georgia and was only afterward established in a clear and satisfactory manner after is full and exhaustive examination soon after the payment of her bonds as described the state of georgia presented her claim to congress the committee on revolutionary claimsat the first session of the thirtysixth congress reported a bill for the payment of the amount hut congress adjourned without acting upon it and the war intervening the state of georgia is again presenting herself and asking reimbursement your committee are unable to see any good reason why the united states should not pay this debt it was valid against the state of georgia it has been paid by her and is already covered by the spirit of the law of august 5 t790 your committee think the united states should pay the principal of the debt claimed but not the interest and they report the bill referred to them back to the senate with an amendment and recommend its passage congress is not asked to pay interest on the aitount of the claim since january 1 1858 the time when it accrued in fvor of georgia but merely to reimburse the state for what it actually expended in liquidating the cost of supplies furnished to a body of continental soldiers at savannah while the war of the revolution was pending congress has reimbursed other states in like cases i do not care whether they are

items will be practically prohibitory so that we shall lose 46 000 revenue or nearly thatentirely that if it be prohibitory on sumac and we shall lose 87 000 on tanned goatskins what is the result the farmer has to compete with the foreigner who brings in goatskins untanned because that is the shape in which the goatskinsarrive and leave the hand of the farmer untanned goatskins are brought in free to compete with him but the tanner is not allowed to compete with the farmer and the sumacgatherer is not allowed to compete with the farmer both of them have the benefit and the effect of that tax is to add to the price of morocco leather or leather out of which the common ladies shoes are made so that when a farmer comes to buy a pair of sunday shoes for his wife or daughter he has to pay an increased tribute under this bill first to the sumacgatherer which helps the tariff men andsecondly to the tanner which also helps them and lastly the revenues are decreased 150 000 the committee
