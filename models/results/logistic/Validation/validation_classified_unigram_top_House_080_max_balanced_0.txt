program under date of march 3 194 i discussed the pending federal antilynching bill as will be seen by the congressional record beginning at page 2057 on march 24 1948 i discussed the proposal to abolish the poll tax by federal legislation as will be seen on page 3397 of the april 1 1948 i discussed the proposal to outlaw segregation by federal legislation as will be seen on page 3965 of the congressional record i now discuss the socalled fair employment practices commission as advocated by the president perhaps the greatest moral tragedy of our age is the growing tendency of virtue to make concessions to vice during the 1930s the greatest example was the repeal of the eighteenth amendment which sacrified morality to political expediency during the 1940s the great example is the socalled civil rights issue on the insistence of a small but powerful group of radical specialinterest minorities the chief executive of our land has been intimidated to the extent that he has advocated legislation that is in direct violation of the fundamental principles upon which our government was founded the president has bartered his political virtue for a mess of partisan pottage it is up to us to see that our american birthright is not a part of the bargain the antilynching bill the antipolltax bill and the antisegregation bill are bad enough but the most iniquitous of the presidents recommendations is the proposal for a permanent fair employment practices commission this piece of legislation is the darling of every radical negro communist and socialistic organization in the nation the startling thing is that the president of the united states should give aid and comfort to those who propose to destroy the american way of life it is difficult to believe that his civilrights message with its preposterous recommendations was a sincere statement of his own convictions it is easier to believe that the entire civilrights message was a shallow bid for votes from the wallace fringe a concession from a normally virtuous democrat to the vicious radical elements of our nation the president has the reputation of being loyal to his friends the experience of his southern friends fails to justify that reputation for the president has repudiated the debt of gratitude that he owes to the south his civilrights message displayed nothing but contempt for the friendship and loyalty of those who are directly responsible for his being in the white house if it had not been for the southern delegates to the democratic convention in 1944 henry a wallace would today be president of the united states it was the south that blocked wallaces nomination and paved the way for the nomination of harry s truman as a running mate to the ailing franklin d roosevelt and made harry s truman heirapparent to the presidency and how does mr truman express his gratitude by turning his back on his southern friends and supporters by lending the prestige of his high office to the efforts of conscienceless purveyors of hate and deceit to crush human dignity in the southland in his recent special message to the congress the president said the world situation is too critical and the responsibilities of this country are too vast to permit party struggles to weaken our influence for maintaining peace the american people have the right to assume that political considerations will not affect our working together it is difficult to reconcile this attitude with the attempt of the president and his advisers to force antilynching antipoll tax antisegregation and fepc legislation on the people of the south and thus shatter the unity of the democratic party during the most critical period in history for these measures can spell nothing but disunity not for the democratic party alone but for the entire united states the enactment of fepc legislation alone would do more to create social and industrial disunity than all the vicious propaganda of communism it is apparent to all but those who refuse to see that the fepc is nothing but a major objective of the communist party it is designed to destroy our republican form of government by regimenting the nations business and industry the communists are counting on the fact that in an election year neither major party will dare to alienate any minority group by refusing to support a measure that is falsely assumed to help minority groups the communists are counting on the fact that the democratic party in endeavoring to win back the fickle radicals in the wallace camp will pledge itself to any obnoxious platform and the communists are counting on the fact that the republican party in its traditional bid for the negro vote will continue to wave the red banner of fepc is it true then that the american peoplb have the right to assume that political considerations will not affect our working together what is in this fepc that makes it so dangerous the fepc would provide severe punishment for employers judged to be guilty of practicing racial discrimination in the hiring and promotion of workers it proposes to set up a permanent commission to investigate and determine whether an employer is guilty of race prejudice in the conduct of his business we had a brief but bitter taste of fepc during the war when it functioned on a temporary basis fepc has made little progress in any state in the state of new york where there is a considerable radical minority there is a state fepc pressure groups have managed to force similar measures through the legislatures of new jersey and connecticut in no instance in which a state has adopted fepc have the people been given an opportunity to approve or disapprove in every case it has been adopted by the legislature acting under pressure in 1946 the people of california had an opportunity to express their views on fepc in spite of the fact that there is a large radical and socialistic minority in california the fepc proposal was turned down by clear majorities in every county in the state the people of the state of michigan will have an opportunity to vote on this issue this year and even fepc supporters acknowledge that it has little chance of being approved for the people of the united states recognize fepc for just what it is a communist inspired conspiracy to undermine american unity the fepc is not an assault on the south alone it is equally dangerous to all industry in all parts of the country fepc operation at the present time in the state of new york is working a serious hardship on industry in that state inasmuch as it takes personnel control in a business or industry out of the hands of the owners and places that control in the hands of a bureaucratic commission which may dictate policies of hiring and firing in the state of new york it is now illegal to carry on personnel practices which have always been regarded as fundamental to sound business to indicate how new yorks fepc plays havoc with the hiring procedure alone let me cite a few examples it is unlawfulto make inquiry into the original name of the applicant for employment whose name has been changed by court proceedings or otherwise it is unlawfulto make inquiry into the birthplace of the applicant for employment the birthplace of the parents spouse or other close relative it is unlawful to requirean applicant for employment to produce a birth certificate it is unlawful to inquire into the religious denomination of an applicant for employment his religious affiliations his church parish pastor or religious holidays observed an employer cannot even ask whether an applicant for employment is an atheist it is unlawful to inquire about the race or color of an applicant for employment it is unlawful also to require an applicant to submit a photograph with his application for employment these are just a few of the tyrannical restrictions that the fepc places on a business or industry it denies a businessman the right to say what kind of people will work in his organization if there is a greater imposition on personal liberty than this it is difficult to imagine what it could be it requires no great imagination to see what would be the result if this kind of legislation were foisted upon the people of the united states it would open wide the doors of every business in the nation to those agitators who are skillful in fomenting racial unrest every industry every business in the nation which did not employ certain minority racial groups would be subject to severe penalties every industry every business in the nation could be required to employ unqualified incompetent persons merely to avoid any stigma of prejudice or discrimination every member of every minority group could bring charges justified or not against his employer or against a prospective employer seeking to demonstrate that employment or a coveted promotion was denied him on the basis of his race creed or color with enough communist agitators in the field life for a southern businessman would be one continual round of lawsuits and court appearances a perpetual inquisisition conducted by bureaucratic fepc investigators the fact of innocence would be no defense for an employer could be held responsible for the intolerances and prejudices of his employees if they happen to resent the employment of a member of a particular race or religious group there are many industries in which employers have no jurisdiction over the choice of employees inasmuch as the union dictates who shall be hired most unions have written or unwritten regulations limiting their membership to members of the white race in such a case if an employer fails to hire a negro he violates the fepc laws if he does hire the negro he violates his union contract no matter what happens he is bound to lose this is the kind of inequity that we are asked to sanctify by federal law to do so is to fly in the face of all history which teaches that prejudice cannot be overcome by coercion that the only real answer to discrimination is better racial understanding through the forces of religion and education this is a critical period of national and world history it is no time to allow our legislative machinery to become stalled by fepc debate it is no time to permit communist agitators to disrupt our national unity by spreading distrust and misunderstanding among racial and minority groups it is no time for virtue to make concessions to vice"], [0.04285426065325737, 0.04285426065325737, 0, "i ask unanimous consent that the conferees on

claimed that this is a better bill than that one if this is a better bill perhaps if we wait another couple of years the committee will report a still better bill and one which is more just to the shippers and consumers the underlying reason for bringing out this bill is of course to preclude the state of georgia and the united states from proceeding with its action against the railroads which are charged with being guilty of violating the antitrust law i do not see why we should deprive the courts of the right to pass upon that important question whether these railroads are guilty or not i am of the opinion that neither the department of justice nor the state of georgia would have proceeded against them unless they had sufficient evidence to justify the action the billbefore us is in the interest of the railroads that desire to agree between themselves as torates the bill favors the steel oil and other big shippers and will operate against the smaller shippers and naturally against the consumers i know that the gentlemen who have prepared the views of the minority which i consider a very splendid and honest r~sum6 of conditions will explain later on the unjustifiable desire and insistence upon passing this legislation before the courts can act on it so i shall not dwell any further upon the provisions of the bill because the gentleman who signed the minority report the gentleman from minnesota has devoted much time and study to the bill and can explain it more satisfactorily and in much clearer terms than i possibly can but i do say this you gentlemen claim you want free enterprise free enterprisei hear that every day this actually kills free enterprise i do not see how you will be able to justify yourselves iu voting for the bill of course the railroads want it so i know that it will be passed because unfortunately they have a way of misleading congress and legislative bodies in such smooth and convincing ways thatmany of you gentlemen feel sorryand sometimes almost cryfor these unfortunate railroads that have suffered so much of course they did suffer during the years 1930 up to 1934 under hoover many of themwent into bankruptcy but since that time since the democratic party came into power those railroads have accumulated tremendous profits and surpluses as my colleague the gentleman from illinois a member of the judiciary committee has stated on the floor so many times so really if his investigation as to the great increase in incomes on the part of the railroads is trueand i have utmost confidence in him because i know he is an honorable and honest man and has given the house the facts when he has tried to impress the house with the real facts relative to the railroadsi do not see how you can vote for this bill nevertheless i feel that a vast majority of the members have again been led astray by the strong and powerful railroad lobbyists and the capable gentlemen representing them here and they have again impressed the membership with the great need of this legislation that has tied their hands as it is claimed in that they were expected to comply with the law of the land and not violate any special secret agreements made against the shippers after all it is the consumer who has to pay the bill i am not going to detain the house the rule will be passed i know and i strongly suspect that even this bill will be passed notwithstanding the fact that the senate has acted already and has eliminated a provision whereby the action pending against these railroads should be allowed to proceed to a conclusion in this bill that is brought before us however that provision is eliminated i cannot understand why people should rely on the other house to safeguard and protect their interests up to a few years ago the country looked to congress now it looks to the senate to save the people from the arbitrary action of this body but it seems to me much as i dislike to say it that conditions are changing in fact i know they are changing consumers will get no protection here however i believe that after the next election there will be people elected who will represent the real democracy and the rights and interests of the masses of the people in the country in conclusion let me call attention to the following paragraphs which appear in the minority report and more thoroughly explain why this legislation would be against the best interest of the small shipper and the consumer who after all as i stated before will be obliged to foot the bill it is denied that the reason for pressing these suits is the pending suits against the railroads the proponehts of the bill claim that the legislation is needed merely to clarify existing law to allow carriers to ges together in order to c6mply with the interstate commerce act particularly as to the making of joint rates and through route the minority maintains that the legislation is not needed for that purpose because the carriers now have authority to collaborate in making such rates some have attempted to interpret oppoltion to passage of this legislation as an indication of lack of confidence in the interstate commerce commission whether the commission is competent or whether it would faithfully discharge its duty imposed by this legislation is not germane under the terms of the bill once the basic agreement of the association of american railroads and its satellite organizations are approved by the commission the subsequent acts performed under the agreements do not have to be approved by the interstate commerce commission but are exempt from the antitrust laws because the acts are carried on pursuant to the basic agreement it goes without saying that the basic agreements offered for approval will not be likely to indicate practices that would preclude their approval under the vague standards set up by the bill such as indicated in paragraph 2 typical of which is the requirement that the commission shall approve the agreement if it finds it is in furtherance of the national transportation policy declared in this act the most vicious feature of paragraph 4 is that it provides for approval of agreements between carriers of different classes thereby extending the monopoly power to the whole industry collectively under these provisions the railroads motor carriers water carriers and so on could take part in one organization and control the rates and services for each class of transportation so as to determine the freight charges paid by shippers and the service they are to receive the terms of the paragraph providing for approval of agreements as to joint rates or through routes do not limit the arrangements to connecting carriers actually handling the traffic and thereby participating in the joint rate an agreement could be approved under which a composite organization of carriers of all classes could determine the joint rates of any connecting carriers as the greater part of the traffic of the nation moves on joint rates such an organization would be one of the most powerful forces for monopoly in the entire economic system"]], "top_incorrect":

figures furnished by the secretary of agriculture mr anderson it has been my observation that as a general rule the department of agriculture and the secretary of agriculture can be relied upon to give the most accurate figures available to members of congress and the public the publication the agricultural outlook which is put out by the department of agriculture carried one figure with respect to the disposition of our wheat supplies since july 1 1947 and the secretary in his testimony before the house and senate committees it is claimed gave a different figure which was an increase in availability of wheat over the figures in the outlook to the extent of 82 500 000 bushels i merely wish to point out that i find in checking the matter that the figures compiled for the publication agricultural outlook charts had to be prepared somewhat in advance of its printing and that the figures given by the secretary of agriculture were the very latest revised figures all the figures given were mere estimates of the possible distribution of our grain since july 1 1947 to date in the publication entitled agricultural outlook charts 1948 the following estimates of the disposition of wheat in the united states for the year beginning july 1 1947 were made bushels food 510 000 000 feed 3 25 000 000 seed 87 500 000 industrial uses 5 000 000 total 927 500 000 the secretary of agriculture in his statement on december 6 gave the following estimates bustels food 510 000 000 feed 250 00 000 seed 85 000 000 total 845 000 000 there is no mystery about the alteration in the estimates made by the secretary of agriculture on december 6 you will note that in the earlier estimate it was thought that 325 000 000 bushels of wheat would be used for feed for livestock in the december 6 estimate the secretary had revised the amount to a greatly reduced figure of 250 000 000 bushels this is the principal variation and is explained in the following statement by mr 0 v wells director of the bureau of agricultural economics as follows the chief revision is in the estimated amount of wheat which will be fed to livestock originally this e3timate ran 325 000 000 bushels at a time when there was considerable fear that we would have an early frost and a soft corn crop and at a time when prices of wheat and corn per bushel were at about the same level within the last two months or so however the price of wheat has moved above the price of corn good growing conditioni have yielded a corn crop of good quality and we now have available actual estimates of the disappearance of wheat for feed or farm waste during the first quarter of the year beginning july 1 1947 which indicate that about 60 000 000 bushels of wheat was fed to livestock as a result our estimates of the amount of wheat used for feed have been revised down to 250 000 000 bushels for the current year and there is some belief that it may run even lower than this the other slight variations in estimates are well explained by mr wells but i see no necessity for elaborating with regard to them"], [0.8322954773902893, 0.8322954773902893, 0, "on july 18 1946 when word came to me that clarence hancock would not

provides consideration and 2 hours of general debate on h r 3813 a bill to provide for removal from and the prevention of appointment to offices or positions in the executive branch of the government of persons who are found to be disloyal to the united states generally speaking the bill establishes procedures for eliminating disloyal persons from the federal pay roll it also provides a number of safeguards so that loyal americans will never be purged from the federal pay roll because of legitimate political convictions i will not touch upon the specific provisions of the bill the chairman and the members of the committee on post office and civil service will explain and discuss the bill in detail but i would like to take just a minute to make a personal observation regarding communism as i have pointed out this bill provides a number of safeguards for loyal americans and i repeat no loyal american should ever be purged from the federal pay roll because of legitimate political convictions but i do not regard communism as a legitimate political conviction nor for that matter as a political conviction at all communism is a moral issue and it must be regarded as such if we are to prevent the enslavement of the american people by this foreign ideology when discussing politics we must proceed from the premise that governments were created by men and for mento protect and further the rights and interests of men when i speak of a legitimate political conviction i mean a conviction based upon that fundamental premise morals on the other hand are definite standards of relationship between man and his creator between man and his fellow man and between men and their government morals establish certain rights for all men and these rights are due him merely by virtue of his being these rightswhich we call morals are not within the purview of governments to change but merely to protect now my point is this political convictions concern themselves with the methods and techniques of guaranteeing these fundamental rights of all human beings but any attempt to deny that human beings have certain rights is not a political conviction but an encroachment of our moral standard there is ample room for most variations of opinion on the best method of effectuating this fundamental purpose of government and such disagreements are within the legitimate realm of politics but a disagreement on the purpose of the state and of government can only be discussed as a moral issue by virtue of their being all men should have the opportunity to provide themselves a decent standard of living workingmen have the right tc good working conditionsall men have the right to own propertyand there are many other rights which men have and these rights are above question it is the sole function of politics to determine the method by which these rights can be accorded in the most equitable manner but to deny that men have these rights or to make them secondary to the will of the government is not political chicanery but moral turpitude throughout history men have recognized that all personal freedom must proceed from specific limitation on the power of the government over its citizens yet none of the great documents of history attempted to define the rights of men the makers of these documents presumed and rightfully so that human beings have certain rights which were given and defined by the creator the magna carta the bill of rights the delaration of independence and the constitutionnone of these great documents asked for any rights but all declared that men have certain rights which must be observed by the government now to prove that communism is immoral we need only agree that states and governments were created to serve men entirely inconsistent with this fundamental concept the hegelian dialecticthe basic creed of communistsmaintains that the state is an organism and that men were created merely to nourish the state and to contribute to its growth the citizens in such a state have no rights whatsoever and no protection exists against the power of the government it is obvious that any such denial of the fundamental rights of men is not a political doctrineit is an immoral usurpation of the dignity of the human personality communism in practice is a crime against humanity and the communist party is a conspiracy to deprive men of their natural rights i have spoken of communism but what i have said applies to fascism and all other isms which make human liberty secondary to the will of the government this congress cannot stand by idly and

the services was first brought to the attention of the old committee on military affairs i had a lot of reservations about adopting this as a policy in america of course we had never done it before however many of us traveled throughout the world during the war years and saw these girls in many parts of the world performing duties that were hard and arduous many times in places that we probably thought they should not be i never heard one of them complain of the duties they wereasked to perform during all their years of service about a quarter of a million or more girls served in these services during the war as waves wacs spars and wasps like the gentleman who just preceded me i think the wasps deserve recognition they performed a very arduous and hard task in many parts of the world primarily the reason i am supporting this legislation at the present time is that in a few weeks we will probably be asked to raise the number of personnel in our armed forces i think we are all aware of the emergency that exists today with reference to the trained personnel which our armed services are trying to get along with to perform their duties and maintain a fighting force during the war it required about 10 men back of the lines to support every fighting man today the army is trying to get along with four men supporting one fighting man it cannot be done and have an efficient army we hear accusations today that the armed forces of our country have become topheavy and that it is entirely an administrative job it is a big job it is a job that we do not think about and appreciate here as we should it is expending more money and is a larger organization than united states steel or sears roebuck and a half dozen other of the largest american concerns today it simply cannot function unless we as the constituted body and authority here give to the army navy and marine corps what they need to perform their duties i have before me a chart which was presented to us this morning in the committee on armed services showing the strength as of today at 1 376 408 men i also have a chartwhich shows what that force will be as of march of next year if the rate of enlistment gains and discharges continues as at present we are considering legislation now which in my opinion can be helpful in this situation from the best information that we can secure there seems to be about 2 percent of the jobs in the army which it is estimated will be filled by this group of people whether in the reserve status or permanent status under the reserve bill as presented here today by the committee on armed services they have full authority to call in as many as they care to call in for service duty i believe it would be helpful in this present hour we are not assured as to whether or not this body and the senate will adopt the legislation as requested by the armed forces and by the president that is the socalled draft measure so in view of that fact i think we should not hesitate to adopt this legislation and put it into operation as quickly as possible there is a group of people of course and i do not know how many that we can get fn on a volunteer basis and there are others who will have to come back from the reserve corps not to permit them to serve their country in some capacity would be rather disastrous in my opinion in the present hour i have a chart in my hand showing the manpower pool in the 19 to 25yearold group the total in that pool is 8 410 560 those with prior service in that pool is 3 371 300 which would be exempt under the present legislation being considered the total who had no service because of physical defects is 1 489 500 the total number nonflt veterans is 1 181 800 so you finally wind up in this pool with an army of single nonveteran nonfather status of 1 362 000 people that is the pool you will have to deal with if you get the socalled regular army which they tell us they must have of around 700 000 we are going

labor which local has been actively opposing the presidents loyalty program is about to leave the department of labor to work privately on confidential matters with her father david lilienthal the newly appointed head of the atomic energy commission in this connection the following portion of an article which appeared in the february 1947 issue of plain talk should be of interest his daughter nancy an employee of the department of labor and a member of the united public workers a communistdominated union only recently displayed her strong prosoviet attitude at the beginning of december 1946 at a meeting of her local a proposal had been made to indorse the resolution of the atlantic city cio convention condemning communism the fight against the indorsement was led with success by nancy lilienthal it may be that nancys outlook had been conditioned not by her father but by her mother for mrs lilienthal is reliably reported to have belonged in the middle thirties to several front organizations i sincerely trust for the future security of the united states that president truman will see that all employees of the atomic energy commission are investigated by a competent board to determine their loyalty after all it is a privilege to be an employee of our federal government and not a right mr cox democrat of georgia will the gentleman yield mr busszy i will be glad to yield to the distinguished gentleman from georgia mr cox i would like to make the observation that the appointment of mr lilienthal to the atomic energy commission is one thing that only god himself can explain the blast in the house it may be noted came the week after the senate following bitter and savage wrangling had confirmed lilienthals nomination by a vote of 50 to 31 there will be more of these uproars they will increase in violence as our relations with moscow worsen the net result damaging of course to the morale of the nation is that the confidence of americans in the one man to whom is entrusted the greatest war secret in the history of the world will be sapped truman of course pulled one of the biggest boners when he sent the name of lilienthal to the senate lilienthal wounded himself and the men who had battled with him for tva and everything that tva stood for when he permitted his name to be considered six months hence its an even money shot that lillenthal will have quit his post or stubbornly and to the detriment of national security will be defending himself against communist charges even more violent than those already in the record and the most devastating from the standpoint of the nation will be the charges that never get into print or never are heard over the air waves the national caliber of the senators who voted against lilienthal on the grounds that when it came to protecting the atom secret he did not have the confidence of a nation behind him was impressive party lines were kicked out the window voting against lilienthal were such democrate as byrd of virginia and the veteran mccarran of nevada lining up with ohios republican bricker governor deweys running mate in 44 and ohios other presidential aspirant taft they simply didnt want lillienthal because they figured the nationunjustly perhapswas worried when it came to the atom bomb secret and had sent out the call put only americans on guard tonight these would have

are considering this rule and resolution today because the new legislative reorganization act and a provision therein requires that the joint congressional budget committee meet and report back to the congress by february 15 its recommendation as to the ceiling which shall be placed upon the annual budget and federal spending in the coming fiscal year the legislative reorganization act was enacted by a democratic congress either the congress and the members of the dembcratic party who voted for the legislative reorganization act and the provisions of the act which require that a ceiling be fixed on expenditures with the very thought and purpose that such a ceiling would help bring about some sort of economy in the government were sincere or they are insincere if they were sincere then they are insincere now in opposing this rule and resolution if they are sincere now then they were insincere a few months ago when they voted for the reorganization act and the requirement that a budget ceiling be fixed i wonder if during general debate some of the gentlemen who have already spoken will tell us which time they actually were sincere and which time they were insincere in the opposite positions they have taken on this matter the gentleman from new york chairman of the congressional budget committee spoke and voted against the provision of the legislative fteorganization act which required this budget ceiling to be fixed and this report to be made he pointed out the difficulties which would be encountered at the time the legislative reorganization act was before us and offered an amendment to strike out that section of the bill but the democratic majority voted almost solidly against his amendment and for keeping the budget ceiling requirement in the act now they are condemning the very measure that they wrote into the law of the land i give the gentleman from new york great credit for his present position despite the fact he did not want the provision of the law requiring this ceiling and report he has done his best to comply with the law and to make the report as required of course the democratic members of that joint budget committee had the full right and complete authority to bring in a minority report and to set forth therein the figure at which they believed the budget ceiling should be fixed by the congress however they failed to do that instead they simply wrote a sort of a nambypamby minority view saying oh we are for economy and a budget ceiling but we are not going to tell you how much i also want to pay my sincere respects to the members of the democratic party who put the welfare of their country ahead of partisanship and joined with the republican majority in fixing the 31 500 000 000 budget ceiling the republicans along with the courageous democrats on this committee have told you how much they want congress to cut the presidents budget they want it reduced by 6 000 000 000 any one who stands up here oh this floor and tells you it cannot be done is not interested in economy why of course the moneyspenders do not want to cut the budget why should they that is the way they were elected and reelected until the people finally caught up with the fraudulence of their political operations certainly they will try to tell you it is still necessary in the third peacetime year after the war to spend four times as much to operate this government as was spent in any prewar peacetime year under franklin d roosevelt when we were spending our way into prosperity yes we want to cut public spending by 6 000 000 000 we are being mighty good to you spenders but you do not realize it you should be grateful to us that we did not make the budget cut 7 500 000 000 instead of only six billion but we will be back next year with another budget cut for we are determined to have greater economy in our government let me say to the gentlemen on my right who in past congresses have made the greatest spending record in all history that you have voted this country into its present condition you also created the demand by your wild profligacy which caused the people to speak out on november 5 and say they were tired of the reckless waste and extravagance of the federal government by their votes the people clearly demonstrated they wanted a congress which would do something about it all oz us who ran on the republican ticket and many of you who ran as democrats promised the people we would do something to curb this reckless waste of the federal taxpayers money well i think i can guarantee you gentlemen on the right one thingthe republicans in this house are going to do something about it by supporting this resolution when it comes to a vote i rather suspect there will be a great many democrats do likewise i have heard much talk here today about the army and the navy you and i know that the army and the navy appropriations are not going to be cut to where our national defense or security are endangered yet every veteran who served in the late war and every officer down in the war department as far as that is concerned knows that there is waste and extravagance in our military structure which can and should be eliminated without in any way endangering our national security the fiscal leaders of this congress pledge us they will eliminate waste and extravagance wherever found in the war and navy departments but that there will be no reductions in appropriations for true national defense and security needs i think we can depend upon the loyalty and patriotism of these men being just as great as that of any other member of this house but i want to refer back to one or two statements which have been made here today i love and respect every member of the committee on rules they

betterment of labors status rejects the communistic and the new deal concept that a single group can benefit while the general economy suffers we cannot expect to solve all labormanagement problems by

right to take a greater part in their problems no one should condone jurisdictional disputes wildcat strikes secondary boycotts mass picketing and violence and destruction of property secondary

though he employed a union driver these union leaders on dock street gave one of the merchants 15 minutes to get off the street this merchant had worked on this street for 57 years the union demands that an employer may be permitted on the firms premises on saturday morning provided permission to do so is obtained from the union in advance the union also demands that where a partnership of two persons exists but who employ no salesmen one member of that partnership must be a member of this union therefore in the event of a strike one partner would be forced to picket the other this industrial unrest proves that our present labor laws are thoroughly inadequate of attaining industrial peace and we intend to do something about it in terms of what is best for all of the people but in finding the solution for labor abuses we should not abolish labor unions the right to strike industrywide bargaining the union shop and the checkcff are union fundamentals if you outlaw industrywide bargaining you will create industrial strife in such industries as steel automobile clothing longshoremen coal rubber and newspaper unions if the employers and employees want to bargain on an industrywide or area basis i see no objection you are not going to stop strikes but you will create thousands of strikes i have not heard a sound argument yet to abolish industrywide bargaining if you outlaw industrywide bargaining strong unions will have an excellent chance of picking the smaller employers one by one as a result of the abolition of industrywide bargaining we will return to cutthroat competition scab coal mines and sweatshops we certainly do not want the government to take over all of the functions of labor and management if we have to regulate and regiment the employees and employers we might as well repeal the national labor relations act and save the taxpayers the money of administering it the workers and management would have more freedom without these regulations i would also like to discuss briefly three other proposals in this bill the first is the definition of employee there is some doubt as to whether an employee has a right to strike for legitimate reasons under the present definition the second is the welfare funds under section 8 a 2 c this section of the bill would invalidate thousands of our existing healthbenefit agreements these welfare funds should be left to collective bargaining i see no reason why we should even try to protect the employer on this subject because the employer certainly has a right to reject such a proposal the third point is the automatic checkoff especially where a union shop exists the employer should have the right of deciding whether or not he wants to give the automatic checkoff the automatic checkoff in many cases is very convenient to the employer i have talked to hundreds of businessmen in the past year and not a single one has asked me to outlaw the checkoff it should be left to collective

is out on strike say about onefourth his daily wages earned in the mines and no increase in union dues to be imposed a cut to onehalf of all union officials salaries during the time of strike such a law would stop this strike business the wage earner at present pays the bill for a strike let the union officials help pay the bill and also pay the striker enough to partly keep him out of debt and half enough to eat we do not want to lose our union but we do feel we should have a voice in it if we want to accept an offer made or not the most of us know that the longer a strike lasts the more

think it is a very worthy extension of the post graduate training of naval officers for the navy and i think the appropriation authorized in the bill for the purchase of the property is very reasonable the reason i am saying anything about the matter at all is that this bill does not add to the undergraduate training of officer personnel for the navy there is a desperate need at present for an undergraduate school on the pacific coast in addition to the one at annapolis i know the custom and tradition and the opposition to extending the undergraduate school beyond annapolis but we all know that annapolis is limited insofar as expansion is concerned and that something will have to be done to provide additional naval training facilities soon there is not a better place in the united states for training undergraduate naval officers than on the pacific coast and i mean particularly in southern california because of the yeararound fine climate and the facilities for extensive training on land sea underseas and in the air i have introduced bills on two occasions to accomplish that purpose and i trust that the committee on the armed services when it comes to the consideration of these bills will give them serious consideration in the interest of providing additional officer personnel for the naval forces which is limited insofar as the facilities at annapolis are concerned eventually we will have to have apother undergraduate naval officers school and it should be on the pacific coast i hope the pending bill will pass because i believe it is very necessary but i am also taking this time to call to the attention of the house the fact that we do need additional facilities i hope the time will come when we will have them"], [0.0006909966468811035,

with a young man who had just returned from the philippines a boy who was a draftee after the war he said that we americans are thoroughly despised at least the boys get that vibration from the

it is entirely in order that this matter be considered by the united nations and that we have no legislation here at all i believe the people of the world and the people of this country are sick unto
