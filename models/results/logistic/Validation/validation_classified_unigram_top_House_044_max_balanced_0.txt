party i have the honor in part to represent on this floor and the republican party i hope to be able briefly to recur to those most prominent it can doubtless be said with truth as a general proposition that the longcontinued retention of power by any party in any country begets corruption it can certainly be truthfully stated that this general condition is exemplified by republican rule in as brief a manner as possible i propose to show by figures and undisputed facts that since the conclusion of the late war the expenses of all the different departments of the government have been on the increase that while all the valuable industries are languishing while all the products of labor are decreasing in value while the agricultural manufacturing mercantile and labor interests are under the influeuce of stagnation that almost equals death offices and officeholders are increasing in number and public expenditures consequently alarmingly increasing in amount that moneywealth instead of being diffused among the many and throughout the producing districts is rapidly accumulating in the few and in the cities that we have fallen upon those times that either from unwise administration or some other unfortunate and uncomprehended coudition the rich few are daily becoming richer and the poor many who are the bone and sinew of the state are daily becoming poorer assuming that this state of affairs exists the highest duty of a representative of the people is to carefully study the situation and attempt to apply a remedy one remedy from which immediate relief must result to the people is by reducing expenditures and thereby decreasing the burdens of taxation it has been the effort of the majority of this house from the first day of this session until now to decrease the financial budget for the present year although enthralled as we have been by constant opposition from the minority there has been a reduction of over 39 000 000 without interfering with the efficiency of any of the departments of the government to this redaction a factious and unauthorized opposition has been developed in the senate the repablican branch of congress and while their leading representatives are constantly promulgating theories of rigid economy for the 1boring millions they oppose with desperate energy every effort to deprive the officil household of any of their gaudy trappings useless display and riotous extravagance the democrats demand as the representatives of the people that the strictest economy shall be practiced in the administration of public affairs that useless offices shall be abolished and that useless officeholders shall be driven to prod ucing pursuits that instead of absorbing the hardearned wages of the poor they shall by labor be compelled to add their quota to the wealth of the state before i conclude it will be my attempt to show that offices and officeholders in the midst of the general depression that has surrounded us for the last few years have been almost constantly increasing that the apparent attempt has been to make places to reward partisans rather than to consider the welfare of the people or the economy of public administration it cannot be doubted that without damage to public interest from four to five hundred millions of dollars could hav e been saved to the people in the last ten years the saving of which would have prevented the present depressed condition of affairs and the untold and littleunderstood misery and unhappiness that it entails what then is our duty and what do the people demand retrenchment economy and reform are demanded by the people the eloquent appeals of unscrupulous politicians to secure partisan triumph and the rhetorical fulminations of partisan laudation partisan honesty and partisan integrity in this oftenreferredto centennial year will not suffice to meet their demands they demand of their servants to whom they have confided the control of this great and free nation that they shall be frugal honest and economical in all their expenditures avnd expel froom the public service at once and forever all venal incompetent and corrupt men they demand sir that fraud and corruption shall at once cease in every department of the government and that there be an immediate return on the part of all officials to that economy patriotism and virtne which characterized the conduct and action of our fathers they demand a reduction of expenditures in every branch of the govern meat and that not one dollar nor one dime more than is absolutely required for carrying on our federal affairs shall be appropriated from their depleted treasury they demand that the extravagance and reckless expenditures which have crept into the various departments within the past fifteen years shall absolntely and forever cease they have witnessed with sorrow and indignation the frauds the pecnlations and the arbitrary acts of the party in power they have seen their treasury despoiled their constitution wantonly violated their states subverted and their legislatures dispersed to maintain the power patronage and supremacy of a party fraud and corruption in office are almost as frequent as the offices themselves are numerous and time greatest violators of law have their apologists among the highest officials in the land the history of civil service as administered by the party in power is a recital of extravagance fraud and corruption men occupying high and responsible positions as government officials whose characters are blackened by crime and who are in some instances arraigned before the tribunals of their country to answer indictment are still recognized as suitable persons to perform the functions of their high offices rings have been formed with and without congressional aid for the purpose of plundering from the peoples treasury the results of their hardearned gains money is deified and wealth is so centralized that free institutions are endangered and the rightful power of the people destroyed a disregard for the sacred teachings of the constitution aid a contempt for the forms of law mark the advent and the reign of the party in power and will result in their overthrow partydespotism is unrelenting in its demands and lie who profits by its influenecs is compelled to wear like gurth the collar around his neck marked this is the born thrall of cedric the saxon but sir the time has come and very fortunately too for the welfare of the country that empty promises and loud professions of economy by political parties will not satisfy the demands of the overtaxed people they have declared for true economy in every department of the government and that all reckless expenditure shall absolutely cease they have defied the authority of party which for so many years has chained the country to the car of corruption with united voice they demand that their servants in all official positions must be honest economical and competent we areadmonished daily by the condition of all our material interests that retrenchment economy and reform in all the departments of the government are absolutely required for the perpetuity and preservation of the life of the nation american commerce has almost abandoned the high seas the agriculturists of the country are bowed to the earth with low prices and oppressive taxation and are struggling on their broad acres for a bare existence the factories and machineshops are nearly all idle mechanics are thrown out of employment and in many instances are without the actual necessaries of life destitutioi nod misery are stalking from city to city from hamlet to village and from ocean to ocean while the business of the country is paralyzed and universal bankruptcy threatens the whole people the burdens of taxation are more oppressive ruinous and exacting than ever before national taxes stale taxes county taxes town taxes mnnicipal taxes the collctor is as inevitable as the grim messenger of death incomes profits wages al these fail but taxes rise during the year 1875 there were 7 740 business failures in thiscountry whose aggregate losses were v201 060 353 and during the first three months of the year 1876 the failures mounted to 2 806 and the losses amounted to 04 644 156 if the failures continue tbiroughout the remainder of this year in the same proportion they will present the startling number of 11 224 while the aggregate losses will reach the enormous sum of 258 500 000 with these nimerous evidences of financial ruin which are constantly presented to the minds of tbe people is it surprising that they should forget party ties and leaders and look only to the protection of themselves and the preservation of their government from universal bankruptcy and decay the great political revolution that swept over this country in 1874 and gave to the democratic party a niojority in this branch of the legislative department was inaugurated by the people of all political parties in the interest of economy retrenchment and reform and si if we prove faithful to our trusts and obey the demands of the people in appropriating such sunis of money only as are requisite and necessary for an economical admiiistration the ides of november next will witness a revolution at the ballotbox unequaled in the annals of our political history sir understanding as i think i do the wants and desires of the people whom i have the honor to represent knowing too the hardships and privations to which they are subjected by cruel and reckless legislation and oppressive taxation i am ready and willing to vote for all necessary appropriations for an economical administration of the government bt not one dollar more i am one of those who hold that governments like individuals must be oconomical to be successful the question presented by the republican policy in their deteriniatiou to perpetuate present extravagance is whether we shall make further loans and spend the principal and go onlyfor a few years to come to the people for the interest or so increase the bur dens of taxation that the principal sum can be extorted from them annually while the majority of this house demand sueh reduction of expenditures that the inauguration of this republican policy is unnecessary the gentlemen on the republican side of this house insist that they are for retrenchment and reform wherever it is possible but when you propose the reduction of the salaries of any of the employds in the departments they say it is not practicable when you propose a reduction of the clerical force in any o f the departments of the government they say you cannot do it without seriously affecting the public service the truth is the loud professions of economy coming from the gentlemen on the other side are a deception they are istended to be extensively circulated over the country with the hope of del uding the people into the belief that they are in favor of reducing the expenditures while in reality they are here laboring and voting for excessive appropriations and high salaries which in the aggregate amount to many millions of dollars more than are required for an honest and economical administration in 1855 while discussing the appropriation bills of that year in the senate of the united states mr benton said that a practicl man acquainted with the objects for which the federal government was created and familiar with its financial workings from the time its fathers put it into operation could take his pen and cross out nearly the onehalf of the appropriations for that year and leave the govornment iu full vigor for all its proper objects and more pure by reducing the number of those who live upon the substance of the peop0e sir while thn committee on appropriations have not gone to the extent suggested by colonel benton in 1855 they have had the wisdom and courage to reduce the appropriation for this year 39 000 000 below last year and the democratic side of this house have had the courage and patriotism to stand by them in their labors i am aware sir that the annual saving of 39 000 000 is of small consequence to some of the gentlemeni on the other side of this house but it is of vast importance to the taxpaving people of the country who must meet it why the entire net ordinary expenses of this government for the year 1846 were only 26 418 459 59 being over 12 500 000 less than the reductions made by this house 1 desire in this connection to submit some carefully prepared tables showing the annual net ordinary expenses of the government exclusive of pensions and interest upon the national debt from 1852 to 1860 both inclusive and from 1867 to 1875 both inclusive 1852 37 988

net ordinary expenses for nne years from 1867 to 1875 1 376 806 720 0 here we see that the net ordinary expenses of the government for the nine years from 1867 to 1875 exclusive of pensions ael the interest upon the national debt exceed those for the nine years from 1852 to 1860 in the enormous sum of 865 515 915 73 nearly half enough to pay the whole national debt sir is it not time that the american people were ordering a halt in all extravagant legislation and reckless expenditures and demanding in the most emphatic manner a return to that economy and simplicity which are the safe guards of a republican form of government the people refuse longer to close their eyes to the imperial displays which are going on all around them and which not only threaten a subversion of free institutions but axe impoverishing and bankrupting the country in this connection mr speaker ji wish to present the following carefully prepared statement showing the amount of the different

our republican friends this house has reduced the appropriations for the fiscal year ending juno 30 1877 below the actual appropriations made by the last congress for the fiscal year ending juno 30 1876 ovex 39 000 000 and much larger reductions could have been made without injury to the public service had we but men at the head of our governmental iffairs who are in sympathy with the people and impressed with the necessity of economy and reform and yet sir after all that this congress has done in the reduction of expenditures and in lifting burdens from the shoulders of the people which have so grievously oppressed them for many years we are still told by our republican friends in this house that economy retrenchment and reform is the mere party cry of political demagogues sir the gentleman from nebraska struck the keynote of his party on that side of the house when but a few days ago on this floor he used the following words now i am not one of those gentlemen who advertise themselves in advaoe as being in favor of retrenchment and reform if there are any words of whirt i an sick and it there are words which have been used to cover up hypocrisy those are the words sir let me say to the gentleman and his political associates upon this floor that they will grow much sickorwhen they go back to their constituents and attempt to explain these words and their actions here in fighting to the death every effort at retrenchment and reform by this side of the house our action is potent and endowed with an energy adequate to a wholesome result and so gentlemen will find it at the polls i wish nowto call attention to another authentic statement showing the annual appropriations made by congress for defraying the expenses of the foldingroom for folding documents and speeches of members of congress fron 1861 to the psesent time i give this as another example of republican financial policy thqugh comparatively small in its results it is one of the patent indications of their extravaganpe and reckless disregard of the public treasury appropriations for house folding roomn 18111 30 000 00 1862 30 600 0 1063 30 000 00 1864 30 000 00 1805 30 000 00 186 30

the remarkable fact that from 1861 to 1867 during the whole period of the civil war when labor was high and our currency was depreciated to about forty cents on the dollar the actual expenses of the foldingroom were only 30 000 per annum while the appropriations for the same purpose from 1866 to 1875 when laborwaseheap and when too our currency had appreciated in valneto within a few cents of par averaged the enormous sum of 77 750 and for the year 1869 the appropriation amounted to 122 000 and for the years 1872 1873 and 1874the appropriationsreached the sum of 100 000 per annum during the last session of the fortythird congress when the republican majority saw that the control of this house was about to pass into the hands of the democratic party they were seized with a violent spasm of economy and in their appropriations for the fiscal year ending juno 30 1876 they allowed but 25 000 for the foldingroom they thus admitted that the democratic party could run this department of the government much more cheaply than they could but sir this reduction of expenditures in this branch of the service by our republican friends during the last session of the fortythird congress for the fiscal year ending june 30 1876 was not sufficient to satisfy the wishes of the majority of this house and they have reduced the appropriations for this purpose to 15 000 per annum the object of these excessive appropriations for the foldingroom while the house was under republican control was to enable them to use the public treasure to defray the expenses of their political campaigus by the distribution of documents and otherwise the objee of reduction to 25 000 by the republican house last session was to prevent the democratic party from using this weapon for the advancement of their cause the democratic party however represented as they are in this house by a majority and confident of its continuance by the people have further reduced the expenses of the foldingroom 10 000 thus showing by acts that they commend themselves to the people by true economy while sir it has been universally admitted that this house has the constitutional right to determine the rules of its own proceedings and to designate the number of its employds and the appropriations necessary to defray its annual expenses it has been left for the present senate to reverse this longestablished eustom and have constituted themselves the guardians of this house in the legislative oxoutive and judicial appropriation bill which originated in and passed this house april 28 1876 the number of employds and their salaries were fixed by this house and the necessary sums of money appropriated to meet the current expenses of this branch of the public service for the fiscal year ending juno 30 1877 but sir what is the condition of this bill when it has passed the senate i we see air that the number and compensation of the employds of the house of representatives have been increased by the senate amendments and the appropriations made by this house to defray its own expenses for the fiscal year enling june 30 1877 have also been increased by the senate amendments over 2 24 000 this is 224 000 more than this house deems requisite or necessary to defray its expenses for the present fiscal year and yet the senate insist that we must appropriate and expend this large ssum uselessly and extravagantly in this we have another specimen of republican economy and reforma policy which looks only to an extravagant expenditcre of the peoples money and a needless increase of the burdens of taxation a policy thatowered before the purifying influences of a bristow the greatest reformer of his party and finally forced him from the treasury department and caused the dismissal of almost every omployd who had aided his efforts or who dared to speak of him an terms of praise or admiration this is not the kind of reform demanded by the people of this country they oppose in the most emphatic manner the removal from office by the administration of such men as bristow and dyermen who have proven themselves the best and truest reformers of their party and who were ready and willing to strike down every violator of law wherever found regardless of partisan influences or political considerations no greater truth was ever uttered than that which fell from the lips of a prominent and influential republican of massachusetts a few days ago that reform within the republican party is out of the question at present and that the only hope of the country is ia the democrats u the"]],

for services rendered the indian department these vouchers are dated in 1872 1873 and 1874 this indebtedness on the part of the government was created by its authorized agents in the discharge of their official duties they invited the people of new mexico to sell to the government these supplies and in many instances they were furnished at very low rates the people in obedience to the proposals of these officers to furnish supplies in good faith and generally in accordance with a written contract delivered them to the officers receiving therefor these vouchers on which it was understood as is always the case they were to receive the money immediately as such transactions with the government are always on a cash basis these vouchers were issued by the indian agents in charge at the various reservations who received the property and bad full knowledge of all the details of each transaction they were until the office of superintendent of indian affairs was abolished

into the consideration of the question they would have made the discrepancy between the cost of the governicent printing and the cost at responsible private establishments much greater i hold in my hand executive document no 10 fortythird congress second session receipts and expenditures for the iiscil year ending jne 130 187 3 there is one sage of long psimer and six hundred and fiftysix pages of nonpareil type i have had this examined carefully as to what it would cost if done in private establishments in this city one estimate i have before me is 2 043 75 the estimates varied but a little the congressional printer charged 4 781 15 but i have not time to go into detail in reference to all matters these examples serve to cover the whole ground we find the same thing all the way through in reference to overcharges i oow come to the question of government binding we find there has been wasteful extravagance to use no harsher term in the orders given by the departments for various kinds and classes of binding i hold in mcy hand a book a bound book the birds of the northwest you will observe by looking at it where some of the goldleaf has been used so profusely of this book there were fifty bound at a cost of 212 50 or about 4 25 per volume for the binding alone this work was done for the interior department here is the report of the secretary of the interior volume i for 1875 of which five hundred copies were bound at a cost of 471 30 one hundred bond in the style which gentlemen cain see and four hundred in cloth the cloth copies according to the estimates cost about twenty cents a volume which would leave the cost of this bound copy at aboot 3 90 per volume in examining the report of the secretary of war by the way i saw that 1 290 was charged fdr binding a few books i could not understand it and made inquiries and found that they were photographic views which had bec bound it this groat cost the secretary of war states nder date of march 16 1876 thatthe requisition for binding the wheeler photographs was made by the chief of entnloers in accordance with instructions from the secretary of war it is inelndel in cthe report of the chief of engineers furnished yonr committee on printing cnd 3inding for 1874 and 1875no 414 on tit eneineer list and dated november 8 1875 aounti cg to 1 292 50 for binding one itunlred and ten volnes f photogapho iailf turkoy there were sixty volumes of twentyfive views each onufon ehort edge as pter sample herewith cover 151 by 21 inches thiliryfour velinces of fifty views each bound on short edge cover 1i by 0 inches and sixteen volumes of fifty views each boned on long edlgo cover 1 by 22 inches the examination of witnesses as well ts the samples funished show that this same system of extravagance has prevailed for years past ire refereco to the binding and printing of the government and we have foind nowhere that any effort has been made to put a stop to it i next come to the questio of overcharges the overcharges referred to in the contract system have prevailed here the same system of doubling up or charging for work that has not been done this paper chat i hold in my hand is what is termed a form of sixteen pages these sixteen pages are made up in type locked up in what is trormod a chase and put upon a press the paper is put in aind rnn through the press and comes out with sixteen pages printed on it now the complaint that was made heretofore in discussing the wrongs practiced under the contract system was that the contractor would print these sixteen pageswould tear them apart and charge sixteen times for the work but what do we find in reference to the work of the congressional printing office i we find this identical system carried out there and it has been carried out there through all the books that i have examined before i make a further explanation in regard to this let me say that the charges wore changed two years ago upon complaint of the postoffice dopartmeunt as staled in the testimony of the congressional printer a reduction of 40 per cent was made in the charges against the departmnt now let me ask here if that change of 40 per cent was made why had not the error been discovered before and remedied 7 but now i ant speaking upon the present charges look at this here is a form of sixteen pages if these forms were made up of singlesheet reports there would be sixteen printed at once here are sixteet cut apart now the congressional printer prints off these forms of sixteen pages each he tears them into sixteen pieces he makes sixteen separate and distinct jobs of nineteen hundred copies each and what does le charge i not one presswork but sixteen pressworks what is the result he makes an overcharge of about 85 for presswork alone upon each and every form of that sort that lie puts through his press an examination of the books of the congressional printer shows that full presswork is charged upon each and every joh of work whether put through the press singly or combiued with tither jobs then there are overcharges made in composition we find by further examination of the congressional printing office that t great many jobs are stereotyped therehundreds of themand that all that is necessary to do when an order comes from a department is to take one of these out lock it up in a chase put it on a press and print it we find that in almost every such case full composition is ebarged and charged every time the job is ordered the books show that these charges have been made that it is the rule to so charge during the progress of the investigation we discovered that two classes of work were undercharged one of these was the court the congressional rlecord h d been taken from a private establishment in this city and the supreme court work was also taken from private parties in the city ofwashington for forty years the congressional globe had been printed by private parties here and always to tie satisfaction of congress speaking of the manner in which the work on the globe had been performed senator anthony congressional globe volume 93 page 1473 february 19 1873 said i have several times borne toy testimony and i very cheerfully do it now to the meaner in which the work has been performed by the present contractors it is as near perfect as onytbing of the kiid possibly cm be this work is done easily quietly promptly and we never hear hmro the contractors i do not think that i have spoken to them more than once this session they never come near us but always fraud no their work well done in a discussion in regard to the publication of the debates senator anthony congressional globe volume 73 page 1512 said i have no doubt that the congressional printing office can do this work as cheaply as it can be done by anybody and that whatever mney a contractor can make en it will be saved by the government subject of course to the deduction that must always be made for government work in competition with private work it always costs rather more and again in 1872 globe volume 88 page 1319 he said we inventigated that matter and made a report to congress on it throe or four years ago we then had an offer for the printing of the debates from the present contractors we had peopcosals from a firt of printers i i elicve in new york and we had an estimate of tie cost at the gavercnnt ririting office frac tie congressional printer the cost at tice govetcmet printing office and the figures givet by the now york tactics were ahect the seai and were considerably less than these of the globhe think about thirty or forty thousand dollars less but upon a very full debate in the senate the coucmittee who recommended that the work be done at the government printing offico were voted down bye voetof two to one it was the opinion of the snate and also the ipinioniof ti ilotisoof epreocntatives that the anount which it was estimated would be saved iy doing the work at the government printing olice was not worth the clmago and nlthougi i was voted down fori took rite other side it is my opilion now that we cannot profirably carry rice publication of the globe to the congressional printing office do net thinlk any ochier holding his place by the votes of the senate couli print the globe i thiink nothing in foxs book of martyrs would le equal to the sucfferings which lee woold icave to endure i think if we are going to print the globe we cannot do it any bettor tihn tice way it is hons now unless there should be an edited edition of ile globe somcething like hansards debates that would be a very great saving and it would be a great convenience in many respects but i do not know the man who would like to undcrtkir the tasknf alit ing the globe i would not do it for 50 000 a yeer senator frfaitighuysen globe volume 73 page 1512 said we are told this charge will be a saving of 40 000 hctilhow is that eioate matle that estimate is made not by a person o is esng to take the eontact and who is unaffeetd entiely by the question whethur his estimate is correct or incorrect and i have not a great deal of confidence in it htsides i celiee it is the true ititerest of the government to make as few contracts to undertacoe as fesvjos whetlcr io grinting or in building railroads or cinais or anything of that ehaeter ts lessile but to make contracts with todividms tad make them strictly and have them rigidly enforced senator morill of vermont congressional globe volume 73 page 1512 said if this change should be made i have no idea but that instead of making 40 000 for every two years of coogressioual printing we should run under at least 50 000 d year and again page 1513 he said i do not believe that we are on the road to retrenchment by making this change but i believe that if it should be made we should revert and turn back to the same system within four years senator fessonden globe vtuice 73 page 1513 said as it stands now the question is wicther we should gain or lose by it myopinion is that we should tily lojo by atteipting to dts it ecausei think it is overburdening the public printer and 1 think those men have done the work so well and sit long that their judgofent as to what thccy can do it for as they certainly must be very desirous of getting the contraet is a good deal better than the judgment of anybody else senator hendricks globe volume 73 page 1514 said mr president nothing is more deecptive than titlic esticnates we know that in the great body of the work that is done for the gvoinoment tihe construction of public buildings anti repairstend tll lthea nowsi i1 have very little confidence in the estimates that are ireseucted hcre from the burea of puhlic printing if it may be so called 1 do not believe that this printing will be clone at the public printing office for the price that we arce paying to the present company i do not expect it to lc doe for that irico i know that cite government never does work as cheap as individuals to it ordinarily we can pay inicividuals for work done and a reasonable prodit acil sass nococy to tiie goverciittnit rather than do it direely through the agents of tho govorment this work has been carried on a hocg whils by this olles to the satisfaction cif members of congress it reflects creidit upon the goivernntettt and icti alcry rcl etacci to see a ehacigo made in lice coarse of a congress i believe it is now thitled that tecrecan bo a change maloin favor of the troosury of forty or efity or sixty thuancd dollars when we come to test it by experience i thin that the change will le the otiher way it will cost that much more than it does now senator m orton globe volume 73 page 1515 said i have no faith myself in the government directly procuring heavy work of this kind to be performed cheaper through its own ictediato agents than by contract it is contrary to all governmental eperience vherver the governtent has work to he lone of a contimmus or important character it has uniformly been found to be cheaper to lot it ot under fair terms of contract than to underiake to execute the work itself if b overnoent has a harbor to repair or construct or ay public work to do it has boon found hchapor by experienco to let it out by cootract than for tho goeermont to udertake through its own agonti to hire the hands and oxecuto the work the government tried that experment once in the construction of the cumberland road the construction of that road was first put unaler the cro of engineers with authority to employ suporintendee and agents to birs the hands and construct the road without the intervention of contractors and i believ it is a notorious fact that the work cost the government at least twice what at would have cost if it had been let out under fair terms of contract ad more than that it progessed far more slowly than it would have dons tf it had been tatrly contracted for why sir the operation of this principle is so well understood that railroad com panics private corporatins where they have a railroad to construct will not undertoke to construct it directly by their own agents some roads have attempted tint but they have been i believe unifornly unfortunate i remember one instonco where a railroad company undertook to build a road through its own suer intendents to employ hands and superintend them and after having partially constructed the road it was compellel to abandon that system and resort to the ordinary one of contract where the work is let out to contractors under fair competition now air if the government of the united states con save money by undertaking to execute along and heavy work of this kind directly through its own agents jundertake to say it will be the first time that that oxperiiint hs ever been successful as i said beore it has been tried in regard to railroad companies where the parties managing the company were directly parties in interest and it has been found even with regard to railroad companies that it is to their advantoge to let the work out to contractors and allow the contractors to make fair profits and that they can construct the work cheaper and faster as this is the almost uiversal experience with regard to the government in other particulars with regard to corporations with regard to the construction of all works of improvement it seems to me there is no reason to suppose that the government can execute this particular work cheaper through its own agents than it can by contractors with fair competition shows that it has been undercharged ever since its establishment that many and important items that were properly chargeable have been omitted and in the main the prophecies of the gentlemen whose remarits i have quoted
