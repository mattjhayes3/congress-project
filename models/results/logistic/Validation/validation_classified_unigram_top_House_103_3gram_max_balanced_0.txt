comprehensive base closure legislation and should not be second guessed at this point m chairman nobody has ever claimed that this legislation would be perfect or that it would bring about immediate savings particularly in the area of proceeds anticipated fron land sales the reality is that were not going to achieve revenue from sale of facilities and land as long as we give these properties to communities to mitigate the impact ofa closure nonetheless dod still forecasts steadily increasing annual savings figures beginningin fiscal year 1996 we have known from the outset that this process would have upfront costs it will cost money to implement decisions made by the base realignment and closure commission to realign forces as installations in fact close the congress has been supportive of these efforts fully funding the base closure accounts to ensure that we are good stewards of the bracs recommendations if this amendment passes it sends a signal to our military leadership that we are not committed to achieve the readiness levels so greatly needed in preparing to meet the threats and challenges facing our forces today and in the future keeping unneeded infrastructure begs the question for whose benefit do we keep unnecessary installations for shortterm political gain or do we let the process continue as authorized so that the military can get the most efficient use of declining resources if i believed that the defense budget would again reach its 1985 peak i too would question the legitimacy of conducting the next closure round but reality tells us otherwise delay of the next round will ultimately force our military leadership to cut readiness accounts to keep the lights on at installations that do not have a mission if we vote for this i seriously doubt we will be able to afford any modernization of our equipment and forces even if we keep forces at a level to meet the bottom up review requirements we run the risk of a 30 percent shortfall in acquiring systems to replace rapidly agingforces furthermore all over the country both strong and vulnerable installations would experience reductions in force of civilian personnel just to s ustain unneeded infrastructure in that scenario all military installations and their neighboring communities around the country would lose we already face a 14 5 billion backlog on maintenance and repair of real

impacted communities no longer can it be said that the base closure is simply chaining the gates and walking away unfortunately the proponents of this amendment are creating even more dire

were asked by the unitedstates congress to prepare a comparative analysis of the nuclear options for this country the question they were supposed to answer was if nuclear power is to be retained as an

shortterm needs however the academys report on the longterm needs for the nuclear industry in this country and for our nuclear energy needs in this country said the committee believes that the lmr the

we are discussing is the high level importance and is important to helping us continue to address our nuclear needs in the country the science is there the question is why are we facing this

consumes plutonium it consumes spent nuclear fuel and it is part of the answer to the many difficult questions we will be facing longterm it is also a part of the answer to our nations energy needs as has already been mentioned the reactor technology that we are looking at is going to be a critical part of our future electricity needs those who are concerned about the environment and the need to rely on fossil fuels will have to focus on longterm nuclear energy as a part of our nations longterm energy solutions it has been stated that there is not support in the commercial industry that also is not accurate as we know today it is very difficult to get nuclear technology licensed and the united states must participate in that process in its research at the initial stages yet already at
