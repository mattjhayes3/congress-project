the woolgrower of my state but it will also close up the mill where that blanket was made and put out of employment the labor engaged in its manufacture in controverting the theory that manufactures are made higher to the consumer by protection let me take the article of cutlery professor waylands political economy published in 1842 page 140 contains this proposition we pay a heavy duty on cutlery in this country while not a thousandth part of the cutlery used is made here it would be vastly cheaper to pay bounty sufficient to raise all the cutlery made in this country to its present price and it would be for aught i suggest as good for the cutler but had this sage counsel intended to discourage the infant manufacturers been followed we would not have the cheap cutlery we have today while we would have been dependent on foreigners for most we use instead of now obtaining our supply almost wholly from american workshops and furthermore those american workshops would not now be flooding the markets of the world with their products and crowding those of britain at the very threshold of her factories but broadening our view let me make some comparisons between protective and freetrade periods in 1860 our manufactures aggregated only 855 000 000 on an invested capital of 1 001 000 000 employment was given to 1 311 246 personsto whom was paid in wages 378 878 996 or an average of 290 each per year the product was 1 972 755 642 and in 1880 2 752 595 operators were paid 947 953 795 or an average of 346 per year in the mean time the cost of living had not materially changed i take a table from the report of the director of the mint 1881 giving prices in 1860 and 1880 articles 1860 1880 flour superfine per barrel 85 19 84 13 pork m ess per barrel 18 09 13 23 b eef

per yard 071 07 standard sheeting 23 inches per yard 07 05 all will remember that in 1880 there was a strong tendency to high prices by reason of the general prosperity of the country in 1860 on the other hand as older people will recollect there was a general depression in prices following the disastrous panic of 1857 consequently the cost 9f living ought to have been lower in 1860 than in 1880 it will be observed the difference if any was rather in favor of the latter year in 1860 our steel production was 11 838 tons in 1880 it was 1 397 015 tons copper in 1860 was produced to the amount of 2 288 182 in 1880 it was 8 849 961 a fall in price attended the increased production ranging from 61 to 8 cents in iowa the augmentation from 1860 to 1880 in manufacturers was as follows number of establishments from 1 939 to 6 921 or over 250 per cent in capital invested from 7 347 886 to 33 987 886 or more than 350 per cent in hands employed from 6 307 to 25 382 or about 350 per cent in wages paid from 1 922 000 to 9 725 962 or about 400 percent the average pay increased from 304 87 to 343 65 per annum the increase in value of products that is after deducting value of materials employed was from 5 359 066 to 22 741 615 or almost 300 per cent the aggregate value of products was 71 045 926 in the former years 36 per cent of the product went into wages in the latter year 43 the first caststeel establishment or at least the first to endure was founded about 1860 so well did the tariff of 1861 do its work that in a dozen years the steel manufacture of pittsburgh alone amounted to more than the entire importation of steel while the remainder of the country manufactured almost as much as was imported and these figures do not include bessemer and steelheaded nails this product was furnished to consumers at from 2 to 3 cents a pound ess than it was ever furnished for prior to the establishment of the american industry even though the duty on the foreign article was now three times as great as under ibrmer tariffs and today american manufacturers of steel have taken the contract in successful competition with those of great britain fbr the steel for our new armored cruisers and steel guns of caliber equal to those of any european power when the first bessemersteel works were undertaken in america the price of steel rails purchased for american railroads and delivered at english ports when the present duty was imposed was 155 a ton in gold now american mills furnish them at 31 50 to 33 50 per ton giving the english manufacturer not over 15 50 per ton after paying the duty to pay freight if any and all the costof raw material and labor does anybody believe that without american competition their rails would have been furnished them for twice the money i quote from a recent number of the industrial world how important it was to the steelrail industries of the country that neither the randall nor the morrison tariffreduction bill was enacted into a law may be seen fromthe fact that even with the present impost duty of 17 per ton on steel rails large importations of englighmade rails are coming to this country the alabama and great southern railway 295 miles long is to be relaid with foreignmade rails imported via new orleans homemade rails can be obtained at eastern mills for say 31 50 per tn and at western mills at 33 50 per ton so tlfft to compete with products here the foreign rails can yield the manufacturer only 15 50 per ton according to the point in this countryat which they are delivered and assuming they may come across the ocean as ballast but were manufactures alone thus benefited by no means during the period from 1860 to 1880 the production of indian corn increased over 100 per cent that of wheat more than 150 per cent the total of cereals 120 per cent and the wool product 260 per cent during this time the population increased only about 50 per cent and manulhetures as before indicated showed an increase of about 125 per cent so that agriculture got its full share of the enhanced prosperity by protection the truth is that protection duties encouraged the production of these goods at home so that we have the products of both home and foreignmarkets to select from instead of being compelled as otherwise to depend on the foreign market in which to make our purchases however beneficial free trade may appear to be on paper i have yet to find the first country that has prospered under it i am aware that the example of great britain may be cited that country has done better than any other under the system but there the mutterings of discontent are gathering in volume until they can be heard across the ocean what is known as the fairtrade party an organization growing in the number of its adherents rapidly is hostile to free trade while ireland has certainly not been benefited by it but whether successful or not what kind of preparation for free trade was therein england its manufactures were built up under a comprehensive system of protection combined with vigorous repression as in the case of ireland and in the american colonies where needed for the furtherance of the obj ect ass early act of the english parliament specially offered all clothworkers of other lands safety and protection carrying into england scotland ireland and wales in after years ireland received less consideration or rather more of it but of a less favorable kind an act of edward iii made it a felony to export wool until otherwise ordered by the king and council another act prohibited everybody not of the royal family wearing any cloth thereafter brought into what is now the united kingdom unless the same was made therein and merchants by another act were prohibited from bringing cloths into england another act of the same reign prohibited all merchants from carrying any manner of wools leather wolfels skins with wool on or lead to the seacoast for shipment on pain of penalty and loss of member and forfeiture of all property although this was repealed in the same reign the exporting of wools and wolfels etc was prohibited by later enactments another act prohibited for a time bringing any card for wool into england or wales the preamble to this bill giving the reason for its passage in the quaint style of the time reads thus whereas many thousands of woolen cardmakers and card wiredrawers of london bristol gloucester norwich coventry and of many other of his highness cities and towns have heretofore lived and well maintained themselves their wives families and children by the benefit and use of their and faculty of cardmaking and drawing of wire within this realm and now of late lime by reason of the common bringing in of foreign cards for wool out of france and other foreign ports the said cardmakers and card wiredrawers have been so much impoverished that scant the twentieth person that has heretofore lived by the said trades is now maintained and get work thereby free trade worked then about as it does now it appears parliament went at one time so far in its determination to uphold the woolen manufacturers and discourage the importations of foregn linen as to require the dead to be buried in nothing but woolen clothing and in a coffin lined with no other material an act towards the close of the seventeenth century having in view the enhancement of englands interests prohibited the exportation of wool or wolfels or woolen manufactures from ireland to any place but england and the same act forbade the woolen manufacturers of the english plantations in america as the colonies were called from being exported out of the plantation where produced to any other plantation or to any other place whatsoever that is they might be used where produced but nowhere else lest they should conflict with english manufacturers various acts of parliament were passed especially aimed to improve the business of england at the expense of the colonies no sugars cotton wool indigo etc grown in the english colonies were allowed to be exported except to england ships in the colonies were required to bring them to england nothing grown or manufactured on the continent of europe could be sent to the colonies but by way of and in english ships this was afterward modified so as to allow servants horses and victuals as the act puts it to be imported from scotland or ireland salt for the fisheries and wines from the azores no hats or felts were allowed to be transported from any of the colonies to any other in 1750 parliament forbade the erection in america of my mill for slitting ion or plating forge to work with a tilthammer or furnace for making steel and british statesmen are at the same business todayin another way however i am aware that it may be said that these were the enactments of hardier ages this is true but they built up british manufacture and their enduring effects enable the island nation to sustain as gallantly as she does the losing cause of free trade with our soil and our resources there is no excuse for our not producing everything which can in reason be produced in our immense territory and our legislation should be shaped so as to assist in freeing our nation from commercial thraldom to other lands what we can not produce such as tea and coffee and sugar let us get as cheaply as possible and let no duty enhance their cost this is in my opinion the true policy for a nation a policy which will best promote the general prosperity of the american people the great advantage of the protection system to the agriculturist is that it gives him a uniform market chiefjustice story nomen clarin et venerabile says on this question thata large and uniform market at home for a nations products has a tend ency to prevent those many rises and falls in prices which are so deeply injurious to the farmer and planter the cobden club of england an association composed of rich men who are largely interested in manufactures which is supplemented by its honorary members in high places here is today sowing broadcast through this country freetrade pamphlets in order to persuade the american people that free trade is necessary to us why this is being done may well be asked the answer is if they can to a degree break down the american mapufacturer and thereby force our operatives into agriculture they can then monopolize our markets for goods at their own prices and take their pay in american produce at prices fixed by themselves the question is well stated by chiefjustice long is america ready to give everything to europe without any equivalent and take in return whatever europe may choose to give us on its own terms could the results of free trade be more clearly stated we should ever bear in mind that in all ages there has been an irrepressible conflict between monarchical and republican forms of government this has been well expressed by missouris great senator thomas ff denton who said thatforeign interference and foreign influence in all ages and in all countries had been the bane and curse of free government and that such interference and influence are far more dangerous in the insidious intervention of the moneyed power than possible invasion of fleets and armies should not this interference on the part of the cobden club be considered by our people as an insidious interference of the moneyed power while it is true that we have much in common with the english people yet the government and the interests of the two countries are in direct opposition of each other lord robert cecil in a debate in the english parliament explained exactly the relations between england and the united states when he said they were rivals politically rivals commercially again we are both manufact uring people and in every port as well as in every court we are rivals to each other in this conflict between free trade and protection we have on our side the interest of the manufacturer the artisan the laborer and the producer of america on the other a large portion of the democratic party backed by the whole monetary interests of england of this foreign influence we as americans should be especially jealous the passage of the mills bill in the interest of free trade is a victory for british commerce for this kind of victory is a prostration to our american and producing industries and i must confess that i see but little difference between being subjugated by british commerce or by british cannon nature has been bountiful of her gifts to the american people in addition to the mines of precious metals she hs given them vast deposits of iron copper lead coal and other base metals in a lavish degree in many portions of the country to utilize these requires labor which alone can develop all this vast amount of raw materials into implements and the manufactured articles in order to enable us not only to live in comfort but to supply the wants of other nations she has also given a kindly climate and a fertile soil which is adapted to the growth of most of what we consume in fact no other nation is so well fitted by its natural conditions to maintain itself almost absolutely independent of foreign nations m l influences as we the american people bearing these facts in mind is it not for the best interests of our nation to adapt its policies in such manner as to give the greatest good to the greatest number and to do this is not protection to our home labor an absolute necessity sir we are told in the good book that he that provideth not for his own household hath already denied the faith and is worse than an infidel what are we as a nation but an aggregation of households and is not the divine command as imperative on us as on an individual is it not our bounden duty to so legislate as to provide for our own people rather than for those of other countries there are many glaring inconsistencies in this bill it is cunningly drawn so as to command the support of that portion of the country which the democratic party counts on for its main support the solid south and it is also a direct blow at the industrial and agricultural classes of the northern states from which come the republican majorities let me illustrate take rice the bill leaves rice produced in south carolina and louisiana with a duty of nearly 100 per cent and also increases the duty on uncleaned rice which is not only in the interest of the southern rice producers but will inevitably drite out of the business cleaningmills of new york city and elsewhere why not make the duty on rice as it was before the war and thus give the consumers of this country who use 250 000 000 pounds annually the benefit of this cheap and desirable food again the bill reduces the tariff on sugar about 22 per cent why may i ask would it not be a sound policy to take off entirely the filyeight millions of tariff revenue on sugar sugar is an article of absolute necessity for all why levy what is a direct tax of over a dollar per capita on all our people for the benefit of its few raisers in the south sugarcane is not indigenous to this country it is an exotic with us easily injured by frost or bad weather even the refuse stalks or bagasse owing to climatic influences can not be utilized for fuel as it is in cuba without a large expenditure for a peculiar kind of furnace to burn it in let me call the attention of the committee to the small area of land in the cultivation of sugar in the united states as compared with the acreage of corn in any congressional district in my own state in 1879 there were but 181 592 acres in sugarcane in louisiana and the united states but 227 776 acres in the seven counties comprising the district i have the honor to represent on this floor there were in cultivation the same year 481 126 acres in corn over twice as many acres as there were in sugarcane in the whole united states and sir the agricultural products of those seven counties are three times the value of the sugar crop of the united states and yet we are taxed 58 000 000 annually for the direct benefit of the sugarplanter think of it and yet after nearly half a centurysprotection there is not as much sugar grown today as there has been in times past this country does not produce over onetenth of the sugar we use and yet the people of the united states paid during the past year nearly 26 an acre in the tariff on sugar as a rental on the 227 776 acres in the cultivation of cane is it not better by far for us to pay a bounty of 20 a hogshead on the sugar raised inthe united states in 1887 which would amount to about 7 000 000 or about 2 cents a pound and thus save 49 000 000 which will be paid this year in the shape of a direct tax on the breakfast and tea table of every family in the land this would be a practical relief to the laboring classes whom our democratic friends on the other side of the house are so loud in their professions to aid a bounty of the kind i have suggested coupled with the proviso that this should not apply to countries that levy an export tax on sugar exported to this country would in my opinion stimulate not only the growth of cane sugar in the south but would also at tue same time give an impetus to the production of sorghum and beetroot sugar which our western prairies and california are so well adapted to produce the result would be that eventually we would produce all the sugar that the people of this country have use for all the interests of the reliable democratic states are cared for in this bill the sumac of virginia is protected and cement which was first reported to be put on the freelist is now left with a protection of 10 per cent because of the fact that in democratic kentucky is found not only one of the largest cement manufactories in the country but it is also the banner state of democracy the lead of missouri is but slightly reduced and even the peanut interests of north carolina are looked after with care in the draughting of the bill by the majority of the committee of ways and means the interests of those states a large number of whose members sit here elected by methods well known to this house and the country have been tenderly touched where touched at all again this bill aims a blow at the prosperity of the agriculture of the north the west and the pacific slope by the fact that it places on the freelist many articles grown in canada and other foreign countries which will be an injury to our home producers of those articles take one agricultural industry in my own state of iowa for illustration flax is a fairly remunerative crop in that state under the protection now given to it and its product flaxseedoil let me show you how it works a poor man comes to iowa to make a home for himself and family he buys 160 acres of land on long credit with interest on the deferred payments and this accounts for a large amount of the mortgages we hear so much about in the olden time it took a whole season to break up a portion of his land to be ready to sow grain in the second season since we have had a fair duty on flaxseed he commences to break up his land in the spring and as fast as he has 10 acres broken he puts it in flax by the 1st of july he has 50 acres broken and sown in flax from which he can realize five or six hundred dollars the first year and in addition have his ground ready for wheat or corn the succeeding season the result is that he is able to make his payment on his land and support his family during his first season in addition we have in iowa eleven oilmills costing a large amount of money and employing many men in their operation this raising of flax in the west has been the means of the erection of these oilmills and has reduced the price of oil as was shown by my colleague to a much lower price than it has ever been bef re by putting flaxseed and its product on the freelist you accomplish two things you place the iowa flaxraiser in direct competition with the ryot laborer of the east indies and drive the oilmills of the countr into innocuous desuetude and when this is done our people will inevitably pay higher prices for oil than now again we in iowa have hoped that in the near future we would have factories erected in our state to utilize the lint of our flax fields into thread and linen that hope if this bill is to pass will never come to fruition the lint will rot on the ground where it is thrashed again the raising of potatoes under the existing protection is a fairly remunerative business in iowa the people of that state shipping to chicago from five to seven hundred thousand bushels annually this bill nominally retains the tariff on potatoes at 15 cents a bushel yet really admits them free i have no doubt that under this definition potatoes will be admitted free thus letting in the canadian potatoes by the cheap water transportation while the small farmers in iowa have to pay freight on their crop on two to four hundred miles of railway transportation these ir chairman are only a few of the inconsistencies of this bill time will not permit me to elaborate its many injuries to the manufacturing agricultural and laboring interests but it may be well to inquire who has asked for the enactment of this proposed law i have failed to hear presented on the floor of this house any petitions nor have i seen in the record any petitions asking us to pass this bill but on the contrary from all parts of the country have come hundreds of petitions not from manufacturers alone but those who eat their bread in the sweat of their faces protesting against its passage from the east from the north from the great west and the states of oregon and california the peoplehave protested against its passage shall we close our ears to their protests i have personally been in receipt of many petitions and of letters by the score from my own state from manufacturers woolgrowers artisans farmers and laboring men protesting against the bill sir the people of my state believe in a ifir degree of protection to american industries of all kinds why we in iowa have not timber enough to build a fleet of canoes yet i in common with my colleagues have been in receipt of many letters and petitions from the laborers of that state yea from the knights of labor urging us to vote for a subsidy to american vessels so that the american flag may again be seen on the waters of the ocean as it was in the days of yore the last revision of the tariff was made by the republican party since that revision the democratic party has been in the ascendency in the lower house of congress which alone has the right to originate a measure of revenue they have signally failed in adjusting the revenues to the constantly increasing surplus in the treasury it is to the republican party that the country must look for a proper adjustment of these economic questions if a revision of the tariff is needed let us revise it by all means but let it be done in such a manner as will not prostrate the industries of the country as has been done by the democratic party in the past for it should be borne in mind that any revision of the tariff which will tend to throw out of their employment american laborers can but prove disastrous to the best interests of all for labor when employed at fair wages is always contented drive labor out of employment by free trade or by any other method and at once it becomes demoralized and restless sir we are entering on one of the most remarkable political campaigns this country has witnessedsecond only in interest to that of 1860 already the millions of voters are arming not with swords and bayonets not with cannons and musketsthe time for that thank god is pastbut with a weapon that comes down as still as snowflakes fall upon the sod but executes a freenuans will as lightning does the will of god sir in this contest the candidate of the democratic party is already known the president has so dominated his party that they can not nominate any one else on whom the choice of the republican party will fill i do not know but this i do know hewill be onewellworthy to lead the republican hosts to victory in that conflict on the banner of the democratic party will be inscribed free trade sir behind that banner will follow all who believe in that fallacy backed up by all the power and influence of the cobden club of england on the republican banner will be emblazoned protection to american industries a fair ballot and an honest count under the republican banner will march all who believe in the progress and upbuilding of the american nation on this issue we make the fight and of its result i have no fear for it is said that coming events east their shadows before when the result is known it will be found that the american people have pronounced in unmistakable tones their condemnation of the principles underlying tle mills bill and that at the close of that election day we shall hear from lake to gulf from mlaine to the golden gates of the pacific preans of victory welcoming the return to power of the republican party which has by the policy it inaugurated done so much for the moral and material elevation of the american

protestations they have made that they seek to promote the interests of te farmer this article of potato starch is one in which the lhrming interests in certain sections of our country are directly concerned to a very important degree in maine new hampshire vermont and new york where the largest portion of our potatostarch is manufactured the starch factories furnish the principal home market for the farmers potatoes in a large portion of the agricultural regions of those states the starch factories form one of the essential sources of reliance for the farmer in the northern part of my statethe most fertile region of mainethe potatostarch industry is a most important factor with regard to the interests of the farmer during some years past the starch rhctories of this country have probably consumed annually something like 3 000 000 or 4 000 000 bushels of potatoes and the production of starch has l cen 25 000 000 or 30 000 000 pounds the starch factories arc located in the immediate vicinity of the potato fields the farmer digs his potatoes and sells them almost at his very door during a number of years past the farmers in aroostook county maine where this industry is very largely carried on have been enabled to sell their potatoes without assortment large and small just as taken from the field at prices varying from 25 to 30 cents a bushel to the starch factories without these factories those farmers would have no market for that class of their potato product that is not adapted for table use by reducing the duty 50 per cent as proposed in this bill you will simply permit the potatoes raised in the british provinces to come across the line and compete ruinously with the product of the farmers of my state and of the other states bordering on canada which are interested in this business in that portion of my own district to which i have alluded there are some forty of these starch factories scattered through the potato region producing thousands of tons of starch annually and providing the farpajrl 9 ers with a reliable cash market at home for hundreds of thousands of bushels of potatoes in a recent interview on the subject mr alba holmes one of the leading starch manufacturers of aroostook county maine stated emphatically that the removal of the duty on starch would close every factory in that county the reduction of the duty to 1 cent per pound would probably be quite as disastrous mr holmes said the average price of starch for some timepast has been 4 cents per pound owing to the prices we pay for potatoes and labor there is only a very small margin for profit in fact we could not continue the business and sell at a less price we find formidable competitors in germany and holland who owin to their starvation labor prices and the low prices paid forpotatoes are enabled to export large quantities of starch pay a duty of 2 cents per pound and sell for 4 cents and make a profit take off the duty and we could not nor would we try to compete with them i shall close my factories that moment the duty is taken off take the matter of dextrine or burnt starch it was formerly manufactured in providence r i and in new york the two factories using about 1 400 tons of starch annually at that time it was protected by a fair duty and the business flourished the duty was unjustly reduced to 1 cent per pound we say unjustly because it takes 11 pounds ofstarch to make a pound of dextrine and at the present rate of duty on starch it should now be 3 cents instead of one the result was what might have been expected the american manufacturers of dextrine were driven to the wall and today there is not a pound manufactured in the united states hon thomas h phair state senator from the same county and the owner of seven starch factories declares that without the protective tariff not a pound of starch could be made in aroostook until the farmers should be ready to furnish potatoes for 10 cents a bushel he says last year canadian factories paid from 10 to 13 cents a bushel for their potatoes while the factories on the american side paid from 25 to 30 cents take off the duty and our farmers must sell their potatoes for 2 or 3 cents a bushel less than the province farmers on account of difference of freight or not sell any a few days ago while in boston i met a prince edwards island man who had several tons of starch to sell and he sold it for 4t cents less the duty of 2 cents and 2j per cent commissionthat is he sold for 2z cents less the 21 per cent commission and paid the freight 2 50 a ton at the prices paid for potatoes last year by our factories the cost of starch here was about 4f cents a pound while the prince edward man paid 2 50 a ton for transportation we have to pay 7 50 not only must the freetrade policy if adopted by the people shut up every starch factory in aroostook but it must absolutely stop shipments of potatoes unless our farmers are ready and willing to produce them for less price than the province farmers now realize hon c f a johnson a pioneer in this industry and one of the most highlyrespected citizens of his section stated before the committee on ways and means a few years ago when this interest was similarly threatened that the interests of more than ten thousand farmers were involved he said protection to the starchmaker is protection of the utmost importance to the farmer it really means to him home comforts the education of his children and the support in his community of religious and charitable institutions with all that those advantages imply if any gentleman of this committee has ever had the good fortune to be a planter and hoer and digger of potatoes he will readily assent to the proposition that 25 cents per bushel is as low as he or any other man ought to do it at this price which is the usual one paid by starchmakers starch costs from 3 to 41 cents per pound to which must be added front onehalf to fiveeighths of a cent per pound for transportation storage and commission this brings up the cost when it is sold to 4 to 4 cents per pound this variation in cost is explained chiefly by variation in quality of potatoes in different years i have known years when they yielded but 6 pounds per bushel there is in the communities in which these mills are located in my own state maine a large amount of capital invested the business is one involving large risks my own firm lost in this business in 1881 over 12 000 the present tariff of 2 cents per pound isas small as we can possibly work under a reduction would demolish the industry in the united states the farmers of the neighboring maritine provinces contentedly or otherwise produee potatoes at much less price than ours can and the canadian starchmakers have a very material advantage over us in the matter of transportation we can not take a pound of starch to their country without paying their government a duty of 2 cents why should not american citizens have the advantage of their own markets last year the starch factories in the province of new brunswick paid from 10 to 13 cents a bushel for their potatoes right across the st john river at the very time when the farmers of my state were receiving 25 and 30 cents for every bushel they could lay down at the starch factory if you agree to this proposed reduction of onehalf of the present duty making it but i cent per pound the result is to be the destruction of this industry on the american side of the line you are going to take away from the farmers of new england new york and the other states interested this chief market for the sale of one of their important products and you are going to do this very strangely as it seems to me directly in the face of the fact that the canadian tariff today puts a duty of 2 cents upon every pound of starch that goes from the united states to the british provinces our present duty on starch is in no sense a burden upon the american people the additional cost that is imparted to a yardof cloth by reason of the starch used in its manufacture is infinitesimal and this potato starch is used almost entirely for the purpose of starching yarns and fabrics of cotton cloth and cloth for prints yet by this legislation cutting down the duty onehalf you propose to say to the farmers of maine of new york new hampshire vermont and elsewhere who who have been engaged in raising potatoes upon lauid better adapted for that than for other purposes the american congress has decreed that you shall sell no more of your potatoes at the prices they now bring but you must raise and sell them to compete with the low prices of the canadian farmers everybody knows that in canada labor is cheaper land is cheaper and that the people live in a less comfortable way than we are willing that our american farmers should live so that the competition involved in the proposed reduction of duty so far as the potato industry is concerned would be to our farmers simply destructive i can not see why we are called upon to show to canada a liberality which canada refuses to show to us i can not see why we are called upon to allow the products of the starch factories of canada to come over into the united states at onehalf the duty which the canadian government exacts from the american manufacturer if he tries to sell starch in the british provinces there is no logic in this there is no patriotism in it there is no common sense in it there is no justice in it to our farmers on the contrary so far as my section of the country is concerned it is one of the most direct and serious blows that this mills bill proposes to strike at the agricultural interests this reduction of the tariff on potatostarch and the failure to put the rate on dextrine and similar

of illinois and the farmers of the entire union wherever they live within the belt in which the cane can be successfully produced aside from this there is another very important item to be taken into consideration and that is that the cane is almost a certain crop drought does not materially affect it the grasshopper does not affect it it can be raised almost surely every year in this belt of country regardless of rainfall or of atmospheric or climatic influences i have said that two years ago we had too much science and therefore did not produce sugar successfully after we had obtained the saccharine matter but last year it was left to work itself out passing from the diffusion battery into the vacuum pan and from that into the centrifugal and from the centrifugal into the barrel i made a trip to fort scott during the sugar season last year i went to the field and saw the cane cut i saw it loaded on the wagon i saw it hauled upon the scale i saw it taken to where it was cut up into small pieces i saw it go into the diffusion battery and from that into the vacuum pan and then into the centrifugal and i saw it come out sugar in the barrels so that i know what i am talking about because seeing is believing and i not only know that sugar was made but i know that it was made in the quantities i have stated because i saw the ton of cane weighed and saw the sugar that was produced weighed not only that but i saw the government chemist from the agricultural department here polarize it and it polarized 98 1 per cent is there any use in talking to a kansas farmer or a kansas man who has had a practical eyewitness knowledge of this matter about doing away with that tariff because forsooth we can not increase the production of sugar in the united states i sayand i believe it is the feeling not only of the commissioner of agriculture but of the people of kansas and of every citizen who has investigated the subjectthat only a few more years of protection are needed to make kansas the sugar state of the world that is what we are fighting for that is why we are opposed to this proposition of boupty i would be glad if some man could tell me with the assurance of certainty that a bounty would step in and take the place of the tariff and insure us the capital to develop this infant industry of kansas but there is no man who can give me such assurance logic can not give it eloquence can not give it argument can not give it logic is a power in the forum but it can not command capital capital is ever sensitive and when you go to it with your fine speeches and your eloquent sentences capital turns to the experience of the past and says notwithstanding your logic notwithstanding your eloquence which falls pleasantly upon the ear business principles tell us we can rely only on the experience of the past so the kansas farmer the man interested in the development of this industry says we know that the capital will be forthcoming to furnish the plant to develop this industry in the united states if reasonable protection is continued we do not know we can not tell that this capital will be forthcoming if you do away with this protection and substitute for it a bounty in short it is better to rely upon a certainty than to experiment upon an uncertainty as i stated yesterday after the result of these experiments in kansas last year preparations were made for the establishing of numerous plants to manufacture sugar in kansas four of them in the district from which icome yet because of untoward circumstances because of the threat involved in this very cry for tariff revision because of this to a large extent but two of these plants are beingput in today the capitalists of the east who promised the money with which to put in these plants have said we will wait another year we will wait until we see what congress will do we will wait until we see whether the tariff is to be so changed that capital can not reasonably expect profitable remuneration for its investment so this year is to be passed over a plant is being put in at topeka the capital of my state the plant at fort scott is being enlarged and a plant at conway springs in my district is being put in this is the extent of the present operations i plead on behalf of my people that you will not strike down this infant industry which presents to the agricultural portion of my state so grand an outlook for the future i plead with my friends on this floor that they will not by their act strike down this industry throttle it in its very infancyan industry which promises so much relief to the agricultural people of this country who need the fostering care of the government there is another point to which i wish to call attention in connection with this question of bounty i have said i am not in favor of a bounty because it is an uncertainty we do not know that under the uncertain stimulus of a bounty capital will furnish the money to put in these plants a bounty is unstable and for this reason capital being timid will not take the chances under a bounty law capitalists know also that if the production of sugar should increase until this bounty instead of amounting to five or six million dollars annually should reach thirty or forty million dollars there would come up a cry from all parts of the united states demanding the repeal of the bounty act and it would be repealed the experience of every legislator in this house teaches him that this must be the effect it such an increased amount of bounty should be paid by the general government but there is another consideration connected with this question when you do away with the protective duty upon sugar and put in its stead a bounty you place the consumers of the united states in the power of the ibreign producer of sugar if there is a foreign trustand there are foreign trusts because the empire of germany is nothing more nor less than a sugar trustif there are foreign trusts then in doing away with this protection and substituting a bounty you place the consumers of the united states in the power of these foreign trusts do away with these

gained in this country under the protection of the morrill tariff and the laws in the same direction which have been subsequently enacted not many years ago all the finer classes of files which were used in this country were imported from abroad it is only within the last seven years i think that the manufacture of the finer kinds of files in this country by the nicholson file company of my own city which has been referred to has been successfully carried on with the effect of very largely decreasing the cost of such files to the consumer while giving employment to a large amount of american capital and labor i think the table which has been furnished by the committee on ways and means and which i have in my hand giving among other things the amounts of diities collected upon various articles in these schedules during the fiscal year ending june 30 1887 very well illustrates with regard to this particular manufacture the point that i attempted to make the other day while discussing another matter relating to this same bill i then suggested that the amount of duty collected upon an article illustrated the operation of the law and that where a considerable anount of duty was collected on the importation from abroad of any given article the like of which was manufactured in this country that fact indicated that the article was not highly protected by the tariff because otherwise the importation would not be so large and consequently the amount of duty collected thereon would not be so large under the existing law the tariff duties upon the several classes of files have been regulated according to their length which is believed by file manufacturers to be the proper method and which i think all of us who believe that specific rather than ad valorem duties should be imposed will agree is in the direction of preventing frauds upon the revenue now the amount of duties collected during the fiscal year ending june 30 1887 on the first two classes of files those 4 inches in length and under and those over 4 inches in length and under 9 inches is an anmount which tends to show very clearly as it seems to me that the duties imposed under existing law upon those classes of files are not excessively or improperly high because the rate of duty averaging about 58 per cent has not prevented a considerably large importation the reduction of this duty as proposed by the bill under consideration to 35 per cent ad valorem can not but have the effect of increasing the importations and necessarily assisting to that extent in increasing the surplus which it is claimed to be the purpose of this bill to reduce now gentlemen must not forget that in the manufacture of these files labor is the important interest concerned this is illustrated by the recital of certain facts which i have from unquestionable authority a pound of steel from which the finest grades of these files are made costs 40 cents and when made into files its value is enhanced to 59 35 an increase of 14 740 per cent the great cost of this manuihcture is in the labor employed and it is principally for the protection of that labor that such protective duties as existing law provides are required upon 1 pound of steel used in the manufacture of medium grades of files costing 38 cents the value is increased by manufacture into such files to 18 20 an increase of 4 690 per cent and in the coarser grades of files a pound of steel costing 6 cents is enhanced in value by manufacture 1 640 per cent"], [0.06178777292370796, 0.06178777292370796, 0, "i move to strike outthe last word theamendment proposed by the gentleman from new york changing the classification of sugars under the tariff laws involves more technical knowledge of the subject than all of us perhaps have conveniently at hand but there is one fact in regard to imported sugars and the tariff duty upon them which almost every wellinformed person in this country knows sngars between no 13 and no 16 dutch standard as they are now produced abroad under modern processes of manufacture are fit or measurably fit for consumption by the people of this country without being put through the refineries i ought tosay rather that they would be fit forcousumption without refining if they were not artificially colored totakeadvantage ofour tariff laws theyare or rather wouldbe pure enough clean enough and lightcolored enough to suit thetaste of a large proportion of the people of the united states but it so happens that the classification of our sugar tariff imposes a higher duty upon sugars lighter in color than no 13 dutch standard hence the foreign producer has a strong motive to darken the color of his sugar in order to take advantage of the lower duty he changes the color of his sugar by artificial means before it passes through the customhouse the result is that after it has passed the customhouse it is forced to go through the refineries in order to get rid of the artificial coloring instead of going directly as it otherwise would to the breakfast table of the american consumer ience the existing sugar tariff as well as the mills bill for the mills bill perpetuates the abuse compels the american consumer to pay a tribute of about a cent a pound to the sugarrefining trust on a large portion of the sugar which lie uses this is the evil which the amendment of the

text of the bill ile is not far out of the way the members of the committee on manufactures as well as the members of the committee on ways and means would probably admit that the change was due to evidence given by new york sugar refiners before the committee on manufactures when that committee was investigating the sugar trust under a resolution of my colleague which passed the house january

long ago it would have been of some benefit to us in the consideration of the provisions of the pending bill relating to the sugar duties that was undoubtedly the intention of my colleague in introducing it the scope of that resolution was so broadened by the house that it covered not only the sugar trust but the standard oil trust and all the other trusts of which we have heard so much during the discussion of the pending bill i am glad to have all these trusts investigated but i wish the committee had seen fit to make at least a partial report of the evidence taken so that we could have had some benefit at this session from their investigations it seems to me it would have been only fair for the gentlemen on the committee on manufactures who are also members of the committee on ways and means to see to it that at least a partial report was made including all of the testimony taken in relation to the sugar trust it is not enough in my estimation that in a practical matter a matter of grave importance of this kind the facts should be familiar to but three or four gentlemen however eminent and able they may be if we in this house are called upon to vote for or against a

doing in all industries what they admit it has done in some of them the recent republican convention had evidently hal its attention called to the assault that was proposed to be made on the american protective system and in favor of the antiquated and now abandoned system of imperial bounties the language of the platform though it does not refer in express terms to the proposed system of bounties does say we are uncompromisingly in favor of the american system of protection we protest against its destruction as proposed by the president and his party they serve the interests of europe we will support the interests of america the american government has never fallen in with the imperial habit of granting bounties in support of industries the system was proposed to the country under the highest auspices under which it could have been proposed for it was under the auspices of george washington the then first president of the united states in a plan developedby his remarkable secretary of the treasury alexander hamilton ninetyeight years have passed since then and in no instance has a bounty been granted as a direct stimulus to an industry we sustained the infant fisheries by bounties avowedly as a school for a volunteer navy it was an administrative measure of the government and not in connection with any branch of the general industrial system of the country but the convention did not stop with the extract i read it went on to say the republican party would effect all needed reduction of the national revenue by repealing the taxes upon tobacco which are an annoyance and burden to agriculture and the tax upon spirits used in the arts and for mechanical purposes and by such revision of the tariff laws as will tend to check imports of such articles as are produced by our people the production of which gives employment to our labor and release from import duties those articles of foreign production except luxuis the like of which can not be produced at home if there shall still remain a larger revenue than is requisite for the wants of the government we favor the entire repeal of internal taxes rather than the surrender of any part of our protective system that is the latest authoritative declaration of the cloctrine of the republican party and it is assailed vitally here in the seats of republican members from whose suggestions i dissent in the name of the republican party at whose birth i was and to whose interests i have been devoted flom that time to this but it is said that sugar constitutes an exceptional case in that we are paying

bounties but for the maintenance of the american protective system that is the duty you owe if you are liege party men and respect the last declaration of your partys creed it is argued and has been asserted in this debate that protection does not so operate as to stimulatedevelopment of the sugar industry when honest john swartz an old farmer was elected from berks county pennsylvania by beating that scholarly gentleman and diplomatist j glancy jones who had avowed himself a freetra er the tariff was under revision the story went through pennsylvania and mr swartz never contradicted it in social circles that when his party friends gathered around him to persuade him that duties were added to the cost of imported articles and would make out a seeming case honest old john would wait patiently and listen to the endand my friend from new york who does me the honor to listen probably remembers the incident of mr swartzs membership of the house and say vell it does look very much dot vay mit dem dings i cant contradict you mit dem but i tell you von ding itdont work dot vay mit pigiron and doubtless my friends who favor this bounty project are thoroughly convinced that though protective duties operate that way with everything else they do not work so with sugar whether it be grown or made from sorghum produced in the states in the heart of the continent or from beets along the pacific shores or upon the newly redeemed lands from cane in florida where they are draining and redeeming swamp and overflowed lands which are capable of producing sugarcane equal to the finest that has ever been produced upon the island of cuba where they can produce cane with two months additional growth over that of louisiana so that a stalk in a florida canefield that does not tassel is

to maintain the integrity of this union a direct tax has always been regarded with great disfavor by the people while the power to levy suh a tax is recognized in the constitution yet during a period of one hundred years of national existence under that grand instrument that mode of taxation has been resorted to but four times and in every instance it has been found that it was not an efficient way of raising revenue indeed that it was the worst possible manner of collecting money from the people but the needs of the country at the time of the passage of the act of 1861 were such that congress deemed it advisable to resort to that method of taxation and as an inducement to the loyal states which were exerting themselves in every laudable and patriotic manner possible to maintain the integrity of the union it was provided that if any of those states would assume the amount of the tax which was apportioned to its citizens a commission of 15 per cent would be allowed to the state for so doing under that provision the loyal and patriotic states at the north assumed the responsibility and paid out of their own treasurie5 this large amount of money and as has been stated by

bill for the establishment and endowment of agricultural and mechanical colleges in the several states by appropriating the public lands read very much like the speeches we have heard against the blair bill the agricultural and mechanical college bill became a law twentyfive years since the aid was accepted by the states upon the terms andconditions prescribedin the law and in each state agricultural and mechanical colleges have been established and the splendid results of that wise legislation are a matter of public history and public pride in my own state the agricultural and mechanical college is under able and wise and efficient government and there is no apprehension and never was of federal usurpation as the outgrowth of that munificent benefactionofthe general government on the contrary that college is firmly rooted in the affection and conlidenee and pride of alabama as an institution whose worth and usefulness can not be overestimated but the enemies of the blair bill hope to avoid the fate of those who made such signal mistakes as to the operation and consequences of the agricultural and mechanical appropriation by being classed as false prophets by clinging to the last hope they have that congress has no such power to appropriate money to be raised by taxation as has been adsmitted it possesses to appropriate thepublic lands and their proceeds they claim that the controversy as to the power of congress to make such disposition of the public lands and their proceeds has been ended by long acquiescence and judicial determination grant it but it must not be forgotten that the senators who supported the agricultural and mechanical college bill were just as confident then that congress had such power as the enemies of the blair bill are now after it has been settled the friends of the agricultural and mechanical college bill were arraigned on the charge of being latitudinarian constructionists of the constitution and as favoring a scheme to usurp the rights of the states and centralize all power in a national government under the guise of a bribe to the states to accept federal control in the place of state control of common schools and the education of the people but time and trial and experience have wiped out all the alarming prophecies of those senators who claimed to be the only accredited apostles of jeffersonian democracy and the agricultural and mechanical colleges stand today as indestructible monuments to the wisdom of federal aid to education in my judgment the power of congress is just as well founded in the constitution to make the appropriation as provided in the blair bill as the point is now well settled that congress had the power to make the disposition of the public lands and their proceeds as provided in the bill to establish agricultural and mechanical colleges in the case of the agricultural and mechanical college bill the power of congress to passit rested on the authority of congress to dispose of the lands in the case of the blair bill the authority of congress to pass it rests on the power of congress to appropriate money in the treasury raised from any sources the enemies of the blair bill deny that the power of congress to appropriate money collected from taxation extends beyond the subjects and the objects defined and embraced in the express and implied grants of power to congress in other words they insist that the power to tax and the power to appropriate coexist and are coextensive and both are confined and restrained to the single purpose of enabling congress to exercise and execute the powers contained in the express and implied grants in the constitution and this being true they say it follows necessarily that congresshas no power to appropriate the money in the treasury from taxation to any subject or any object over which congress has no jurisdiction or any power to legislate i do not apprehend that the enemies of the blair bill can complain that i do not unlerstand their position or that i have stated it unitirly if they are right in their construction of the power of apipropriation i would join them in opposition to the blair bill but i differ with them and agree wvith mr calhoun and president monroe that the power of appropriation i for good reasons and wise considerations of public interest is not confined and limited to the execution of the afterwardsenumerated powers of congress but has a wider range in the discretion of congress it must not be understood however that this discretionary power of congress to appropriate public money is itself absolute or unlinited but on the contrary such power can only be exercised for purposes and objects that come honestly and fairly within the meaning of the descriptive words in the constitutionto pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the united states i agree with jefferson madison monroe calhoun story and kent that these descriptive words in the constitution delegate no distinct substantive power to congress but merely define and were used only to define the objects to which the money raised by taxation may be appropriated the power of selecting these objects must necessarily reside somewhere and can be trusted nowhere with any more safety than to the discretion of congress the discretion of congress is trusted by the framers of the constitution in many of its provisions it is trusted with the power to declare war to levy taxes to borrow money to regulate commerce to coin money and regulate its value to exercise exclusive legislation over the district of columbia and the territories and to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers and all other powers vested by this constitution in the government of the united states or in any department or officer thereof the sole question then to answer is whether the commonschool education under the exclusive and absolute jurisdiction control and regulation of the state governments as expressly conceded in the blair bill is a public object possessing in its aggregated and associated efiects and influences throughout the united states such national importance as to bring these common schools fairly within the meaning of the descriptive words of the constitution as objects deserving federal aid in order to promote the general welfhre these common schools have been public objects of national importance and national solicitude from the ibundation of the government several hundred millions in nmoney and public property have been contributed to their existence and support by the federal government under state management this national aid has been so continuing and so common that it has become an established practice of the general government to treat common schools as objects of so much national importance that the states ought not to be allowed to carry the burden of supporting them alone by taxation of their own citizens no man living can deny that common schools under the exclusive jurisdiction of the states have been and are recognized as public objects deserving national aid and support but it is urged by the selfconstituted apostles of jeffersonian l cmocracy that this generalwelthre source of power leaves congress without any bridle or harness to run roughshod all over the face of the earth with the money of the people who is to carry on all this work of destruction under the generalwelfare clause the congress of the united states a house of representatives elected every two years from three hundred and twentyfive districts and seventysix senators elected every six years by the several state legislatures this federal government made by the states and its congress made by the states and the people are to conspire against their own constituents in open day under the eye of the people and under the supervision of the newspaper press to usurp the power of the states centralize the government and destroy the liberties of their own people all this is to be done in one term of the representative as the people and the state legislatures will certainly be incapable of selfgovernmentif they reelect such a congress to consummate such dire calamities mr president i do not believe it the people can not be made to give serious consideration to such wild speculations a few words in conclusion in answer to some objections that have been urged to the machinery of the blair bill the morrill bill it will be remembered expressly required that its terms and conditions should be accepted byan act of the legislature of each state before receiving its share and the bill also expressly provided that no state should be paid any part of the appropriation until it raised enough from its own revenue to keep open the common schools at least four months in each year which would then have compelled alabama to about double its schooltax before a dollar would have been paid to her under the provisions of the morrill bill and with the teller amendment all the proceeds of the public lands which have since amounted to over ten millions per annum would have been subjected to many of the same conditions contained in the blair bill now pronounced by the supporters of the morrill bill and the teller amendment to be too humiliating and degrading and dangerous to the states under the blair bill alabama would receive over a half million dollars each of the eight years without increasing its schooltax one cent and if she wishes more of the fede ral aid all she has to do is to add to her own school fund whatever she pleases and receive an additional amount from the appropriation in the blair bill every state in the union is put on precisely the same footing and each receives on the basis of its illiteracy an amount equal to its own school fund i make the following quotation from the speech of the senator from new york i now come to the principal feature of this bill in the first place the bill adheres to the proposition that we are not to undertake the regulation of the instruction of the schools and their management inside the states we arc offering au endowmentin aid of the resources ant of the activities and of the desires of the different states we are not ndcrtaking to coerce in the least degree the acceptance or permission on tile part of the states to meet and accept this proposition or to reject it then we areecarcful after tlisciidovment is pressei upon them and is accepted by them to effect no oilier coercion or persuasin which is a better phrase for it to use and employ these agencies and these resourceswhich shall in the least enervate their domestic interests or break down the zeal and the virtue of their own endowments in the same direction beyond that although they protect their funds their principal being supplemented or reduced by our added aggregate wealth we also do not compel in tie least that taxation for a dollar shall be pressed there beyond their present purposes and their present laws we hold before them no compulsion that they shall raise from their own resources by taxation or otherwise an equal amount to that which we offer them we guard then on the one side and on the other against any encroachment upon the freedom and the ease of the states in meeting this endowment first bysaving them from any fear thatour endowment may check or nip or divert the growing zeal and growing duty and growing performance of duly among their own people by their owu taxation we say to them you are to receive from us under this distribution no more than you raise yourselves on the other hand as i say neither by undue excitement nor by aiiy menace of withdrawing aid do we urge the taxation beyond the easy and proper assessments that may be laid we say to the states whatever you raise and only that amount you shall receive and if you raise up to the amount that we ofler then you have a doubled fortune so if the senator from alabamal ur morgan will allow me all this apprehension of the pressure oi tie people of alabama whom lie so ably represents and defends iii their institutions in their policy in their customs in their tendencies it seems to me swings entirelyfree of the measure of this bill it is urged that in the words in the blair bill the instruction shall include the art of reading writing and

effectually tend to establish a coal monopoly and raise the price of coal and private coal lands than the withdrawal of the public coal lands from the market by the united states i think the best way to secure in the future an ample supply of coal at fair rates is to provide some simple honest way of disposing of the public lands in small holdings to actual bona fide settlers of the country they will protect it and preserve it better than the government can but the moment you say you will not sell coal lands just that moment the north pacific railroad and other companies with their millions of acres of such coal lands will at once raise the price of coal and coal lands how can the people get the coal if the syndicates own most of the private coal lands and the government refuses to dispose of such public land we are in a bad fix you ought to say to the people of the country that they may go on prospetting for minerals of all kinds go on making investigations and secure what they want if they can find it at a fair price we want the country developed that is the best protection to the people against corporate monopoly it is the only protection against the coal monopoly we hear so much of here this evening it is the only protection to the people whose lands have been so recklessly disposed of what is to be done with the coal lands unless the government proposes to go into the business of mining coal no one dares propose such a scheme if we have coal land the important question is how we are to get it in such shape as to enable the people to get the benefit of it the government will have to take it out or else provide some way to dispose of the land or coal itself you can not get coal without money and labor people will not dig coal for nothing for the chances of a paying mine some will take big risks i am in favor of allowing the settlers who have the good fortune ot finding coal upon the lands which they occupy as homesteads to have the advantage of whatever coal they may find in it the coal is not lost to the country at all if on the contrary you say you will not partiwith thetitle to coal lands noone who hears mue will live toseethe coal disposed of the
