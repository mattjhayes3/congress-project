that the report excepting one item has already been before the house the issue between the two houses has been in relation to the appropriation for the intercontinental railway survey by several yeaandnay votes the house hasrefused to make that appropriation not so much on account of the money involved therein as because it seemed to carry with it obligations of various sorts of a very grave nature which were presented to this house when the consular and diplomatic bill was up for consideration before and when the former conference reporton this bill was before the house a second conference discloses a disposition on the part of the senate to insist upon the expenditure of 65 000 the conferees on the part of the house believing that the adoption of that appropriation without anything else carries with it moral and perhaps legal obligations in reference to the neutrality of the road and various other items which were carried by an amendment insisted that every doubt upon that question should be removed that there should be a declaration on this subject pronounced in all its details expressive of the attitude of the house upon the subject and that the nations of central and south america should be duly informed thereon in order that there should be no possible question raised as to its position hereafter i will read the several provisos attached to this appropriation by the report of the conferees provided that this sum shall be in full of the share of the united states for the expense of said preliminary survey and protided farther that it shall not be lawful for any officer of the united states or person connected with the international commission of engineers as a representative of the united states to participate in any action as to proposals to build the whole line of intercontinental railroad or any part thereof andprovidedfurther that to avoid any misunderstanding on the part of the central and south american nations it is hereby declared that no officer of the government of the united states shall commit or attempt to commit it to the approval of the surveys the terms of proposal the protection of the concessionaires the inspection of the work the legislation affecting it the neutrality of the road the free passage of the merchandise in transit thereon or to aid in the construction thereof in any form either alone or in connection with other nations interested and that the president of the united states cause notice of this declaration to be communicated to these several nations this covers the language of the international declaration which appeared in the debate containing sixteen sections one of which related to theappropriation for the survey and out of which it was claimed on the part of some that the honor of the government was involved and a fear that the same claim might be asserted with reference to these other sections alarmed the house and largely prevented its assent to the appropriation now i have felt from the beginning and i think the house has that on the first opportunity which the demooratic party had it made a declaration against these sixteen sections and the construction put thereon by the former secretary of state mr blaine it declared its determination not to consent to the expenditure of this money and for these reasons there then came a point at which the senate conferees declared that it was not their purpose to commit the government in any of these particulars and taking the text of this international declaration this proviso was coined from it in thought and word the conferees thought and believed that this declaration of the policy of the government laid down in the statute if it shall be adopted and communicated to th3 nations of south america would give an assurance to the american people that there can be no entangling connection with reference to south american affairs and especially with reference to this railroad if hereafter the matter of negotiation of treaties with reference to this samie subject over which we now havecontrol shall arise the moral force of this statute will stand on the pages of the statute book of the country as an expression of the will of the democratic partyr furthermore if later or there shall appear in reference to the nicaragua canal or any other project in this country and foreign countries the distinct expression found contained in this amendment will have potent effect in connection therewith the gentleman from indiana i thought said with great aptness and force that a declaration of this sort in this statute under these circumstances was worth the amount of money appropriated 65 000 i would gladly have stood against the appropriation but when it was stripped of everything else except the mere matter of the expenditure of 65 000 1 then felt that we had reached a point in the difference between the senate and the house when there was nothing left except a mere question of money the apprehensions entertained had all been stilled by this proviso the conferees in their report have recommended the appropriation of this money with the provisos which i have read in a spirit of
