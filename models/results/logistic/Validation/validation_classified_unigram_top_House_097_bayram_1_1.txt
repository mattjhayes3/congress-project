be forced to live on less the 255 lumpsum death benefit will be eliminated when there is no eligible spouse or entitled child a more stringent recency of work test will prevent many disabled persons

or age differences between individuals however in the 1980s as the new administration begins to tackle the health care financing and delivery issues facing the unitedstates health care system concern will undoubtedly begin to focus on the relationship between federal health budget reductions and potential reduced access to medical care by the poor and elderly this may require the application of civil rights principles to the delivery of health services in the context of an ever changing political and economical environment consequently a new emphasis on civil rights as a mreans to protect health benefits may be needed to continue the public debate over equal access to medical care as a right for all americans even during a time of economic austerity the delivery of medical care in the united states through the use of expensive technology has fostered spiralling health care costs and the development of one of the largest service industries in the nation however access to medical care is limited for many americans with low incomes and who lack adequate health insurance protection during the past 15 years medical care for the poor and elderly has been subsidized primarily under the medicare and medicaid programs these programs help transfer a traditional welfare and charity arrangement of financing medical care into new attempts to mainstream medical care for the indigent populations this emphasis on making the availability of medical care more equitable has increased the purchasing power for the indigent and has helped to close the gap in health services and health status between black and white americans moreover recent attempts to expand the health care purchasing power of the poor along with removing discrimination barriers have been instrumental in assuring equity and accessibility in the delivery of medical care now this trend is being reexamined to reduce federal and state health expenditures and to develop more prudent methods of financing medical care for the poor the two major health care financing laws were created in 1965medicare and medicaid programsto help assure equal access to medical care for the elderly poor and disabled medicare established uniform hospitaland medical benefits which are administered as part of the social security program for all elderly persons regardless of income or place of residence now 16 years later despite the dramatic rise in public spending for health care the aged pay more out of pocket for health care than they did before medicare began the medicaid program was designed to aid and encourage the states to provide minimum health benefits for at least those individuals receiving federal income protection a ssistanceafce and ssi in 1975 many states began to liberalize entitlement and benefits for medicaid to individuals meeting specific categorical and income eligibility requirements the federal and state governments attempted to fulfill national expectations to make health cafe available to all even those unable to purchase private health insurance however runaway health care costs began to exceed public expenditures to meet this goal in 1978 states began to take measures to reduce expenditures under the medicaid program through lower fees to medical providers elimination of optional benefits and reducing the number of persons classified as medically needy for enrollment in the program the result of these policies was to reduced access to medical care for many of the poor as states began to restrict budget allocations for programs such as medicaid this required many indigent patients to rely on charity hospitals and other facilities that were funded by local government to obtain medical care thus many of the poor and elderly have been subjected to segregated facilities based upon inadequate purchasing power this time segregation was not on the basis of race but based upon low incomes and inadequate health insurance protection racial discrimination has been of fered as an explanation for racial differences in the utilization of nursing homes between blacks and whites many have concluded that racial dis crimination plays a major role in nursing home admission procedures this may also account for the low percentages and inadequacies of nursing home care used by blacks and other minor ities contrary to some reports these differences cannot be viewed based simply upon disparities in life expectancy between blacks and whites since recent mortality data identifies few differences between racial groups above the age 6f 70 1urthermore lower rates of nursing home usage among blacks cannot be attributable simply to more superior health status this stance is supported by recent data which suggest that therev is a higher incidence of disabilities amonir black elderly whicht may require institutionalization than among elderly whites for example the black elderly are more likely than elderly whites to reside as a part of an ex tended family living at home because they lack the resouirces tobe supported by nursing homes or other alterna tive living arrangements aside from racial discrimination economic limitations play a major rolein reduced nursing home utilization additionally nursing home beds are in short supply in many urban areas and blacks with limited and lower incomes have relatively fewer chances of obtaining admission consequently the black elderly are more likelyr thani white elderly to be institutionalized in settings other than nursing homes such as mental and chronic disease hospitals moreover reliance oni social security and medicaid for income and health insurance protection reduces their ability to receive quality nursing home and home health services a form of economic discrimination is thus created because many nursing homes are not willing to accept medicaid recipients it is well known that title vi of thel civil rights act prohibits discrimination violations on the basis of race color or national origin in any program or entity such as a hospital home health agency community health center and nursing home facility receiving federal assistance but relatively little is known about the application of this provision on eliminating access barriers to federal health benefit programs for the general population for example the de partment of health and human services office of civil rights ocr was involved in litigations during the l1970s over batterns of racial lsegregation among hospitals in new orleans la arid other urban areas similarly in 1978 ocr be came concerned about potential eases of discrimination against minorities die to reductions relocations l and closures of hospital facilities in urban communities currently we are not certain what position ocr will take under the new administrationto guarantee equal access to medical care for the poor elderly and handicapped citizens of this nation we can only hope that this office will continue its efforts to reduce barriers and practices of discrimination the primary cause of hospital closures facing many urban commnunities is the amount of care they provide to patients who cannot afford to pay for services and who lack adequate health insurance protection recent estimates in dicate that at least 200 hospitils closed during the 2month period between 1975 to 1977 this fact isl often related to the large numbers of individuals who lack medical insurance for example recent data has reported that over 23 million persons have no health insurance coverage in the united states and another 20 million have inadequate coverage many of these individuals are considered the working poor with incomes above state medicaid eligibility levels but are inadequate to purchase private health insurance or to pay directly for the medical care they need many of the poor and working poor would be eligible for medicaid if it were not for limited income eligibility requirements imposed by states these limitations on eligibility and scope of benefits contribute significantly to the gapq in coverage that exist among the medically indigent under the medicaid progran these gaps have become even wider in many states due to limited state expenditures to finance medicaid this requires many charity and public hospitals to provide expensive medical care free to individuals without health insurance in the past it was possible for private and voluntary hospitals to recoup a portion of their losses on services to uncovered patients by passing this lost on to privatepaying patients public general hospitals deficits for providing free care to a sizable number of their patients were usually subsidized by local governments now due to shrinking tax revenues for innercity areas many public general hospitals are in2 great financial distress since many local governments can no longer support them in a number of urban areas public hospitals which are the major sources of primary care and the only source of emergency and trauma services began to close moreover these closures have begun to be seen as a serious threat to reducing access to medical care for urban residents and viewed as a legittmate civil rights issue for example a recent study identified that the percentage of minority residents of the community around the hospital is directly related to the proportion of hospital closing or relocating from the area in neighborhoods 025 percent black in 1970 for example only 14 2 percent of the hospitals hadf closed or relocated between 1937 to 1977 but neighborhoods 70 to 100 percent black in 1970 fully 48 9 percent of hospitalsalmost half had disappeared other consequences of hospital closures include firstdeparture of the few remaining primary care physicians in private practice from the community surrounding the hospitals and second lost of health service employment opportunities for community residents these conditions have further reduced the effectiveness of the urban health care delivery system and to reduce assurance of equal access for many urban residents who have limited medical care purchasing power a number of cases now pending before ocr are designed to determine whether reductions in the availability of medical care due to hospital closures violate title vi since these actibns occur more readily in minority and poor communities many have viewed these closures as an act of racism cases involving homer 0 fhillips hospital in st louis mo and thenew york city health hospitals corp which have either closed or reduced health services in recent years are major litigation disputes for ocr the complaints allege that proposed reductions in medical services by hospital closures in predominantly black communities would reduce access to health care since few alternative health care resources were available contrary to earlier civil rights legal cases which involve hospitals and other health facilities practicing discrimination in the provision of medical care to minorities and handicapped individuals present cases have not gained national attention however as more hospitals and community health centers either close or reduce services due to recent federal health budget reductions we may expect future civil rights debates to be concerned with reduced access to federally funded health programs one major objective of title vi of the civil rights act in regard to the delivery of health services was to prevent minority patients who are seriously ill from being turned away from hospitals and community health centers legal disputes involving patients who were transferred from private to public hospitals or subjected to long delays for medical care are now being considered as a violation against federal civil rights statutes these problems of discrimination appear to be most frequent for blacks mexican americans asian immigrants a number of civil rights regulators have recently examined policies of proprietary hospitals that require patients to pay advance payments prior to receiving treatment and the diagnosis of illness in addition the failure of proprietary hospitals to inform patients of their free care obligations which they must assume in accepting hillburton funds can be considered an attempt to prevent poor patients from receiving equal access to medical care in private health facilities these examples of discrimination practices in the delivery of health care services may have to be rsolved within the context of civil rights protectionism civil rights in the delivery of medical care may gain prominence in the 1980s to assure equal access to medical care for the poor heightened public concerns about the relationship between federal budget cuts greater control by state governments and efforts to reduce access to medical care mpay be a concern of many black elderly yet the entrenched coalitions and ideological commitments to reduce inflation will continue to influence the debate on mainstream medical care for the poor and elderly we can only hope that concerns over whether blacks and other minorities are discriminated against by the private health system may be raised as a major public policy issue in this round of debate as in others that consider equal access to medical care the major issue will undoubtedly relate to an individuals ability to purchase medical care this argument is highly needed based upon recent attempts to reduce medicaid recipients freedom to choose health providers which may encourage the poor to receive substandard care in socalled medicaid mills ironically the governments new emphasis to convert categorical health programs into block grants to reduce medical care inflation has been opposed most vigorously by opponents that this will encourage states to reduce funding to urban health facilities that serve the minority poor conventional public opinion suggests that few solutions other than legal disputes are most likely to emerge during this period of federal budget reductions congressional leaders must understand the importance of federal health funds as a necessary ingredient to assure minorities and the poor equal access to medical care only in the event of strong and coordinated leadership committed to the ideas of civil rights and equal access to medical care can we expect that the poor and elderly will fare better during this decade"], [0.046790361404418945, 0.953209638595581, 1, "i wish to thank the gentleman for yielding~to me and to commend him for his outstanding

federal republic of nigeria which used the american constitution as a blueprint for its own democratic government the honorable alhaji shehu shagarl president of the federal republic of nigeria and

institution for the fostering of international understanding peace and harmony through a healthy exchange of parliamentarians and parliamentary practices and procedures he further stated i am fully convinced that this exchange and crossfertilization of ideas has helped a great deal in promoting wider international understanding and cooperation not only among lawmakers but also among the dif ferent states represented in the union the interparliamentary union has fostered international peace unity and harmony through constant dialogue i would ask to include the full text of president shagaris speech at the close of my remarks i was assigned to the committee on nonselfgoverning ter ritories and ethnic questions and i am also submitting for the benefit of the house the draft resolutions which came out of that committee and which will be voted on in rome in september of this year the central issue of concern in the ipu committee on nonselfgoverning territories as well as elsewhere in discussions amongst the african and other third world delegates was south africas continued occupation of namibia it may be difficult for many americans to understand the immediacy and depth of feeling attached to this issue indeed in the past 18 months we have been encouraged by officials within our government to redefine the situation in southern africa and to view it from within the definitions of ideological and geopolitical conflicts that trou ble western europe in doing so the united states has taken a giant step backward into the 19th century this is a naive and dangerous view not one on which strong and lasting unitedstates relations with the countries of africa and the third world can be based it is a view in which even our staunchest nato allies part company it is a view attractive to people who have completed political science sequences within universities which stress only the history of 19th century political conflicts between european nations however it is a view which has nothing to do with the realities of contemporary africa and with the determination of nonwhite populations to shake off the yokes of colonialism and apartheid anyone who fails to see that this struggle against apartheid and its extension to namibia will remain the primary determinant of african sentiments toward america and europe is dangerously insensitive and out of touch in this regard it is clear that current unitedstates policy toward southern africa represents at best a highrisk strategy which shows no signs of working at worst a dangerous drift toward permanently redefining unitedstates commitments to human rights and lacial justice the implications for our own society are extremely troubling the negative impact that this apparent attempt to reverse unitedstates policy is having on our relationships with the nations of africa and the third world was starkly evident in lagos i do not wish to make a partisan speech but it is recognized that outside of africa unitedstates diplomatic interests and long range strategic objectives are extremely frayed within africa unitedstates interests are held hostage by and are completely at the mercy of the south african government at any moment some event within south africa or namibia or even some event external to the region may crystallize world sentiment against the united states i submit that this is a result of the radical policy reversal that has taken place within the past 18 months it is not a solution in which the congress can afford to acquiesce the reagan administrations southern africa policy is based on two conflicting views the first is that south africa is a bulwark against soviet expansion and as such must be supported by the united states no matter how repugnant its internal policies the second view is that the africaners are a prickly people who must be humored by the united states if they are to be encouraged to make changes essential to their own survival the truth of the matter is that south africa has no intention of making changes within south africa nor of seeing an independent government come to power in namibia so long as it can avoid it unless it is forced to by events which remain unforeseen the south african position with respect to the united states is simple as previously articulated by south african officials in meetings with our own government some time ago south africa feels that through internal repression and the forced relocation of black and nonwhite populations it can contain any developments which might occur among its black and nonwhite populations provided the united states will guarantee protection from any outside force including south african freedom fighters who are foreigntrained or fighting with foreign advisers like a hapless giant the united states has apparently acquiesced the result is ai increasingly dangerous isolation of our government in africa and among the nations of the third world in addition those major nations such as nigeria which risked their own international standing in order to counsel patience in this and other conflicts now feel increasingly that they have been toyed with by the united states in short we are at a pivotal point the positive regard with which our efforts in southern africa were viewed has been dissipated a policy which is not seen as bungling is increasingly viewed as duplicitous my question is is it worth it for the united states and is this dangerous drift in unitedstates relations something to be acquiesced in by the congress i believe most of my colleagues are unaware of how radical the unitedstates policy drift has been the documented information i cite has been developed by the house committee on foreign affairs and puts into sharp focus criticisms that were made by the ipu delegates it is time we took a hard look at the unitedstates policy shift in the 18 months that it has been in office the reagan administration has initiated a number of changes in american policy toward south africa following are some of the changes which have been undertaken in march 1981 the administration granted visas to three senior south african military intelligence officers including general vander westhizen chief of military intelligence and the former south african military attach6 who had been asked to leave the united states following the expulsion of the unitedstates military attach6 in south africa even though there was a policy of not permitting senior military army and intelligence officers to come to the united states visas were issued to these three officials supposedly by error they subsequently met with unitedstates ambassador to the u n jeanne kirkpatrick and officials at the national security council and the defense department the united states upgraded its milltary attache office at the american embassy in pretoria and allowed the south africans to do the same in washington in november 1981 and march 1982 two south african generals visited the united states as part of a namibia negotiating team in october 1981 two police officers attended international conferences in the united states the presence of these officials casts doubt on the departments earlier statement that the admission of three south african generals was in error the united states permitted the south african government to establish as many as five new honorary consulates in the united states in pittsburgh seattle phoenix cleveland and denver the city of pittsburgh has strongly protested the administration changed the foreign policy export controls in june 1981 to permit the sale of medical equipment to the south african military and to permit the sale of crime control devices to the south african government it should be noted that shortly after the completion of this sale a group of south africans were able to smuggle arms out of south african over land in an aborted attempt to overthrow the government of the sychelles the administration further amended the foreign policy export controls in february 1982 to permit the sale of items to the south african police military and security forces previously the carter administration had refused american companies permission to sell any items to the south african police military or security forces the new administration policy makes it easier for american companies to sell computers to those agencies and ministries in south africa responsible for enforcing apartheid the departments of state and commerce have agreed to gralit two american companiesbeechcraft and piperlicenses to export up to 22 air ambulances to the south afncan air force these will probably be used to ferry wounded troops from namibia to south africa the south african government wants to purchase at least six of these planes which can also be configured as troop carriers and intelligencegathering planes in 1981 the united states permitted approximately 20 south african nuclear technicians to come to this country to receive training at unitedstates government facilities the administration approved the travel of several american technicians from the department of energy to travel to south africa to investigate that countrys coal to gas conversion process previously such cooperation between unitedstates government agencies and south african government agencies had been denied in march 1982 the administration granted an export license to an american companycontrol datato sell a cyber 170 750 computer to south africas governmentcontrolled center for industrial and

in order to circumvent unitedstates nonproliferation laws the department of state may have been aware of this transaction arguing that public statements are counterproductive the administration has backed away from the basic human rights principles of the carter administration and has ceased to make any public statements about south africas ongoing human rights violations the administration vetoed a u n resolution condemning south africas invasion of angola last fall and did not protest south africas earlier attack on the african national congress in mozambique the administration has not criticized south africas support or rebels attempting to overthrow the governrients of angola and mozambique more subtly the administrations fiscal year 1982 aid request recommended elimination of the unitedstates contribution to the u n trust fund for south africa the money from this fund was used to pay lawyers in south africa to defend black and white south africans arrested for political offenses or for violating south africas aparthied laws the administration also asked for reductions in unitedstates contributions to the u n trust fund for namibia which is used to help train and educate namibian refugees the administration refused to go along with a joint french british and german initiative to condemn the south africans for forcibly relocating thousands of blacks from the cape town area in the dead of winter to their socalled homelands 800 miles away in the transkei it refused to protest the unexplained death in detention of dr neil agaitt a white doctor who was arrested for his work advising black trade unionists the administration has not publicly condemned the impending execution of three black south africans for political offenses in addition to risking unitedstates relations with other nations and to committing the united states to a policy which is repugnant to our own institutions and to the overwhelming majority of the american people there is already ample evidence that the administrations new approach has not worked in fact it may have encouraged the south african government to take even harsher measures against both blacks and whites who oppose its apartheid policies there are indications that the administrations policies may be enco raging the repression of moderate elements within south africa and increasing the commitment of the people of south africa and of namibia to change at any price in the past 18 months the south african government has made no meaningful reforms instead its actions have been in the direction of greater repression in 1981 the south african government arrested and detained for political reasons over 300 black trade union members many of them leaders of some of south africas most moderate trade unions these arrests and detentions without trial continue dr neil aggit a white labor union official mysteriously died while in detention and at least two other black officials had to be taken to mental institutions following intensive questioning the south african government has banned two black newspapersthe post and the sunday post the gov ernment had previously banned the world and the weekend

revoking his passport bishop tutu is an opponent of apartheid he is the head of the anglican church in south africa and secretarygeneral of the south african council of churches bishop tutu was to be the keynote speaker at the allard lowenstein memorial lecture series at yale and to receive an honorary doctorate at columbia the government has forcibly removed thousands of blacks in cape town and relocated them hundreds of miles from their families in impoverished semiarid rural areas the government has stepped up its bannings and detentions of both white and black student leaders including

encourage savings and investment by reducing the maximum federal tax rates on longterm capital gains from 49 to 28 percent as a result of this farsighted action there has been a significant increase in both the number of individual investors and in total equity values unfortunately however despite these positive developments current economic conditions demand that we enact additional tax measures to further stimulate capital format ion and to end the tax bias against savings and investment for this reason i am today introducing the comprehensive savings incentive act of 1981 a bill designed to significantly increase both our savings and productivity rate to expand the number of individual shareholders and to create millions of dollars of equity capital for our financially starving industries in brief the bill is comprised of three major provisions the first provision permanently increases the amount of money an individual may exclude from taxation on dividends and interest earned on savinus accounts from the current limit of 200 400 to 1 000 2 000 for individuals and married couples as my colleagues will recall the 200 400 provision was incorporated within the socalled windfall profits tax bill and is expected to significantly increase our gross national product the rate of private investment productivity and employment i believe that far greater benefits are to be gained by increasing the exclusion amount and by making it a permanent part of our tax code the second provision of this legislation modifies our tax code as it affects individual retirement accounts at present to qualify for an ira an individtual must be earning an income either as a salaried or selfemployed worker and must not be eligible for an organized pension or retirement plan iras are personal taxdeferred retirement plans which allow individuals to put 15 dercent of their yearly incomeup to 1 500into a special interestbearing account while i believe there is merit in reevaluating the eligibility requirements for an ira my bill simply recognizes that because of recurrent doubledigit inflation we must increase the amount of money people are ab le to setaside in an ira for this reason my bill increases the individual limit of 1 500 to 2 500 and correspondingly increases the spousal deduction from 1 750 to 3 000 the third and final provision of this legislation provides for a further rollback in the effective tax rates on capital gains from 28 to 21 percent for individuals and corporations i am convinced that a further reduction in the capital gains rate is overdue and that it can be financed in effect by higher realizations of gains and related tax receipts consisting largely of ordinary income earned by brokers executing sales commissions in fact this finding is consistent with the results of the 1978 reduction which has increased capital gains receipts to the treasury department by some 900 million additionally it is significant to note that a reduction in the capital gains tax from 28 to 21 percent received the enthusiastic support of the senate in its consideration of the revenue act of 1978 at that time the senate finance committee reported that the committee believes that lower capital gains tax will markedly increase sales of appreciated assets which will offset much of the revenue loss from the tax cut and potentially lead to an actual increase in revenues in addition the improved mobility of capital will stimulate investment thereby generating more economic activity and more tax revenue it is my firm belief that this type of antiinflationary individual tax cut compliments the presidents own tax proposal which i fully support and will help produce lasting jobs in the private sector minimize the risk of a new and worse recession result in lower interest rates increased capital investment and productivity and will strengthen the dollar abroad what i am proposing here today is an idea designed to benefit all americans for in this time of economic crisis we must do all thatwe can to increase the amount of available capital capital is the lifeblood of our economy and without it we will continue to experience high

upon mr teagues retirement from the house in 1978 after 32 years of illustrious service to our nation and most especially to veterans this award is indeed a fitting tribute to a man whose accomplishments in the field of veterans rights and benefits are exceeded by none mr mowles was selected for this years award from many nominations submitted by va facilities around the country the entries ranged from work with alcoholic and psychiatric patients to an innovative health care delivery system for veterans with communicative disorders past teague awards have gone for pioneering work in the field of sex education and counseling of spinal cord injury victims for the design and development of devices for veterans with orthopedic or prosthetic disabilities and for the development of

the administrations economic program has so depressed economic activity and economic prospects that we now have tremendous amounts of excess idle capacity in our factories and the threats of new waves of bankruptcies among our businesses the people of the united states now want their chance at a meaningful tax relief package a vote for the fauntroy substitute will give them that chance under the congressional black caucus proposal your middle income constituents will fare far better in tax relief than under the kemprothreagan second and third year tax measures under our tax proposal the 96 percent of the people of this country who make 50 000 a year or less will have much more money in their pockets and in their pocketbooks gone in our proposal are last years windfall profits tax exemptions of 1 billion gone are the tax loopholes that gave excessive benefits to oil companies and to people who invested only in chinese and antiques and gold coins those features of the fauntroy substitute measured alone save us 10 billion in deficit spending a vote for the congressional black caucus is a vote to reduce taxes for 96 percent of the people of this country this is the peoples house and we ask you to give them a chance to receive what they want and what they need meaningful real tax relief the people of this country want relief from the enormous budget deficit that has resulted from last years tax giveaway to the rich and the gigantic increase in military spending of last year the people o this country now know that those large deficits mean continued high interest rates and thus continued small business and small farmer failures and continued high unemployment at record levels such as we have achieved in this past year the people of this countryand remember this is the peoples housewant a strong national defense but they do not want domination of the world they want an end to nuclear proliferation and your vote for the fauntroy substitute will give them that they know with former secretary of the defense ielvin laird thatand i quote him our true strategic military needs have little to do with military weapons except to deter their use against us he points out that we must be able to keep open the sea and air links that bind us to our allies and that we need to be able to hold ground on the borders of europe and elsewhere and to protect and sustain power at great distance none of these objectives as i continue to quote former secretary of defense melvin laird none of these objectives requires nuclear weapons your vote for the fauntroy substitute will acknowledge that fact ii12689 the caucus budget also anwers a number of concerns raised by amendments offered for consideration under the rule today for those of you who have offered amendments to raise the cola caps in the jones budget for federal employees and retirees and to all of my colleagues who intend to support those amendments i say that a vote for the caucus amendment does just what you want the fauntroy substitute does not require such amendments since it incorporates the cbo baseline levels which preserve current service costofliving adjustments for federal pay and pensions a number of members have offered amendments to increase funding for function 500 education above the level recommended by the house budget committee the fauntroy substitute also as proposed raises funding for education above the house budget committee level and indeed it includes funding to restore programs to the present fiscal year 1982 reductions as passed in grammlatta let me now briefly outline the details of the congressional black caucus substitute before concluding my remarks you first ought to understand that the cbc budget reduces the deficit substantially in fact the congressional budget office has estimated that our budget will produce a 92 8 billion deficit in fiscal year 1983 which is lower by at least 10 billion than the deficit estimated by cbo for any other substitute and half the 183 billion deficit that will exist if nothing is done to rectify the errors of last years budget moreover our budget will lead to steadily shrinking deficits of 60 billion in fiscal year 1984 and a 18 billion surplus in fiscal year 1985 bringing interest rates down and providing the basis for genuine economic recovery in our country second you ought to know that the fauntroy substitute is fair and humane we not only prevent that many additional cuts in human needs programs as proposed by the president we return funds to social programs that were lost by the enactment of the reagan fiscal year 1982 budget reductions these programs must remain federal priorities if we value human potential and care to meet human needs because of savings generated by our alternative tax and defense policies several education health housing and urban programs can be restored to fiscal year 1981 funding levels adjusted for inflation for example the fauntroy substitute adds 3 3 billion to title i 600 million to pell grants for disadvantaged college students increasing funding for health care programs it adds 600 million in social services funding including child welfare programs and 1 billion more tlan reagan for pollution control it retains eda and the legal services corporation and lowincome energy and other conservation programs the third thing that this budget does is that it stimulates and creates jobs a centerpiece of our budget proposal is the creation of a major 6 billion to 8 billion federal jobs vocational education and training package this is a response to both the nations unemployment rate generally and to the catastrophic unempioyment in the black community specifically the fauntroy substitute also includes a 4 billion urban infrastructure proposal which will create 50 000 to 80 000 jobs directly and more indirectly a 4 billion expansion in mass transit and highway construction programs which will create an equal number of jobs in this country it also includes home ownership assistance and rental housing construction programs that will stimulate employment in residential construction finally the budget insures adequate social security and other support for the nations poor both the elderly and the nonelderly this budget maintains the costofliving adjustment for elderly on fixed incomes and expands unemployment compensation benefits at a time when we have 10 3 million people out of work the program triggers in the caucus budget increase eligibility for the unemployed to 52 weeks in our view this restoration of benefits is necessary at a time when we are experiencing the levels of unemployment which have not been endured since the depression our budget also provides increased funding for other programs to assist the poor including 3 2 billion more than reagan for aid to families with dependent children 5 billion more for food stamps 3 billion more for medicaid and medicare 1 2 billion more for six health programs and 400 million more for supplemental social insurance as my colleagues in the congressional black caucus follow me they will give you more details about the caucus budget resolution i simply want to remind you again that this is the peoples house and we ought to give the people the life support programs that will cushion them through these difficult times we need to give 96 percent of the people of this country the kird of tax relief that we have pr45mised in the generalized language about tax relief for all of the people we need to give the people relief from the enormous deficits and the high interest rates that have robbed the people of this country of homes and farms small businesses and 2 5 million jobs just since july of last year a vote for the fauntroy substitute the economic recovery program of the congressional black caucus will do just that at this time i would like to add the congressional budget offices reestimate of our budget proposal and yield time to my distinguished colleague from new york the third ranking member of the ways and means committee to share with you what our proposal does with respect to tax relief for the american people"], [0.06543487310409546, 0.9345651268959045, 1, "the administration promises in essence that tax reductions of 30 percent spread over a 3year period combined with federal spending cuts leading to a balanced budget in 1985 will so stimulate the private economy that inflation will be curbed industrial strength restored and joblessness reduced providing in the presidents words a brighter future for all of our citizens but will this occur even the conservative business week magazine feared the tax cuts would touch off an inflationary explosion yet something must be done chronic inflation hovers at about 13 percent a year unemployment by latest count was running at 8 percent with 8 million americans out of work unitedstates manufacturers are losing markets abroad and facing tough competition with foreign products at home the productivity growth rate in the past decade fell to half of what it had been for the previous 20 years these economic woes are serious not only the president and the congress but also the local governments labor and management must pull together to reverse these disturbing statisticsand the human distress behind the statistics if the pittsburgh area i represent is typical the administrations strategy is beginning to confront the american people and the congresseven those of us who support the goal of reduced federal spendingwith agonizing decisions as specific details of the reductions strike home visiting delegations complain of false economies heavy burdens thrown on already troubled local governments and cuts that impose disproportionate shares of the sacrifice on our program take the presidents proposal to require tenants of subsidized housing to pay increased rents going up to 30 percent of their income by 1985 from serving on pittsburghs public housing authority board i know that tenants are hard pressed to meet current rents at 25 percent of their income moreover as the administration seeks to cut back subsidized housing by 4 6 billion in 1981 and another 8 7 billion in 1982 i cannot help but visualize the long waiting lists of needy families hoping for assisted housing in our community corporations doing business overseas meanwhile are alarmed over proposed reduction in exportimport bank funding direct loans would be slased 800 million in 1981 600 million in 1982 loan guarantees would be cut 1 billion this year 1 2 billion the next the president jutifles this by asserting that restoration of general economic health in the unitedstates economy will be a more powerfil stimulant to export expansion than costly subsidized loans foreign firms however typically get big subsidies from their governments corporate and union leaders fear that reduced eximbank loans which help keep unitedstates firms on an equal footing will hurt our trade balance and put americans out of work during eximbank hearings before the international trade investment and monetary policy subcommittee on which i serve we heard testimony that each billion dollars in exports creates 40 000 unitedstates jobs gordon c hurlbert president of the power systems co of westinghouse said large facilities with thousands of employees including an east pittsburgh plant will be seriously threatened if eximbank contraction causes the loss of far east sales and if large american companies lose their competitive edge in foreign trade the ripple effect will spread to the many small suppliers and subcontractors engaged by these international corporations during 1980 allegheny county controller frank j lucchino reports federal assistance to the county amounted to approximately 177 million the city of pittsburgh according to deputy city controller raymond e johnson jr received 75 million in federal assistance without being narrowly parochial i believe most of my constituents expect me to examine the proposed reduction of these funds to make sure they do not do more harm than good prime minister margaret thatcher several years ago using similar rhetoric about restoring the enterprise system sharply reduced funding for british social programs as the reagan administration now proposed to do the soaring unemployment rates and high bankruptcies that followed caution us against accepting promised results on faith i am not convinced for example that it makes sense to eliminate cetacomprehensive employment training actjobs throwing lowskilled employees back on welfare would not even be cost effective and it seems to contradict the workfare not welfare theme of mr reagan if some ceta programs are poorly managed and if some fail to train participants so they can successfully enter the private job market when their public jobs end i would favor the most rigorous efforts to correct these weaknesses but why throw out a program that reduces the human and economic waste of unemployment the proposed elimination of 1 billion in federal assistance for the operating cost of local mass transit systems would translate into a 16 millionayear loss to the pittsburgh port authority county officials tell me that if this federal funding is withdrawn they have three choicesto raise bus fares from 75 cents to an estimated 1 05 to seek further subsidies from local taxpayers or to shrink services the latter of course would hit hardest those who depend on public transit to get to work it would also leave the community without an alterantive to reliance on autos if the nation has to experience long drawnout gasoline crises managers of our local school lunch programs say they would accept reductions more in line with the average reagan cuts of about 7 percent but they object to reductions of over 40 percent allegheny county schools would lose about 6 6 million a year the administration says it only wants to halt subsidized lunches to people who can afford them but because of the way the aid is leveraged some fear the feeding programs will be wiped out entirely in many schools pittsburgh has long been a leader in urban revitalization with a big emphasis on selfhelp our urban redevelopment authority is continuing this tradition with udagurban development action grants local officials say udag programs are stimulating over 100 million in private investment in response to 23 million in federal aid with a spinoff of 2 460 new jobs and nearly 2 million a year in new local tax revenues before my committee on banking finance and urban affairs in response to concern over the future of udag david a stockman director of the office of management and budget said our plan is to continue the udag function but our question is how can we incorporate that function into a basic community development program and not have to maintain the existing program structure for 1981 we are proposing no change for 1982 we are proposing to make udagtype obligations through a new legislative proposal that we will be sending to your committee shortly this supposed clarification still leaves me puzzled about what is contemplated for udag constituents who suggest that the democrats are holding back on approval of the republican blueprint need to understand that many parts of that blueprint remain sketchy or nonexistent despite this the house democratic leadership is moving ahead on a very tight schedule to complete action on a new budget by midyear pennsylvania taxpayers have been getting back only 92 cents for every dollar its taxpayers send to washingtoncompared with 1 07 by taxpayers in the west and 1 12 by those in the south one of my tasks in reviewing the budget is to seek to correct this imbalance which amounts to subsidizing the drift of people jobs and industries from our area to the sunbelt it wastes energy and contributes to the instability of our great cities the barge operators inform me of another difficulty with the administrations proposals increased waterway user taxes and a program to recover the costs of the unitedstates coast guard are of particular interest to pittsburgh which handles more barge tonnage than any other inland port in the nation at a time of energy problems the fuel efficiency of barges should be encouraged not discouraged according to the american waterways operators a gallon of fuel can move a ton of freight 59 miles by truck 202 miles by rail but 514 miles by barge since coal and oil are major barge cargoes the energy implications are multiplied the question in my mind is not whether barge traffic should continue to pay for maintenance of the waterways it should but we need to make certain that this mode of transportation is being treated equitably with rail highway and air transportation i do not hesitate to give the president high marks on several counts he correctly targets inflation as a major problem he properly calls for reduced federal spending his initiatives create an atmosphere in which whole categories of federal activities that were previously off limits to economizers and reformers have been opened up for review it is in this spirit that i am seeking alternative methods of achieving the costcutting goals let me give two examples first it is not widely recognized that the treasury gives up more revenue each year 19 8 billionthrough income tax deductions for mortgage interest than it provides to poor people through all housing subsidies combined these deductions serve the useful purpose of stimulating homeownership however no limit is set on the amount a taxpayer may deduct for this purpose owners of mansions and vacation homes deduct all their mortgage interest payments out of all proportion to need i strongly favor consideration of a 5 000 ceiling on these deductions so the bulk of taxpayers do not have to pick up the tab for the wealthy a congressional budget office analysis indicates that the 5 000 ceiling would yield about 3 68 billion a year in additional federal revenue it would affect only 5 percent of all taxpayers and even they could deduct all but the excess over 5 000 if this modest reform were adopted half of the administrations proposed 1982 budget cuts could be restored in the following programs food stamps aid to families with dependent children ceta jobs elementary and secondary education basic education pell grants for college students legal services for the poor small business assistance housing and rehabilitation loans urban development action grants and support of the arts and humanities unlimited mortage interest deduction is but one example of a whole array of tax breaks or loopholes for the affluent that require serious attention before the needy should be deprived of basic help for food medicine shelter and jobs second everybody wants america to be strong with adequate wellequipped forces that can be deployed rapidly wherever they are needed and with a nuclear potential that is too powerful to challenge however i believe each addition to the defense budget should be treated with as much care as each cut from the nondefense budget as responsible a person as outgoing comptroller general elmer b staats pointed to several billion dollars a year in pentagon waste and mismanagement in a 23page letter to secretary of defense caspar w weinberger staats itemized such costreduction opportunities as consolidating adjacent military bases joint supply purchases improved management of weapons systems and multiyear contracting that would save an absolute minimum of 4 billion a year by 1985 opinion polls indicate considerable support for the presidents budget goals most of the mail which i receive in my office is written by individuals in general support of the presidents goals i should point out however that a good number of the letters contain a similarity in phraseology that may be more than coincidental be that as it is some of these individuals indicate in their letters that if i did not support the president i would be regarded as an obstructionist further i was also reminded in no uncertain terms that these individuals would remember me in a not too favorable light at the next election james wilson makes a point that each of the great powers executive legislative and judicial should be independent as well as distinct lectures on law the works of james wilson the division of the powers of the national government was established for a purpose and that was to avoid a concentration of power in any one branch i think the citizens of this country would be illserved if this body were to adopt the course of action recommended by some and that is simply to trust the president and approve his program without the needed scrutiny edmund burke in his speech to the electors of bristol stated that your representative owes you not his industry only but his judgment and he betrays instead of serving you if he sacrifices it to your opinion the course of action advoctated by this administration deserves very careful examination because we are not simply considering a request for a reduction in federal expenditures we are considering a reordering of priorities the effect of which if adopted will be felt by many low and moderateincome individuals the programs which we are considering reducing are ones which meet the needs of those most in need of assistance we should examine these proposals very closely the economist in its latest issue states thatalthough the reagan budget attacks nearly 300 programmes including some dear to the hearts of even mr reagans supporters its main effect will be felt negatively on the poor and positively on the defense industry social justice should not be sacrificed on the altar of an untested economic theory and that it seems to me is what we are about to do if we adopt without careful examination this administrations still unclear proposals i am not advocating delay for the sake of delay that would be obstructionism i am advocating however delay for the sake of thoughtful reflection upon and detailed analysis of the recommendations that are before this body"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.8784123957157135, 0.1215876042842865, 1, "i rise in opposition to h r 4 the bill creates three new criminal

category section 601 c of the bill however well intentioned in its effort to prevent exposure of our covert agents tramples on protected first amendment freedoms for the first time in american history the publication of information obtained lawfully from publicly available sources would be made criminal i recognize and applaud the efforts made by the intelligence committee to narrow the scope of section 601 c to keep it within constitutional bounds nevertheless it is my firm belief which is supported by many noted constitutional experts that no amount of tinkering can rehabilitate a law which crimianalizes constitutionally protected freedoms of speech press and political expression moreover the bill allows no exception where disclosures are aimed at revealing illegal activity oversight of our intelligence activities traditionally exercised by all the american people the press and the congress will instead be relegated solely to the two already overburdened intelligence committees recent events concerning the disturbing activities of the top echelons of the cia d6monstrate that greater accountability is necessary rather than less the best solution is to concentrate our efforts to improve the cover provided the cia and any other covert agents operating on our behalf overseas not to create criminal penalties which stem the flow of information only to our o~wn public and do little to protect our agents from hostile powers overseas i urge you to vote against this bill and i ask unanimous consent to revise and extend my remarks i firmly believe officers employees and sources that operate covertly on behalf of american foreign intelligence must be protected from harm and exposure i share the alarm of my colleagues arising from callous and irresponsible disclosure of names of covert agents however i believe that the goal of maintaining secrecy and minimizing risk of harm can be achieved by less onerous means the portion of h r 4 which i question is section 601 c this section is aimed primarily at private citizens and the press who gain knowledge of agent identities from either public or classified sources in both instances first amendment interests are compromised the intelligence committee attempted to alleviate the adverse impact on the first amendment by adopting language that narrows the intent requirement criminality hinges on a finding that the identification was made knowingly with an intent to impair or impede the foreign intelligence activities of the united states and in the course of an effort to identify and expose covert agents and by adding a requirement that the disclosure intend to impair or impede the foreign intelligence activities of the unitedstates by the fact of such identifileation and exposure while i applaud the committees efforts i remain convinced that no amount of tinkering can render this section constitutional as long as it seeks to criminalize publi cation of information already in the public domain these judgments all are highly subjective thereby leaving the door open for less cautious officials to level this provision at a broad class of individuals many acting within the constitution the requisite intent can be inferred whenever the publication exposes and thereby diminishes the effectiveness of an intelligence agent or activity further the intent requirement itself may have the effect of chilling legitimate critique and debate in addition it is clear that the name need not actually be revealed to constitute identifying information in some circumstances simply noting the agents title and location may be sufficient to reveal his identity thus the number of details that must be omitted and the consequent loss of credibility is also a vague expandable concept finally the concept of in the course of an effort offers no real protection as a society of professional journalists witness noted during the debate on this bill last year a journalist who is assigned to cover the intelligence community on a regular basis may indeed establish a pattern of reporting the names of agents or sources in the course of legitimate coverage of the cia furthermore even if the revelation was a single story or a single incident it is not clear that the act of investigating the story and preparing to publish it are insufficient to meet the governments concept of effort the department of justice repeatedly has emphasized that the effort need not consist of a pattern of disclosure but rather may be simply a pattern of acts with a purpose of disclosing i am not alone in this view distinguished constitutional scholars from around the country have also criticized section 601 c and its predecessors as being both unwise and unconstitutional consider this from stephen saltzberg of the university of virginia law school when it comes to punishing people who have figurcd out the identity of an agent on the basi1s of information available to the public i think there are enormous problems to overcome in fact they cannot be overcome when all is said and done i recognize that the intent element of section is it really permissible to prevent people from trying to get the government to change its ways by publicly disclosing what has been going on in order to criticize it i doubt it the line between an intention to impair the intelligence activities of the united states and an intention to seek a modification of the intelligence activities of the united states is one that is too fine for me to perceive of course the first amendment involves balancing of interests the need for the united states to protect its officers and agents is surely real and great but the first amendment is at its strongest when people are speaking out against the government criticizing what it and its agents are doing and i think the balance here will be in favor of speech section 601 c prohibits publication of identifying information even if the reporter or private individual derived the identity or identities wholly from public sources this includes disclosures based upon inferences drawn from the governments own nonclassifled documents it includes the publication of common knowledge as to who is a cia agent or source in a particular area it includes the revelation by an organizationt such as a missionary church newspaper or university based on its own internal lnve~tigation that some of its memberscontrary to the organizations policyhave acted as sources for the cia it includes republication of disclosures made by others the limit on how public this information must be before prosecution will is left to the discretion of political appointees moreover section 601 c criminalizes disclosures under a wide variety of circumstances try as the house intelligence committee did to limit the bill i still believe it will forbid both wanton and callous disclosures as well s those that serve a socially useful purpose it will create an unprecedented dilution of the notion of what constitutes freedom of speech and the press by eniminalizing the utterance of publicly available information without a showing that the national security is at stake indeed there is no requirement that any adverse impact be felt by reason of the disclosure in order to constitute a crime i am also concerned about the wide range of individuals covered by this legislation i believe this overinclusiveness adds to the constitutional problems of this bill a covert agent is defined to include not only intelligence officers or employees serving covertly outside the united states but also anyone who is a present or former agent of or a present or former informant or source of operational assistance to an intelligence agency informant is defined broadly as any individual who furnishes information to an intelligence agency in the course of a confidential relationship protecting the identity of such individual from public disclosure it is clear therefore that thousands of individuals fit this description and that the bill is primarily a source protection bill for the cia and the fbi regardless of the merits of their need for protection the breadth of the definition broadens the restraint of free speech furthermore it is not clear that protecting the identity of sources who may be in no greater peril than any other law enforcement informants weighs as heavily against the need for open discussion of american foreign affairs as does the protection of employee identities indeed the original position of the attorney general when this bills predecessor was under discussion last congress was solely to protect from harm the men and women who serve our nation as intelligence officers likewise the fbi director in seeking fbi coverage originally spoke only of employees this expanded purpose should alert us to the danger of future additions to the definition of disclosures that impair american intelligence activities congress could criminalize the disclosure of many other matters derived from public information such as the content of the covert activities themselves the methods used and so forth the fact that those activities may have been in clear violation of american law or policy would be no defense how will the line bedrawn when so much information relevant to public debate arguably could impair or impede intelligence activities or foreign relations or national defense for these reasons i believe this coverage is vastly overbroad and fundamentally at odds with a free society it is also unnecessary section 601 c simply misses the markit aims thearsenal of the criminal law at the entire populace but all the available evidence indicates that the true culprit is the combination of sloppy secrecy procedures and unauthorized disclosure of classified information in other words section 601 c of the intelligence committee bill attacks a phantom problemprivate citizens culling through public documents and sources it thereby diverts attention from the real heart of the problem which as the cia itself admitted is the disclosure of sensitive information based on privileged access by faithless government employees 0 this problem can be dealt with by punishing those employees and former employees who breach their trust by revealing identities or by providing assistance to others in identifying covert agents moreover if indeed it is possible to glean identities from public information or doeuments then it is the responsibility of the cia and the president to remove those indicators from the public domain and to improve the procedures for insuring effective cover criminalizing disclosures stemming from sloppy secrecy procedures on the other hand will only tend to lull the agency into inaction surely if private citizens have been able to infer identities from public sources so too has the kgb as the house permanent select committee on intelligence act 1coinplelled to note that provisions for the concealment of intelligence operative are not fully adequate the burden must be on the executive branch generally and the intelligence community in particular to remedy this situation accordingly the committee adopted a provision requiring the president to promulgate procedures that will help to rectify this situation i believe this course of action will be more productive and certainly less destructive of free speech inever before has a criminal sanction been attached to this kind of speech the cia insists that it is necessary but it is the responsibility of congress as well as the courts to determine whether such a measure is constitutional or whether a less onerous alternative will deal adequately with the problem in concluision i believe this bill is dangerous not only for what it forbids directly but also for the precedent it creates today we ban the disclosure of identities tomorrow there will be talk of banning disclosure of covert actions themselves why not the logic is the samethe preservation of effective foreign intelligence efforts if the american people are denied information they are denied the power that the constitution says resides with them preventing that is what the first amendment is all about ultimately it is the respect and protection we afford free speech that distinguishes this country from the

negotiation act of 1982 is designed to help remedy the problem of unfair trade practices by countries that trade with the united states it is a very simple piece of legislation this measure very clearly requires all unitedstates agricultural trading partners to extend to the united states the same trade concessions that we extend to them in our home market if equivalent trade concessions are not provided by our trading partners then this legislation directs the president within an 18month period to impose trade restrictions on that country until those trade restrictions are lifted against imports from the united states if the president determines that any unitedstates trading partner maintains quotas or employs licensing practices with respect to unitedstates agriculture imports or subsidizes exports from their country then that countrys agricultural products will not receive column one tariff treatment from the united states until the illegal trade barriers are removed this way a tariff penalty is attached to any country that fails to observe the established rules unitedstates customs law has a twocolumn tariff schedule column 1 is for the mostfavorednation mfn countries and includes most of the gatt parties and certain others column 2 is for the nonmfn nations primarily communist countries and has a higher rate of duty than column 1 this bill will broaden column 2 to include any country which imposes illegal trade barriers in the form of quotas restrictive licensing systems or export subsidies if a country objects to this penalty it can be removed upon a change in that countrys trade practices with this high price attached to illegal trade practices it is my belief that discipline can be restored to world trade while i have been a strong advocate of free trade for many years the united states can no longer afford to provide free access to our markets to nations which block similar treatment of unitedstates commodities in their countries april 5 1982 co although i am well aware of the fact that trade is critical to the united states i am very tired of seeing our unitedstates trading partners lag behind by not extending similar trade concessions to unitedstates agricultural products while i do intend for the united states to maintain our traditionally open markets for imports i do think the time is right for our government to be more forceful in demanding similar openness abroad my constituency is from the 15th district of the great state of cailfornia let me take a moment to point out how very important agriculture exports are to my native state of callfornia california leads the nation in the production of specialty crop type agriculture in fact in my congressional district alone over 220 commercial crops are producedo while california does have significant exports in cotton and wheat california also has citrus fruits peaches plums and a whole host of nuts and vegetables for example the state accounts for more than 90 percent of unitedstates exports of raisins dates prunes dried apricots table grapes almonds and walnuts though california is the nations leading producer of highquality specialty crops this preeminence is useless if our products are denied access to the worlds markets a situation which california is seeing increasingly it is for these reasons that i introduce this bill today i hope this legislation

off this balanced r d bill which addresses concerns that are expressed by both sides of the aisle the reagan administration for instance made very drastic cuts in the solar and in the conservation programs but this substitute adds much of that money back for example nearly 90 million is added to solar seventy million dollars is added to conservation the substitute also includes funding for the clinch river breeder reactor the administration requested 254 million but it has been reduced to 230 million which is adequate for continued development this package also includes funding for the geothermal demonstration at heber calif it includes funding for magnetohydrodynamics mhd which was zeroed by the administration this is a very brief summary of the winn substitute in the interest of time i would like to provide for the record a more detailed discussion in general i think this is a good substitute which not only complies with the reagan budget and the reagan economic package but it maintains the technical integrity of the most promising energy technologies i rise in support of the grammlatta substitute to this reconciliation bill i have supported and will continue to strongly support the presidents economic recovery program which includes this grammlatta substitute i am happy to be a coauthor of this substitute specifically the winn substitute for title xii in the reconciliation bill the winn substitute changes the doe authorization contained in title xii to bring the program more in line with the presidents request the winn substitute is actually below the budget requested by the reagan administration for the department of energy like the reagan request the winn substitute redirects the department of energy research and development programs into more longterm research and development activities these longterm activities will be specifically those that will not be undertaken by private industry and therefore are more appropriate as part of the government role in addition this winn substitute containts funding and continuation of the liquid metal fast breeder reactor demonstration plant the clinch river breeder reactor crbr i am deeply disturbed by the creative accounting which was done by our committee in this reconciliation process the baseline which was chosen resulted in the committee on science and technology appearing to have come 1 8 billion under their as signed levels when in fact the committee was almost 100 million over the budget levels recommended by the reagan administration for all of the agencies which the science committee authorizes these false savings make a mockery of our hard work in trying to bring this federal budget back into line second i oppose title xii in the budget reconciliation package because of the fact that the strategic petroleum reserve is authorized at 3 8 billion this level of authorization is directly contrary to the assumptions made when the first concurrent budget resolution was passed at that time the decision was made to finance the strategic petroleum reserve offbudget both mr dingell and mr broyhill have proposed alternative ways of funding the strategic petroleum reserve offbudget and that issue should be resolved during the discussion on title vi even without the strategic petroleum reserve we feel that the winn substitute is preferable to the doe authorizations contained in title xii the winn substitute shifts funding into the solar and conservation r d programs at doe also a second geothermal demonstration plant for that promising resource is provided therefore providing a more balanced energy research and development budget than originally recommended by the administration the major difference between the two versions is that the jones substitute will provide for the termination of the clinch river breeder reactor project the decision to terminate the clinch river breeder reactor was make in committee by an effective twovote margin by contrast in the past the house has always opposed amendments to terminate crbr by margins of over 80 votes each time the crbr is essential to maintaining our countrys nuclear generating option in the next century without it we are left to rely on other more speculative generating options to supply the energy needs of consumers and industry in the next century we would also be departing from the energy path that the rest of the industrialized world is following for their future i want to reiterate that the administration strongly supports the continuation of the clinch river breeder rector project during our committees consideration of this budget the director of omb mr david stockman sent a letter to me in which he strongly endorsed the continuation of the crbr in that letter he said the commitment to such a goal is reinforced by this administration the reagan administration favors the economical and safe development of nuclear energy and in particular this administration supports construction and operation of the clinch river breeder reactor this administration intends to reinvigorate the effort on this project by joining the long struggle by the congress to complete

to devise and schedule plans to strengthen any weaknesses h r 1526 would require the estab lishment of internal accounting and administrative controls at each executive agency in accordance with standards prescribed by the comptroller general these controls would provide assurances that all obligations and costs are in compliance with the law that all funds property and other assets are protected against waste and mismanagement and that all transactions are properly recorded standards would also be prescribed by the comptroller general to insure the prompt resolution of all audit

amendment that went through the ordinary process of congressional committee part of this bill was referred sequentially to the committee on government operations why because we have jurisdiction over procurement when it was referred sequentially it was referred to a subcommittee headed by the chairman congressman brooks and i serve on that subcommittee as the ranking minority member after we had hearingsthe general accounting office was heard 0mb deputy director ed harper was heard we heard representatives from the department of defense and after the hearings we had a markup we reported it it was reported from the subcommittee to the full committee the full committee met and we are a committee of this congress a respected committee of this congress we met and then as a result of our meeting full committee meeting attended by a quorum over a quorum we voted and reported out these amendments afi this is one of those amendments now this is an important amendment i am not just talking to the members about knocking out a provision of this bill that has been reported out of the armed services committee because i am antidefense i am not i have indicated that i support basically the provisions of this bill reported by the armed services committee but they got a little bit off base in some of these areas that relate to procurement my appeal now to the members of the armed services committee and to the members of the house is to take a hard look at this what we are doing if we permit the bill reported by the armed services committee to go through without this amendment what does this amendment do the amendment offered by the full government operations committee which mr brooks and i are supporting because he is the chairman and i am the ranking minority member of that committee is to strike section 901 section 901 would permit the department of defense to procure research by grants where contracts would be required under current law now what is wrong with that in 1978 the government operations committee reported and the congress enacted the federal grant and cooperative agreement act which established a governmentwide policy for the definition and use of contracts grants and cooperative agreements by all federal agencies under that act grants and cooperative agreements are to be used for assisting the private sector whereas procurement contracts are to be used where we acquire goods and services for the governments own use one of the purposes of the act is to minimize the potential for abuse in the use of grants the congress had found that grants were being used in lieu of contracts to avoid the laws and regulations governing the procurement with regard to the department of defense section 901 would undo all of the good that congress did in 1978 when it enacted the federal grant and cooperative agreement act it would permit the department of defense to evade procurement laws and regulations as they relate to contracts because now they can do that if this amendment is not adopted they could permit the defense department to procure research grants rather than by contract this would be clearly unwise it would violate that law that we passed in 1978 and which is on the books so i would urge the members to support that amendment but i am not here just urging on behalf of the committee on government operations we also had the testimony of mr harper the deputy director of 0mb and this apparently is the administration position this is what he said relative to title ix general provisions we do not concur with section 901 which would amend section 10 unitedstatesc 23581 to permit the defense department to use grants in lieu of contracts for research pro curements under public law 95224 grants and cooperative agreements are to be used for assisting the private se~ctor whereas p~rocurement contracts are to be used when we acquire goods and service 4 for the government~s own use one of the purpo~es of public law 95224 was to minimize the pcp tential for abuse in the use of grants the congress found that grants were being used in lieu of contracts to avoid the laws and regulations

took the well in this house to discuss what i believe is the most difficult and critical problem facing the united states the decline in productivity growth i said then that congress had to focus its efforts on putting the puzzle together and launching a comprehensive strategy to improve productivity although productivity was at that time already a buzzword on capitol hill little was being done about it and the outlook was not encouraging unfortunately i am afraid the same can be said today there has been so much talk on the subject of productivity that perhaps it is worth reminding ourselves why prompt action in this area is so important as i see it there are at least four reasons why improved productivity must be a top priority for the federal government first and foremost i believe productivity is the neglected longterm key to our fight against inflation it is obvious that when the costs of labor raw materials and physical plant increase those higher costs will be translated entirely into higher prices for goods and servicesunless productivity is improved the second point is closely related low productivity growth is contributing to the weakening of the dollar by reducing the competitive edge of american products and thereby undermining the balance of trade third steady productivity growth is important to expanding employment here the relationship is perhaps less obvious and may contradict the assumption among rmany people that productivity simply means fewer people doing the same amount of work but as we should learn from the current discussions of supplyside economics more costeffective production is the key to business expansion and thus to expanded employment finally these benefits add up to a social or political argument for a strong productivity policy as we have progressed through successive antiinflation policies in the last few years americans have been asked repeatedly to make sacrifices i believe the country is willing to make those sacrifices but only if there is a visible and realistic path toward improvement ahead to date there has not been a comprehensive and coherent policy for improving productivity can provide that crucial glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel when i addressed the house a year ago on this subject the economic report of the president for 1980 had just been released that report was rather fatalistic on the question of productivity since it is difficult to identify a single cause for a slowdown in productivity growth the report declared the immediate prospects for improvement in productivity are not good the attitude of mr carters council of economic advisors eventually improved the final economic report of president carter released in january abandons last years gloomy prognosis and asserts unequivocally that a program to stimulate productivity growth must be a keystone of economic policy intentions however have yet to be transformed into reality the sad fct is that there is no federal program to foster productivity improvement several federal activities scattered among various agencies and amounting to more than 2 billion do contribute to private sector productivity but the closest the federal government has come to establishing a productivity program which might coordinate these disparate activities and set clear productivity improvement goals is a deservedly obscure entity known as the national productivity council established by president carter under an executive order in october 1978 the record of that productivity council is a travesty upon its very name since 1978 the council has convened on exactly four occasions and has garnered a barely fulltime staff of two people with no funding last year i characterized the council as an interagency group which rarely meets and accomplishes little this year i am spared the embarrassment of repeating myself since the general accounting office in a thorough evaluation which has just been released has provided its own assessment the gao notes that the key responsibilities assigned by the president to the productivity council were first coordinating and supervising productivity activities throughout the federal government second identifying for the president and the congress key issues pertaining to productivity improvement and third serving as a focal point within the executive branch for productivity issues with special liaison to business labor and academic leaders on this subject the gao report concludes that the national productivity council has not effectively accomplished any of these functions in other words as a government and as a nation we have been wasting our timetime which we cannot afford to lose the councils inactivity has coincided with a 2year period of national productivity declineonly the secondand now the longestsuch period since world war ii the councils poor performance would be less discouraging if it were an isolated event unfortunately it is the fifth unsuccessful productivity group to be formed at the federal level in the past decade against that background of past failure i welcome president reagans determination to make a fresh start i am particularly pleased that the president has given productivity a high priority in his recent statements and i look forward to working with him toward that end i am today reintroducing legislation which i first offered a year ago which would create a statutory visible fully funded and fully staffed national productivity council this proposed council is fashioned upon recommendations of the general accounting office and i believe it can succeed where its forerunners have failed this council would be assigned specific and important responsibilities which the gao has concluded on the basis of its past experience will be essential to a successful federal productivity effort these responsibilities will include first the formulation and annual revision of a national productivity improvement plan second analysis of those federal activities which hinder or encourage improved productivity in the private sector third legislative and regulatory recommendatiods to the congress for enhanced productivity fourth consultation with representatives of business labor and academic institutions on the subject of productivity improvement and fifth coordination of various federal activities related to productivity why do we need this council above all because when we have 2 billion worth of independently evolved programs affecting productivity we need to have some coordination of them we need to analyze the effectiveness of our total effort to assess where the gaps are in that effort and to discover what more could be done for example in its recent report the gao found that current federal expenditures in the area of productivity were not evenly distributed among activities related to productivity less than 2 percent is spent for improving human resources through programs for skill training hiproved labor mobility job security and labormanagement cooperation the report found i believe that an active forceful and respected national productivity council could help to redress such imbalances by calling them to our attention and by suggesting corrective measures the council could similarly restore a balanced perspective to the current obsession with business investment as the total cure for lagging productivity certainly increased capital formation is an important component of any effort to improve productivity but investment alone is not the answera fact which we are in danger of forgettiog today we are poised on the brink of accepting a multibilliondollar tax cut for accelerated business depreciation which has been promoted as a panacea for declining productivity growth yet as even business weeks analyses have shown the capital cost recovery act has a highly differentiated effect on various industrial sectorssome benefit greatly others benefit very little as we well know there is already a considerable range of productivity growth rates within the private sector the proposed tax benefits of the 1053 legislation do not always correspond to the sectors in need as pat choate and gail schwartz point out in a recent book on sectoral revitalization we need to know whether acrosstheboard tax incentives would encourage the flow of capital into those vital industries that need it the most in order to modernize and ultimately become more productive the historical precedents would suggest the opposite faced with such crucial policy dilemmas i am convinced the existence of a professional national productivity council could be extremely helpful we need a neutral third party whose sole concern is the federal impact on productivity and to whom we can turn for reliable advice in short we need an unrelenting spokesman who will keep the issue of productivity uppermost in our minds and make us aware of how federal policies affect it there is of course considerable hostility today toward any proposal to create a new government organization not surprisingly some of that antagonism was directed last year toward my proposal for a new productivity council let me assure those critics that i share their skepticism and their concern about government bureaucracy moreover i fully acknowledge that the crucial decisions affecting productivity growth will be made in the private sector nevertheless we must face the fact that we live in a mixed economy and that a federal government which spends more than 22 percent of gross national product and whose taxing and regulatory policies broadly affect the private economy ought to have some agency within it that attends to the nations no 1 economic problem governments of other industrialized nations such as japan and west germany are much more involved with labor and business in developing a consensus policy for maintaining high productivity growth we would do well to take our cue from their success my proposal for a statutory productivity council would not add to the burden of government but rather would respond to a serious weakness in governmental performance as the recent gao report noted all key economic decisionmakers in recent years have recognized the importance of productivity growth to our economic strength yet when economic policies are made productivity concerns seem to be given low priority the new productivity council would not be an economic deci sionmaker but would participate in economic and budgetary decisionmaking to ensure the presence of a productivity perspective naturally some members will not be persuaded that spending 5 million on a productivity council to oversee 2 billion in current productivity programs is a worthwhile investment to these colleagues let me offer a more compelling costbenefit analysis as a 1978 report of the council on wage and price stability observed the effect of slow productivity growth since 1967 has been to reduce total real incomes by some 20 percentmore than 300 billionfrom what they would have been if the pre1967 productivity growth rate had been sustained clearly we cannot afford not to invest in a more productive future last summer the retiring chairman of the house subcommittee on economic stabilization scheduled 4 days of hearingswhich i chairedon the problem of lagging productivity growth and what the federal government should do about it in my opinion those hearings were very useful in sharpening our understanding of this issue in particular they reinforced my conviction that something like a statutory productivity council is needed in the executive branch i would like to take a few moments to share with my colleagues some highlights from those hearings which in my view strengthen the case for the legislation which i am reintroducing today during the initial hearing testimony was given by an associate director of the office of management and budget omb on behalf of the current productivity council ombs presentation revealed a startling devaluation of the productivity problem high inflation and energy problems which dominated the 1970s omb testified must be solved before the productivity growth rate can be restored to its previous level when during quistioning of the witnesses i suggested that this statement reflected a disturbingly passive approach to the productivity issue 0mb simply reaffirmed its view that productivity growth will result when the economic policiesof the administrationtake hold this determination to put the cart before the horse says a good deal about why the existing productivity council has been such an abysmal failure most experts in this field i think would agree that lagging productivity growth is a major component of inflation rather than the other way around no productivity council worthy of the name can succeed when it is a captive of ombs perspective on this point one of our subsequent witnesses economist lester thurow from the massachusetts institute of technology saw the issue much more clearly productivity is obviously the countrys number one problem when productivity is going downhill it doesnt make any difference what is happening to inflation or enemployment you are going to have an economy thats going downhill although the public opinion polls havent put productiv ity in the number one slot 1 think the congress ought to put it in the number one slot at one point in the discussion i asked mr thurow whether he thought the united states would benefit from some kind of independent group that might be perceived as a little less partisanthan the congresssuch as a national economic commission or a national productivity council professor thurow largely concurred i certainly think there is a lot of value in information especially in the productivity area productivity is one of those kind of background things whiph doesnt make the headlines well we are not going to address the productivity problem until the american people in fact decide that it is an important problem that they have to address one of the traditional barriers to productivity efforts on a national level has been the opposition from many sectors of the labor movement which feared from past experiences that productivity was just another name for speedup or reduced labor force thus some of the most instructive and encouraging testimony received by our subcommittee came from mr donald ephlin a vice president of the united auto workers in his opening statement mr ephlin underscored his own unions willingness to tackle a tough issue we recognize that the only reliable basis for improving the purchasing power and access to leisure of american workers is the increase in the economys capacity to convert a given amount and intensity of work into ever more output in keeping with that recognition the uaw has explicity pledged not to oppose the introduction of productivityenhancing laborsaving technological advances on the specific subject of my legislation to create a statutory productivity council mr ephlin observed that the uaw is in strong support of objectives mr ephlin went on to make a crucial point with respect to a productivity councils potential effectiveness the national productivity improvement plan that the council is directed to develop will not be regarded as authoritative and viable unless it incorporates the agenda of labor and business by including them in the proposed council a tripartite committee would be created the parties would have the opportunity and the responsibility to find a common ground between often conflicting sets of goals as a public official who has been involved in the labormanagement cooperation movement for many years i have seen what it can achieve in the area of productivity and i wholeheartedly agree with mr ephlins tripartite proposal the legislation i am introducing today does create an advisory board to the productivity council whose members are to be selected entirely from individuals with experience in business labor and academics the bill does not take the further step of placing such individuals on the council itself but i am quite open to that possibility and will be exploring that alternative structure in the weeks ahead appearing on the same panel with mr ephin dr richard rahn vice president of the unitedstates chamber of commerce endorsed the same notion of tripartite communication among business labor and government but added i dont think there is a need for a formal government intervention in this process fortunately not all of the probusiness community seems to feel the same hesitation for example the american enterprise institutes committee to fight inflation chaired by former federal reserve board chairman arthur burns recently issued a ninepoint antiinflation plan i was pleased to note that in one of those points the committee urged congress and the president to actively encourage labormanagement councils in individual shops offices and stores throughout the country so that workers and managers will jointly seek ways of improving productivity perhaps the most persuasive testimony from any witness last summer was the presentation from the american productivity center this private nonprofit organization based in houston tex has done pioneering work with numerous businesses to improve productivity the organization is chaired by c jackson grayson former head of southern methodist universitys business school and was represented at last summers hearings by one of its directors mr william usery former secretary of labor mr usery had this to say on the productivity council legislation which i am sponsoring although i and the american productivity center believe that h r 6462 may not go far enough in its particulars we believe it is a most important step toward a firm commitment by our government to improve productivity efforts within the private sector have proved successful but are limited by the relative absence of government commitment to implementing solutions one might expect a private organization like the american productivity center to dismiss a government productivity group as intrusive and unnecessary on the contrary however mr usery explained in some detail the benefits which the center anticipates would result from a federally formulated productivity improvement plan the federal government would be helping to bring together elements of the business labor and government communities such a friendly meeting of the minds would be beneficial to america and certainly beneficial to productivity the concept of a national productivity policy has many advantages over other economic measures we have already tried other measures such as cutbacks controls regulation spending subsidies protectionism the result has been in most cases a failure a successful productivity program promises to avoid the problems inherent in these other actions no one expects that a national pro ductivity council by itself will reverse the deceleration in americas productivity growth productivity is an enormously complex issueone which must be addressed simultaneously on several fronts certainly the diverse testimony we heard last summer confirmed that point but paradoxically a productivity council might help us make some progress by reminding us of that very complexityby insuring that congress does not attempt to solve our productivity problems by seizing upon on simplistic cure in my statement on productivity a year ago i outlined four general areas each encompassing several policy issues where i thought our efforts could be profitably focused first improving the use of human resources second enhancing capital formation third expanding the commercialization of advances in knowledge innovation and fourth reforming the regulatory process i can only look back over those remarks today with acute frustration if a national productivity council were monitoring congressional progress in these areas we would not receive high marks for achievement during the past year in the absence of that kind of thirdparty neutral assessment let me take my remaining time this afternoon to list some of the legislative objectives which remain unfulfilled i will not take time as i did last year to discuss these measurses relevance to productivity but i do believe each item forms a part of the puzzle"], [0.8336536884307861, 0.8336536884307861, 0, "today i join with many of my fellow colleagues

in world war ii i feel it is only fitting and proper to honor this man who sacrificed so much for so many in 1944 wallenberg a swedish diplomat was sent to budapest as a result of requests from the american war refugee board and a representative of the world jewish council his mission was to assist jews to escape from the wholesale slaughter being conducted by adolph hitler his mission and the activities he carried out were both daring and successful the swedish raoul wallenberg association has attributed wallenbergs work to directly saving 20 000 hungarian jews in addition he assisted with the collaboration of others in aiding approximately 100 000 jews to escape unfortunately mr wallenberg would never see the success of his work he would never see the children he helped escape grow to adulthood and he would never receive the thanks of a grateful world unfortunately the yoke of oppression that mr wallenberg helped to lift frcm the hungarian people was only fated to be replaced by another form of oppression mr wallenbergs biography reads like a greek tragedy it is a mixture of triumph and tragedy when soviet forces eventually ended the nazi occupation of hungary in january 1944 one of the first actions they took was to arrest wallenberg for suspicion of spying the charges were unfounded and the act unpardonable instead of being hailed as a hero wallenberg was carted off as a common criminal today a mystery surrounds the fate of raoul wallenberg since his incarceration by the soviets 36 years ago after repeated inquires as to his fate the soviets issued a statement claiming mr wallenberg died of a heart attack in 1974 however former prisoners in the soviet gulag system have claimed to have seen a man resembling mr wallenberg during their confinement in 1975 a russian jew jan kaplan met a swede in the butyrka prison who had been imprisoned for 30 years but still seemed healthy if this man is raoul wallenberg then the soviets are once again heinously guilty of repression and the denial of human rights why will the soviets not reveal the real truth about raoul wallenberg how much longer must we accept the lies and falsehoods offered to us by them hopefully the actions we are taking today as representatives of the people of the united states will help clear up the mystery of raoul wallenberg if he is alive after all these years of unnecessary penal servitude then grant him his freedom so that he can live out the remainder of his years with dignity if he is dead then perhaps the knowledge of his fate will permit his soul to rest in peace

this let us go back to what the law was since the early 1950s the statute says that members of congress can deduct 3 000 for business expenses that is for regular bustness expenses but members could still take a deduction for interest and local taxes on their home as any other taxpayer in the united states could and these with large mortgages had 20 000 deductible when they included the 3 000 interest and local taxes people who do business in washington and state legislators usually receive a per diem and then deduct their necessary and reasonable expenses members of congress do not receive any per diemonly deductions members of congress were not treated the same as other taxpayers last december or whenever it was we instructed the internal revenue in a revenue measure dealing with revenues to support the black lung fund and that was a revenue measure the other body added an amendment instructing internal revenue to treat us like every other taxpayer and adopt regulations to that effect however the regulations they adopted were not exactly consistent with those for every other taxpayer and those regulations should be changed so that they are it was not the law that was faulty it was the regulations that were promulgated that were faulty contrary to what some people have said the irs does have arbitrary deduction levels for any member or an business person in different cities in des moines iowa it is 56 a day in washington d c it is 75 a day they set an arbitrary amount and they say that if a taxpayer claims no more than that amount and qualify for business purposes then you can take that amount instead of justifying it penny for penny it is usually an amount that is low enough they know the taxpayer could justify at least that amount or more so that part of the regulation is no different what is different is that they permitted members of congress to take taxes and interest on a home in addition to a standard 50 deduction for other expenses and that is the part that is different and it should be chahged when i came to congress my wife and i had been practicing law we gave up a lucrative law practice i am not complaining about that but i consider this to be a husband and wife job and it is so we both gave up the law practice to handle this job but i see some members talking on this issue who have a double income family and do not even maintain a home in their home state and some are taking honorariums in additionfor some reason they seem to be defensive and think they should divert attention from their own situation by cannibalizing other members and misrepresenting the situation i think honorariums are usually provided to influence a member i think they are wrong and should be prohibited and i do not accept them

receive well sure exxon and general motors would be glad to furnish a company lawyer to fill every seat in this place they have been cooperating i think for years anyway they would be glad to divide it up they would furnish company lawyers who would serve without pay but that kind of legislators would not well serve the american people those legislators would cost the american people a lot more in other ways it is time for members to quit cannibalizing on other members and to tell the truth the truth of the matter is that the members of congress ought to be treated precisely as every other taxpayer is no more and no less now you can say that there might be a better way than the amendment of the gentleman from indiana but that is one way to do it you are not going to get there by voting against the previous question because if you do that what you are saying is that you want every member to get a 3 000 deduction plus interest and taxes whether they can justify it or not and that is not right some members should not have that members should be treated like every other taxpayer so if you want to treat the members of congress like every other taxpayer you should vote for the

appropriate remedies this bill does a lot of that it allows the fdic the fslic and the ncua unprecedented latitude to help troubled financial institutions especially savings and loans and mutual savings banks all this is desirable and necessary it allows regulators to step in when an institution is on the verge of failing and taking actions to protect the institution its depositors its shareholders and government interests instead of leaving well enough alone this bill goes further and becomes fatally flawed it undermines the very foundation of our basic financial system by specifically authorizing interstate and interindustry acquisitions this runs directly counter to primary protection of the financial system afforded by the mcfadden act and the bank holding company act these protections are necesary to protect small and medium sized financial institutions of our decentralized system from predatory practices by giant institutions and giant nonbanking corporations

republicans and democrats in fact nearly all subcommittee chairmen argued and voted against them it is not regional except that most of the beneficiaries large financial institutions are located in a
