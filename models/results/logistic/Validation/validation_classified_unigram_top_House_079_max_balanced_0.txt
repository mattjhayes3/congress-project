engaged in agriculture into the armed services in direct violation of the tydings amendment to the selectiveservice law it is high time that notice be served on the president general hershey and all other government agencies that the laws passed by congress are to be obeyed by them as well as by all other citizens that notwithstanding the new deal theory that we should have government by man and be ruled and governed by directives and bureaucratic orders we still have a government by law that the executive branch should administer the laws passed by congress and not attempt to make law by executive directives or bureau orders or to nullify the law the law reads as follows every registrant found by the selective board subject to appeal in accordance with section 10l a 2 to be necessary to and regularly engaged in an agricultural occupation or endeavor essential to the war effort shall be deferred from training and service in the land and naval forces so long as he remains so engaged and until such time as a satisfactory replacement can be obtained you will note this law provides that the selective service board has the responsibility of determining those registrants who are necessary to and regularly engaged in an agricultural occupation or endeavor essential to the war effort now let us see what has been done recently general hershey issued a directive to local boards which said the director of war mobilization and reconversion had written him a letter stating in part thatthe president has found that the further deferment of all men now deferred in the 18 through 25 age group because of agricultural occupation is not essential to the best interest of our war effort the letter then says the president had authorized him to ask general hershey to take action in connection with the administration of the tydings amendment that would in effect nullify that law the law does not give the president any authority to make findings or to do anything in connection with agricultural deferments his action is an unauthorized assumption of power which he does not have in accordance with general hersheys directive the local boards began changing the classification of deferred farm workers from iic to ia and began inducting them into the armed forces probably the local boards should not be blamed for this as they are only following what they consider as an order issued to them although as a matter of fact the local boards should and they would be wholly justified in refusing to follow this directive or any other one that directs them not to follow the law in indiana the state selectiveservice director sent a letter to all local boards from which i quote the following it is our opinion based upon all facts available to this headquarters that further deferment of farmers under 26 years of age must henceforth be restricted in most cases to those registrants who are sole ownersoperators who are fully equipped and fully engaged in extensive farm operations plus those few cases which involve situations of extreme hardship there is not authority in law for an instruction to defer only sole ownersoperators who are fully equipped and fully engaged in extensive farm operations plus those few cases which involve situations of extreme hardship another assumption of power which does not exist from the above it is plain that the president the socalled assistant president general hershey and the state director of selective service in effect ordered the local boards to disregard the law and to disregard their own rulings as to deferments of those engaged in agriculture let me mention only a few of the many cases called to my attention one is that of a farm owner who has 1 son serving in the army and who is farming 500 acres which is stocked with 15 milk cows 21 brood sows 150 hogs 30 feeding cattle and who has 3 tractors and full equipment which was operated by the owner and 1 son who had been deferred under the tydings amendment now this son has been placed in ia and inducted on january 31 the father advises that he cannot get help and that he must materially curtail his farm operations which means less acreage in crops and less production of livestock in another case i was sent an ad vertisement of a public sale reading as i am being inducted into the armed services i will sell at public auctionhe listed for auction a complete outfit of farm implements and machinery 32 head of hereford cows 5 jersey cows 1 000 bushels of corn all his chickens 100 bales of clover hay and all other grain and household goods and numerous tools another farm out of production here is another a man 23 years old living with his mother on a 360acre farm which he was farming this farm has 200 acres in cultivation and in production and the rest in pasture barn lots and so forth it has 8 barns all filled with grain hay and livestock there are 55 head of beef cattle 6 dairy cows 20 brood sows ready to farrow this spring and 40 head of feeding hogs the farm is equipped with mechanized equipment all tools tractordriven has its own hammer mill combine and pickup baler and a 6ton truck to haul produce to the market he has more than enough units to defer 2 men still he has been placed in ia and ordered inducted another farm out of production why in one town of 500 the people face the complete loss of their milk supply by the induction of the last remaining son of the only dairyman left supplying the town another farmer who has 1 son in the service who operated his farm with the help of another son and who has 700 beef cattle 1 500 feedlot lambs and 150 hogs as well as 50 bred ewes and 30 bred sows will be forced to liquidate all the breeding stock along with twothirds of the feedlot stock because his son has been placed in ia and inducted another man farming 600 ztcres will be forced to liquidate his 200 young feedlot cattle and cut his farm operations in half or more because his son who is 18 has been placed in ia and inducted another farmer who has been producing 600 hogs per year has to liquidate his stock and be content to raise what crops he can tend because his son has been placed in ia and inducted another farmer writes me as follows i am writing you this letter to let you know some things that are happening here i want the public to know part of what is going on right here at home my son was classified in iic by the selective service board until the 10th of january when he got a ia card he was called before the board and was told that the board got a new ruling that all between 18 and 26 would have to go into the service in 1944 my son and i farmed over 300 acres we produced 54 870 pounds of pork 26 435 pounds of beef 2 915 pounds of lamb 40 855 pounds of milk 2 194 dozen eggs 1 890 pounds of poultry we had 92 acres in beans 76 acres in corn 47 acres in hay and 10 acres in wheat with my son gone into the army and as it is impossible to get farm labor you can readily see that i will be forced to greatly reduce production another farmer writes me now i farm 300 and more acres my rent for the coming year is already paid and i am not financially able to lose that i have over 60 head of cattle and put out from 80 to 90 gallons of milk daily i raise the feed for this stock we pasteurize and distribute the milk my nephew has been working for me for several years his classification has been changed from iic to ia i do not see how it will be possible for me to continue on i wish to be patriotic but i do not think the farmers are getting a square deal in this particular setup it is really alarming the number of farmers who have already given up or are planning to do so another farmer n rites me again and again and again have we farmers been called upon to produce more and more and more with less and less and less and the enclosed bill of sale is a partof my forced answer to this appeal for more food two years ago three of us gave our entire time to production then my hired man left and then last year my son and i carried on and produced 49 tons of pork 15 tons of beef besides eggs milk honey wheat etc my son was in class hc but has now been placed in ia and inducted and i am left to do all the work on a 390acre stock and grain farm it moves me to think of a quotation from the psalms that i heard an old man give in 1914 at the beginning of world war no 1 it was this how long 0 lord how long will it forever be i might mention one other case that of a sole operator of a 20cow dairy farm who has called on his local draft board to come and sell out his herd and farm because he was reclassified into ia and ordered inducted many other similar cases could be cited in each of these cases the local boards had in conformity with the law placed these farm operators and workers in class iic but since the issuance of the abovementioned directive and orders they have been reclassified into ia and inducted into the armed forces i think congress should make it plain to the executive branch of the government that the laws passed by congress are to be obeyed and are to be administered so as to give them full effect if the administration thinks laws passed by congress are wrong or that they should be changed the right thing to do is to ask congress to change the law but not to deliberately nullify them by administrative action members of congress are the peoples representatives and upon congress has devolved the responsibility to protect the people from the present administrations efforts to completely regiment them we are repeatedly told that food will win the war our farmers have patriotically worked long hours without being able to get needed equipment and machinery while great quantities were sent to other nations and with a shortage of farm labor still these loyal citizens have produced great amounts of food grain vegetables and livestock they are entitled to more consideration than they are getting they are mindful however of the administrations boast of a planned economy and they also remember about the planned scarcity which was supposed to bring prosperity they remember the killing of the pigs and the plowing under of the crops and many are asking why money is appropriated to encourage the production of crops some of which have production subsidies while at the same time another government agency is paying an export subsidy on the same crops and at the same time the government acting through the selective service is so depleting the farms of workers that it is greatly curtailing food production now the war food administration announces that it is trying to curb the current decline in butter production by revising the governments milk and butterfat subsidy program however we have one arm of the government putting farmers out of the milk and butterproduction business thus creating additional shortages while another agency attempts to increase the production through subsidy manipulations if the government will let our farmers have sufficient labor and give them a chance they will produce enough milk and butter oh we hear much about manpower shortages in industry but really there is no manpower shortage what we actually have is manpower wastage poor use of available manpower and the government itself including the army and the navy is the worst offender we need a wise sensible use of manpower we are told that we have 100 000 000 000 worth of surplus war materials which simply means that our government has expended 100 000 000 000 of the taxpayers and bond buyers money for labor and material which we do not need this is a waste of manpower as well as of money and material we know there is always waste in war but need we have this much waste we are told that the war has cost us up to date a total of 230 000 000 000 this includes the pay of those in the armed services and all lendlease aid it certainly seems that out of this amount of total cost that 100 000 000 000 wasted is very much too much and shows an alarming state of inefficiency many instances have been cited where the government has sold and is selling as surplus property large quantities of material while at the very same time the army and navy are buying large quantities of the very same items from manufacturers a further waste of manpower money and material the navy is asking for more employees for a navy yard while admitting that the workmen at this yard have been making chessboards and checkerboards oystershucking tables napkin rings and fine furniture for the officers why it has even been shown that the government has sold many items at a very cheap price and then purchased the same items back from the purchasers at a greatly increased price the government paid 1 500 each for searchlights declared them surplus and sold them at auction for 155 each paid the auctioneers fees cost of advertising and so forth and then bought them back for 235 each it sold plumbing strainers as surplus property for 3 25 each and then bought them back for 12 each enormous quantities of socalled surplus material are being offered for sale while at the same time the government is buying enormous quantities of the same items at full price all this shows a waste of manpower money and materials a miserable record has been made ir procurement and as the facts become known it will be evident that the waste and purchasing scandals of the first world war are mild in comparison the congress should act at once to see to it that the tydings amendment is obeyed by the selective service and to stop the needless and useless waste of manpower money and material the people are expecting and are entitled to immediate action and while i realize the administration will oppose this and bring its full power against it that is no reason why action should be delayed congress has the responsibility and if congress either cannot or will not act then our form of constitutional government is surely in serious difficulty in this hour of national emergency i plead with those of the majority party to lay aside partisan advantages and considerations and look only to the best interests of our country and to join us in our efforts to stop waste and inefficiency and preserve constitutional government"], [0.00890570878982544, 0.9910942912101746, 1,

attack made by the official russian government newspaper upon the catholic church pope pius xii and cardinaldesignate francis j spellman of new york the chief complaint was that the catholic church and its two venerable sons whom i have mentioned were fascists having read this attack against the oldest and most sacred institution in the world and against two of its most illustrious sons i would be derelict as an american a catholic and as a human being if i did not answer this titanic falsehood when russia was but a great forest and morass the teachings of jesus christ had crystallized through his sanctity and supernatural being into the catholic church this great institution was teaching for the first time to all of the then known world and to its masters the dignity of man his possession of a soul the sanctity of his family and the recognition of the necessity for the respect of constituted authority it has provided the basis for a civilization that could and would guarantee the fundamental rights of man which we in america so deeply love and which we wish to be the property of all men of all faiths colors creeds and nations liberty justice equality and the right to worship god untrammeled and unrestrained the very rights that our declaration of independence and the constitution guarantee and also the very rights that those who now malign the church do not recognize even in this late day pius xii is not only one of the greatest of pontiffs the world has ever known but he is also one of the greatest men alive today he has been recognized and termed the prince of peace a title that flows naturally from his deep and great love for all of gods children before the great conflict that the world has not yet emerged from he labored everlastingly to spare the earth from the holocaust of blood that is still searing millions of people during the soulcrushing days of the conflict he was the shepherd of all the oppressed religious affiliations colors or country meant nothing to christs vicar on earth oppression and those who suffered from its scourge were his first concern and he provided haven refuge and safety in the vatican to jew christian atheist and agnostic before the war started he was recognized throughout the world as the greatest exponent of social justice and many of president roosevelts social principles were reiterations of parts of the encyclical of the present pope to call pope pius xii who has ever recognizedmans stateliness a fascist especially when he is called this by his present detractors is the height of absurdity for the accusers are the very ones who formed the alliance with the fascist mussolini only a few years ago and who pledged their wealth their honor and their men to assist and defend fascism and perpetuate its pernicious doctrines so that the italian people might continue to be enslaved even while this foul alliance was being made pius xii was fighting the stench and endeavoring to save the soul of the italian nation from pollution every member of this house knows that long before the war started as early as march of 1937 i was fighting the nazi and fascist on this floor in that very year i introduced a resolution to suspend relations with germany until that nation recognized the right of religious freedom i introduced a bill to forbid the sale of helium gas to hitler i worked and voted for lendlease and for every appropriation that would strengthen our allies including russia i have begged many of russias detractors to have patience in their lack of understanding of her diplomatic moves now i find myself losing patience and faith with the seeming unwillingness of that nation to cooperate for that which americans have fought and died we want a perpetual peace that recognizes man as a free creature of god and not a vassal of an allpowerful state we want a guaranty to all of mankind of freedom of expression and not to limit him to a mere parroting of a despotic government no man in our country is so beloved as the splendid archbishop of new york francis j spellman he is not only the first citizen of new york city he is also one of the most beloved of all americans we of new york regardless of our faith have been deeply impressed with his sanctity humanity humility and kindliness we have learned to love him as the foe of racial and religious intolerance he has enshrined himself in the hearts of his countrymen by his intense love of country and his sincere desire to serve it regardless of personal sacrifice he has won the undying gratitude not only of millions of our servicemen but of their fathers and mothers for the spiritual and human comfort that he gave to our soldiers by his presence on almost every battlefield of this war his life has been a guide lamp to the road of true americanism his faith is a joint one consisting of two isms catholicism and americanismboth pure and unadulterated neither tinted nor tainted by fascism or communism our archbishop has taken his place in the history of our country side by side with other great catholic americans including alfred e smith cardinal gibbons and bishop ireland we know that his life has been consecrated and spent in the service of his god and his country we appreciate as a nation his unselfishness and we feel that the bestowing of high papal honors upon him is a tribute to our country if the rulers of european governments had the humanity of pius xii and archbishop spellman not only would there be peace but mankind would blossom in all of gods intended glory we

insisted any amendments would cripple the opa the provisions of this amendment are the very things that i and other members on this side of the aisle have been trying to accomplish for the past several months it may be that what we needed was a little more pressure than we have had of course it was wrong for the opa to close down the small packing plants of this country and thereby further the meat shortage we have known that for a long time i have always insisted that the small packing plants be kept open and be permitted to run in regular order mr bowles administrator of the opa in reply to my protest on that very problem gave me to understand that to permit the smaller packing plants to remain open and to carry on at regular capacity would not be for the best interests of the people ofthis country this amendment will go far in relieving the situation but this is not enough we must go still further and provide a price on finished cattle that will encourage the livestock men of this country to feed and finish beef cattle and not let them go to market without being fattened as they are doing now we are losing from 200 to 400 pounds on each of thousands of animals because the opa will not permit a sufficient price so that our livestock can be properly finished the opa has bungled this thing long enough only 2 years ago hog producers were penalized because they permitted their hogs to be grown and fattened beyond a certain limit of pounds hog producers became discouraged so today we have a dire shortage of pork let me say again with respect to the cattle industry that we have 10 000 000 more cattle than are ordinarily produced in this country and yet no meat on the family table we have millions of bushels of corn in storage that ought to be fed to these cattle and yet the opa and other agencies have discouraged that very thing so we have a near famine in this country we all understand that the demand for meat is greater than it has ever been and everyone wants the armed forces to have every bit of meat they need but even at that there is no excuse for having a meat shortage such as we have right now in my judgment most of our trouble is the result of poor management on the part of those who have been entrusted and empowered to handle this most important problem it ought to be noted right here that agencies are permitting several million bushels of corn to be used for making liquor that ought to have been fed to livestock if we permit our small packing concerns to go back into operation as they should and let our corn be fed to the livestock so we can produce more meat and then give the secretary of agriculture control over the production and distribution of meat we will go a long way in solving the problem it just does not make sense that we have large numbers of crttle in this country and a supply of grain in our bins and elevators and yet a shortage of meat on the shelves and on the family tables and black markets growing bigger every day the people of this country are entitled to a fairer deal than they have received at the hands of our governmental agencies if the country could or would not produce there might be some excuse that is not the picture qt all our farmers and producers have done a magnificent job thoy have done it under handicaps of all kinds too many agencies many times working at cross purposes have mismanaged and bungled the situation the agencies have failed to take a practical and farsighted view of the problem we should put the management and distribution of food under one head who will seek advice from the producers and processors we should cut red tape and regulations as far as can be done and put emphasis on production of more and more food we should offer more

been extended to other corporations the treasurer of the united states crediting funds to the commodity credit corporation and to other corporations upon the purchase of their notes then the treasurer of the united states getting reimbursement through warrants approved by the secretary and countersigned by the comptroller general the same way he gets reimbursements for the publicdebt obligations that he redeems or purchases so it is an appropriation and i think the constitutional provision is fully complied with it is clear therefore that the only limitation at the present time as to the amount of payment of subsidies is the amount of borrowing authority given to the commodity credit corporation and the r f c and other corporations organized pursuant to the r f c act as amended it seems to me that the congress of the united states had better take some very definite action to determine this whole policy of subsidies it is apparent to anyone that the little savings we can effect here on the floor of congress are puny and infinitesimal compared with the losses that will ultimately arise as a result of this subsidy program for which there is no direct return to the treasury it seems to md that congress should retrieve its authority and power in this regard and courageously face the issue as it will be an important one in the postwar period i am not arguing for or against the theory of subsidies i realize full well that it is all involved in the stabilization program it does seem to me however that congress itself should determine after full hearings on the subject the type and character of subsidies that are to be paid the treasury of the united states must ultimately make good and the people who pay the taxes expect their representatives in the congress to exercise some control over the expenditure of public funds and not to leave the matter entirely to executive or administrative direction and control thus we have this picture before us we are organizing one corporation after another under state laws and vesting in those corporations great broad powers which i cannot believe were in the contemplation of the congress at the time some of the legislation heretofore referred to was passed the whole structure has become so involved and so complex that it is beyond the capacity of an individual member of congress to follow through and to thoroughly understand what is taking place it seems to me that it is almost silly to suggest that the general accounting office is auditing the books of the commodity credit corporation when we have thousands of triple a committeemen xci83 writing checks on the funds of the treasury the amount of which is determined by their own computations in the field if the commodity credit corporationa

the present costplus and other systems of contracting for public construction by a system of negotiated lumpsum contracts in essence this bill is the same as h r 4352 which i introduced during the second session of the seventyeighth congress except that it contains several minor clarifying amendments during the seventyeighth congress the committees of judiciary naval affairs and military affairs carried on exhaustive investigations of the high cost of war production and brought to bare not only the tremendous waste of manpower and material but also the exorbitant profits made by some contractors in the manufacture and construction of war materials and facilities as a member of the committee on ways and means i had an opportunity to get firsthand information on this subject matter when your committee considered the problem of the renegotiation of war contracts the abusive practices of some of the contractors and subcontractors were alarming neither h r 4352 nor the bill i have introduced today is likely to be found perfect however it is my personal hope that the committee on the judiciary to which the measure has been referred with its broad learning and experience will perfect and amend this legislation in such a manner as to make it applicable to all forms of contracts the bill in its present form is applicable to construction work but i am confident that it can be broadened to cover other fields of contract service there has been an erroneous impression in the minds of some people that uncle sam is a sucker that the federal government should be scalped at every turh that because of our governments great wealth it should be obliged to pay far more for the performance of services to it than should a private citizen or corporation because it lacks a check on excessive costs and waste of manpower and material the costplus contracts have been grossly unfair to our government let us examine some of the methods of contracting now employed by the various government awarding authorities generally speaking these methods may be classified as first the competitive bid system second the several different forms of costplus systems both have been thoroughly discredited the longestablished method of buying goods and services by the federal government tonsists of advertising for bids to be received and opened at a specified time and then awarding the contract to the lowest responsible bidder the responsibility of a contractor according to the practice is established by the filing of a performance bond with the bid and or a certified check the federal government i am informed requires a performance bond from a surety company the bond becomes a part of the contract when executed and the contractors responsibility is thus considered established the record shows however that a bond is not necessarily a guaranty of responsibility because bonding companies have all too frequently been called upon to complete contracts which contractors have abandoned for lack of financial ability or have been removed for persistent faulty work or materials or failed to meet a required time schedule discussing the subject of the competitivebidding system mr william haber in his chapter building construction in how collective bargaining works a text book used by the massachusetts institute of technology on page 194 states prospective owners rarely ask for bids from only one construction firm but from several general contractors who in turn may ask for bids from several subcontractorb for each trade the process is full of pitfalls most subcontractors have fewrecords and have wholly inadequate costaccounting systems estimates are submitted to the general contractor who adds the bids for all trades together includes an item for his own profit and overhead and hands the total to the owner since the owner usually awards the job to the lowest bidder subcontractors are under great pressure to make low bids in addition the practice of bid shopping or putting pressure on the low bidder to get still lower bids intensifies the downward drive and leads to many evilsinaccurate estimates shoddy quality and disregard of labor standardswhich in the end may adversely affect the construction worker the evils that grow out of competitive bidding as described above most certainly have had an adverse affect upon the type of work realized under this system by the awarding authorities many authorities might be cited to substantiate the conclusion that the present competitive system of contracting leads to collusive bidding and price fixing leads to various unsavory trades practices and evils which result in bid peddling chiseling price cutting inferior work impeded progress litigation bankruptcy economic waste and overcharging on changes and extras and other kinds of unpardonable profiteering the bill i have introdhced this morning seeks to determine responsibility in a more practical way it requires all intending bidders to file a completed questionnaire drawn in the form to elicit reasonably accurate information as to the bidders experience and skill as a contractor as to his integrity ability to cooperate to reach the objective of the contract as to his administrative and organizational ability his financial strength and dependability the completed questionnaire if favorable with appended references supplies the awarding authority and the ratifying committee with facts by far more important to the successful conclusion of a contract than any relatively small difference between the low bid and the higher bid it is reasonable to assume that there is just as much difference in skill integrity adaptability and cooperative ability in a score of contractors for a given piece of construction as there is likely to be found in an equal number of bankers for a financial project or lawyers for litigation or counsel or generals in the conduct of a war or architects for the design of buildings or engineers for the design and building of great bridges tunnels or subways in the conduct of such projects the banker lawyer general architect or engineer is selected not according to the lowest bid but in accordance with those qualities unquestionably real and important but elusive of arithmetical calculation it is proposed in the legislation i am introducing that the qualities recognized as highly essential to the best performance of government contracts are to be obtained by a selective method the government is entitled to the best that is available at the lowest equitable cost the lowest bidder with a performance bond is all too frequently selected in the vain delusion that the bond provides all those qualities not to be measured by figures but which are absolutely essential to the best performance h r 2030 provides that a contractor is selected by the awarding authority cooperating with the ratifying committee and all three working together negotiate a lump sum figure for the work indicated upon which a fixed fee is calculated when these three parties in interest have agreed on the estimate of the cost the objectives of all three are merged into one and that objective is the best possible solution of the problem posed by the project the evils of the costplus system of contracting bare their ugly head at every turn particularly today when a serious manpower shortage exists in our war production effort and the astronomical size of our national debt seems to be skyrocketing to infinity under the costplus plan the contractor is at least mildly indifferent to the total cost not perhaps consciously but because that is the way human nature works the same indifference to costs applies to labor in greater or lesser degree to prove this the government need only to examine into its own experience briefly stated the evils of the costplus system are as follows first the working force under this system of contracting consciously or unconsciously feels that the costplus contract is a legitimate reason for extending the man hours second the field organization consisting of clerks stenographers bookkeepers engineers stockkeepers timekeepers and so forth is overmanned third there is a great hoarding of labor especially skilled labor fourth frequently overmanning results on orders from the officer in charge fifth tendency to use less efficient men reserving the best and most efficient for lump sum contracts sixth voluminous amount of red tape and paper work seventh lack of incentive for management to save on labor eighth lack of incentive for management to buy close ninth extravagant overordering and waste of materials tenth if costplus work is carried on in a plant concurrently with a lump sum contract there is at least the risk that labor and materials that should be charged to the lump sum contracts are charged to the costplus job under the negotiated lumpsum contract when the awarding authority the ratifying committee and the contractor all have a common objective the resulting operation is certain to be better and more equitable than that produced by any other method hitherto devised since it is based on the normal reaction of human nature the provisions in this bill requiring agreement among the awarding authority the ratifying committee and the contractor before a contract is executed thereby reducing to the minimum proportions the necessity for renegotiation after completion in accordance with the renegotiation act as amended the amendments to the renegotiation act recommended by the under secretaries of war and navy provide a reduction in the total number of contracts subject to renegotiation of excusing all contractors from renegotiation whose annual war business aniounted to less than 500 000 this amendment would reduce the estimated number of cases to be renegotiated from 85 000 to 20 000 thus permitting 65 000 contractors to go free of any examination for excessive profits this amounts to a wholesale surrender of principle to expediency the task of renegotiation reckoned in competent manpower is administratively impossible within any reasonable length of time renegotiation destroys confidence this bill would restore confidence renegotiation lessens enthusiasm for government work the negotiated lumpsum contract would increase it renegotiation consumes the time of officials of both government and contractor that should be given to construction problems the adoption of the negotiated lumpsum contract system would end this waste of time the recovery by renegotiation of excessive profits is essential but even more important to the winning of the war is the prevention of such profits before they accrue by proper control of prices this latter is the primary responsibility of the procurement and awarding agencies the prevention of excessive profits by the control of prices is far more effective than the subsequent recovery of profits because it avoids all the subsequent administrative work renegotiation is an administrative sin because it amounts to a confession on the part of the procurement and awarding agencies in the first instance awarding contracts which subsequently require reexamination and repricing after completion of the work called for in contracts there may be some few instances in which it may be difficult to determine the cost of producing a new item in advance however under the triple check of the negotiated lumpsumcontract system this could be corrected before final payment is made renegotiation not only costs the government large sums of money for clerical and accounting services but it imposes on the contractor the cost of much time and effort to compile and supply the data required by the renegotiation official this time and effort must be supplied by executives whose attention is thereby diverted from their normal duties as well as by the capable rank and file whose customary duties must meanwhile be suspended from activities important to the winning of the war the negotiated lumpsumcontract system would definitely eliminate these extra preoccupations made necessary by renegotiation it is not my purpose to discuss exhaustively the negotiated lumpsum system of contracting as proposed in the bill introduced by me but briefly to sketch its advantages over the existing systems of contracting now used by the various government awarding agencies the system of contracting proposed in the bill introduced by me provides a triple check of cost first there is an estimate of the cost of the work to be done before a general contractor is selected second a check and approval of the contract and the subcontracts must be made by the ratifying committee before the work is begun third the ratifying committee makes a complete audit of the books of the contractors and subcontractors before final payment a central construction contract ratifying committee is established under this bill which would have jurisdiction over all contracts entered into by any and all government awarding authorities in this way a more uniform system of contract letting is established and takes the matter out of the hands of whimsical individuals a uniform centralized system of contracting would eliminate a flagrant bit of inefficiency and confusion which today causes one awarding authority to sell for little or nothing as surplus a commodity which another agency repurchases through speculators at fabulous prices the ratifying committee is to consist of three members who are qualified engineers or architects the ratifying committee shall have the power to disapprove any contract that does not comply with the existing law and the provisions of this act and shall have available to it all the records in connection with all contracts that are negotiated by any and all government agencies no contract can be consummated without its approval it shall also have the power to adjust any and all differences arising between the awarding authority and the contractor or between the contractor and subcontractor the centralization of the ratification of all contracts should greatly aid in avoiding the conflicts and confusion that often occur under the present system of letting government contracts the plan i submit is not a perfect one i am not wedded to any particular part of it however i believe it points to the right direction and should be developed to that end i trust that these suggestions may be incorporated into the law of the land as quickly as possible for it is in my opinion a long step toward accelerating the day of victory and at the same time holding and cutting down the cost of waging the war the text of h r 2030 is as follows be it enacted etc that in order to save the government time and money in connection with highway building and other construction to provide for a simplified practical contracting procedure in place of the various contracting methods now employed by government awarding authorities to protect the government from profiteering to substitute a simplified system of auditing and adjustment of fees for the formal process of renegotiation of

such questionnaires together with such supplementary investigations as the awarding authority and the construction contract ratifying committee may wish to make the general contractor best fitted to undertake the work the awarding authority in connection with such questionnaires shall also make available to cantractors a statement prepared by it in collaboration with the ratifying committee setting forth the nature of the work to be performed its location the time within which such work is to be started and completed and an estimate of all costs of labor material and fees b the general contractor when selected will select the subcontractors subject to the approval of the awarding authority in the same manner as provided in subsection a of this section c the awarding authority shall negotiate with the general contractor a lumpsum fee for his services the general contractor shall then proceed to negotiate contracts with each subcontractor specifying a lump sum for the work to be performed including all elements of cost and the fee for his services each contract shall be subject to approval in all respects by the ratifying committee if the general contractor has been accustomed to perform carpenter work masonry concreting or any other specialty work with his own forces he shall negotiate for it on a lumpsum basis just as though such work were being sublet to another contractor d in order that the total commitment of the government may be determined in advance no contract or subcontract shall be operative until the ratifying committee has been furnished with all contracts and subcontracts covering the work in question and until it has approved the aggregate amount involved in such contracts and subcontracts e any extra work done by a subcontractor or by the general contractor with his own forces shall be negotiated for in advance on a lumpsum basis in the same manner as prescribed for in the original contract 1f the fees of the various contractors shall be determined by the importance of the work the skill required to properly execute the contract and the time estimated to be necessary to complete the work g the contractors fee shall include the cost of the services rendered by his central office for estimating purchasing expediting accounting financing and general supervision h before final payment is made on any of the work the books of the contractor and of each subcontractor shall be audited by the ratifying committee to determine the true overall cost of the work and the total compensation including that made on extra work shall not exceed the sum agreed upon negotiation when the job is completed and certified by the awarding authority an auditor shall be appointed by the ratifying committee to determine whether profits in excess of those agreed upon have been made by the contractor the cost of such audit shall be borne by the contractor final payment to the contractor to be made within 30 days after the audit has been submitted to and approved by the ratifying committee if upon such audit it should be found that compensation in excess of the agreed amount has been paid the excess shall promptly be repaid to the government and if any evidence of fraud should be discovered the awarding authority shall pursue the remedies provided by law sec 3 a there is hereby established an independent construction contract

member shal be financially interested in any company or firm with which the awarding authority has had any business each member shall serve for a term of 6 years a member of the ratifying committee shall become permanently ineligible to serve if any company or firm in which he is financially interested is an applicant for or a recipient of either a contract from the awarding authority or a subcontract from its contractor the president shall designate one of the members as chairman the compensation of each member of the committee shall be 8 500 per year in addition each is to be paid travel and subsistence expense while actually engaged in work of the ratifying committee outside of washington d c b the powers and duties of the ratifying committee with respect to contracts negotiated by the awarding authority shall be as follows 1 to disapprove any contract that does not comply with the existing law and the provisions of this act in order to facilitate the ratifying committees task in this respect the awarding authority shall submit to the ratifying committee in addition to the proposed contract a detailed memorandum of its reasons for arriving at its final choice of a contractor or subcontractor the replies to the questionnaire by those who filled it out and any protests which may have been filed with the awarding authority by dissatisfied contractors or subcontractors no contract between the awarding authority and a contractor shall become effective without the written approval of a majority of the ratifying committee 2 to adjust any differences between the awarding authority and the contractor or between the contractor and any subcontractor and to make final determination of the allowable profit of the contractor or any subcontractor if any

one of the best reports i have ever seen concisely and definitely answers every question that might be asked i wish therefore to make a few preparatory remarks indicative of the reasons for the legislation hector bywater the great english naval writer said in 1927 now as never before the dominion of the sea is vested in the strongest fleet he used the word fleet as meaning the whole naval force of a country he also meant a proper balance of ships of all types and classifications his statement may have presaged the present conflict when naval warfare must be on all the waters that cover the globe the united states has gone further than any other country in that conception and as said in the report of the committee today the united states navy is larger than the combined navies of all other nations and much stronger than any combination of foreign navies which could be brought against us such a navy is not only our strongest defense but now as never before it is absolutely essential to our offense such a thought is newit has arisen from the nature of the warfare of the present day one hundred and fifty years ago it was the view of the people of this country that we needed no naval force at all the war of 1812 disabused them of such an idea as utter naval helplessness the succeeding years showed the need of a navy and in world war i and afterward we were engaged in a great naval building program which as president roosevelt in a message to congress in 1927 said before its completion would have given us first place on the sea all of you know that our deliberate selfdenial in the limitation of armament caused us to lose our position as to naval strength japan violated her sacred oath to disarm made at the washington conference almost as soon as the ink of her signature dried on the pages of the treaty disarmament became a delightful dream so far as peace was concerned still there were those among us who though having eyes refused to see the dangers across the waters to the east and west of us some time ago i read a short paragraph of three sentencesi do not know the authorbut it is so concise andcomplete in pointing out the dangers of inattention to the upkeep of the navy that i will insert it here there has been after each of the wars in which we have been engaged and coincident with the relaxing of the war tension a waning interest in the navy in recent years this has been furthered by an organized pazifist propaganda working both upon the countrys inherent idealism and upon the dc tre for economy and having as its object disarmament by example in the conditions now confronting us this weakening of our first line of defense is a menace to the countrys security it is evident we have won the war even though we are still fighting and surely no observer anywhere will fail to give credit to the navy for the part it played speaking for myself i am of the opinion that not only did our navy afford a sense of security and protection to the people of the country in its defensive work but also in its offensive operations made it possible for our glorious armies to give the knockout blow yet in our indifference to international conditions we had after the washington conference and until 1932 not even kept the navy up to the treaty strength permitted in the treaty signed at washington the united states navy had sunk to a level of a thirdrate navy by the grace of god this danger was foreseen by some farsighted leaders of america and we began in 1933slowly it is true but surelyto build up the navy that it might be prepared for any unforeseen eventuality it takes time to build a navy and the work done in those few years before the dastardly blow struck us was of such value small though the navy was as compared with its strength now that i believe it kept our shores from enemy invasion the lesson of unpreparedness was forcibly brought home to us and we energetically and feverishly began to build and accomplished the greatest production in a short period of time that the world has ever known the work has been done successfully we must make sure that never again will we be caught in such a precarious unpreparedness no man knows what will be the after conditions of this war while we are striving so hard to bring peace to the warworn weary world this bill has as its main purpose to put before the people of the country the need for keeping up to its full adequate strength the navy as it now is and secondarily to move slowly in the disposal of surplus ships and property which have accumulated in the years of our large production following the american system of checks and balances the committee thought the disposal of such unnecessary ships equipment and material should have the approval of congress after consideration of the recommendations of the naval administration it is the declared duty of congress under the constitution to provide and maintain a navy this bill again quoting from the report of the committee is a recognition that the branch of government which has had the responsibility of appropriating billions of the taxpayers money for constructing the greatest navy known to history likewise has the responsibility for seeing that this huge investment in security is not dissipated by unwise dispositions this bill is not intended as an interference with the operations of the navy the control and command of the navy is left just as it should be in the hands of those best qualified to direct it the committee however thinks that congress should be advised of the maintenance of the navy in order that it should fulfill its constitutional responsibility this is recognized by the able and hardworking secretary of the navy in his letter to the committee of may 2 1945 in which he says that while it may slow up some of the disposal activities it is not felt that this restriction and delay incident thereto would unduly affect the operations of the navy in the great emergency that confronted the united states prior to and at the breaking out of the war congress realized the necessity for speedy action which could not have been obtained un der the slower processes of legislation and it delegated to the executive department broad powers of action this bill again reviews the situation and the committee thinks the time has come to enact legislation to limit that extensive authority previously granted the navy department under the bill cannot dispose of any ships shore stations or plants except under the definitions and restrictions mentioned in the bill without first reporting to congress congress then can approve or disapprove said proposal by a concurrent resolution or take no action at all in which case the navy may carry out its ideas after 60 days this is proper necessary legislation and should be approved by the house"], [4.431605339050293e-05, 0.4999556839466095, 1, "i recently made a rather extended yet hurried tour

the end that no temporary or provisional authorities in the liberated countries block tile eventual exercise of the peoples right to choose freely the government and institutions under which as freemen they are to live in the yalta agreement we find this very significant language free and unfettered elections in which all democratic and antinazi parties shall have the right to take part and

guaranteeing 0 personal freedom freedom from fear freedom of worship freedom of speech liberty of the press freedom of assembly and association the agreement likewise contains the following language elections for constituent assembly will be decided within 3 months of the liberation of the whole country election will be held in accordance with the election laws for constituent assembly which will

political parties corporations groups individuals who have not collaborated with the enemyto present lists of candidates for election with specific reference to the present situation in yugoslavia from the best information i have been able to obtain from sources which i consider in all respects reliable and trustworthy the people of yugoslavia are very apprehensive and with fear and trembling

and daughters to say nothing of the property losses involved certainly the libertyloving people of yugoslavia have a right to a government which is responsive to their will but what is the actual situation yugoslavia is today experiencing a reign of terror and ruthless and unwarranted cruelty which is being visited upon those who are unwilling to accept the communism of tito who made his appearance in belgrade in the ranks of the russian army political opponents are exterminated without trial thousands of people have been murdered and others have been placed in concentration camps institutions never known in the country before the war all personal liberties are suppressed in yugoslavia courts of law are not permitted to function the life of every individual depends upon the mercy of tito and his totalitation regime work is a privilege to the favored and obedient subjects of titos will yet only those who work may eat spies or agents snoop upon the citizens and woe unto one who makes an unwise remark in a public place or insists upon the right of free speech i am advised that 57 professors of the university of belgrade have either been placed in concentration camps or put to death as tito extends his reign of terror over the political and economic life of the country tito suppresses political activities and his agents boast that the national liberation front is the only political organization in our country in spite of the yalta decisions there is a total absence of personal liberty and economic freedom and free and unfettered elections will not be held if tito has his way because citizens fail to accept communism they are accused as collaborators with the enemy and are dealt with according to titos directive how can yugoslavia have free and unfettered elections if all candidates must be approved by titos supreme political committee a citizen who fails to vote will be considered unpatriotic and will be forced to bear the consequences of having

and his words however guarded may be construed to be criminal he knows that even his looks and countenance may be considered as the signs and evidences of treacherous thoughts and treasonable conspiracies and he knows that the suspicion of his masters upon any of these points may be fatal for he knows that he is at the mercy of those who upon the slightest suspicion may seize or hang himwho may do whatever they please with him and with all those who are dear to him what effect must this mans situation pro duce upon his mind and temper can his views be great or exalted no such views instead of being encouraged would give offence and he is well aware what would follow can openness and candor beam from his soul no such light would be hateful to his masters it must be extinguished now i ask you for what are our boys fighting and dying and becoming maimed and blinded is it to set up any such system of totalitarian control or any such tyranny as you find in these bills you know it is not it hasnever entered their minds that they are fighting for any such setup as this and it is not worthy of congress to put any such totalitarian bill on the statute books of

recommendations of the navy department i suggest that you put yourselves in our position sitting on the committee as we were the navy department coming before us and saying this is the minimum requirement that we know we need in order to carry on the war what would youdo would you raise a controversy over a small particular item would you undertake to go through the program with the finest of finetooth combs or would you look at it from the broad standpoint i am sure that you all agree with the attitude of the committee we tried to inquire a thoroughly as we could into the particular items but principally we relied upon the recommendations of the officials who have the responsibilities of doing this tremendous job especially did we rely upon their recommendations in view of the assurance given to the committee by admiral horne vice chief of operations whose job it is to see that the tools are made and are in place and that the bases are established at the time they are needed upon his assurance of the various steps taken by the navy department itself in screening these various projects as they were received by the department from the officers in the field we felt that the navy had been unusually thorough in its consideration of the necessity of the items these various steps total nine they are included in the report but in case none of you have had an opportunity to study the report i will briefly call them to your attention first the item is recommended by the commanding officer in the field he knows his local situation he knows his responsibilities he sees that a certain thing has to bedone he recommends to the department that it be done in addition to that the department itself initiates projects of its own accord to be developed and constructed in the field that is the first step the second step is the submission of all these projects to the bureau of ydrds and docks which has the job of building them the third step is the review of the publicworks program by the bureau of yards and docks and the submission by that bureau to the chief of naval operations then the chief of naval operations surveys all the recommendations and his decisions are based upon the military necessity for each individual item his recommendations are submitted to the secretary of the navy the secretary then refers the entire program to the judge advocate general for the preparation of appropriate legislation after it is prepared it is submitted to the budget bureau heretofore the budget bureau has been rather critical of the navys requests for funds i feel that we would not perform our duty to the house if we did not advise the house that in this instance the budget bureau did not reduce any of the items recommended by the navy department then it goes from the budget bureau back to the judge advocate general and is submitted by the judge advocate general to the speaker of the house and to the president of the senate and referred to the committees where again it is considered bear in mind that after this authorization is adopted the navy people have to come back again to the congress and go to the committee on appropriations for the money and again they will have to substantiate their requests i cannot conceive how any system could be more thorough or more complete than this system has been when we consider the responsibilities of the job there is a paragraph in the bill as the members will note authorizing the secretary of the navy to acquire land wherever it is necessary it should have been brought to your attention that the law requires or if the law does not require it it is the practice of the navy department that before the navy acquires any bit of land in any place within the continental limits of the united states or our insular or territorial possessions the navy comes to the committee on naval affairs whether it be for a lease of land or for the acquisition of title to land and justifies its particular needs the committee then must put its stamp of approval upon that land acquisition or the land is not acquired already in the past 3 years i think the committee has surveyed some 2 000 or 3 000 pieces of property if that number is not correct i hope the chairman will correct me a question in regard to advance base construction perhaps arises in your minds which might well be answered what is done with our land bases as our military machine rolls along farther and farther into the pacific and these bases which were so essential a year or 2 years ago become practically useless what becomes of our naval equipment and of the land installations are they turned over to the local governments are they dismantled and moved forward what is the picture we were assured by admiral horne and i think it is no military confidence that wherever possible every item of naval equipment whether it is afloat or ashore that can be used miles in advance is used every bit that is salvageable is salvaged as to the remainder the title still remains in the united states we have not disposed of any of our naval equipment in any of the advance bases to any of the local authorities a question has been raised vith regard to section 4 which i am very happy has been brought to the attention of the house because of my own personal interest in it public act no 1 of the seventyeighth congress the first bill the seventyeighth congress passed in 1943 provided that no ship boat barge or floating drydock could be disposed of except in accordance with the terms of the lendlease act of march 11 1941 that was attached to the public works bill as i recall it similarly as this section 4 is attached to this bill in 1943 the congress determined that not a ship sailing under the flag of the united states navy should be disposed of in any way except as we had previously authorized its lease to foreign countries under the lendlease act that has been established as a matter of policy by the congress subsequent to that law came the surplus property act which by its definitions made possible the dispcsition of all types of naval craft except the combatant type that would include floating drydocks barges oil tankers and landing craft these enormous ships that take the tanks right up to the shore could be disposed of as the chairman has so very well said it is the opinion of the committee that it is for the congress to determine at some future date how and when any of the ships will be disposed of and how and what ships will be retained i yield 20 minutes to

made an outstanding record in this country gen lewis a pick i recall the time when general pick was called to washington in september of 1943 from his work as division engineer of the missouri river division at omaha he was here for 3 or 4 days given only that short period of time to take the initial steps in organizing the staff he was going to take with him to set up this work in burma and india he said to me i cannot tell you where i am going but i am going a fur piece i did not try to press him further but because of general conditions i was able to make a fairly accurate guess of where he was going i have heard from him two or three times he was attacked by malaria and himself had to meet the rigors of going from a midwestern climate in the united states to that of india and burma yet he carried on to outstanding success when the committee of the whole goes back in the house i shall ask permission to include in my remarks an article which appeared in last sundays magazine
