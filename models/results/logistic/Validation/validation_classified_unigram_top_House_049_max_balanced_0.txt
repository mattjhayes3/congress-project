or the national bank question or the general question of government expenditures or any other question except that of fortifications i think that the title of this bill ought to be a bill to provide how not to do it it comes so far short of what seems to me to be the emergency and the demand of the hour that it can be in no sense called a fortification bill at the very best it is a bill to get ready to prepare to begin to fortify but beyond that it does not go the gentleman from alabama who has charge of the hill said in his opening remarks as excusing the meagerness of the measure that we are at peace with all the world that is true and for that very reason we ought to be utilizing the present opportunity to get ready for a different state of affairs as has been said by the gentleman from ohio when the hour of danger comes it is too late to make preparation for war human nature is the same today that it has ever been international intercourse is the same it has always been human selfishness human greed and human ambition have not changed with the lapse of years and as in ages past one nation has ever stood ready to take advantage of the unpreparedness of another so today our great commercial and political rivals stand ready to seize the opportunity of our nakedness to fall upon us and destroy us the millennium has not yet come and until it does come it will never be safe for a great commercialnation a rich nation like the united states to be unprepared for war as to when war may comesoon or latethat is a mere question of years it may be a mere question of months at all events it is only a question of time when this nation shall again be plunged in war it is as certain as any future and contingent event can be and when it comes where is it going to fall with the present military power of this nation its strength in men its command of resources no great lbreign army will ever again be marched into the interior of this country no foreign flag will ever be borne across our territory but the war will be waged on our sea borders upon the great commercial centers on the seacoast the blow will fall i itherefore it is that we need to provide not interior delouses not great standing armies but adequate defenses along the sea margin i think it was talleyrand who said that nothing happens but the unexpected war never yet or very rarely came to a nation when that nation was fully prepared armed equipped and expecting the assault in 1871 when the matter of a submarine tunnel to connect france and england was under discussion colonel maurice of the english army undertook an investigation of the manner in which great wars have originated he commenced his investigation with the year 1700 and brought it down to the year 1871 covering a period of one hundred and seventyoue years lie fbund as a result of his investigation that during those one hundred and seventyone years one hundred and seven wars had commenced without any previous declaration of war or announcement of hostilities he found that during that time there has been fortyone cases of war commenced without the declaration of hostilities not only evidently but in many cases avowedly for the very purpose of gaining the advantage that was to come froln a blow for which the enemy was unprepared lie found that of those one hundred and seven wars commenced without previous declaration sixty had occurred in the present century and that in thirty cases important fortresses had been seized by sudden movements because of no previous declaration of hostilities and inadequate preparation on the part of the enemy this is the history of modern warfare it almost always comes in a day as did the francoprussian war and as have other wars of recent date we know not therefore when war may come but when it doescome it will come suddenly as a thief in the night now what preparation have we for war at the present time in the report of the commission on fortifications to which reference has been made several times today the commission state that in 1860 this nation was as well fortified and as well prepared for war as any nation in the world in the then state of theart of war but what is our condition today we are absolutely helpless we are wholly deficient in any modern armament we are absolutely stripped of any navy we are totally without the best modern guns of heavy caliber in other words we are not prepared to cope with the meanest european power even the sick man turkey today could send a fleet of war ships into new york harbor that the united states of america with all its armaments could not withstand and which could dictate terms to that great commercial metropolis and lay it under contribution for hundreds of millions of dollars we have not the means for capturing or destroying any one of those which they could send against us the little south american republic of chili has more than one and more than two ships of war which could steam through the golden gate into the harbor of san francisco and lay that great western metropolis in ashes in spite of all that we could do this is the deplorable and disgraceful condition we are in the board composed of the secretary of war of the chief of ordnance of the chief of engineers of the army of two able ordnance officers of two wellknown naval officers and two distinguished citizens from civil life say in their report to this house under date of january 23 1886 it is impossible to understand the supineness which has kept this nation quietallowing its floating and shore defenses to become obsolete and effete without making ans effort to keep progress with the age while other nations besides constructing powerful navies have not considered themselves securo without large expenditures for fortifications including armored forts that is what their report says that is what the secretary of war subscribes to because his name is appended to the report the new navy which we have not built and have made no appropriations to build is the coefficient of coast defense goes along with it and is a part of the system the navy is the movable factor and the coast defense the permanent factor it is said we have no present need of these defenses i said a moment ago the time when we have no present need is the time when we must prepare for the time of need as the board says it would take three years to create the plant and then two years more to fabricate the first great gunfive years before we can begin to turn out our armament it would take fifteen years with the utmost expedition we can make to cariy out the system of fortification this plan has evolved not less than fifteen years will suffice to put our 4 000 miles of coast in a condition of sufficient defense along the atlantic coast along the gulf coast and along the great pacific coast are the great entrep6ts and depots of the nation through which itsvastwealth goes out to theworld and the wealth of the world comes to us close these great portsportland boston new york baltimore philadelphia hampton roads charleston savannah and the mouth of the mississippi riverand the commerce of this nation is absolutely paralyzed until the blockade is raised and we have not yet the first ship the first gun the first battery with which to raise the blockade we would have to go to work to create the ships to create the guns to create the armament before we could raise the blockade of the first of these ports i desire to speak especially ior one moment on the condition of our lake frontier wo not only have this grdat atlantic coast fronting europe the great gulf coast fronting south america and the great pacific coast fronting china japan and the orient but we have a great lake coast of a thousand miles from rouses point on lake champlain to duluth on lake superior right across the border we have a flourishing strong and vigorous young nation of five millions of people with the british empire back of it with the st lawrence open to them so that british ironclad gunboats could be sent to them through the canals on the canadian territory while we have not a shipcanal or water way on american soil through which any war vessel could pass from tidewater to the lakes on these lakes are more than a thousand millions of property within range of any one of a fleet of gunboats that can get access to them on lake michigan alone is approximately a thousand millions of property within range of any gunboatthat can reach that lake and as you come down along the lakes there are detroit toledo sandusky cleveland buffalo and oswego with hundreds of millions more of property liable to destruction by gunboats that could come up through the welland canal by the treaty of 1817 we are forbidden to maintain more than one revenuecutter upon lake ontario and two upon the upper lakes with one 18pound gun on board that is the only protection that is now afforded to this vast amount of property but you say there is nodanger on our northern frontier because we could walk over and take canada any morning before breakfast gentlemen do not remember perhaps that we have to cross this great water boundary first canada has control of the canals and it would not take over twentyfour hours for a british gunboat fleet from kingston to come up through the welland canal and reach the upper lakes and once there we would have no means to stop them fort wayne is little better for this purpose than an earth bank with a popgun on it once there they would have the world before them where to choose there would be nothing to prevent their devastating the shores and laying their great cities under contribution at will the board of fortifications in as report places the lake frontier as fourth in point of urgency of all the great fortifications required only new york san francisco and boston taking precedence the board recommends the construction of four principal works on this northern frontier first a work at the outlet of lake champlain to prohibit the entrance of naval vessels of an enemy into that lake second a work with heavy armament upon the st lawrence to command the entrance into lake ontario third the strengthening and supplying of modern guns to fort wayne upon detroit river which commands the entrance to the three upper lakes with all their populous and opulent cities fourth the construction of works at the falls of the sainte marie for the purpose of protecting the great shipcanal through which passes the vast commerce of the new northwest for these purposes the board recommends an expenditure of 4 136 800 if it is said that great britain will never declare war against us because we have a mortgage on canada i would ask if we are prepared to surrender our vast seacoast of 4 000 miles to be ravagedand desolated for the sake of an ultimate possibility of the aquisition of canada will not a great irouclad fleet off new york boston philadelphia and baltimore be quite as likely to dictate terms to us as we would be to dictate the terms of settlement to them with a hundred thousand men on canadian soil they would have us by the throat while we have them by the heels the idea that the proper place to defend new york city from an ironclad fleet is beyond the canadian border is to say the least a novel and striking one the great seaport towns portland boston new york philadelphia baltimore new orleans and san francisco are the nervecenters or ganglia at which national life resides here the great railroad lines internal water lines foreign commerce and coastwise trade concentrate the possession or destruction of these by an enemy would paralyze the entire commercial system of the country this is so clearly pointed out in the letter already read by the gentleman from ohio from samuel j tilden to the speaker of this house on the 1st of december last that i need not again repeat it he says the property exposed to destruction in the twelve seaports of portland portsmouth boston newport new york philadelphia baltimore charleston savannah new orleans galveston and san francisco can not be less in value than 5 000 000 000 to this must be added a vast amount of property dependent for its use upon these seaports the distinguished writer whose voice and counsel should at least be potential on the democratic side of this chamber advises the imamediate application of the surplus in the treasury to our seacoast defenses the board of fortifications most emphatically reenforces that counsel the president in his annual message says the board on fortifications or other defenses appointed in pursuance of the act approved march 3 185 will in a short time present their report and it is hoped that this may greatly aid the legislation so necessary to remedy thepresent defenseless condition of our seacoast this is a substantial indorsement of the report of the board so we have both the intellectual head and the political head of the democratic party urging them in one direction and yet they hesitate to go they are deaf to their own secretary of war but what is the plan of the board it is the construction of a system of iron and steel armored forts some with revolving turrets others consisting of metal casemates and others yet with barbette emplacements and all armed with the best modern breechloading rifled guns of heavy caliber these works are to be supplemented by floating batteries and submarine mines and torpedo boats it is hardly needful to say that all these should be the correlative of a firstclass armored navy prepared to contest the approach of a hostile fleet to our coast"], [0.12064915895462036, 0.8793508410453796, 1, "i move to strike out the last word the question that is of the most importance to my mind in the consideration of this measure is not the relative value and purity of the article known as oleomargarine or of butter and i do not desire to submit any observation on these subjects nor upon anything which has been said about these two products but the question is as to whether the american congress shall deliberately proceed in the line of a new departure to use the internalrevenue taxing power for any purpose other than that of raising revenue this measure however demanded for wbatever purpose introduced supported by whatever argument is when you reduce it to its ultimate analysis the use of the sovereign power of taxation for the purpose of aiding a competitor in trade in the race for profit now what i desire to say is only to emphasize that issue so that we may understand and the country will understand what it is we are doing today we do not need the revenue for the figures show that by the present internalrevenue taxation for this year we will receive from tobacco and spirits and from the duties imposed on imported tobacco and spirits about 109 000 000 with the sugar duties added to this making about 160 000 000 all the war expenditures can be met by these three articles the pensions are about 80 000 000 the sinking fund 46 659 000 the interest on the public debt about 44 622 589 so that these three articlessugar tobacco and spiritswill pay all the war expenditures which the government must liquidate the customs will leave us perhaps thirty millions or over more than the sums which by the estimates of the departments are necessary for the year 1887 on page 254 of the book of estimates the aggregate estimated expenditures for the year 1887 are 339 589 552 34 of this sum 75 830 200 are for pensions 46 659 000 for the sinking fund 44 622 587 23 for interest on the public debt so that these three items all being var expenditures aggregating 167 111 789 28 are to be met by war taxes by the internal revenue on spirits and tobacco and the remainder over the sum collected on these two articles can be well paid by the duties on sugars these taxes are literally taxes absolutely so as to spirits and tobacco almost so as to sugar 85 per cent of the imports on sugars going into the treasury so that we have ample revenues for all the purposes of the government and a surplus of at least thirty millions this of necessity brings us face to face whether we desire to face it or not with the problem howshallwe sort out these taxes how shall we eliminate from the objects of taxation so as to reduce these excessive revenues somewhat to meet the mere necessities of the government from what shall we take off the burden of taxation what shall be relieved from the taxing power not what shall we hunt to subject to new burdens there are 30 000 000overand above our necessary revenues where shall we lift the burden of taxation this is the real problem which meets us this bill proposes not to relieve taxation and lest i forget it in lihe limited time allotted to me i here remark that the power of taxatioi is a trust power all powers granted to governments whether they be despotic or republican governments are trust powers they are powers delegated by the people to the organism known as society acting through prescribed agencies called a government merely for the purpose for which governments are organized now this trust

purpose of adding to what i said in the fortyeighth congress concerning this case but at that time i gave to the bill then presented to us for our consideration some thought some investigation some careful consideration and i desire briefly tonight to emphasize and only emphasize what i had then occasion to say for more than twenty years it has stood recorded that in an hour of the countrys extremity and peril fitzjohn porter was guilty of insubordination and disobedience of orders and during all these years the loyal patriotic heart of this country has indorsed and approved that record it so approves it now and asks that in the years that are yet to come it may stand as the recorded judgment of the american people why ought it to be stricken down what evidence is tendered to us fbr our consideration what evidence has been adduced that is calculated to convince any man that the verdict then recorded by that distinguished courtmartial was erroneous and wrong true it has been criticised true supplications and petitions have been presented true a military com mission reviewed the evidence subsequently years after that trial and that investigation a commission that had no power to execute its decrees a commission that had no power to administer a legal oath a commission that had no power to command the presence of a witness a commission constituted and composed of three officers to review the xvii97 proceedings of a courtmartial legally constituted and authorized under the laws of the land sitting for fortyfive days patiently impartially and conscientiously endeavoring to ascertain and determine the facts i have heard it said upon this floor that that is not such a court as is recognized by or known to our constitution and yet members here know that quite recently the supreme court of the nation in reviewing the celebrated case of paymaster smith has recognized and affirmed the constitutionality and legality of military courtsmartial and it has declared the law to be that these officers may not only be tried and courtmartialed for offenses committed by them in their military capacity but they may be courtmartialed and tried for offenses committed in a civil capacity if as a matter of fact they are officers representing the government of the united states we all know how important it is if we desire to ascertain the truth that a matter shall be investigated when it is fresh in the minds and recollections of the people as lawyers we all know how important it is if we are defending criminals to indulge in delay and procrastination we know that delay is the essence of our defense and if we can secure continuances until witnesses are dead if we can secure delays until facts are forgotten if we can secure continuances until public interest has subsided or has lost knowledge of the case then we hope to secure acquittals for our clients and it has occurred to me that is the essence of this supplication and of this petition that is presented to the american congress in the name of fitzjohn porter when that distinguished courtmartial sat for fortyfive days and heard the witnesses tendered in defense of fitzjohn porter as well as those brought by the government to confront him with his deeds all knew the circumstances the facts were fresh general porter knew whether it rained on that night or not general porter knew whether the roads were passable on that night or not general porter knew whether his troops were in condition to be marched that night or not general porter knew whether he received these orders or not general porter knew whether he had moved with expedition and promptness or not general porter knew and so did the country where the position of these confederate forces was on that day and now after more than twenty years from the happening of those events he comes to congress to say that that courtmartial so patiently investigating these facts knew nothing of them and were in error is not that a remarkable proposition i remember that in the fortyeighth congress a distinguished gentleman from new york who had charge of this bill said that we as members of congress were not competent to consider the facts that we as members could not investigate the testimony and determine whether fitzjohn porter was innocent or guilty and yet with that remarkable declaration made here to this house he pressed upon our attention and our consideration a bill something like the one we are considering tonight i think it is a remarkable thing in the history of legislative bodies that a man should come before congress pressing for its consideration such a bill and yet declaring when so tendering it that that body was not competent to give it an intelligent investigation appeals are made on this floor to us in the name of general grant and is is said that after he had given to this subject laborious careful and thoughtful investigation he changed his conclusions i am glad to express my appreciation of one fact in connection with this discussion and that is that it has converted almost all of the representatives upon the other side of this chamber into friends of general grant and let me say that that better becomes them than the defamation and slander which for years were uttered and expressed against the head and heart of that distinguished statesman and patriotic soldier but let me suggest to them also that for eight years general grant had resting upon his shoulders an official oath and official responsibility for eight years he was the chief executive of this nation during those eight years general fitzjohn porter knocked at the doors of the presidential mansion asking that this case of his should be reviewed and reconsidered and during all that period when general grant as president of the united states had resting upon him the same obligations that rest upon us here to observe n maintain the constitution and respect the laws he turned a deaf ear to those solicitations and said my duty is plain my duty is to stand by that courtmartial whaich considered all the evidence and all the facts in an impartial manner and declared that you were guilty as charged in the indictment afterward when official responsibility ceased and official cares were laid aside when general grant had gone into a different atmosphere and had resting upon him only the simple responsibility of a private citizen he allowed the avenues to his heart to be opened and he listened to the supplications and importunities of this unfortunate man and because general grant did that we are charged almost with sacrilege because we do not set aside the oath of official responsibility that is imposed upon us as representatives of the american people and say that we will vindicate or attempt to vindicate this man"], [0.1334051489830017, 0.8665948510169983, 1, "the gentleman begs the point at issue by asking me whether we can take away

washington i received a letter from professor baird in respect to carp and their production i knew very little about fishculture but treating the question in the same way in which i have been disposed to treat this question i decided to go to some scientific man and find out what use carp would be in my district casting about for a suitable person to whom to apply i decided to go to professor linden of the buffalo academy of sciences i showed him the letter i had received and asked him whether lie thought it worth while to introduce carp into that district at all he looked at the letter

transportation question my friend on the right asks me if i meant to say there was no danger of the passage of this bill if i thought there was no chance for its passage i would not waste breath in talking about it to the house to my mind upon the wise solution of this question of transporting freight throughout the united states depends the future prosperity of this country if there was any possibility of turning a question of this character into a partisan one by which votes could be lost or won then there would not be any question of the attention of this house to the discussion upon this bill every mans ears would be open and every man seeking to understand the question involved but because this is purely a business question affecting the pockets and the prosperity of the people out of which by no possibility can grow partisan politics we become indifferent and drift apart and so cast our votes upon the final issue without a real understanding of the merits of the case our railroad system the wonder growth of the nineteenth century has opened up the great wilderness of the united states it has peopled this vast country with the freest and most intelligent people the world knows anything about it has brought into neighborly intercourse the people on opposite sides of the continent it is breaking down the barriers of provincial civilizationand molding us into a homogeneous people but with this system which has done so much for the united states and for all the world with this miracleworking system have come those evils which always go hand in hand with the greatest good i never knew in all my personal observation or in my reading a blessing to be conferred upon humanity without finding right by the side of it a curse and the business of legislation is to minimize the evil and get the most out of the good competition in most instances between railways alone has proved a failure as a safe regulator of charges the facility for combination and the skill of railway management have been too strong to permit the benefits expected in this direction railroads are in the very necessity of the case monopolies you can not make anything else out of them the cost of construction the immense consolidation of capital necessary to build a long line of road makes a preemption of the country through which it goes not only possible but necessary legislation thus far has proved without effect in the way of controlling this monopoly and preventing it from having its natural growththe natural growth of the power of consolidated wealth the natural growth of the power arising from the preemption of any particular section of the country and the absolute control of the commerce and trade and traffic that pass across it while i do not despair of beneficial results from legislation yet to be had i am quite sure we must seek it in other channels than those now advocated before any real relief will be had one solution and one only thus far has presented itself to the american people whcrcver water transportation has been made effective it has solvedthe whole question of cheap transportation andhas been worth volumes of statutes upon that question wherever railroads have been obliged to compete for traffic with water routes this question has always settled itself chicago has become the metropolis of the greatwest because located at thelower end of lake michigan with a complete water course through the great lakes and the erie canal to the atlantic seaboard it has been able togatherin the great graincrops of the northwest in order that they might obtain the advantages of water competition thence to the markets of the east and the old world all over the western country freights take the shortest routes to chicago you do not need legislation to control the railway traffic from thence to the atlantic the lakes and the canal control whenever the summer months melt out the ice and allow competition between the waterways and the railways and we get the benefit of it largely in the winter as well as in the summer because of the fact that the lines of railway extending eastward from chicago and paralleling those lines farther north and farther southbecause those roads have to compete in the summer they are compelled to studycheaper methods of transportation they are compelled to economize to straighten out their lines to make smaller grades and to do all those things that wise men may do to enable them to compete with the lake routes and still make dividends for their stockholders and so in the winter where the water ways are icebound we get the benefit of that economy we get the benefit of the study of the railway men to make profits and to cheapen railway transportation so all through the west we have the unparalleled low rates of transportation from chicago and the only trouble is when you get beyond and out of the line of waterroute competition now the proposition of this bill is simply to extend lake michigan 500 miles westward to saint paul that is the whole of it when you figure it all down when you strip it of all outside issues and get away from the multitude of figures that only confuse the mind the simple question for this house to pass upon is whether it is worthy of the attention of the united states and of the american congress to consider the question of moving lake michigan 500 miles into the interior and penetrating the very heart of the great wheat fields of the northwest that is all there is of it you build a canal almost straight from the southern end of lake michigan to the mississippi river and then for 400 miles more you pass up with good transportation to saint paul there you are in the center of another railway system that brings there the great grain crops of all the northwestern country it is 500 miles more of water competitioni will not say transportation for i believeand i propose to deal with all questions fairlyi believe that in the future the great body of the crops of the west moving eastward and the products of the east moving westward will be transported by rail as they are today to my mind it does not make any difference whether there is only one canalboat a day passing over that canal or whether there are a thousand any more than it makes any difference whether lake michigan is whitened with the sails of commerce or whether the sight of a schooner is only occasionally presented to us there so long as the lakes exist so long as the erie canal is open just so long will the price of freighting eastward be very largely controlled by the cost of freighting around by the water ways and the same is true of saint paul and all the tributary country along the line between saint paul and chicago so long as you have this cheap canal across from the lake to the river and so long as you have the mississippi open for barge and steamboat transportation to saint paul just so long will it be impossible for those who control any other method of transportation to charge much more than the cost by the water way therefore if you build this canal it becomes the regulator of railroad rates 500 miles farther westward into the very heart of that country which supplies the east and the old world with bread it necessarily cheapens the cost of that transportation and if it does that it adds something to the profit of the farmer it takes off something from the cost to the consumer and all the people producers and consumers alike are benefited by the lessened cost of producing and carrying to market it may be said that this is a state enterprise and that illinois ought to build this canal we know as matter of history that new york built the erie canal and because new york built that canal we may be told on this floor that illinois ought to build this canal to the mississippi i call the attention of gentlemen to the fact that the circumstances in the two cases are entirely different the erie canal was built before the days of railroads i remember whena boy emigrating to the western country passing across the whole state of new york upon the erie canal and i never lost the impression that i received then of the magnitude of the great west from seeing the tremendous amount of commerce that was passing over that canal at that time when the erie canal was built all western new york as well as the farther west was shut out from market its building brought the richest part of the state of new york into a condition to be settled up and made productive but it did more than that it directed the commerce of all the great west down to new york city and made that city the commercial metropolis of the new world but suppose that canal did not exist and this house were asked to build a canal across the state of new york i ask gentlemen upon this floor in view of all that canal has done and all that it is doing in the way of cheapening trafc between the east and the west could there be any reason offered here against its construction except that it would take some money out of the treasury who of us would consent that the project should be abandoned who that represents the grfeat state of new york upon this floor would for a moment consent that that great waterway which conveys the commerce of the west down to the seaboard at new york city should be closed up even if the congress of the united states had to be called upon to appropriate money to keep it open it does not need as i have already said that all this commerce or even the most of it shall go by the canal it does not need that the railways shall cease to carry the great bulk of that commerce it simply needs that there shall be in existence a water way on which boats can float then because of the existence of that water way the railroads must conform their charges to the rates established by its competition why it is within your memory and mineit is only a few years agothat the railways of illinois traversing that state parallel with the line of thb illinois river and canal put their freights down so low that the canal could not pay expenses the purpose being to close it up and force its abandonment so that it should no longer compete with them immediately the legislature of the state appropriated a certain sum of money to keep up that canal every year from that time such an appropriation has been made but not one dollar of it has ever been called for or used in keeping up the canal because when the power of the state was found to be behind it there was no railroad company so foolish as to suppose that it could be broken down by competition and thenceforward they have been satisfied to take such reasonable rates as water competition has compelled them to accept i have no more interest in this canal than any other member upon this floor no portion of my district is within 80 miles of it no portion of the products of my district will ever be transported over it unless the great northwest shall cease to compete with us in feeding the world this canal simply crosses the state of illinois we have the lakes they influence freight all over the north half of our state whether the roads run into chicago or whether they do not this canal is to do for the wheatfields and the cornfields of iowa nebraska and minnesota what the lakes and the erie canal have done for the wheatfields and cornfields of illinois that is all there is of this canal it is a national enterprise if it is to the interest of new york and new england to send the products of those states into the northwest if it is to the interest of pennsylvania to send her coal and her iron into the northwest it is also to the interest of the eastern half of this country to get the wheat and corn and oats and whatever other products the rich farms of that region yield down to the seaboard with just as little toll as possible there is no part of this country that will not feel the effects of such cheapening of transportation as will be effected by penetrating inland into the great wheatfields 500 miles more chicago may get some special benefit by the increased business brought there our local labor market may be benefited and i hope it will be but these are only incidental advantages which do not change the national character of the enterprise i can see no objection that any gentleman can raise if he admits the premises if he admits that the building of this canal will cheapen transportation to the extent of a fraction of what is claimed by the special friends of the bill he admits the whole case unless he has constitutional objections to building any public improvement at the expense of the nation i say when that is admitted that is all there is of the case wherever shipcanals have been built wherever navigable rivers come in conflict with railroad transportation the things which i claim for this canal have taken place why sir in the discussion of the question of regulating railroad freights when we propose to fix a certain rate we are met with the objection that wherever the railroads come into competition with the water ways they must have the privilege of cutting down their rates in order to get traffic so it is everywhere take the city of peoria in which my colleague mr wortmigton resides the second city in the state of illinois in population in wealth and in business why its great distilling interests the largest in the united states have been built up because peoria is in direct water communication with the atlantic seaboard"], [0.13967950642108917, 0.13967950642108917, 0, "the relief proposed by this bill has been in one form or another before this house for the past six years it has been reported favorably and unanimously by the judiciary committee in the fortyseventh congress similarly by the public lands committee in the fortyeighth congress and by the same committee in this congress the history of the grant and the literature connected with it are comprised in this collection of printed matter which i hold in my hand aggregating nearly one thousand printed pages buti hope to be able if i may have the attention of the house to state the substance of it in perhaps ten minutes the prominent features connected with it the essential elements of the case may be as i think concisely stated so they may be comprehended in perhaps a ten minutes statement and i hope gentlemen who may not thoroughly understand me as i proceed will not anticipate me in my statement of it but promising when i shall have concluded itf there is anything i have omitted upon which further statement is desired either by those who do not understand it or any gentlemen who propose to oppose the bill i shall not only not regard it as an interruption but as a favor if the question may be asked me then as appears in the report this grant was made in 1856 to the state of michigan of betweecn four hundred and five hundred thousand acres of land to aid in the construction of a railroad from the southern side of lake superior to the wisconsin state line in the upper peninsula of michigan a railroad system had been devised by gentlemen who proposed to embark in it which contemplated the construction of a line of railroad from chicago north through northern illinois through the state of wisconsin and the upper peninsula of michigan to the shores of lake superior one end at ontonagon on lake superior and the other at marquette the line which is involved in this bill especially is that portion of this system from ontonagon on lake superior southward to the wisconsin state line a distance of 106 miles this grant as i have stated was originally made in 1856 and provided for the construction of the road within ten years from the date of the grant the stateof michigan accepted the grant and under the terms of the act a company was organized in michigan to construct the road and receive the lands from the state this company did nothing whatever with reference to the construction of this line of road not even filing a map of general route or location but a mere skeleton company was organized without the investment of a dollar of capital simply to receive the grant from the state and vest it in this corporation subsequently the grant was conferred upon other companies organized as successors of the first company and without going into the details of these various transfers at this time it is enough to say that in 1859 the chicago and northwestern railroad company was organized and is still a subsisting company these lands were conveyed to that company but in 1862 this plan or scheme which i have alread stated for the construction of this line of railroad from chicago through this interior portion of the country was abandoned and the legislature of michigan petitioned congress to authorize a change of the line of construction of this road so that the old line should be abandoned and a new line run across to the mouth of the menominee river then down the shore of green bay and lake michigan and thence to chicago forming a continuous line between the points named by the new route in july 1862 congress passed a joint resolution which authorized this change of location and permitted the construction of a railroad along the shores of lake michigan to marquette thence across the country to ontonagon instead of the line of road the location of which i have already described and congress in that resolution provided that all the lands previously granted should be restored and a new grant was made in aid of the road thus authorized and in place of the grant which had been made in 1866 for this first road congress also provided that before the lands should be certified by the secretary of the interior for the new line of road that the governor of the state of michigan should certify back to the federal government the lands which had been given by the old act for the construction of this first line of road in 1867 and 1868 the governor of michigan made a certification of the landswhich had been conveyed to the state under the terms of the first grant certifying back as he supposed all of the lands and it was believed by all in the public aervice who had then anything to do with it that all of the lands embraced in the grant to the state of michigan had thus been by the proper authorities of the state government reconveyed to the general government but it turned out that by an erroneous use of terms and by some misdescription of the grant possibly technically a portion of this land had not been reconveyed and so the secretary of the interior refused absolutely to make any certification of lands for the new line of road until the michigan authorities would complete the certification of the lands along the line of the proposed road as originally contemplated from ontonagon to the state line the opinion of the attorneygeneral of the state of michigan was taken with reference to the necessity or propriety of this supplemental action he advised the governor that this certification or supplemental certification should be made the attorneygeneral was mr may and the then governorgovernor baldwinin 1870 made an additional certification of the lands which were not embraced in the first paper making in this subsequent certification what he believed to be and what was then generally believed to beand it is my belief nowthat it was a full certification or reconveyance of the lands originally conveyed under the act of 1856 some lawyers thought differently and the question was raised whetherthat act did reconvey to the general government the lands but the officers of the interior department were satisfied and the land cmbraced in the new grant was certified by the secretary of the interior to the state of michigan for the benefit of the chicago and north western railway company this grant exceeded the number of acres embraced in the first grant by something like fifty thousand that land has been patented to the state of michigan and certified in due form to the railroad company which has been in undisturbed possession of the land grant from that time to now and has disposed of it as if there was no question in reference to it so it will be seen that by this transaction the state of michigan got 50 000 acres more than under the provisions of the first act this so remained until the year 1880 the supreme court had in the mean time promulgated the decision in the case of schulenburg vs harriman holding that all of these grants remained in abeyance until congress affirmatively acted restoring them to the public domain and a few enterprising gentlemen in michigan organized a railroad company known as the ontonagon and brul6 river company and made an application to the board of control in michigan to confer upon it these lands or whatever legal interest the state of michigan might have with reference to the lands of the ontonagon and wisconsin state line company which it was believed and which i believe were properly retransferred or certified to the general government the board of control of michigan assumed to convey the lands to this new company i do not use too strong an expression when i say now and here that from the time of the organization of that corporation down to this hour if there has ever been a step taken by the men composing it which does not indicate that the sole purpose of that organization was to grab these lands from the general government and those who claimed by and under it the fact has escaped the investigation of the committee on the public lands it was organized for speculation not to say legalized robbery and all its efforts have been in that direction it has taken the shape of a barefaced robbery from the first moment of its organization to this time as i am prepared to prove and will satisfy the house in the next fifteen minutes if i may continue to have the attention i am now receiving when this corporation was organized for that purpose this land being in this condition the general government had in good faith sold a large portion of lands within the granted and indemnity limits of the companyover 800 000 acresrealizing more than a million of dollars to the general government which had been paid into the treasury and which remains there today knowing this factit was a matter which was as well understood in the state of michigan as any other matter connected with its historythose who had purchased lands from the government in the belief that they were getting a good title made an outcry against the attempt on the part of the board of control to convey this land to this new company and give it the color of right as against them as purchasers from the united states and a corporation known as the milwaukee lake shore and western which was then engaged bona fide in the building of railroads in that part of the union made this offer to the michigan legislature that they would take this skeleton grant and would recognize the claims of all who had bought from the general government that they would make no claim or assert any right as against the purchasers from the united states that they would take the skeleton of lands which would remain to which no claim attached and build this railroad for that and they made an offer to the board of control and the proper committee of the michigan legislature to deposit 50 000 in cash as a forfeit in the state treasury and put up security to be approved by a committee of the legislature to the amount of 150 000 in advance if the legislature would give them the remnant of the grant and allow them to build the road this was not done but this grant in its entirety upon paper was conveyed to the ontonagon and bru river railroad company in the fall of 1881 they commenced the construction of this road the law provided it should be examined in 20mile sections by commissioners to be appointed and upon the completion and acceptance of any section of 20 miles of road the promoters of the enterprise should have the right to select 20 sections per mile which would be 120 sections of land there for so much within the limits of this grant during that fial and early winter after a fashion they constructed 20 miles of road it was examined by certain commissioners appointed for the purpose and was reported a constructed in a firstclass manner in compliance with the act of congress and the legislation in the state of michigan and was accepted by the state authorities the managers ofthe railroad company then instead of selecting 120 sections of the laud opposite the road which they claimed to have thus constructed abandoned that public land and went down to the southern end of the state to the vicinity of the wisconsin state line 100 miles distant from their constructed section and selected there 120 sections of land every acre of which was land which had been bought from the general government and of every acre of which men were in possession and control under patents and certificates from the general government and upon some of which were very valuable improvements upon other sectionswere iron mines which had been discovered and developed and in the working of which hundreds of thousands of dollarshad been expended in good faith these lands and these only were selected by the promoters of this enterprise and the selections were made by an examination of the books at the local land office to find the description of lands purchased not an acre was selected except of lands which had been sold by the government when this matter was before the judiciary committee in the fortyseventh congress of which committee i had the honor to be a member it was asserted before that committee that this construction was only colorable that there were simply two tracks of iron laid down cheaply and imperfectlyand that was allupon which no trains ran except over a portion of it and only extending 12 miles then it was asserted that grades were made by throwing logs in and casting brush upon them and that then the rails were laid upon that that to make an apparent grade frequently chunks of ice and snow were put and packed under the ties to make them level and all that sort of thing those statements were made to our committee and were verified by affidavits of men who were represented to be reputable but some gentlemen members of the michigan delegation strenuously denied that anything of that kind was true it was asserted on this floor in the presence of myself and other gentlemen members of that congress that there was not a word of truth in any of these statements the next spring after the ice and snow had melted it was demonstrated precisely by observation and was made apparent as to several miles of this road what its condition was it was suggested and by myself that some pictures of the road in its actual condition would be taken as it was intended that that bill should not die even if it was defeated inthat congress so that if the question came up again the condition of the construction of a firstclass lawgrant road might be demonstrated beyond the possibility of doubt photographs were taken which i have in my hand i will give a little description of some of them and will be glad to furnish them for the inspection of any gentlemen who may desire to look at them each photograph i have is verified by the affidavit of the photqgrapher who took it six different views were taken and were placed on the files of the committee on the public lands and there never has been a question raised as to their accuracy and what the facts are since i do not deem it improper to call especial attention to the iniquity of this transaction as bearing upon the question of what this house shall do when the vote shall be taken in order that it may be demonstrated that not a vote will be cast against the measure of justice which is proposed to be meted out by this bill the first photograph which i hold in my hand is a picture of a railroad bridge upon thisline itis humped like a cameland backed like a whale six feet is the difference in altitude between the center of the bridge and one end of it although the whole bridge is only 120 feet in length so that upon this railroad bridge there is a steeper grade than that of any mountainous railroad in this country except the denver and rio grande here is the picture which gentlemen can see for themselves the next is a photograph of a mile of the completed road which was accepted by the commissioners one railroad tie is all that appears upon this entire mile of road a little grading has been done but it has grown up to weeds and as i have said one tie is all that appears on this whole mile of completed road here is a picture of a fill an embankment 420 feet in length thefilling of which is composed of logs and brush and nothing else here isa fill between two hills four hundred and some odd feet in length and the filling is nothing but logs and brush several of these photographs show that after the snow melted the ties which had been spiked to the rails were held in suspension some of them as much as 8 inches above the surface of the ground upon which they were supposed to rest this is an illustration of the devious ways in which the public lands of this country have been plundered by men who have found representatives of their interests upon this floor and in this case who have succeeded for six years in preventing the consideration of this measure there are affidavits in this volume under my hand made by men who were engaged in the construction of this pice of road showing beyond question that the ballasting of the road for several miles was done with nothing but ice and snow preparatory to inspection and acceptance as completed landgrant railroad"], [0.14384645223617554, 0.8561535477638245, 1, "i decline to do so the count

in a controversy with a neighbor is given the right to go into court and have the question at issue investigated and judicially determined this bill does not propose that these questions shall be

testifies how worthily he had discharged the public duties he bad assumed to perform in the most important and honorable stations in the republic his career was an active and an eventful one and the distinction he attained among his fellowmen was the result of honest laborious and welldirected efforts in public service the leading incident of his life may be briefly told born in union county indiana in the year 1831 he passed his youth and school days in the midst of scenes and adventures always associated with the occupation and development of a new country he was perhaps spared some of the privations encountered by many young men in the west by reason of the fact that his parents were able to give him the advantages of a good education before he took his start in life but even under the most lavorable circumstances noyoung man could grow to manhood in the west at that time without having his mettle tested in many ways that young miller went through the usual ordeal with credit to himself is shown by the selfcommand and perfect confidence in himself he displayed in after years when confronted with new and unexpected emergencies he began the study of law at an early age and graduated with distinction in 1852 from the new york state law school thenextyear we find him in california practicing his profession with success at a bar noted for the ability of its lawyers and the wide range of its litigation in 1855 he returned to indiana in consequence of the supposed serious illness of his mother to whom he was greatly devoted her early recovery gave him the opportunity of resuming his professional and business relations in califbrnia but the attractions of his family home and the inducements there offered him were sufficient to prevent his immediate return to the golden state at the breaking out of the rebellion mr miller was a senator in the indiana state legislature where he had achieved an enviable reputation for close attention to official duties and had demonstrated his capacity as a man ofaffairs he thus early in life won public confidence without any of the meretricious devices of the mere politician and gained respect and esteem without any compromise with his dignity or selfrespect his valor and patriotism drew him into the army in 1861 like many of our heroes of that period he exchanged the duties of civil life for the dangers of the field without hesitation the transition was easy and in accord with his active disposition his undaunted courage and his faith in the integrity and perpetuity of the union his military career was one of honorahie distinction from first to last entering the army as colonel of the twentyninth indiana volunteers he attained therank of brevet majorgeneral rendering gallant services in every rank and station to which he was assigned at stone river liberty gap and nashville he was particularly conspicuone as a brave and skillful commander it will not be necessary for me to repeat the incidents of his splendid military service they have been outlined in military orders preserved in the records of his regiment brigade and division and have become a part of the brilliant and enduring history of this great country at the close of the war general miller declined further employment in the army and although suffering irom severe wounds he proceeded to calitbrnia to engage in the active duties of his profession it was at this period that i first met him and the acquaintance then formed soon ripened into a friendship that continued down to the day of his death soon after general miller arrived in california he was appointed junf 19 by president johnson collector of the port of san francisco he held the office for four years discharging its duties with great efficiency and good judgment and gaining the entire confidence of the business community for ten years he was a leading officer of the alaska commercial company a wellknown corporation on the pacific coast the character and policy of this corporation have often been commended officially and otherwise for its just and honorable dealings with the government and its wise and generous treatment of employis general millers association with an enterprise of this reputation shows that in private business as well as in public service he earned the gratitude of good people by furnishing an example worthy of imitation it is also worthy of mention that general miller never neglected his duties as a citizen in all his business relations he was public spirited and generous he was an ardent republican and al ways ready to labor for the success of his party believing in its principles and having faith in the ability of the people to reach reform in the administration of government affairs through party organization in 1879 he was elected a member of the constitutional convention of california and participated in the formation of our present constitution in 1881 he was elected a united states senator by the legislature of california for the term of six years as a senator his services were characterized by great attention to the detail of congressional business in which the people of his state were interested he was in the habit of responding promptly and pleasantly to every demand made upon him for a proper service but with all his kindness of disposition he did not permit himself to be occupied with trifling matters to the exclusion of more important business he was deeply interested in the welfare of his state and looked forward with great anxiety to the time when congressional legislation or other action on the part of the general government would solve some of the difficulties pertaining to our peculiar position on the pacific coast he was eminently a statesman of enlarged views and being well informed on all the leading questions of the day was able to render to his state and the nation most important service his fame as a soldier and a statesman was not the gift of fortune or the chance of reckless adventure but the hardearned reward for faithful devotion to the welfare and glory of his country he grew to commanding position with an adaptability of capacity which always marks the vigor of wellequipped manhood where the social forces are active and aggressive he was perhaps known to but few members of this house but the place he occupied in the affairs of the country was distinctly marked and his influence everywhere felt this house therefore performs its solemn duty on this occasion with the full knowledge that a page in its history is being given to one who achieved renown as the just distinction accorded to heroic and patriotic public services mr emerson in one of his admirable essays discourses on the fact that many men of great figure are known to history by deeds which do not appear to justify their fame we can not he says find the smallest part of the personal weight of washington in the narrative of his exploits and he mentions philip sidney the earl of essex sir walter raleigh and others as men of distinction who accomplished but few deeds worthy of historical mention it is a fact that the character of a man can not be determined by the mere incidents of his life no more than can the mass of the mountain be ascertained by measuring the altitude of its prominent peaks in human nature as elsewhere the magnitude of force and power is not always disclosed by what is seen back of the visible action there may be a mental and moral combination moving with certainty and winning success with apparent ease in grave emergencies a man thus organized has character and he may have genius he conquers because his arrival alters the face of affairs i senator miller possessed this latent power in a remarkable degree and always commanded respect and confidence not so much because of what he said or did but because it was apparent that he could say and do much more if it were necessary the career of senator miller was incomplete the full measure ot his capacity had not been attained he had plans for the future and bad his life been spared his mature judgment and large experience would have been of untold value in the councils of the nation he felt that he could be of service to his country and even when his malady had become dangerous he refused to lay aside his work for needed rest with the restless spirit of the wounded but gallant soldier who hears a summons in the notes of preparation for the coming battle senator miller came from his distant home at the commencement of the present session of congress to engage in the active duties of legislation he knew the angel of death had come very near to him beforeand wondered why he stayed his dart yet quailed not but could meet him so as any lesser friend or foe such serene courage might again dismiss the unwelcome messenger he would not weakly surrender even to the inevitable but the struggle was all in vain the energies of his scarred and overtaxed frame had broken from their natural channels and no human skill could restrain their wasting current the end came and the spirit of a brave man found rest fair life to pulseless silence wed we all remember the

effect without a cause threrefore it would be well for the statesmen of this nation to ask themselves the inestiri what has brought the women from all parts of this nation to the capital at this time the wives andmothers andsisters the homeloving lawabidiig woimei what has been the strong motive that has taken us away fromn the quiet and comfort of our own iomes and brought us beofe you today as ar answer partly to that question i will read an extract from a speech made by one of indianas statesilen aid probably if i tell you his naire ris sentimcnts may have some weight with you he found out by experience aid gave us tile benefit of his experience and it is what we are rapidly learning you can go to meetings you can vote resolutions you can attend great demonstrations oil tile street but after all the only occasion where the american citizen expresses his acts his opinion and his power is at the ballotbox and that little ballot that he drops in there is the written sentiment of the times and it is the power that lie has as a citizen ofthis great republic that is tire reason why we are here that is the reason why we wart to vote we are no seditious voneri clamoring or any peculiar rirghts but we are patient women it is not the woman question that brings ns before you today it is the human question that underlies this iovenent among the women of this nation it is for god and home and native land we love and appreciate our country we value the institutinrs of our coutry we realize that wo owe greatobligatiois to the men of this nation for what they have dno ve realize that to their strength we owe the subjugation of all the material forces of tile universe which give us comfort and luxury inn our homes we realize that to their brains we owe the machinery that gives us leisure for intellectual culture and achievement we realize that it is to their education we owe the opening of our colleges arid the establishinentof our public schools which give us threse great and glorious privileges this movement is the legitimate result of this development of this enlightenment and of the suffering that woman has undergone in the ages past we find ourselves hedged in at every effort we make as mothers for the amelioration of society as philanthropists as christians a short time ago i went before the legislature of indiana with a petition signed by 25 000 women the best women in the state i appeal to the memory ofjudge mcdonald to substantiate the truth of what i say judge mcdonald knows that i am a homeloving lawabiding taxpaying woman of indiana and have been for 50 years when i went before our legislature and found that 100 of the vilest men in our state merely by the possession of the ballot had more influence with the lawmakers of our land than the wives and mothers of the nation it was a revelation that was perfectly startling you must admit that in popular government the ballot is the most potent meansof all moral and social reforms as membersof society as those who are deeply interested in the promotion of good morals of virtue and of the proper protection of men from the consequences of their own vices and of the protection of women too we are deeply interested in all the social problems with which you have grappled so long unsuccessfully we do not intend to depreciate your efforts but you have attempted to do an impossible thing you haveattempted to represent the whole by onehalf and we come to you today for a recognition of the fact that humanity is not a unit that it is a unity and because we are onehalf that go to make up that grand unity we come before you today and ask you to recognize our rights as citizens of this republic we know that many of us lay ourselves liable to contumely and ridicule we have to meet sneers hut we are determined that in the defense of right we will ignore everything but what we feel to be our duty we do not come here as agitators or aimless dissatisfied unhappy women by any means but we come as human beings recognizing our responsibility to god for the advantages that have come to us in the development of the ages we wish to discharge that responsibility faithfully effectually and conscientiously and we can not do it under our form ofgovernment hedged in as we are by the lack of a power which is such a mighty engine in our form of government for every means of work i say to you then we come as onehalf of the great whole there is an essential difference in the sexes mr parkman labored very hard to prove what no one would denythat there is an essential difference in the sexes and it is because of that very differentiation the union of which in home the recognition of which in society brings the greatest happiness the recognition of which in the church brings the greatest power and influence for good and the recognition of which in the government would enable us finally as near as it is possible for humanity to perfect our form of government probably we can never have a perfect form of government but the nearer we approximate to the divine the nearer will we attain to perfection and the divine government recognizes neither caste class sex nor nationality the nearer we approach to that divine ideal the nearerwe will come to realizing our hopes of finally securing at least the most perfect form of human government that it is possible for us to secure i do not wish to trespass upon your time but i have felt that this movement is not understood by a great majority of people they think that we are unhappy that we are dissatisfied that we are restive that is not the case when we look over the statistics of our state and find that 60 per cent of all thecrime is the result of drunkenness when we find that 60 per cent oftheorphan children that fill our pauper homes are the children of drunken parents when we find that after a certain age the daughters of those fathers who were made panpers and drunkards by the approbation and sanction and under the seal of the government go to supply our houses of prostitution and when we find that the sons of these fathers go to fill up our jails and our penitentiaries and that the sober lawabiding men the painstaking economical and many of them widowed wives of this nationhave to pay taxes and bear the expenses incurred by such legislation do you wonder gentlemen that we at least want to try our hand and see what we can do we may not be able to bring about that utopian form of government which we all desire but we can at least make an effort under our form of government the ballot is our right it is just and proper when you debate about the expediency of any matter you have no right to say that it is inexpedient to do right do right and leave the result to god you will have to decide between one of two things either you have no claim under our form of constitution for the privileges which you enjoy or you will have to say that we are neither citizens nor persons realizing this fact and the deep interest that we take in the successful issue of this experiment that humanity is making for selfgovernment and realizing the fact that the ballot never can be given to us under more favorable circumstances and believing that here on this continent is to be wrought out the great problem of mans ability to govern himselfand when i say man i use the word in the generic sensethat humanity here is to work out the great problems of selfgovernment and development and recognizing as i said a few minutes ago that we are onehalf of the great whole we feel that we

can satisfy the house that the president of the united states in compiling this veto message has been misled has made errors of fact that he has beon misinformed and if i satisfy the house of those facts i trust i may have the benefit of the unbiased judgment of every member on this floor i can best argue this matter by a simple statement of the facts connected with the case mr thomas s hopkins the beneficiary under this bill was a soldier in the union army during the late war after coming out of the service he spent thirteen years as a practicing lawyer in the city of washingtonnot in good health bfut still capable of earning his living and unwilling to ask the assistance of the government in his support prior to march 3 1879 he was suddenly stricken down by a cerebral disease whichhas been proved at the pension office th have been the oslt of disabilities contracted by him during his service in the army shortly after he was reduced to the unfortunate condition which i shall by and by describe the bill known as the arrears of pensions act became a law that bill became a law on march 3 1879 and the limitation expired on the 30th june 1880 during that whole period this man was absolutely helpless ire was mentally and physically incapacitated from making an application and this fact is established not merely by the testimony of reputable physicians in the city of washington like dr w w johnston and 1h d frye but by the solemn adjudication of a court which removed him from a position as trustee because he was utterly incapable of exercising the trust which devolved upon him now the object of that arrearsofpension act was to allow to every soldier the interval between the 3d of march 1879 and june 30 1880 to file his application in the office for pension but out of that limitation of time was excepted certain persons those who were entirely incapable of making application the language used being cases of insanity and children under sixteen years of age the case of this applicant was not a technical case of insanity but it was a case where the man by the very injury for which he claims pension was deprived of the ability both physical and mental to make the application in other words he never had his day in court that is the fundamental fact upon which the case turns that fact and that alone covers the whole ground and yet it will surprise the house when i say that it is the one fact of all of nfhich there is no mention whatever in the presidents veto message showing conclusively that the facts of the case were by some error or misinformation on the part of somebody never brought to his cognizance there is another fact stated in this veto message of the president and that fact has had undoubtedly great weight in his mind he states that if this bill passes this man will receive 9 000 as arrears of pension now that is obviously a mistake because it proceeds upon the assumption that he will receive 70 a month from the original date of his disablity up to the present time while the bill itself simply proposes that this man shall be rated according to the rules of the pension office and those rules rate him year by year on the basis of his disability and the case shows that for thirteen years this man was here in washington was a practicing lawyer who was able to earn and did earn his living so that it is manifest the president was mistaken or misinformed by the documents before him and was induced to veto the bill on a statement of fact which really had no foundation now i believe that is the simple statement of the case and
