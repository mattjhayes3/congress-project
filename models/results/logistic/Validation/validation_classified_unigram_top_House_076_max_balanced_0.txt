gentleman from massachusetts he implied that anyone who opposed the repeal of the arms embargo of our existing neutrality law was lined up with the ungodly bloody red communist butchers in moscow for years in and out of congress i have actively opposed and exposed communist activities in america and i have not changed my position as has the gentleman from massachusetts who now favors repealing the arms embargo i have consistently opposed repeal of the arms embargo in the past and now oppose its repeal as provided in the pending bloombaruch creditandcarry war promotion bill which our new deal brethren have disguised in the robes of cashandcarry neutrality our distinguished democratic colleague the gentleman from montana cited the language contained in section 7 subsections a and b under this language foreign nations can prior to the presidents proclamation issue their obligations in america with the sky the limit and refinance them under the provisions of subsection b after the president proclaims that a state of war exists two new deal leaders the gentleman from pennsylvania and the gentleman from new york admitted that under section 7 financial transactions and extension of credit after the presidents proclamation was prohibited insofar as belligerent nations their political subdivisions and agents were concerned but permitted in the case of all persons who are residents of said belligerent nations and their political subdivisions the gentleman from michigan has also pointed out that various government agencies of our federal government could raid the federal treasury and give handouts and credit to belligerent nations engaged in war this is not a cashandcarry measure but a pure unadulterated creditandcarry proposition i oppose this bill because it repeals the arms embargo of our existing neutrality law because it is a creditandcarry proposition and because it gives the president too much authority and power i do not intend to vote our new deal fuehrer in the white house the vast discretionary authority vested under this fake neutrality bill let us look at the first section of the bill which reads that whenever the president or the congress by concurrent resolution shall find that there exists a state of war between foreign states now can we expect our new deal president to find when a state of war exists a bloody war has been raging in china for many months the communist forces of red russia have moved in and taken possession of about half of poland and our new deal president has not been able to find that a state of war exists in china or poland for he has failed to apply the arms embargo to japan and russia as required under our existing law i do not intend to vote any more authority to president roosevelt because i have no confidence in him when we examine the record we find that he repeatedly talks one way and acts another the president promised to cut the cost of government 25 percent and the records indicate he has increased the annual cost of our federal government more than 100 percent for a number of years he has boasted that our existing arms embargo was a great instrument of peace which would help keep america out of war he has aboutfaced again and now demands the embargo repeal in the name of keeping america out of war our new deal president talks one way and acts another he changes his position like the wind he reminds me of the man on the flying trapeze whenever i study the record of our new deal president i am reminded of a speech delivered on january 12 1848 in the house of representatives by abraham lincoln then a representative in congress in referring to the president of the united states abraham lincoln said the president is in nowise satisfied with his own positions first he takes up one and in attempting to argue us into it he argues himself out of it then seizes another and goes through the same process and then confused at being able to think of nothing new he snatches up the old one again which he has some time before cast off his mind taxed beyond its power is running hither and thither like some tortured creature on a burning surface finding no position on which it can settle down and be at ease this pending bloombaruch bill is a pure unadulterated creditandcarry warpromotion measure which our new deal brethren have disguised in robes of cashandcarry neutrality it would repeal the arms munitions and warimplement embargo of our present neutrality law and its enactment would be a long step in the direction of dragging our country into another european war i am opposed to uncle sams financing aiding or abetting wars of foreign nations and supplying them with sinews of war under a cash and carry or any other system foreign governments which are now engaged in war owe our government more than 11 000 000 000 most of which was handed to them during the last world war democratic administration and many billions even after the armistice this report from the secretary of the treasury indicates that on march 1 1939 great britain owed our american taxpayers treasury 5 419 388 374 72 soviet russia owed 385 372 179 65 france owed 4 160 824 820 69 and germany owed 1 251 417 749 70 in view of our national debt which has now passed 41 000 000 000 in addition to many more billions of obligations which uncle sam has guaranteed it is about time that we move to collect the billions of dollars which foreign governments owe us instead of continuing to play santa claus to them in a big way a great democratic president andrew jackson told a foreign debtdefaulting nation to pay its honest debt he sent a message to congress asking for the enactment of legislation to collect a french debt by levying on the assets in the united states of the french government and her nationals france then paid without any further quibbling since our foreign debtor nations have the cash to finance their present and future wars they should use it to pay their honest debts which they owe our country if they do not we should follow the principle enunciated by president jackson and foreclose on their holdings in america and the holdings of their nationals and collect as the new deal has been collecting from distressed american citizens who through no fault of their own are unable to meet their tax home loan farm loan and other payments due our government let us have a moratorium on the new deal foreclosures on the homes and farms of our distressed american farmers and home owners and let the new deal devote its foreclosure and collection energies and activities to collecting the many billions of dollars which foreign nations now owe cur almost bankrupt federal treasury and on which debt they have refused to pay even one penny of the interest i am opposed to giving any president of the united states the vast discretionary authority contained in the pending bill i am particularly opposed to giving such authority to president roosevelt who is a former international banker of wide experience and a member of whose family has recently marrieda member of the warmunitions family of du pont and whose son has been in the business of selling military airplanes to foreign nations history reveals that international bankers and munitions makers promote propagandize and profit by war while the great rank and file of the people pay fight suffer and die when we examine the record we find that president roosevelt is far from being a man of peace as he claimed to be when asking for the enactment of the pending bill his chicago quarantine speech and his loose talk about aiding one side in every way short of war is certainly not peaceful or neutral i cannot vote to give an exinternational banker president the vast discretionary authority as proposed in the pending bill president roosevelt wrote the foreword of the prospectus for the federal international banking corporation and was hooked up in it with robert rowland appleby president of the british empire chamber of commerce in the united states this corporation according to the prospectus which i have in my hand was organized for the selling of foreign bonds and securities to the american people i hold in my hand a photostatic copy of page 31 of the new york times of september 14 1922 in which appears an advertisement of a new issue of 600 000 000 german marks floated by united european investors ltd franklin d roosevelt president this advertisement statesthe companys facilities and connections enable it to secure attractive and sound investments the directors will take advantage of the present money stringency in germany and of the purchasing power of the mark which is far greater than is reflected by exchange quotations i hold here in my hand a photostatic copy of page 1480 of poors register of directors 1929 wherein franklin delano roosevelt is shown as a director of the international germanic trust co i now hold in my hand a photostatic copy of a page from the martindalehubbell law directory of january 1933 volume 1 page 754 showing a legal advertisement of franklin delano roosevelt an investment bankerattorney if we give our exinternational banker new deal president the authority provided in this bill we can expect to find that it is a long step on the road to war i have no more faith in the presidents being sincere in his loud protestations that he desires to keep america out of the new european conflict than i had when he claimed to have driven the money changers from the temple of our government the records conclusively show that he did not drive the money changers from the temple of our government but drove them into it with the help of his secretary of the treasury mr morgenthau the son of an international banker who married the favorite niece of the lehman brothers who are among the most powerful international bankers in america under new deal international policies the interests of our american people are sacrificed for the benefit of internationalists in other lands under the roosevelt new deal goldandsilver policies the international bankers foreign owners of and speculators in gold waxed fat when mr roosevelt forced americans to turn in their gold for 20 67 an ounce or go to jail for 5 years and then imported 10 469 100 000 worth of gold from foreign owners at 35 an ounce according to the treasury department letter of october 26 1939 which i have in my hand in many respects such as being an apostle of peace reducing the cost of government 25 percent and driving the money changers from the temple when we examine the facts and the record of president roosevelt we find like isaac of old the voice is jacobs voice but the hands are the hands of esau i approach the pending bill from an american standpoint i am a nativeborn american citizen and i owe my first allegiance to our american government and our american people i have no personal sympathies for either side of the present european conflict one of my grandparents came from england another came from alsaceloraine and two came from germany i do not want any carping critic to tell me i am pro this or pro that or anti this or anti that the only pro that is in me is proamericanism and i do not apologize for it it was brought out on the floor of the house today that mr goldenweiser a government official indicated that england and france had almost 2 000 000 000 worth of gold and about 7 000 000 000 worth of securities in the united states which they could use for purchases if the pending bill is enacted since england and france on march 1 1939 owed uncle sams almost bankrupt federal treasury a total of 9 580 213 195 41 they should be called upon to pay what they owe us and use the assets mentioned by mr goldenweiser to do so i favor a cashandcarry policy to wit let england and france use those billions which mr goldenweiser says they now have in the united states to repay the billions which they carried away during the last world war in view of our national debt which is now more than 40 000 000 000 in addition to many more billions of obligations which uncle sam has guaranteed is it not time that uncle sam moves to collect the billions of dollars which foreign governments owe him instead of continuing to play santa claus to them as he has under the new deal and as proposed in the pending warpromotion bill which has been dressed up as a neutrality measure since our foreign debtor nations have the cash to finance new wars they should be called upon to use it to repay the billions which they owe our almost bankrupt i federal treasury and which they carried from america during and after their last world war when another democratliberal administration was in power you and i know what a democratliberal isliberal with other peoples money even though the second third fourth and fifth generations have to sweat and toil to produce it uncle sam should make a demand that our foreign debtdefaulting nations pay their honest debts to him if they do not we should follow the advice of andrew jackson that great democratic president and foreclose on their holdings and the holdings of their nationals and collect as the new deal is collecting from distressed american citizens who through no fault of their own are unable to meet their tax homeloan farmloan and other payments due our government let us have a moratorium on the new deal foreclosures on the homes and farms of our distressed american farmers and home owners and let the new deal devote its foreclosurecollection energies and activities to collecting the many billions of dollars which foreign nations owe our almost bankrupt federal treasury and refuse to even pay one penny interest on the new deal would be rendering a splendid service to our country and our countrymen if they would do so our country should not directly or indirectly help either side in the new european conflict some say that we should aid the democracies in every possible manner short of war this war is not a war of democracies it is a war of power politics which we should keep out of france england russia and germany are not democracies the british empire was built on bloody wars of conquest and oppression so was the socalled republic of france only a few years ago the french government was in the control of a communistsocialist coalition under blum and the present premier and dictator of france daladier was the righthand man in the communistsocialist coalition government of blum at that

foreign affairs the gentleman from texas who addressed the house this afternoon a few questions our distinguished colleague admitted that the congress was called into session to consider neutrality legislation notwithstanding this fact the house has been adjourning from day to day and the new deal administration has not seen fit to bring their latest neutrality legislation before the house for full consideration debate and amendment the members of the house have as much responsibility with reference to this legislation as have the members of the senate i believe that in order to expedite action on this highly important and controversial legislation the house should stop adjourning for 3 and 4 days at a time and end these 1 and 2hour sessions when we do convene the new deal administration should make arrangements to bring their bloombaruch creditandcarry warpromotion bill which has been clothed in the robes of neutrality on the floor of the house for consideration discussion amendment and a vote i feel confident that the house will then be able to make a real neutrality bill out of it i particularly wanted to ask our distinguished colleague the gentleman from texas who spoke today what he thought about the recent unneutral warlike utterances promises and pledges of our new deal under secretary of state sumner welles the gentleman from texas correctly stated that the congress of the united states the senate and the house the duly elected representative body of the american people who will have to fight and suffer and die and pay if we are dragged into this new world war in europe was called into session to consider and enact neutrality legislation notwithstanding this fact we observe in the headlines of the papers that our multimillionaire new deal under secretary of state mr sumner welles at an assembly in panama of the representatives of 21 south central and north american nations most of which are ruled by dictators announced alleged neutrality policies for the united states which are in conflict with international law and the existing law of the united states mr welles without authority of law proposed a program of a 300mile neutral zone around the americas put the approval of our country on his proposal and promised that our american navy would patrol the zone mr welles also fails to realize that uncle sams treasury is almost bankrupt in order to obtain support for his proposal mr welles without authority of law promised that uncle sam in addition to patrolling the welles 300mile zone would play santa claus in a big way to these dictatorships most of which now owe and have refused to pay a total of almost 2 000 000 000 to american investors whose hardearned dollars were used to purchase securities issued by these debtdefaulting countries and their political subdivisions mr welles said i am authorized to state that the united states government wishes to cooperate with all other american republics in such efforts of each to develop the resources of its country along sound economic and noncompetitive lines when desired it will assist in making credit available to them through the services and facilities of its privately owned banking system as well as its governmentowned agencies when the latter have funds available for such purposes i yield now for any new deal leader to point out under what provisions of existing law the new deal under secretary of state mr welles has authority to go to panama to a conference of 21 nations most of which are dictatorships and promise that our american navy will patrol a 300mile welles neutral zone around the entire continents of north and south america the canadian seacoast excepted i yield now and pause i hear no reply i now yield for any responsible new deal leader to point out a provision of law under which our multimillionaire swordrattling under secretary of state mr welles has authority to go to panama and promise these 21 nations that uncle sam will open up the doors of the federal treasury and pour millions of dollars out to nations which are now in default to american investors to the extent of almost 2 000 000 000 i yield now and pause for information i hear no reply our multimillionaire new deal under secretary of state is truly a great liberal as most ardent new dealers claim to be yes a great liberalliberal with other peoples money mr welles is not only liberal with public funds which our american taxpayers must sweat and toil to produce but he is also exceedingly liberal when he promises foreign debtdefaulting nations that savings of our american people which are in our privately owned banking system will be handed to them while i am on the floor i want to state that i am going to oppose to my last breath the enactment of the sol bloombarney baruch creditandcarry warpromotion bill which the new deal has clothed in robes of neutrality why is the country told that this bill is a cashandcarry measure when in fact the socalled cashandcarry provision is a creditandcarry one the new deal is certainly not playing fair with the american people in propagandizing their sol bloombarney baruch creditandcarry warpromotion bill as a cashandcarry neutrality program do the members of congress realize that the foreign governments which are now engaged in war owe our government more than 11 000 000 000 most of which was handed to them during the last world war democratic administration yes many billions even after the armistice as one member of this congress i shall continue to oppose uncle sams financing aiding or abetting wars of foreign nations and supplying them with the sinews of war under a cash and carry credit and carry or any other system only a few years ago a number of our foreign debtdefaulting nations were calling uncle sam uncle santa claus and uncle shylock now that they have their hands out again asking for help they would lead us to believe that they think that uncle sam is a grand old man according to the press releases these debtor nations have more assets in the united states than their liabilities to our almostbankrupt federal treasury the new deal handed most of these assets to them do you remember when the new deal forced american citizens to turn in all their gold to the federal treasury on the basis of 20 67 an ounce or go to the jailhouse for 5 years then after our american citizens turned in their gold at 20 67 an ounce the new deal imported from foreign countries over 10 800 000 000 worth of gold at 35 an ounce most of this gold was imported from countries which have refused to even pay one penny interest on the billions of dollars which they owe to uncle sam this new deal handout of many billions of dollars represents a large part of the socalled cash which our foreign debtdefaulting nations intend to use if we furnish them munitions arms implements of war and other war supplies under a cashandcarry or a creditandcarry fake neutrality act our foreign debtdefaulting welshing nations owe our almost bankrupt federal taxpayers treasury billions of dollars the debt defaulters who owe the most cannot find 1 penny to even pay the interest on these debts resulting from their last world war although they have billions of dollars to carry on another conflict which no matter who wins will destroy civilization

act provided an additional 15 000 for each of the several states the purnell act provided a further 60 000 for every state making a total of 90 000 for the experiment stations of the 48 states regardless of size or population or the relative importance of agriculture in the particular states economy none of these acts included hawaii in its provisions in 1928 a special act was passed extending the benefits of the three preceding measures to the territory of hawaii but prescribing that hawaii should receive a specific sum each year increasing in amount until 90 000 per year was reached in other words hawaii was to achieve parity with the several states gradually over a period of years the amount stipulated in the special act for the fiscal year ending june 30 1938 was 60 000 the appropriation bill as approved by the house included this item but the senate reduced it to 50 000 and the bill was passed with the lower figure this meant a loss to the hawaii agricultural experiment station of 10 000 for that fiscal year for the present fiscal year ending june 30 1939 the statutory provision called for an appropriation of 70 000 the department of agriculture submitted this figure in its estimates the bureau of the budget reduced it to 60 000 noting that this provided for the statutory increment of 10 000 of course this is incorrect because the law prescribed no increment but names specific amounts for each fiscal year the house passed the appropriation bill with a further reduction to 50 000 the senate restored it to 60 000 in conference the amount was fixed at 55 000 which meant a loss for the current fiscal year of 15 000 the amount authorized by law for the fiscal year ending june 30 1940 is 80 000 the department of agriculture included this sum in its

wish to call attention to a book civilization against cancer just published written by dr clarence cook little which gives very valuable and uptodate information concerning the fight that is being made against cancer the book tells of the work being done to eradicate cancer by different federal state educational and other organizations that are cooperating dr little points out the progress made in the fight up to this time the great need of additional work and the need of coordination of the work he stresses also the great importance of diagnosing the disease in time my amendment to the cancer institute billand i shall ask very shortly for a hearing on it before the committee on interstate and foreign commerceprovides that 2 300 000 be appropriated in order to further activities to prevent and cure cancer it is generally conceded by the cancer experts that nearly half the deaths that have taken place could have been avoided if the existence of the cancer in these cases had been discovered early and treatment given immediately my amendment would give money to various cancer institutes both public and private all over the country for the prevention of cancer and the treatment of cancer patients the federal grants would be matched by equal amounts from the states i suppose if you talked with the 435 members of the house you would find very few members have not had some relative in their own families at some time who have had the dread disease of cancer or some related disease fortunately today this disease in many instances is not a dread disease not an incurable disease and not a chronic disease taken in its early stages it can be cured today the mortality rate of cancer is second of all the diseases of this country we have done something in the past few years toward the eradication of cancer we can do very much better and i believe it is up to the federal government to do its part we are not groping in the dark on this problem certain kinds of cancer to be sure have proved to be incurable but by operation by deep radio therapy by radium treatments and xray cures are secured education and knowledge are essential in the fight against cancer with a

feel i would be derelict in my duty as a public official if i did not make a humble contribution by way of suggestion for the entertainment and comfort of their royal majesties remembering the kindness their forbears exhibited for centuries to my ancestors in ireland indeed i should be an ingrate if i did not in some way show my gratitude to the reigning rulers of the synthetic british democracy therefore i suggest that the state department officials charged with providing entertainment for the king and queen of great britain seriously consider the following program call upon all the residents in the district of columbia to create as nearly as possible a true london atmosphere for the duration of the visit pennsylvania and constitution avenues should be renamed piccadilly circus and the strand respectively all persons using the telephone during the visit of the royal couple in washington should refrain from using the vulgar american expression hello and substitute the more civilized and practical british salutation are you there instead of greeting each other daily with that horrible what do you know whats doing hows things let us be british and say cheerio and quite right at the state dinners let the conventional evening dress for men be abandoned and red jackets donned and let there be printed on all menus a copy of the declaration of independence as a reminder of the reign of george iii over the american coloniesa reminder that we have not forgotten old wrongs that would reappear should american men and industry be drafted to save britain from its doom perhaps it would be asking too much to even suggest that the royal couple while staying at the white house take a stroll across the street to the treasury building and make at least a down payment on the british war debt of 5 419 388 374 72 which represents principal and interest due poor old uncle sam as of march 1 1939 information has leaked out that the committee in charge of the reception will recommend that certain public buildings be closed during the stay of the royal rulers i sincerely hope that the united states treasury will be included in the list if you know what i mean if the king and queen are anxious to see our bloodthirsty indians show them the modernversion indian before his airconditioned tepee gloating over his agricultural benefit checks should they wish to see our slaves let them go into any business office in the united states and watch our businessmen work night and day under the whip of the tax collectors or they may desire to see the jolly old opposition in america let them see our republicans in a state of suspended animation waiting for the time to turn their own rascals into office at least they should be taken for a short visit to walter reed mount alto and st elizabeths hospitals let them see the woeful wrecks a war to save britain made of american manhood it would be a good thing to dramatize so that americans will let the world know we will never do it again also it might cause the british rulers to realize that a substantial payment on the war debt might help these broken veterans who are still paying for helping britain should they come to the house for a joint session of congress may i respectfully suggest we open with the starspangled banner so that the tune of america may not confuse them as to its sentiment and let us close with the reading of washingtons farewell address it will be a serious occasion when the british rulers lay a wreath on the tomb of the unknown soldier methinks i can hear the shade of that unknown but immortal american boy cry out not to the individuals but to the government they represent because of you i am here as the shadows of evening draw nigh bonfires should be lighted on capitol hill and on the white house grounds lest they forget august 24 1814 when the british burned the capitol and the white house it is regrettable the time of the royal couple is not sufficient to permit their paying a visit to fort knox ky to view our gold pile such a sight would brighten their eyes and make their mouths water as a compensation may i respectfully suggest that the united states marine band after it tires playing rule britannia rule the waves oblige by playing our gold kentucky home let them visit our navy yards and arsenals our military posts and forts so that they may know we do not need britain i trust our colleagues from the historic state of massachusetts will extend to our guests an invitation to visit faneuil hall and bunker hill perhaps they may be able to induce the daughters of the american revolution to give a tea party on the boston commonsi am sure it will not be black tea if this ever takes place our distinguished patriotic colleague mr sol bloom of new york recently in assisting the publicity department of the worlds fair did a fine job in dramatizing washingtons trip from mount vernon to new york city for his first inaugural why not have the gentleman from new york who is so well versed in history arrange another paul revere ride it would take but little effort and expense to have a modern paul revere mount his steed at the international bridge at buffalo n y a week in advance of the arrival of the distinguished guests and journey to washington announcing that warning which has thrilled american schoolboys for years here

me at this time give you some facts as to its background and development nazi propagandists in the united states have learned a lesson their predecessors in the world war used the kind of blunt tactless methods which alienated more americans than were won over to the german side the nazis tried the same tactics here again after they came to power in 1933 it took another world war to teach them that propaganda to be effective must be subtle and that propagandists must stay out of the limelight today having learned their lesson nazi propaganda emissaries are concentrating their efforts in building up an organization known by the innocuoussounding name of the german library of information the library conveniently situated in the same building as the german consulate at 17 battery place new york can hardly be accused of subversive activity inasmuch as it exists according to its officials merely for the purpose of supplying information to americans interested in the course of events in germany in pleasant quiet offices lined with bookshelves and staffed with polite assistants who plit themselves out to make you feel at home the work of the library goes on its unobtrusive way on the surface at least the library is one and the casual student of german affairs may well find it extremely helpful but delving somewhat further beneath the surface of the library you discover why nazi propagandists regard it as their especial pet the nazis have indeed learned how these things are done back in those dim days when experts returning from abroad were telling us there was no possibility of a wareurope just cant afford onenazi agents in the united states were waging a singularly unskillful campaign to win over public opinion their official envoys here made speeches attacking our democratic form of government and openly connived with subversive groups in a typically arrogant fashion which turned the stomachs of selfrespecting americans last year just before the world war ii they had the audacity to plan a national publication in the united states which would be devoted to promoting nazi ideology the notorious oscar c pfaus a leader of the fichte bund the hamburg world propaganda agency was to be publisher the late but unlamented dr anna b sloane a fanatical antisemitic acted as liaison with 12 americans who were to serve as editors after the projected paper flopped and the nazis realized that as the war intensified their job in america was going to be a tough one they decided on a new propaganda method herr goebbels is a scoundrel but no fool an urgent call for oscar pfaus who had fled to hamburg from chicago brought him rushing to berlin for what turned out to be an extremely significant conference on future methods of nazi propaganda in the united states as a matter of fact it is reported that the series of talks were considered important enough for stenographic transcriptions to be given to the fuehrer himself the goebbels propaganda bureau worked out a new line nazi propaganda agents in the united states were instructed to go easy at least publicly as far as the american people were concerned propaganda aimed at them was to be waged on a cultural front in addition to the other fronts used by nazi agents the bund would of course continue its activities though principally among those of german birth but nazi financing and inspiration of native groups was to be conducted in a more subtle manner at the same time it was above all imperative to develop some medium through which to reach the american press and public this medium would have to be a type which could not be readily denounced by critics of nazi germany the german library of information started in 1935 had never received too much support from the fatherland the group apparently was not considered important enough for the nazis to waste money on its support although active the library was merely a comparatively insignificant link in the chain of nazi proiaganda and espionage officials of the library were not too discreet in their relationship with organizations like the bund and similar groups and it would have been simple to show that they were intriguing against democratic institutions in traditionally blunt and cocksure fashion came the war the nazi master minds decided that here was the perfect medium through which their siegfrieds might ravish the brunhild of american democracy the german library of information was granted additional funds expert publicists were assigned to develop it into the formidable propaganda agency which it has become today heinz beller a german newspaperman who had been covering washington for the nazi news agency incidentally using his press contacts to gain information for his superiors was pressed into service beller who is now registered with the government as a foreign agent was appointed director under his tutelage the library ended its semiofficial tieup with the bund and similar grdups and became a highclass organization which acquired the prestige attaching to an information service of a major government beneath the surface the close collaboration of the library with subversive groups in the united states both nazi and nazi inspired was actually intensified but this collaboration was worked through individuals beller knew that to build up a nazi cultural front the library must be fairly safe from accusations of being a direct propaganda agency the library therefore exerted itself in the direction of subtly reaching schools colleges foundations and germanamerican organizations a tremendous collection of books phonograph records lantern slides research material even movies for use in auditoriums and private halls was set up for distribution throughout the united states this material is lent free of charge with speakers if so desired also included the farreaching network of cultural propaganda therefore extends to every city every hamlet in the country the effect of such constant highpressure yet subtle propaganda can only be realized when you know that the nazi government considers the library its most important propaganda agency in the new world beller also instituted a news service known as facts in review which goes to prominent individuals all through the nation a weekly booklet printed on expensive coated paper it is sent to a selected list of something like a quarter of a million people all through america additional names are constantly being sent in by such organizations as the bund the christian front christian mobilizers silver shirts and so forth so that facts in review reaches an everincreasing audience publishing facts in review is now probably the most important venture of the german library of information the facts in question consist of news reports and stories twisted to favor nazi germany and nazi ambitions the booklet therefore serves as the medium for presenting the nazi position in every situation whether here or abroad which arises its editors are clever enough to realize that to influence american readers facts must be reviewed with apparent objectivity in the manner of a newspaper when the booklet is read casually the deliberately conveyed impression is that events have been described in a fair impartial manner not long ago dr mathias schmitz who holds degrees from harvard and heidelberg formerly a professor of art at smith college was appointed director in place of beller no particular significance was attached to the change at the time but it has since been discovered that beller returned to germany in order to report directly to hitler on the state of public opinion in the united states a serious situation exists in the united states today in regard to the german consulate offices and its attaches since the arrival of fritz weidemann in san francisco the propaganda machine within the fifth column activities have been working overtime weidemann well known as hitlers personal attach6 for many years has come here with definite instructions to coordinate all nazi efforts for one great drive throughout the united states his meetings with ambassador dieckhoff hans borchers german consulate in new york with thompson are merely to clarify the technique of operation during the last congressional investigation in 1934 it was proven that the consulate offices of the german government hiding under the cloak of diplomatic immunity were very active in nefarious subversive activities in many instances they paid as was shown in the congressional hearings out of their own pockets disbursements to carry on propaganda work for germany and so today we find the german library of information which is in truth the german consul in new york bombarding the american people with false dogmas and ideologies of national socialism i have in my hand two photostatic copies of an original documentthe original in the hands of the dies committeedefinitely proving and linking the

of her book called a saga of hitler which was never published this letter is signed heinz beller then attached to the german consulate of new york and also head of the german library of information it is quite true that heinz beller appears as a registered foreign agent on the state department records but in reality is an attach6 of the german consulate these conditions exist throughout the country were any americans carrying on such activities they would be apprehended but under the guise of german consular officials their work goes on unhindered it must be stopped and assurance should be given
