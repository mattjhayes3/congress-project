"mr ryan i dont give the president total credit for all of this he couldnt do it by himself you have to have a rubber stamp congress to give you full power full power to be able to take the country down the track it has gone down and the bottom line is that a republican majority from the leadership on down to the newly elected member of the republican conference has to take credit for giving the president the kind of power that he has right now we are fighting wars abroad for democracy when here at home we dont celebrate that very democracy that so many people speak of we have individuals that are on their third and fourth deployment i am on the armed services committee so i get the reports i get the letters from my constituents saying my husband my wife my mother my dad my niece my uncle my nextdoor neighboris on his way back to iraq again abec se we went alone we didnt go with a true coalition so i think it would be hard if i was a part of the republican majority to try to muster up some talking points for the floor right now to be able to say well okay some of this stuff is not believable so lets try to attack some members of the democratic caucus lets try to muster up and embellisha record on possibly being weak on terrorism or being weak on national security thats where the republican majority is now they are gasping for political air right now but you know what is so important about this issue and this discussion about national security is that it is supposed to be nonpolitical and unfortunately it is and that is because the majority hasnt allowed bipartisanship in this house for so many years and so they can hang it around their neck and say it is our war it is our failure as it relates to national security and border security dont act like it is a crisis right now you allowed it to happen under your watch you have been the rubber stamp congress now mr ryan and ms wasserman schultz let me just tell you what the rubber stamp congress has accomplished borrowing 1 05 trillion from foreign nations in 4 years in more than 224 years of this countrys history with 42 presidents 1 01 trillion they were able to borrow in 4 years and this republican congress and the president has allowed that to happen these are the countries here that own a part of the american apple pie japan china the u k the caribbean taiwan germany and opec nations you know this whole oil thing that we will talk about in a minute korea and canada they all have their hands in the pockets of the unitedstates taxpayers not because of the unitedstates taxpayers but because of the republican majoritys outofcontrol spending oil companies oh wow at this time in history when they unearth what happened under this republican majority and this presidency they will see these record breaking profits there was a meeting in the white house i have the article to prove it and i talk about it all time it was a special meeting that took place in the white house and the vice presidents aides and all met and then the policymakers came here to the congress to the rubber stamp congress now let me set this up here because we believe in the 30something working group in thirdparty validators washington post wednesday november 16 2005 white house document shows that executives from big oil companies met with vice president cheneys energy task force in 2001 something long expected by environmentalists but denied as recently as last week by the white house last week industry officials testified before congress document obtained by the post on november 2005 shows that officials from exxon mobil phillips shell oil companies and bp of america met in the white house complex with cheney aides to develop a national energy policy parts of which became law and parts of which are still being debated in congress that was 2001 look what happened 2002 34 billion recordbreaking profits 2003 53 billion 2004 84 billion 2005 113 billion in profits for oil companies meanwhile average americans are spending through the nose and trying to make it to work and to drop their kids off look what happened here this is what happened under the republican majority and a rubber stamp congress so shall it be written and so shall it be done e85 we talk about alternative fuels flex vehicles every magazine i open talks about flex vehicles here is the bottom line the republican congress have allowed these oil companies to be able to do anything they want to do when they want to do it this is an actual pump here at an exxonmobil station it says you cannot use your mobil credit card to buy e85 meanwhile we can continue to feed off the saudi arabian middle east what got us in this thing in the first place policies you can use your oil card there you can buy a bag of chips you can buy a carton cigarettes but e85 that is produced in the midwest versus the middle east you cannot use your mobil credit card for that and on retirement packages and i dont know very much about lee raymond but the bottom line is he is a retired executive from exxonmobil with a 398 million retirement package and a 2 million tax break this is what happens with a republican majority again the republican majority rubber stamp dont worry about balancing the budget democrats we tried to balance the budget we have done it before we have tried to do it under this republican majority not one republican vote to balance the budget on rollcall vote 87 march 17 2005 ranking member spratt and the budget committee put it forth again failed not one republican vote on rollcall vote 91 in 2004 their will and desire is not there the american people deserve balance minimum wage yes there was some bill that came up before we left for the break to talk about minimum wage a bill that the republican majority knew that the senate would not take up and would never make it to the presidents desk but because we were hammering them on it they said lets pass this they added all kinds of stuff it is called the potomac twostep this chart the bottom line is these are not minimum wage increases these are increases for members of congress this is our pay this is what we make oh look at them since 1997 there hasnt been an increase in the minimum wage and you not a minimum wage worker right now and i am not talking to the members of congress i am talking to the american people the bottom line is if the minimum wage goes up and that means if you are a salaried worker then your wages will go up but the bottom line is that it is a fact that the republican congress has said not over our dead body we are going to get our increase but we are not going to give the american people a minimum wage increase it goes on and on and on i am going to close with this the prime minister of iraq and the president of iran mr delahunt brought this picture out last night i dont care whichever way you cut 300 billion of spending over 2 000 troops thousands and thousands of american troops injured here in washington d c stay the course no plan the secretary of defense says if you talk about or say anything about redeployment of troops or withdrawing from iraq you are fired no question from the congress no response from the congress the secretary of defense is not called to the hill immediately the republican congress what are they saying they are saying nothing so accountability is not there they are embracing and guess what this is a la the unitedstates taxpayer through the republican majority because of a lack of diplomacy and a lack of plan and going to a war of choice versus after osama bin laden in afghanistan andgiving those troops in afghanistan the support they need so ms wasserman schultz mr ryan i rest my case the bottom line is that was not a message for democrats or republicans it was not a message for independents or the green party or other party affiliations that is a message for americans the bottom line is whatever you may feel if you are a member of the republican executive committee or you have always voted republican or you always voted independent you have to have issues with what the facts are i yield to ms wasserman schultz"],

day to share with the members what we are doing right and what we are doing wrong so many times we focus on this side of the aisle on the plans that we have here on the democratic side of the aisle inhelping americans to continue to prosper need it be they are in small business or they wake up and go to work every day educating our children making sure that we have a healthy and prosperous and safe america before i get started i know mr ryan will be joining me momentarily i just want to share with the members a few plans that we have on this side of the aisle that we would like to implement the only thing that is stopping us from bringing these plans to the floor and implementing action well we are moving in the right direction with great force is the fact that we are not the majority here to be able to bring these issues to the floor as you know in the past i have talked about energy i encourage members to go to housedemocrats gov to pick up a copy of our energy agenda talking about alternative fuel talking about bringing about flex vehicles in the industry to be able to allow more americans to purchase vehicles that are flex vehicles that they can use e85 and gasoline real security plan it is there dealing with homeland security we have already said on this side of the aisle if we are in the majority that we would irplement all of the 9 11 recommendations to make america safer this is a bipartisan commission as the members know that was appointed and this house was part of it and they did outstanding work those recommendations have still not been fully implemented to protect america we have our initiative that we have been trying to promote for the last 3 to 4 months in a very forceful way which is allowing working americans to be able to earn more money it has been 9 years since the american people have received an increase as it relates to the minimum wage it is very very unfortunate that we have americans that are working for 5 15 an hour the minimum wage has been the same since 1997 which is now approaching 10 years as you know many americans have suffered under the low minimum wage that we have now that is throughout for individuals that are working every day and i have a few facts here of the last 50years i mean this is the lowest it has been in the last 50 years also 6 6 million americans will benefit from an increase in the minimum wage and something that i must add the republican leadership has said that they vow not to raise the minimum wage again this year or next year so i think that is something that the american people need to pay very close attention to threequarters of the minimum wage workers are adults that are over the age of 20 many of whom are responsible for over half of the familys income one day of work it takes an entire days wage for an earner to buy a tank of gas also studies have shown that zero jobs have been lost when the minimum wage has been increased eightysix percent of americans do support an increase in the minimum wage twentyone states have moved in the direction of increasing the minimum wage i do not know what is going on here with the republican majority in not moving in that direction to allow more american people to have money in their pocket to be able to provide for their families we havetalked many times on this floor in the 30something workifg group about the new weight that has been placed on the heads of the american people as they start to send their young people to college li 1730 just yesterday we had a town hall meeting downstairs in this building in hc5 here in the capitol building with some young people who are thirdparty validators with the student loans they have out now and this is very serious because now people are starting to prepare their young people to go off to college in the month of august and late july many of whom are now having to take out these student loans at a very high interest rate they are going to end up paying almost 100 more a month in interest to pay for their college and i think that is something we need to pay very close attention to it is very unfortunate that on the majority side on the republican side all due respect to all the innovation that one tries to come up with on the other side of the aisle it is costing the american people more and it is putting our young people in debt in this country even before they can grab their college degree and earn a living they are already on average somewhere around 25 000 or 30 000 in debt when they step across the stage that is very very unfortunate we cut student aid here we increase student loan rates here the states in turn have to cut and the cost of college is increased it increases on these individuals it is an increase on these individuals i think it is also important mr speaker for us to talk about the fact that we have the will and the desire on this side of the aisle to move america in the right direction i talked about this last week and i think it is very very important to bring this up here again today that we are willing to move this country in the right direction in a new direction making sure that americans have more opportunities i think it is important for us to point out the fact that on this side of the aisle we have committed again to raising the minimum wage we have committed to helping this country become energy independent investing in the midwest versus the middle east within 10 years we have also committed on this side of the aisle i mentioned it earlier to implementing all of the 9 11 recommendations but one of our major commitments on this side and also to the american people is that we have said that we are willing to bring this budget back into balance within a reasonable time not that we are going to cut the deficit in half or we are going to balance the budget but we are going to be able to bring us out of this deficit spending that the republican majority has led us into with record deficits as far as the eye can see we have the resume on our resume we have the accomplishment of being able to do that we have accomplished that before in the past and i think it is something that one needs to pay very close attention to when we say a commitment to making sure our fiscal house is in order it is not a slogan it is not something that someone says well the polls say you need to say you are going to bring spending under control we have actually attempted to do that you have seen this chart before we cant talk about it enough because the facts are in regardless of the floor speeches that may go on on the republican side of the aisle i think it is important for us to outline the fact that we have put our legislation where our mouths are we have said that we want to see this house say that if you are going to spend then spend in a way that almost every american family has to spend if you are going to buy something you have to know how you are going to pay for it you cant put everything on a credit card and what is unfortunate is that we have allowed other countries to be a part of our country financially not because the american people have made a bad decision but it is because the majority and the white house have made some bad decisions here i have a paygo rule that on this side we have adopted that we are willing to pay as we go if you are going to buy it you have to show how you are going to pay for it it is not that you spend or you buy and then you borrow john spratt who is the ranking member on the budget committee on the 2006 budget resolution and this is the congressional record this is not something the 30something working group put together this is rollcall vote 87 march 17 of 2005 republicans voted 228 against this payasyougo amendment that we put forward again mr sprat and the ranking members substitute amendment to house concurrent resolution 393 this is also rollcall vote number 91 march 25 2004 224 republicans voting against payasyougo on a rule we tried to put in place when i say try that is all we can do at this particular point because until democrats are in the majority we are not going to be able to put this country into the fiscal position it should be in once again and i do say once again i pull my chart out this is almost my exhibit a here thirdparty validator and the source that has given us this information happens to be the unitedstates department of the treasury here we show that 42 presidents over 224 years were only able to borrow from foreign nations and this is money that the united states has borrowed from foreign nations in 224 years and 42 presidents 1 01 trillion through world war i world war ii the great depression a number of other conflicts slowdowns in the economy and other issues that have faced this country 42 presidents have only borrowed 1 01 trillion in 4 years 4 years with president bush 1 05 trillion with the republican congress just in 4 years if someone came to me and said kendrick you have to throw all the charts out but one if you just wanted one chart this would be the one that i would pick because i think it reveals what has happened here in this house how it has been so easy for the republican majority to put runaway spending on a credit card and allowed foreign countries to be able to own a part of the american apple pie what is so very very unfortunate here as all of this borrowing has taken place you would think that student loans would have a lower interest rate you would think that alternative fuels would have an opportunity to be a part of the marketplace and that we would be moving towards more cleanerburning fuel you would think that we would have a worldclass health care system and that companies as big as general motors and as small as a momandpop store that has five or six employees in it would be able to provide health care for their employees and you would also think that a number of states would not be suing the federal government because of the underfunding of the leave no child behind with all of the money that has been borrowed from foreign nations but what has happened is that the superwealthy in this country have gotten the biggest tax cut inf the history of the republic what has also happened is that republicans have been allowed to spend in recordbreaking i mean just off the charts for republicans to come down here and blame democrats for spendingi mean really i know it is kind of hard for them to keep eye contact with someone like me and those of us in the 30something group who knows better who know what the facts show that 1 05 trillion has been borrowed from foreign countries they are weakening our country as they start to move and allow these other countries to be able to own so much of the american apple pie and i will close with this before i yield to ms wasserman schultz who came in before mr ryan i think it is important for us to look at it from this standpoint that if you borrow money from someone the relationship has changed i heard someone from the white house say this morning on the today show we are the last standing superpower okay well you must be talking about militarily because financially we are getting weaker every day under this administrations policy and the rubberstamping of this republican congress i think it is important that everyone understands that we have borrowed money from countries that we have never borrowed money from before in a recordbreaking way the republican majority has done so without our help but because they are in the majority that has happened and now they are looking at us under a different light we still have budgets that are being passed here on this floor that is going to even make the american people more indebted to foreign nations some that we have questions of their links to possible terrorism and other questionable measures with that i would like to yield to ms wasserman schultz"],

mr delahunt always takes the opportunity and the privilege to share with us the printed word and it is good to have him here mr ryan will be joining us a little later if i could just take a moment here to let the members know that the great debate took place here on this floor a number of amendments were proposed to make sure that we pass a budget that is just and fair for every american but i must bring to the members attention because i think members do not realize what is happening or if they do realize what is happening i want to make sure that it is in the record that they know we talk about debt a lot in our 30 something working group and talking about debt and doing something about debt are two different things the republican majority continues to spend in a recordbreaking way that is bankrupting this country and changing the philosophy of this country which is payasyougo democrats we are the only party in this house that can say that we balanced the budget we have actually done it we have actually had surpluses as far as the eye can see republicans can only talk about well we would like to cut it in half and we would like to cut it back a quarter or what have you but i just want to make sure that folks understand that there was an article written on tuesday of this week entitled another possible bump to the debt ceiling 2 7 trillion budget plan pending before the house would raise the federal debt ceiling by nearly 10 trillion less than 2 months after the congress last raised the federal debt borrowing limit the provision is buried on page 121 of a 151page blueprint it serves as the backdrop for congressional action this week i think it is important and i usually have my letters here from the secretary of the treasury but i think it is important that the american people and the members of this house understand that what they are doing to this country recordbreaking debt i just want to make sure before we start off and then i am going to be kind of quiet here tonight because i know that we have a lot to share it is almost too much to share but i just want to share this with the members one more time we are talking about who are we borrowing from we are borrowing from japan at 682 8 billion china 249 8 billion the uk 223 2 billion the caribbean 115 3 billion taiwan 71 3 billion opec nations including saudi arabia and a number of nations that we have issues with 67 8 billion germany 65 7 billion korea 66 5 billion canada 53 8 billion and climbing if we do not stop this republican majority from continuing to raise this debt ceiling and burying it within the federal budget on what they believe their members have to vote for and this budget vote has been postponed and postponed and postponed not because the republican majority did not have time to deal with it they just did not want to do to their constituents what the majority wants them to do as long as we are here and we have breath in our bodies we are going to share with the members of this house that we will not allow this to be a back room with the lights off in the middle of the night proposition for the american people that they do not have any choices in but the special interests do i just in closing again history making this is not the kendrick meek report debbie wasserman schultz bill delahunt or tim ryan report this is facts not fiction the unitedstates

1 trillion to 2 1 trillion meaning that this administration has already accrued more foreign debt than the previous 42 presidents combined let me repeat that this president and this republicanled congress has borrowed more money from foreign central banks and foreign investors than the previous 42 presidents combined as you can see here in 2001 the amount of money borrowed from foreign central banks and from foreign investors was 988 billion that was troubling enough in 2006 we are up to 2 66 trillion that has been borrowed from foreigners unlike deficits in earlier years current deficits have been primarily financed by foreign investors with the rise in foreignheld debt equaling threefourths the increase in publiclyheld debt since the start of the current administration in 2001 this rise in foreignheld debt is troubling because it makes our econormy beholden to foreign creditors and represents another financial burden passed on to future generations foreignheld debt is fundamentally different from domesticallyheld debt since the interest payments on foreignheld debt flow outside the united states of america and reduce americans standard of living the cost of servicing foreignheld debt is high local state and federal government interest rates to foreign investors totaled 114 billion in 2005 an amount that will grow rapidly if the treasury continues to sell

in america i salute him for his excellent presentation today today the house is considering the ultimate values debate the question bafore us today is do we want to cut taxes for the ultrasuperrich or instead do we first want to give hardworking americans a raise do we want to live in an aristocracy or do we want to live in a democracy do we want to perpetuate wealth or reward work the estate tax is central to our democracy it is rooted in our commitment to create a strong and vibrant middle class and to give every american the opportunity to achieve the american dream after the gilded age in which the elites of the time held power and wealth that far far far outstripped what the average american had america decided to go in a new direction one of americas great republican presidents theodore roosevelt made the argument for an estate tax saying that the really big fortune the swollen fortune by the mere fact of its size acquires qualities which differentiate it in its kind as well as its degree from what is possessed by men of relatively small means therefore president theodore roosevelt said i believe in a graduated tax on big fortunes properly safeguarded against evasion democrats believe that we must create wealth we recognize that that we must reward entrepreneurship and risk and we must encourage hard work that is why democrats supported a targeted estate tax relief for small businesses and farmers and fami lies that would ensure 99 7 percent of all americans dont pay any estate tax this is in the spirit of theodore roosevelt targeting the vast fortunes that differ not only in the quantity of wealth but in the kind i salute congressman earl pomeroy for his leadership in giving congress an alternative that is morally and fiscally responsible unfortunately once again the republican leadership just as they have blocked a vote on the minimum wage are blocking mr pomeroys option to bring his proposal to the floor which is responsible which is paid for and which is fair to all americans under mr pomeroys proposal only the top 3 percent that means 99 7 percent of americans most people in america would not pay any estate tax but it would leave that 3 percent the very very superwealthy to pay their fair share there are very few people involved but a great deal of money we will have a chance to vote on it in the motion to recommit unfortunately we will not have the time to debate it as an alternative we have these questions that have come before us when we are talking about this we are talking about giving 800 billion to a few families in america democrats stand for fiscal responsibility payasyougo budgets and no new deficit spending republicans instead have put forth the bill that will cost the american people again almost 800 billion 800 billion that we dont have that we are going to have to borrow our national debt is becoming a national security issue countries that now own our debt it is over 1 trillion already and this doesnt include this 800 billion those countries that now own our debt will not only be making our toys our clothes and our computers they will be soon making our foreign policy they have too much leverage over us with this bill today the republicans are giving tax cuts to the wealthy and asking the middle class to pay for it by writing checks to china and japan for the interest payments on the debt and ultimately the payment on principal it isridiculous it is ridiculous let me get this straight we are at war in iraq many of the same people who wanted to support the staythecourse that the president is on in iraq which has around a 400 billion price tag on it that is off budget they dont want to pay for that and that is a huge figure and now the republicans are saying not only that not only are we not paying for the war it is off budget we will just heap that debt on to future generations they are saying we are going to give twice as much as that to a few families in america it is so unfair this same week that we are taking this up as i said earlier this is the ultimate values debate how can a person of conscience say to the congress we do not support an increase in the minimum wage instead we are going to give 800 billion to the wealthiest people in america the minimum wage is 5 15 an hour it hasnt been raised in 9 years this is a shame it is a disgrace it is unfair and what does the leader on the republican side say about the minimum wage mr boehner says i have been in this business for 25 years and i have never voted for an increase in the minimum wage i am opposed to it and i think the vast majority of the republican conference is opposed to it so thank you mr boehner for making a differentiation for us you are for 800 billion for the wealthiest families in america and not an increase of over 5 15 an hour for americas working families so instead of giving 7 millionamericans a raise by increasing the minimum wage again the republicans are proposing 800 billion that is nearly 1 trillion as a gift to the wealthy this is robin hood in reverse we are stealing from the middle class to give to the wealthy pope benedict just recently put out his new encyclical god is love and in his encyclical he quoted saint augustine when he wrote this is in the popes encyclical you can find it there he talked about the role that politicians have and that a government should be just and we should be promoting justice and he goes on pope benedict does to quote saint augustine he says a state that is not governed according to justice would be just a bunch of thieves this is the pope saying this in an encyclical quoting a saint a state which is not governed according to justice would be just a bunch of thieves i ask this congress is it justice to steal from the middle class to give tax cuts to the ultrasuperrich it is not just and it is an injustice we cannot afford americans can no longer afford president bush and the republicans it is time for a new direction we can begin by rejecting this estate tax giveaway to the wealthy and insist on a vote to increase the minimum wage that would be a real values judgment"], [0.00011909008026123047,

cutting the cost of college cost as you know the cost to go to college has gone up this republicanled congress last not helped in that area they have not helped the everyday average american to be able to meet the increases that they have been asked to pay and also in a new direction for america is making sure that we follow through with fiscal responsibility pay as we go not just on a credit card not just saying because we can give tax cuts to millionaires and we will just puv it off on future generations or we will go to foreign nations and borrow a record number of dollars these nations that i am holding up here they own a part of the american apple pie not because of what the american people have done it is what the republican congress has done and allow these countries to buy our debt because we are not fiscally responsible i think it is also important to make sure that we encourage working families people that are making minimum wage i just want to make this point then i am going to give it to my friend mr ryan from youngstown ohio as you know we have had time after time again three or four occasions in the 109th congress that we have asked the republican majority to join us in raising the minimum wage to make sure that the american workers are able to keep up with the costs of not only living but inflation but it has been well said and mr ryan will point it out with his chart that he has there in a moment that the republican congress is in no way and in no shape ready to give minimum wage workers an increase since 1997 they have not had an increase but here in the 30something working group we actuallytake time to find out the facts because we want to make sure that we are not telling the american people nor members of this house something that is inaccurate i must say that in 1998 members of congress received 3 100 in a pay increase and we are not minimumwage workers in 1998 minimum wage workers zero mr ryan in 2000 members of congress received a pay increase of 4 600 guess what same year minimumwage workers zero 2001 members of congress received 3 800 minimumwage workers zero in 2002 members of congress received another pay

the status quo of the situation and the landscape that the american people are fa6ed with today with a budget that is squarely not responsive nor responsible to the needs of the american people with

in the area dealing with one of the most precious responsibilities we have which is determining and being responsible for how we spend the taxpayers money for this administration in the last 5 years to have squandered a surplus the facts are there they are plain as one can see when the clinton administration left office there was a surplus of billions and billions of dollars and now in this last year the deficit has been shot up over 4 trillion there is a reckoning for that and i am here to tell you that as a member of congress the american people are looking for members of congress to stand up for them and to do what it is we need to do that we were elected to do it is congress that is charged with the responsibility of oversight it is congress whose decision it is by the constitution to

dollars into humanitarian relief for sudan but never bothered to effectively engage in a highlevel effort to resolve the conflict until 2001 when president bush appointed senator john danforth to serve as a special envoy to sudan with senator danforths leadership the comprehensive peace agreement for sudan was signed in january of 2005 presenting a historic opportunity for peace economic development and democratic aspirations in southern sudan unfortunately implementation of the peace agreement has been slow and many difficult challenges lie ahead while the international community

than 2 million others have been forced from their homes once again the unitedstates government provided millions of dollars to meet the immediate humanitarian needs of those most affected by the conflict including more than 150 million to support the deployment and operations of the african union peacekeepers in darfur this time however the unitedstates immediately engaged at the highest levels to seek a resolution to the conflict two years of intense negotiations with significant engagement by president bush himself finally yielded a peace agreement between the government of sudan and the largest rebel faction in darfur the sla in may of this year unfortunately the agreement has not held and the sudanese government has launched military operations against its own civilian population in darfur the united states has significant human rights and security interests at stake in sudan recall that in 1996 the sudanese government made osama bin laden available to american law enforcement officials a point that salah gosh reiterated to me with a great deal of sarcasm when i met with him 14 months ago in khartoum that offer as we know was refused we cannotafford to repeat

authored by our good friend and colleague chairman frank wolf h res 992 strongly supports the appointment of the special envoy for sudan and suggests a roadmap for the formation of a comprehensive

peace agreement and the comprehensive peace agreement the mandate should also include helping to secure a just and equitable peace in eastern sudan supporting reconstruction efforts and the return of displaced persons to the darfur and southern sudan and addressing the inextricably linked conflict in northern uganda in essence what will be the special envoys responsibility to ensure that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past by focusing solely on the crisis in darfur at the expense of solidifying the northsouth peace accord and resolving the conflict in the east by allowing the potential for peace in southern sudan to blind us to the grave human rights tragedies continuing to unfold in darfur and by allowing the government of sudans reported cooperation in the war on terror to outweigh human rights concerns in the region they must be paramount and also to allow those same human rights concerns to compromise our ability to protect our own citizens again this is a good

reviewed and then a decision is made the problem with the present process is this when the contractor wins the competition the employees do not have a right of appeal if they wish to dispute the finding on the other hand if the employees win the competition the contractor does have the right of appeal we think that this is an unfair and unfortunate policy the purpose of our amendment is to suspend the a76 process in the departments covered by this bill until there can be reform and improvement of that process i wanted to especially thank and commend my friend the gentleman from north carolina who is the cosponsor of this amendment and who has worked very diligently and very intensely on this matter he has a scheduling conflict at this moment but has worked very hard on this and i

as any hmo system in this country in which every detainee gets four checkups on average per month we have had over 24 000 interrogations in guantanamo and here are the facts people have talked about the use of dogs the fact that dogs have been present at guantanamo at various times especially with the 20th hijacker mr al kahtani who was subject to the most stressful type of interrogation there is not one recorded instance in any investigation of a dog biting a prisoner there are only a couple of recorded instances of a prisoner being struck by a guard and the one time when a guard struck a

gentleman for yielding to me an additional minute to follow up i support very strongly the vel6zquez amendment and i am glad that the chairman and the majority support it as well it is very important but as i look at the bill i find an issue that will take a higher precedence than the problem of the backlog in terms of our constituents and in terms of our congressional offices and i think will put that far in the background in terms of things that most bother them because under the alien smuggling and related offenses provision of the bill that we will be asked to vote on anyone who assists encourages directs or induces a person to reside in or to attempt to reside in or remain in the united states knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that such person is an alien who lacks lawful authority to reside or remain in the united states is subject to penalties of up to 5 years in jail if it is not for commercial purposes if it is for commercial purposes understandably it would be tougher sentences so when a person calls my district office and talks to my congressional staff and says i was here on a temporary visa the date passed i have an immigration petition pending is there anything i can do if my office assists that person or suggests that person go see a lawyer and perhaps if my assistant does not call the department of homeland security and tell them to pick that person up my staffer potentially is subject to criminal penalties congressional staff do not have congressional immunity that means i am going to have to do all the casework in my district office i

very gratified to know the strong support for reauthorization of the voting rights act and appreciate your leadership on this important issue the importance and necessity of the voting rights act cannot be overemphasized we have learned through experience what a difference the vote makes to us in 1964 the year before president johnson signed the act into law there were only 300 african american elected officials in the entire country today there are more than 9 100 black elected officials including 43 members of congress let me be clear expanding the opportunity to vote in america goes far beyond simply ensuring that minority voters have a voice or that african american politicians get elected the voting rights act has enhanced the lives of all americans not just black americans not just minorities by opening up the political process the voting rights act has made available a broader pool of political talent greatly improving the quality of representation for all voters just as important the voting rights act has been instrumental in moving america closer to its true promise and thus has significantly benefited every single american regardless of their race economic status national origin or political party ive heard it suggested that the voting rights actsor certain key provisionsneed not be reauthorized because its very success has rendered it obsolete this is a fallacyand i urge you in the strongest possible terms not to fall for it the voting rights act must be reauthorized because it works african americans in the south were prevented from voting by a battery of tacticspoll taxes literacy tests that were for blacks only and the crudest forms of intimidation from the southwest to some urban areas in the northeast and midwest latinos were discourage from voting by subtler but also effective techniques that exploited the vulnerabilities of lowincome newcomers for whom english was a second language both groups were also the targets of districting designed to dilute their ability to elect officials of their own choosinga fundamental freedom that all too many americans take for granted that is why it is so important that the congress renew all three provisions that are set to expire section 5 which requires a federal approval for proposed changes in voting or election procedures in areas with a history of discrimination section 203 which requires some jurisdictions to provide assistance in other languages to voters who are not literate or fluent in english and the portions of section 69 of the act which authorize the federal government to send federal election examiners and observers to certain jurisdictions covered by section 5 where there is evidence of attempts to intimidate minority voters at the polls i am gratified
