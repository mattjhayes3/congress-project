empty treasury and a discreditable public service the country was like a drunkard after a long debauch on march 4 mr cleveland suddenly checked this condition and as withholding stimulant from the slave to drink is followed by lassitude so a somewhat similar effect followed the halt called by mr cleveland in the practices which had characterized the administration of affairs since he left the helm of state on march 4 1889 mr cleveland found 117 927 395of net gold in the treasury in march 1885 and in four years of democratic silvercoinage administration we increased the net gold in the treasury to 218 818 253 which mr cleveland turned over to president harrison on march 4 1889 and when mi cleveland relieved president harrison in march 1893 he found the net gold was only 103 284 219 under a silvercoinage democratic administration gold steadily flowed to our country and under the republican silverdemonetizing administration which succeeded the tide was turned and gold flowed from our country to the four corners of the earth mr cleveland left a balance of profitable trade in our favor and he found after four years of republican rule the balance of trade and the tide of prosperity turned fearfully against us he left a tariff which taxed the people 47 per cent and he found one which increased the tax to an average of 60 per cent and a tax of 120 per cent on the necessaries of life which the wage worker is compelled to buy he left a country in the boom of prosperity the result of his wise administration from 1885 to 1889 and in 1893 after four years of republican rule he found it in poverty and distress shrinking commerce falling prices reduced revenues and paralyzed industries before mr cleveland had fairly taken the reins of government the republican party commenced the exercise of all its power to attribute the existing evils to mr cleveland and his administration this was the battle cry in the campaign of 1894 and they promised if intrusted with the control of congress that every evil would be remedied prosperity restored and the country again made happy under this pledge the people gave them a majority of 150 in the house anda decided plurality in the senate the question before the american people is has that promise been redeemed i reply that the history of the world does not show another instance of such utter disregard of the promises by virtue of which a party was intrusted with position and power you have not the poor threadbare excuse that you were obstructed in your efforts by filibustering democrats because no such action in a single instance has been even attempted you can not say that as tle session advanced your wisdom adnionished you that itwould not be sagacious to comply with your pledges to the people because the first utterance of your great our distinguished trusted and worshiped leader announced that nothing would be done and this was certainly an announcement and a confession that all of thepromises made by the republican party would be violated in his inaugural address when congress convened in his first utterance as to the proposed republican policy speaker reed said if we do something which for the moment seems inadequate it may be that time which has justified itself of us on many occasions may do so again this expression was understood to mean that nonaction on the part of a majority of this house would be approved by the people and this was corroborated by the following expression which was widely published as hisutterance if we received the applause of the country for what we did in the fiftyfirst congress we may receive applause for what we do not do in this congress i hold in my hand a newspaper account of the republican caucus of april 11 it seems very clear from its statements that the republicans were quite unanimous in their determination not to allow the enactment of any general legislation the newspaper account says speaker reed was not present but mr dinoley spoke outlining the views upon general legislation held by the leaders of the house the account then says thegeneral tendency of his dinglnys advice was that the republicans should use every endeavor to bring about an early adjournment of congress to adjourn if possible within a month as soon as the appropriation bills could be passed by both houses this shows that the first day the house met your greatest leader announced that the policy of the republican party was not to enact legislation it shows that prior to april 11 the republican leaders had determined upon an early adjournment to adjourn as soon as the appropriation bills could be passed and that determination on the part of the leaders has been repeatedly manifested and not a semblance of honest effort has been made to enact legislation for the benefit of the people is not this policy the grossest violation of the pledges made by the republicans to the people in the election two years ago with no legislation accomplished for the benefit of the people with bills introduced and pending which should be considered by the house and which would give relief to the people the great republican majority propose to abandon their post to fly from their duty and to escape in this way the just responsibility which rests upon their heads is not this action like that of soldiers who fly from the field of battle is it not like sentinels guarding important trusts abandoning their duty in my opinion not a single honest effort has been made by the republican majority to relieve the people from the thraldom under which they are suffering instead of reducing taxes you have used your best efforts to raise them every measure you have presented to the house upon this question has been to raise taxation and sorely add to the peoples burdens i read from the scriptures the fate of the raiser of taxes i find in daniel xi 20 thatthen shall stand upin his estate a raiser of taxes but within a few days he shall be destroyed that will be the fate of a party who desert their posts and are false to the people they will receive the execration of the people as a soldier who runs from battle or a sentinel who leaves the post at which he has been placed intrusted with the honor and defense of the people i hope that every member of this house who loves the people who feels the responsibility of his obligation who feels that his pledges are to be kept will when this question is brought up vote no and pledge himself to stay here until congress has legislated for the people it has been suggested that some efforts have been made by the republican majority toward relief legislation it is true that on december 26 the premier of the house mr dingley thrust a tariff bill upon us i hold the bill in myhands it was dated december 26 it was introduced and printed that day and as i said in my speech while the ink was still wet its consideration was forced upon the house and it was crammed down the throats of the subservient followers of the proud leader whose friends delight in giving him the appellation the american czarthe imperial captaingeneral of the republican party this unwise measure sought to exact and collect burdensome taxes from the people in the face of the report of the secretary of the treasury that he already had i read from page 53 a balance of 177 406 388 62 in the treasury and that there wasno reason to doubt the ability of the government to discharge all its current obligations during the present fiscal year and have a large cash balance at its close without imposing additional taxation in any form upon the people mr carlisle also told you in his report page 52 that while the kind of bill you proposed would place unnecessary burdens upon the people the probable tendency of such a bill would be to paralyze industries and decrease rather than increase revenues he said the revenue derived from customs during the fiscal year 1895 exceeded the revenue derived from the same source in 1894 by the sum of 20 340 086 83 now as the principal items of the wilson bill went into operation january 1 1895 we see by these figures that the lowtariff wilson bill gave more revenue than the hightariff mckinley bill unwise impolitic and umnecessary as was any measure of this characi er it was exceeded by the unwisdom and impolicy of its proposed methods and provisions 1 the largest increase of tax was on many articles which are of necessity used by laboring people 2 the bill was a horizontal bill a kind of bill which presidential candidate mr mckinley said wasa confession upon its face of absolute incapacity to grapple with the great subject he also said it gives no evidences of the experts skill it is the invention of indolence he repeats it is not only the invention of indolence but it is the mechanism of a botch workman for two years the republican party have vehemently denounced the wise democratic tariff bill which was enacted by the last congress and in asking for votes at the last congressional election they solemnly pledged that if placed in power they would immediately enact tariff legislation of the most approved character the people gave them 150 majority and they now propose to adjourn without any further fulfillment of their pledges and promises than the attempted enactment of a measure which their leading presidential candidate denounces asthe mechanism of a botch workmanthe invention of indolence another evil feature of this bill was the badly concealed and finally admitted purpose to enable and finally compel the secretary of the treasury to use the money thus collected from the people to pay running expenses and withhold and hoard all treasury notes and thus fearfully contract the volume of money and still further cripple enterprises which employ labor and encourage progress and prosperity if this had been accomplished you would no doubt have held mr clevelands administration responsible for the distress which of necessity would have followed and thus seek to add to the chances of a republican victory in the coming election the exposure of the bills fearful infirmities and deformities by the little band of democrats sent the measure limping on crutches to the other side of the capitol where it was promptly disposed of by the senators without regard to party affiliations the leader in the assault and the first to thrust his javelin into its bleeding breast was the distinguished field marshal of the republican hostsits greatest leader the chairman of the executive committee of that organization on december 27 in the same way you forced through the house what was called a currency bill the atrocities of which were so fully exposed by the few tried and true democrats who remain in this body that like the tariff bill it dragged its limping form to the senate chamber where amidst its dying groans that body by a decided majority transformed it into a silvercoinage bill and in that condition sent

the government has entered that he is refusing to appropriate money that must be appropriated next year that he is merely postponing not defeating this appropriation now i know that this is a presidential year and i know that stump doctrine has much to do with presidential years and that this is mere stump doctrine but i do insist that it ought not to be sufficiently potent to justify the violation evasion or postponement of solemn contracts entered into and work honestly done sir what has been the custom of the government in the past the appropriation bills have been such that at the end of each session of congress we could foot up the appropriations made and know what the expenditures had been but here my distinguished friend from illinois has fallen upon a new method by which no man in america by footing up these appropriations can tell what the expenditures of this congress have been for he postpones the appropriations till future years and will confuse the people thereby now i do not propose to make any argument against the contract system wherever it proves itself more economical it is well to adopt it but i do insist that when a contract has been entered into the people should know the amount that that contract is costing every year and there ought not to be a postponement of appropriations or amount of expenditures until after the election if it is done let the people know beforehand how much has been postponed let them know beforehand for what purpose the postponement has been made does the gentleman from illinois insist that this appropriation is not needed far from it he admits that it is needed does he claim that it can be avoided on the contrary suits could be brought on the completion and payment forced and yet he says we will not make the appropriation because we are to come back here next winter and while he does not say so we all know that the election being over the bridle can be taken off and the horse whipped down the same old track to the same destructive terminus now the action of the last congress is not to be taken justly as a precedent for what is proposed here what were the continuing appropriations asked for in the first regular session of the last congress i do not say the first session because the first session was an extraordinary one in the first regular session for this work the appropriations demanded amounted to 8 300 000 the sum of 8 400 000 was given at the second session the sum of 11 387 000 was demanded by the estimates and 11 547 000 was given where work was shown to be necessarilymore expensive than expected the appropriation was made but here we propose to avoid appropriating the money to reduce the showing that is to be made for campaign purposes and i doubt not as candid as my friend from illinois is that he when he comes to make up the estimates of the appropriations made by this congress will be figuring it to the credit of the party that he represents and leaving out these items my friend from texas has commented on the fact that certain appropriations have already been shifted from this bill to a general deficiency bill i insist that that was unjust in addition to what he has stated i will point out one or two he has already shown to you wherein 400 000 that was not legitimately charged upon the deficiency bill because no law authorized it has already been appropriated for in a general deficiency bill for the completion of the library building although it can not be expended in this year by that method it can be charged to the last congress instead of this again there is an appropriation of 300 000 for the printing of the agricultural report that legitimately goes upon the next appropriation bill and does not belong as a charge upon the last congress and yet that has been saddled upon the last congress that has been charged to the democratic administration instead of this house what is the necessity for this legislation why not boldly come up and tell the people what the last congress cost the country and what this house is costing it but these are not all there was in that urgent deficiency bill an appropriation of 16 000 for the purpose of purchasing a building in japan not authorized by law not contemplated by law and hence it can not be a deficiency it was an original appropriation and although it is made in this congress it is charged as a deficiency of the last congress by an increase for the navyyard at brooklyn also not chargeable to the last congress 50 000 is heaped up against the appropriations of that congress as a deficiency when it is not a deficiency fifty thousand dellars more in the same way for the increase of the navy all of these items amounting to 898 000 have been put upon a deficiency bill when they should have been appropriated for on this bill or on the other regular appropriation bills of this congress now i was not content that this method of legislation should be entered upon without its being known how it came and to whose charge these expenditures properly belong let us go on as we have in the past let us make our appropriations for each fiscal year let us make them in such a

150 special examiners at an expenditure of 195 000 in other words the congress of the united states gave in its appropriations for examination by special detailed examiners of the pension bureau which had immediately and specifically in charge the investigation of pension frauds more than was asked for by the pension bureau of the department of the interior i take the reports for the three full years of the administration of the pension bureau under the present administration of president cleveland desiring the house to bear in mind the serious charge contained in this message to which i have referred as it came to the second session of the fiftythird congress and will quote briefly from them in 1894 the first full year i find this convictions had 194 sentences imposed 120 in 1895 convictions had 294 sentences imposed 214 in 1896 convictions had 167 sentences imposed 160 that is the record of the investigations of the pension bureau pertaining to these conspiracies alleged and

distinguished friend from texas r sayers and my equally distinguished friend from missouri m dockery disclaim any intent to make a partisan criticism ea sorry that in their remarks they were not entirely consistent with their declaration of intentions this matter of great appropriations of the public money is not and should not be made a partisan matter no party has a monopoly of economy and no party has a monopoly of extravagance recent history does not indicate that the republican party is especially chargeable with culpability in increasing the public expenditures the fiftyfirst congress was republican in both branches and xxix114 held office at the same time with a republican president mr harrison it was that congress which was first called a billiondollar congress an epithet that was intended to convey a general accusation of extravagance the epithet was in fact not literally deserved as the official figures show that the appropriations of the fiftyfirst congress amounted to only 988 417 183 34 the next or fiftysecond congress was composed of a house having more than a twothirds democratic majority and a senate barely controlled by the republicans it passed appropriations amounting to over a billion dollars or to be exact 1 027 104 547 92 the fiftythird congress was democratic in both branches with a democratic executive mr cleveland the total appropriations were 989 239 205 69 the present or fiftyfourth congress is composed of a republican house and a senate having a majority of democrats and populists there being a democratic president its total appropriations will iregret to say amount to much more than a billion dollars perhaps to as much as 1 045 000 000 a material part of the excess over a billion dollars is due to the increase of the sinkingfund requirements occasioned by the increase of the public debt within the past three years during which time additional government bonds have been sold to the extent of 262 000 000 entailing an additional interest charge of 11 500 000 per annum and annual payments upon th principal to the amount of 1 per cent of the new loan or about 2 620 000 an increase for interest and sinkingfund obligations of over 14 000 000 on that account the river and harbor bill passed at the last session of the present congresspassed by the votes of democrats as well as republicansappropriated directly nearly 13 000 000 for that class of work and authorized the secretary of war to make contracts for the completion of works most of which were already in progress to an aggregate of about 59 000 000 payments to fall due at the rate of 25 per cent per annum for four years the sundry civil bill now before the house includes more than 15 000 000 of appropriations for these river and harbor contracts without going further into detail we have already accounted for practically the entire excess of the appropriations of the present congress over and above the billiondollar mark a careful investigation of the figures i have given and of the whole subject will convince an impartial observerhowever much he may regret these vast expendituresthat the responsibility can not be placed upon either political party as a party and that if the true explanation is to be found and a proper remedy applied they must be sought for outside the lines of party division the truth is there is much more of human nature than of party politics in all these matters of appropriations and i think i can show before concluding my remarks that the explanation of the growing increase of public expenditures is to be sought and found in another direction but if there were any real difference between the two great parties upon this question i will frankly admit mr chairmanspeaking for myself as a member of the majority partyherethat i do not think our present power was given to us by the people with the purpose of increasing the appropriations there never was a party majority of representatives in this house who owed their seats so little to mere partisan votes as the members of the fiftyfourth congress with the exception of those who have been reelected to the fiftyfifth congress we republicans were elected in 1894 and again in 1896 by a union of forces by men of both parties and we owe a responsibility to those who supported us and who placed us in power here which we can not shirk i am glad therefore and because i am obliged to share in the responsibility of reporting this sundry civil bill to the house i am especially glad that the attention of the house and of the country has been called to the fact that it is the largest bill that has ever been reported under this title i am glad also that the frank admission is made by gentlemen upon the other side of the house that there is nothing in the bill properly subject to criticism excepting those items which provide payment for river and harbor improvements i am glad that attention is called to the fact that almost the whole increase in the bill over and above what has been customaryin recent yearsnamely 15 131 996 91is due to the passage of the river and harbor bill at the last session of this congress and to the fact that the secretary of war under the authority of that law has made contracts for public work under which contracts certain payments will fall due during the

others the exclusive franchise for the privilege of gaslighting in kansascity the charter did not terminate at the end of the thirty years but within that time the gas company had an exclusive monopoly of gaslighting in that city at the end of thirty years the common council of kansas city passed an ordinance reducing the cost of gas from 1 60 as it was thenthe price had varied sometimes higherto 1 a thousand the company which had for thirty years enjoyed the monopoly of gas lighting invoked the aid of the courts and insisted that the city council had no warrant of law for the reduction from 1 60 to 1 a thousand the contention of the company was not sustained by the courts a new company was chartered and after the appearance of that company upon the field of business operations in kansas city there was a gradual reduction in price until this time under the original company gas had never cost the citizens less than 1 60 per thousand now the rate has been reduced to 50 cents per thousand now i know that excessive competition sometimes operates unfavorably but i appeal to members of this house to recall their own experiences in private business the law never shields individuals with the armor of a monopoly they never have or enjoy exclusive privileges if engaged in farming there is no monopoly if engaged in the practice of law there is competition if pursuing the practice of medicine there is an open field and honorable competition in the vast scope of private enterprise the law never intervenes to grant exclusive privileges shall the power of

individual case is not a precedent and the policy of the government can not be founded upon or determined in the future by the passage of any private act that is an entirely different question the private law is an anomaly in legislation it is sometimes resorted to to confer privileges upon those who ought not to have them or who do not have them under the general law in a republic like ours it ought to be in the nature of equitable legislation and should be based on a general principle each case of rivate legislation that comes up for consideration in this body eing determined by the circumstances surrounding it the policy of the law in regard to pensions is that where the soldier died from the effect of wounds or injuries received or disease contracted in its service that the government will confer upon the widow of such soldier 12 per month and upon the widow of a general officer who performs services under similar circumstances the sum of 30 per month the policy of this government in reference to pensions as shown in the public laws of the united statesand that policy has been uniformis to give to the widow of the officer and the soldier alike a similar pension where the death did not result from wounds received in the service or from disease contracted in the line of duty we are departing from this policy of the law and without any good reason the pension that comes through a private law is a gratuity pure and simple it is not supported on any legal principle the pensions that come through a general law especially an act that was passed before the soldier enlisted perhaps or while in the service is in the nature of a debt and an obligation on the part of the government we have made this distinction although in the amount of pay and in the rank of the party the pension comes under the provisions of the general law now it is proposed by this amendment to make the pension of the widow of general gibbon 30 per month i recognize as we all recognize the distinguished services of gen john gibbon i recognize the fact that he got the infantry in that relentless pursuit along on the same time of the cavalry but it was the energy it was the endurance it was the bravery and determination of the private soldier that enabled him to do that i do contend that there ought not to be made this distinction between the officer and the privates both perhaps serving in the same corps and both undergoing the same hardships and the same privations besides that this officer was there for life a place that is sought after eagerly by all the young men of the country so many of whom wish to enter the military service when the proper age comes he may be retired on threequarters of his full pay the pension allowed to his widow is two and onehalf times that allowed to the private soldier and if the amount should be cut down to 50 per month under the amendment pending based on the facts set out in the report it will still be doing full justice to the widow of this distinguished officer and it will be very much more than has ever been granted to the widow of any private soldier under our pension laws"]]}
