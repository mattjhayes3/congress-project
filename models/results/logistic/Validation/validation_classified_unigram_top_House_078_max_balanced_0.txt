our nation there is much to do it is our job to bring up for legislative action pending bills destined to improve conditions on the home front and advance the war effort america is holding the democratic leadership responsible for the stalling and confusion some of the problems needing immediate attention are first increase food production and stop the wasting and hoarding of food the appointment of a single food administrator to bring order out of chaos and give america production of the farms rather than buckpassing on the banks of the potomac i second increase the production of crude oil so that existing gasoline and fueloil shortages may be relieved third the passage of legislation to provide american citizens an appeal through regularly established judicial channels from any bureaucratic directive or regulation fourth the immediate passage of legislation giving all of our persons in the armed services a right to vote fifth the double checking and careful investigation of all appropriation measures sixth the adoption of a better system of protection for our disabled and old folks seventh the rollback of federal bureaus to give relief to the american taxpayers this is not a complete analysis of legislative jobs which are begging for action when i left my district after the congressional recess my people expected to see some action in the halls of congress many members waited patiently for this vital legislation however the democratic majority which controls the congress and every committee in it has failed for 9 solid weeks to permit the floor consideration of legislation to correct or alleviate the foregoing problems therefore a group of us got together and decided to form a driveforaction committee in order to fulfill our pledge to our people back home over a year ago i warned the nation of a food shortage i have talked to farmers canners food processors and distributors about our food problem right now many cities are short of canned foods many more are short of butter some are voluntarily rationing fluid milk and a number of our citizens are doing without foods that they should have why the principal factors which are causing the food shortage are not only frosts floods and droughts but also low price ceilings the new deal philosophy of scarcity dumping and wasting of food scarcity of farm labor and machinery too much regulation and red tape from washington subsidies instead of fair prices and the administrations lack of confidence in the patriotism of food producers processors and distributors the american dairy association told us that there would be a milk shortage unless corrective measures were taken immediately the livestock and meat council warned us of a beef shortage unless quick remedial steps were taken many farm auctions are being held daily in the midwest crops have rotted in the fields and warehouses the canners have lost part of the 1943 pack because of labor shortage red tape and bungling by the 0 p a the american farmer did a splendid job of production in 1942 he has tried to do a better job in 1943 notwithstanding the new deal restrictions placed upon him processors and distributors have done their best within the limitations set up by the bureaucrats our food problem is of vital importance to every american citizen food production and distribution must be divorced from new deal politics and placed in the control of a single food administrator as proposed by the republican congressional food study committee we must stop the wasting and hoarding of food the same inexperienced new dealers who wasted money and manpower on boondoggling projects are wasting food produced by patriotic farmers it was this serious waste that prompted me to introduce a resolution in congress to investigate the wasting of food my resolution is in the hands of the house rules committee i would like to see some action on it now the new dealers tried to whitewash the potato dumping at vincennes ind by giving out a release that there was only 11 2 carloads of potatoes lost but the war food administration finally reported to me that there were 22 carloads lost at vincennes according to the testimony of the food administrator before the banking and currency committee federal officials purchased 9 000 carloads of potatoes and lost 475 carloads"], [0.004515537992119789,

advantageous in the present emergency to overcome the inequities of the low and highcost mines but farm subsidies are not so simple first of all the farmer is not a bookkeeper and does not have the time and money to employ the kind of help needed to cope with the governmental regulations nor the gas to be traveling back and forth to government agencies for explanation he must be on the job from dawn to dark and the constant annoyances of bureaucratic decrees after his days work are entirely beyond his ken or inclination the new deal economists who have gained their knowledge of farming from books and statistical charts with their usual inaccuracies have no conception of the problems of the average farmer of 180 acres he has learned his job the hard way through practical experience and he speaks an entirely different language than the new deal economic advisers it seems the administration does not take into account the wishes desires or advice of those who by experience ability and training are best qualified to make regulations of a particular business or industry i remember last summer one day one of our congressmen from the state of iowa called at the officd of the 0 p a to see if he could not get some encouragement on the farm machinery outlook without adequate machinery the iowa corn crop was jeopardized this particular congressman was told not to worry because 0 p a had just received word that a bountiful supply of hand hoes would be available in time for cultivation of the iowa corn crop one can but wonder as to the background and experience of this particular bureaucrat he must have been one of those new york or chicago or 1600 pennsylvania avenue farmers repeatedly the new deal has attempted to regiment and regulate the farmer during peace times we have practiced the doctrine of scarcity and experienced the coming and going of the n r a and now during time of war comes the most grandiose of all schemes thus far advanced to put eyerybodyproducers processors and consumersdirectly or indirectly on the government pay roll the administration would have it appear to each of these three groups that he is being especially and particularly favored whereas as a matter of actual fact the simple truth is he treasury of the united states that great american santa claus good old uncle sam in reality our boys who we hope will be returned some day our children and our grandchildren are the ones who will be holding the sack i had the privilege on september 2 of attending a meeting in kansas city mo of the livestock producers association of america where some 2 000 farmers from all over the west were assembled about a score of congressmen and governors were on the platform next to me sat senator omahoney of wyoming who received a number of telegrams during the day from washington one of them which was from marvin jones war food administrator was read to the audience it high lighted the entire meeting in that it led those in attendance to believe that the administration contemplated no ceilings on livestock the livestock producers present that day felt this to be quite a note of encouragement and expressed their joy with enthusiasm however only 9 days thereafter september 11 an order was dated from the 0 p a announcing ceilings on live pork surely this order was in the making at least 9 days and later on in the month of september we learned that ceilings on live cattle also were contemplated this is a practical example of how one agency in this case the food administrator said one thing while another the 0 p a actually hdd the authority and said another since then mr jones has testified before various congressional committees but what confidence can we place in his words when he has no authority the fulmer bill would provide for a federal food administrator with power over all agencies having to do with food and would go a long way toward correcting the existing evils"], [0.005078955087810755,

might even think they would be satisfied with it that number represents an average number of 750 persons for every state in the union that is a lot of manpower when every day we see and realize that essential food production is falling off because we cannot keep enough people down on the farm it is a lot of manpower when our manpower barrel is so low that we must call upon fathers to answer the call to defend their country but they are not satisfied with 36 000 employees that is not enough they must have more and more every month i ask you gentlemen is there not any limit or is it like subsidies just a little at first but a little more each month and each appropriation now in their budget this 0 p a which feels it has the right to stop and question citizens on public thoroughfares as to their destination asks for a total of 69 170 employees that gentlemen is an average of more than 1 450 for every state in the union that is almost twice the number on the rolls just last november think of it gentlemen twice as many persons are being taken out of production or withheld from other war services so that this organization can tell everyone what they can eat and how they must present themselves to shoe stores we often hear about how much money this organization saves but how frequently do we hear about how much it costs in pay rolls paper for releases reduced production and volunteer time of some of our most patriotic citizens this rapid growth at a time when there is such a demand for manpower is alarming in itself however what is far worse is the type of personnel here we have an organization which is trying to prescribe the daily living rules for every american an organization which tells every business firm in the land what it may sell and what it may charge an organization charged with keeping the domestic economy in good running order you would think it would have at its helm practical businessmen whounderstand the needs of retailers and consumers alike we look for these men but what do we find the top berth is reserved for a lame duck who could not hold the votes of his own constituents is he just window dressing for an efficient operating organization let us look down at the next layer those that get 7 500 a year or more or have equivalent positions the hearings show 25 persons in such categories out of these top 25 there are 15 with chiefly academic backgrounds15 who have had no business experience of any consequence these coilege professors we are told come from a poorly paid profession yet they seem to be doing all right down here among this group the lowest sum that could inveigle them into government service seems to be 8 000 the graybeard who directs our automotive rationing division is the ancient and honorable prof charles f phillips ph d who has reached the venerable age of 32 the long hair who directs miscellaneous products rationing is prof patterson h french age 35 the same age that has been attained by the assistant professor who is director of retail trade and services while the director of the food price division has reached the ripe old age of 37 we are to be spared the future services of the 34yearold deputy administrator for price who has resigned gentlemen of these long hairs not one has attained the age of 48 i would certainly nbt object to practical experienced youth who are the other 10 among the top 25 are they businessmen well 2 of them have had business experience one mr maxon has actually had experience running a business of his own you know the exception that proves the rule six of these 10 have spent most of their recent years in government connections although one was actually in the realestate business before he came with the government he is thought well enough of to be permitted to assist the 38yearold deputy administrator of the rent department who never had any realestate experience before he was thrust into his present 9 000ayear position where he can rule and ruin the rental properties in which the thrifty people of this nation have invested funds for their old age or dependent widows in case you wonder who the other two were they were members of the legal profession one of whom has spent half the last decade on the federal pay roll when our honorable colleague mr taber asked the 0 p a officials if there was anyone in charge of a unit who had had practical experience in the line of business he was told your criticism at the top is probably true the businessmen it seems are only suitable for the lower positions the positions which do not pay 8 000 surely a practical businessman cannot be worth as much as a 32yearold longhair so we find in the final statistics that there are 478 economists and only 465 business people and you can probably bet that stenographers who worked for a business firm are included iri with their figure for business people america may be wary of more than just professors the ones who succeed in making the orders so complicated that their associates in the academic field have to be employed to explain to retailers what they mean in addition to economic strangulation there are other employees on the 0 p a pay roll who are neither longhairs lawyers or businessmen they are the practical politicians the men who know there will soon be an election to win an election which may determine whether this country is to revert back to a representative form of government an election which might be the death knell for bureaucrats who live off the fats of administrative orders which often have no authority in congressional law these politicians are on the pay roll you can be sure it is too fine an opportunity to miss there are also administrators administrating 0 p a who are not on the pay rolls they are the powerful political machines that have built up over the years with the help of taxpayers funds just this month an 0 p a official resigned saying political machinations designed to create a powerful patronage machine in the 0 p a force me to tender my resignation from that organization effective immediately i could not fulfill my duties sincerely knowing that the 0 p a is under the thumbs of political bosses ed flynn frank kelly mike kennedy and senator mead and others i was shocked when you told me yesterday that the reason for my removal as acting district director in favor of russell was a purely political one namely that you were ordered by ed flynn frank kelly mike kennedy and senator mead to put their suggested candidate frank russell in the job you said if you did not do that the 0 p a would not have the support of the new york congressional delegation when in the near future the 177 000 000 0 p a appropriations bill comes up for a vote now that would not seem to indicate that these funds are not being sought so we can better win the war but rather so that those in power can better win the election in his resignation this mr russell porter was not content with general charges he was quite specific he cited eight incidents within his personal knowledge where the 0 p a personnel was being used for political purposes in one instance he was ordered by his superior to proceed at once t rochester n y apparently at government expense to interview the chairman of the monroe county democratic committee who told him he was not getting enough jobs from 0 p a nor is mr porters resignation the only one because of political pressure in addition to the urge to make jobscfor the faithful there has been the urge of political expediency this is how mr john k westberg spoke about his impending resignation from 0 p a the office of price administration was forced to do many things we knew were not right because somebody at the top did not have guts enough to cross a political bridge i have resigned and am leaving washington july 3 because i was not permitted to do a fair honest and complete job which means fixing equitable ceiling prices at every level of production and distribution the politics within the 0 p a organization are even too much for that stanch new dealer the president of the affiliated young democrats harold r muskovit just a fortnight ago he said they have too many people inside the office of price administration who dont know what its all about they havent got their finger on the public pulse they dont know what the common man wants or needs they need more practical grocery clerks and fewer officeholders i understand that paving block flynn named as chief new york 0 p a commissioner at 6 500 the former chairman of the bronx democratic committee harry d chambers now all this is not a thing to be taken lightly the 0 p a is a powerful organization it can determine who can ride who can walk and who can eat greater power hath no government organization it seems to have the power to stop a man on the street and ask where he is going and why it has assumed the right to say who may have extra shoes and who may not i am also reliably informed that they are studying the possibility of varying the food rations for various types of people now some of this might be justified as a war measure if you feel that dictatorships are more efficient operators than representative governments nevertheless it is a great power over human life from the cradle to the grave from the baby buggy milk and rubber nipple to the gas to take you to your grave in a casket with an 0 p a price on it if we are to preserve this nation in the form which made it the greatest nation in the world we must watch that this power is not politically abused we are on a dangerous path we are following the ways of germany in dictating the daily acts of our citizens we must make every possible safeguard that political machines do not use this vast power to maintain themselves in power for perpetuity the administration should be ashamed of this misuse of office if it wants unity in the nation it must at least be honest with the people and not spend taxpayers money to maintain political pets in offices for which they are not competent i hope that those acadamic long hairs in the 0 p a will at least be politically honest and remove from office all whose main purpose is party politics it is bad enough to have a flock of theorists who do not understand what made this nation the envy of all others and the bankers of all forces of freedom these we can counter with common sense and experience as time goes on but once the political dictators get into power with unlimited federal funds it will be almost impossible to drive them and their propaganda ministers out they will cofntrol the food and life blood of our nation and while we talk about poll taxes they may well dictate how you must vote if you want meat and potatoes you may well call the 0 p a the office of professors administration but look out gentlemen that it does not become the office of political administration for which there is already so much evidence when that day comes we shall know plenty of want and fear i wish to make it very clear that i am thoroughly in sympathy with and in support of an attempt on the part of the government to hold back any tendencies of runaway inflation by using the method of price control or price fixing i did not vote for the firs price control act and i stated my reasons to the house on that occasion i think they were thoroughly confirmed when later the leader of this administration the president virtually admitted that the original price control act which was in substance dictated by his administration was a complete failure and requested of congress a drastic revision in 1942 i did vote for the changes in the act much has been said publicly and even on the floor of the house that the reason for some of our serious situations today in respect to food is due to the divided authority set up in the price confrol act by this congress i thifik probably the congress can be frank enough to admit that we now learn that was a mistake but on the other hand the sole responsibility does not lay with the congress this administration has the power to bring together those two responsible agencies namely the office of price administration and the department of agriculture if their failure to cooperate has been the cause of our food problem in this nation as it becomes more acute every day then as the failure continues it becomes all the more the obligation of the president of the united states to call before him these two responsible agencies and see to it that they do cooperate he appointed both agencies and he has the power to remove the personnel in either or both agencies there is not any possibility however strong the majoritys imagination of this administration shirking the responsibility and trying to pass it back to congress or to the group they may smear as inflationists or to the group they may term the profiteers of the nation or to any other imaginary group this administration is wholly responsible for the critical food situation which has already developed and which promises to become mqre and more critical as the months go on now after all that has been said here today in regard to food i want to make some reference to meat i followed with intense interest the very able comments of my distinguished colleague on the appropriations committee the gentleman from illinois when he sought to draw the picture for this committee of the critical developments in the feed situation and how it applied to meat the 0 p a has the habit of blaming the war needs leaselend demands and the black market for all of its troubles in the meat industry of the nation the 0 p a has failed to realize or to take cognizance of he fact that there was no such thing as a black market in existence in the united states of america in meat until the establishment of their rules and price ceilings and that they motheredand gave birth to the black market by virtue of the very incompetence and if i may say the idiotic rulings and type of price ceilings established and further than that by virtue of their very violation of the price control act you may say wherein has the 0 p a violated the price control act the price control act sets forth this one policy as established by congress that is that it was the duty of the office of price administration in the fixing of prices not to disturb the normal channels of trade and distribution and to allow normal customary price markups in the various fields of industry in the case of beef alone the 0 p a set a price ceiling at the processors level which was below that which the slaughterer of livestock had to pay for live beef the department of agriculture has consistently and persistently gone along with the policy of refusal to permit a price ceiling to be set upon beef at the producers level so there was an attempt under the now exploded henderson theory of price fixing to set a ceiling at the processors level when they established slaughtering quotas they gave those quotas only to the slaughterers of live animals and to the nonslaughtering processors of the nation they gave no quotas it was only natural that when the slaughterer of beef lost money every time he killed an animal there would be a holdback in the liveanimal market on beef it was only natural then that if the farmer wanted to sell his commodity which was the live animal and he could not sell it to the slaughterers who were losing money whenever they bought the animals that the farmer himself began to slaughter this beef on the farm or sell it to those who were willing to pay above the ceiling and who had avenues of distribution known as the black market reputable people found themselves in the middle of blackmarket operations n this developed many months ago and the 0 p a recognized the fact that a black market had developed and they proclaimed to the public that the reason for shortages of beef in part was due to the fact that a black market was draining off a tremendous volume of this vital food now as a matter of fact under normal production estimates as issued for 1943 by the department of agriculture the army and navy and lendlease did not contemplate taking more than 28 per cent of the total production of live animals under a 70 per cent quota restriction for civilian use there would have been ample meat to feed this nation dislocations in distribution were brought about by the simple fact that every community does not have a slaughterhouse and thousands of communities in this nation depend upon the socalled wholesalers of meat for the distribution of this necessary food to their community the 0 p a did nothing about that by its very policies the o p a boosted the production of sausage in this country and then this year with the establishment of point rationing the 0 p a was guilty of putting almost the same point ration value upon sausage which is made from the trimmings of meat trimmings which cannot be sold in a butcher shop because they are not attractive cuts as they put on the good cuts of beef they had the packer in a price squeeze on beef which resulted in excess trimmings going into the making of sausage in sausage many packers found a way of making a little profit where he was suffering a loss on the fresh cuts of meat 0 p a put the same point value on sausage as they did on fresh cuts choice cuts of beef this was called to the attention of the 0 p a by myself in a meat hearing held before the small business committee of the house prentiss brown and chester davis were both present and the question was directed to them brown admitted that this was an error and there would be a change made they made a change of one point i appealed for a drastic reduction and i was told by mr brown and i have the letter here and i intend to put it in the recordi was told by mr brown in words which were virtually the same as the head of the meat branch in 0 p a that it was not logical to put a different point value on sausage which contained the same meat value as the meat before it was made into sausage i have heard a great deal of talk this afternoon about a comprehensive national economic policy there is not any comprehensive price fixing program that can be effective unless 0 p a and this administration from the president on down through the different fanciful agencies or boards or commissions or special mobilization groups which he may set up recognize that there is something else besides the actual vitamin content of a product that has to do with its market value the demand for sausage is not as great as the demand for fresh meat the 0 p a tried to force upon the country the theory that the demand by the consuming public had nothing whatsoever to do with the point values in their rationing program but the other day mr brown contradicted his letter to me when he upped the value of different cuts and again reduced the point value of sausage if what he told me in his letter was a fact then what he has done now has been a gross blunder conversely however i do believe that what he has done now is much more equitable and that he should have taken such action many veeks ago had he acted as the meat industry wanted then he could have saved millions of tons of meat waste the letter referred to follows"],

emergency is in the making another new deal crisis is aborning the purpose of course is to keep us in the middle of the stream that we never seem to get across steps to create this new emergency have been taken by the new deal spokesmen in recent utterances at their national convention on the floors of congress and in the vice presidential nominees opening campaign speeches in detroit there is no doubt about it the new dealers experienced hands in creating emergencies are plunging us into just one more emergency which in fact need not exist unless it is deliberately created by an administration that is bent on regulating the lives of every one of us whether we need it or not it is the same old story that has been repeated so many times in the past 12 years during all of that time we have been kept in a constant state of getting out of one emergency only to be told that another is in the offing today the hue and cry from the master minds of the new deal inner sanctum is that a horrible specter of unemployment faces us in the postwar period these master minds would have us believe that the new deal and only the new deal is capable of driving away that specter in every utterance that has been made by a new deal spokesman since the opening of their national convention in chicago is the statement or prediction of the frightening state of affairs that will prevail when it comes time for america to lay down the sword for the plowshare the din and the roar surrounds us everywhere all in a frantic effort to convince the american people of something which just common ordinary judgment says does not make sense any employer of labor will tell you that such a postwar unemployment crisis as the new dealers are picturing can develop only if hopeless fumbling in washington creates it if the manufacturer and the businessman and the farmer are forced to follow the dictates of those in washington who would rather have what they call a controlled economy than prosperity then it is conceivable that we might blunder into serious unenployment problems certainly nothing that has been done by the new deal up to now would indicate otherwise but if the problems of reconverting to peacetime production are handled by practical men of real experience and not by dreamyeyed planners of the new deal there is nothing to fear a sensible approach to the problem can be made by employers themselves if they are allowed to do so is there any real reason why they should not be given some freedom to work out their own individual problems of reconversion or must we deliver all of industry and all of labor into the hands of the bureaucrats who can then make or break any one or all of us indeed if the problem of reconversion is as gigantic and is as fraught with danger as the new deal would have us believe then there is all the more reason why it should not be entrusted to any one man or small group of men we must not be forced to stand or fall according to the ability or lack thereof pqssessed by the planners given an even chance by labor leaders and government business and industry in america can take care of their own problems of reconversion and the unemployment problem that the new dealers profess to fear so mightily will be automatically avoided many an employer or industrialist has told congress of plans for rapid expansion and production when peace comes many of them have given figures showing just how many thousands they can employ but the new deal has been too busy planning our economy to listen to men who have the hard cold facts as a matter of fact there are many industries that will not have to pass through a retooling or reconversion period before going into full peacetime production one example to substantiate this statement is seen in my own congressional district there the paper industry in the city of kalamazoo alone can add hundreds of workers for peacetime production even on the present time schedules if the time schedules are returned to what they were before the war double the number of men can be added to the pay rolls there are hundreds of such industries where production has either fallen off since the war due to the scarcity of raw material or where the production has gone almost entirely into war work with the coming of peace production will be expended to take care of the tremendous backlog of orders from civilian sources one manufacturer from coldwater mich in my congiessional district who is in washington this week advised me that his company which manufactures plumbing supplies is 21 2 years behind orders then there is the farmlabor situation about which so much has been said during the past few months anywhere from one to three million men will be needed to work the farms of the nation which have been so shorthanded during the war the forestry and timber and fishing industries too are badly depleted in manpower they need no period of reconversion they need not even await a supply of raw material they only need men to work and again there are new industries that have started or have come into their own during the war the entire field of plastics where the possibilities for new produots are unlimited is ready and anxious to apply its newfound secrets on the production of civilian goods those plants are built now they are ready to produce only the wartime restrictions in the supply of raw material and the necessity to produce only for military needs is holding back the plastic manufacturers from developing one of the worlds greatest industries and they will need men by the thousands to do it the fabulous science of electronics is another industry that will absorb thousands of workers after the war television and the million marvels it will bring is ready to go the plans are laid the experimenting has been done to a large extent in the development of war equipment as soon as theallclear sig nal is given the electronics industry will be ready to start heavy production schedules on television that will bring the events of the world to the living room of every home not only in sound but in sight by the flick of a switch or a button mr benjamin abrams president of the emerson radio phonograph co predicted not long ago that the electronics industry would advance from an annual dollar volume of 350 000 000 before the war to a 3 000 000 000 volumeafter the war and there will of course be a corresponding increase in the number of workers employed in that already large industry one can name dozens of such industries and occupations which are ready to absorb workers as soon as the wartime strait jacket is removed by the government our public works have been neglected during the war there has been almost no new construction of roads bridges and public buildings except where directly needed in the war effort most of our public highways are badly in need of repair the road crews have gone to war but their jobs will be there when they return the same is true in our transport industries where needed work has not been done or where men have been replaced by women most of whom have no desire to continue at the unfeminine tasks of driving busses and streetcars when the men come back railroad roadbeds and equipment are in notoriously bad condition as everyone knows who hasridden on a train in recent months this all means work work for returning servicemen and all others who want to work let us not forget too the fact that industry now is operating on a basis of long shifts designed to compensate for the lack of manpower if all plants were to go back to a 44 or 40hour workweek immediately after the war there would be need for thousands upon thousands of workers the immediate effect of cutbacks in war contracts can be largely cushioned by the return to a shorter workweek and it would be a boon to all of us when that happens under the strain of lorig hours at the shop and in the offices nerves have been worn and tempers have become short minor grievances among workers have been built up to a degree out of all proportion to their real importance both sides in these squabbles have been guilty of exaggerating the issues we have all been driving ourselves to work and produce under conditions that we would not tolerate in peacetime the headaches of management and labor have reached migraine proportions and yet we have had to keep going in peacetime we can change all of that if labor leaders and the government will permit recently at the willow run airplane plant of the ford motor co there was a 30percent slice in the governments orders for planes yet not one single man was laid off the cut was made in the hours of work and i am told that it was to the satisfaction of all concerned no mr speaker the new deals specter of impending unemployment will not bear the light of analysis it is scare psychology designed to create panicthinking and to prepare the minds of the people of america

cradletograve security program put out by the national resources planning board as a mental illusion without logical foundation based entirely upon fancy and futile hope it is more fantastic than the mississippi bubble that grotesque fantasy of yesteryear this cradletograve plan brings back to my mind the fable of the pot of gold at the foot of the rainbow that folk legend used to puzzle me much when i was a little fellow i now perceive that it contained the same philosophy as that embraced in this cradletograve schemesomething for nothing this socalled security program is an alluring mirage to those travelers across the desert of life who thirst for economic security without too much work and sacrifice it is a mirage that holds out hope but one which can never materialize in the satisfaction of human needs or wants perhaps you may have noticed that the somethingfornothing philosophy contained in the report permeates the entire new deal setup and has attracted millions of our people as a mirage in the desert attracts the weary traveler by promising comfort and security that never materializes however the experienced desert traveler after being fooled by mirages many times finally learns to resist the lure of those optical illusions and does not permit them to influence him or to divert him from a straight course to his real destination i am beginning to wonder if the american people having been fooled time and again by new deal illusions will permit this new cradletograve security illusion to influence them or to deflect them from their ultimate objective namely a safe sane efficient economical administration in washington to operate the nations businessan administration that will prosecute this war to a satisfactory conclusion at the earliest possible moment the report of the national resources planning board that contained the socalled cradletograve security program was signed by the chairman of the board frederic delano an uncle of the piesident it is called the delano report however frederic delano was for years a hardheaded railroad executive who served as the president of the wabash railroad he knows all about safety devices on railroads to protect railroad workers from injury but very little about social devices to provide security for workers in general for that reason although his name is signed to the report it was actually prepared and written by someone else the report expounds a socialistic program of security that is beyond the experience and understanding of frederic delano in fact his whole lifes activity starting as a machinist in the railroad shops of aurora ill and working his way up the ladder to the presidency of the wabash railroad by his own initiative gives the lie to any socialistic philosophy who then did prepare this cradletograve security illusion the real author of the delano report is one mrs eveline burns ph d the director of research for the national resources planning board she is an english socialist who came to america a few years ago with her husband dr arthur r burns now chief adviser to the war production board she is an important cog in the new deal machine that grinds out socialistic schemes to destroy private property in america and to bring about state socialism she is a brilliant woman saturated with the philosophy of karl marx this same dr eveline burns in 1932 collaborated with others in the preparation of a book entitled socialist planning and a socialist program in her contribution to this book she urged outright government control of both labor and property i quote her exact words society will have to devise methods of preventing the indiscriminate use of resources by every optimistic producer and of replacing the guesses of individual producers by a more orderly method of estimation of need such a method would imply the imposition of controls that would refuse individuals the right to make what use they wish of their own labor and property that last sentence is the essence of the karl marx program and also of this cradletograve security program it is interesting to note at this point that the drs burns are both natives of england and were british subjects until a recent phase of the new deal era at which time they became united states citizens and very soon thereafter secured their high posts in these offices of the united states government it has been pointed out by washington observers that the people of america are indebted for the drs burns to the underground railroad so to speak operated jointly and expertly by the honorable felix frankfurter of the united states supreme court and the honorable harold laski of the london school of economics the drs burns are both former high functionaries of the london school of economics which has turned out in its day many a fine mess of confused master statisticians enthusiastic communists and socialist joiners in fact it may well be said that the london school of economics has specialized in turning out brain twisters who are expert in producing calculated frustration on a mass scale by means of planned confusion designed to end up in regimented chaos if you will take the time to study and analyze the delano report this cradletograve security illusion you will find the essence of the plan contained in the following paragraph taken from the report where a state refuses to comply with the federal requirements in accordance with the federal law or refrains from participation in the program the federal government should have the power to operate the program within that state with federal personnel until the state demonstrates its ability and willingness to reassume its responsibilities this paragraph means if it means anything at all that if the states refuse to cooperate they are to be policed by the rederal government until they see the light it means permanent rationing price fixing and government control of all business no wonder the congress has so far turned a cold shoulder to the plan now if this cradletograve security illusion now dubbed on capitol hill as the wombtotomb plan were an isolated plan separate and distinct from the general socialistic program of the new deal i would stop right here after exposing the real author and the gist of the plan however that is not the case it is not an isolated plan but it is a definite part of an overall program to undermine and destroy our american system of government and our american way of life i propose to prove that there is an organized effort being carried on to accomplish this objective by a group of new dealers now intrenched in government positions and i propose to use their own words to establish my point before doing that however i want to impress upon this house the fact that the president when he submitted the delano report to this congress recommended that we give it our serious consideration immediately if we had followed his recommendation we would have placed this socialistic program ahead of the war effort we would have given it first place in our thoughts and we would have done exactly what the new dealers have been doing all along namely taking more interest in social reforms than in the war effort thank god this congress did not follow his recommendation but instead turned a cold shoulder to the plan and has so far refused to discuss it behind the national resources planning board and frederic delano and even back of mrs eveline burns are a group of new dealers in government service holding important and responsible positions who have been scheming out this socialistic plan pulling the wires to bring it about working out the phraseology and putting together the jigsaw puzzle which finally emerged as a formula by means of which they hope and expect to do away with the institution of private property to do away with the independence of our citizens and to carry the nation over into state socialism at this point let us bring some of these new dealers these social planners out into the open parade them before our eyes and examine their social philosophy let us take up one exhibit after another study the

must be made to increase agricultural production this year and for 1944 and 1945 since the need for food is inevitably going to exceed our ability to produce it and supplies available for civilians will continue to decline finally it should be noted that food is in a category by itself insofar as the war and postwar situation is concerned the minute the war has been won production of direct military itemsships tanks guns airplanes etc can be suspended no such action can be taken with food the demand for it will continue at even higher levels for at least 2 years after the war is won consequently in appraising the timing of projects for expanding food production at least 2 years should be added as compared with projects for the expansion of direct military production in other words if projects for expansion of production of direct military items are ruled out if such production will not come into being until after 1945 projects of the expansion of food should not be ruled out unless they will not come into production until after 1947 the importance of the continuing postwar demand for food should not be minimized because our ability to supply food to freed countries and even to the civilian populations of enemy countries in the immediate postwar period will have a vital bearing uron the chances for a lasting peace moreover because of the time lag in agricultural production we cannot afford to wait until the war is over to develop postwar food production programs it is evident therefore that it is essential to press into production every possible acre of land in the nation our present food production resources in established areas already are operating at capacity and the only other means of increasing output are through development which will permit more intensive cultivation such as irrigation projects the 18 western states afford many excellent opportunities for expanding production of the foods in greatest need such as dry beans and peas potatoes

mediation board was invoked december 18 1942 mediation began on january 7 1943 and ended january 15 1943 without an agreement on june 20 the unions requested the appointment of an emergency board authorized by the railway labor act this board was appointed by the president from the national railway labor panel the emergency board held hearings at chicago covering a period of 44 days this board duly filed with the president their report may 24 1943 this was a 15page report and recommended among other things an increase of 8 cents per hour on may 27 the union officials met with the president and while the unions were disappointed in the small raise granted of 8 cents per hour they yielded to the request of the president to accept the findings of the emergency board the railroads agreed to the findings this then should have ended the matter the unions then arranged with the carriers conference committee to meet in new york on june 24 and formally write the findings of the emergency board into an agreement just the day before this agreement was to be executed the economic stabilization director stepped into the picture on june 23 he issued the following order that the recommendations of the emergency board for a general 8cent increase in rates of pay of nonoperating men now employed contained in paragraph 54 of the report of may 24 1943 shall not become effective there the matter stands and i am advised and from such advice allege the fact to be that the stabilization director will seek the appointment of a new emergency board that will carry out his wishes in the meantime the officials of the unions are fast losing control of their membership and there is not a doubt in the world but what d general strike will be voted it is apparent that the stabilization director rests his case upon the stabilization act of october 2 1942 when we examine this act there is nothing in the present case which conflicts with that law while generally wage increases are forbidden there are two notable exceptions increases may be made first to correct gross injustices and second to aid in the effective prosecution of the war that we may have the full record in regard to these gross injustices i quote the comparative wage scale of railway workers with other employees in manufacturing i respectfully refer you to the report of the emergency board of may 24 1943 and especially to paragraphs 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 and especially to paragraph 43 which reads the existence of gross inequities in the compensation of 73 classes of railroad employees is supported by all of the wage findings above this board after 44 days of hearings with all of the evidence before them came to this conclusion but that conclusion has no effect upon the economic stabilization director this director has waived aside the purposes of thenational railroad labor act the national mediation board the emergency board and the agreement reached between the unions and the railroads themselves if this strike comes is there any possible chance to fasten the blame upon these million railroad workers if this strike comes it is the absolute responsibility of the government itself acting through the office of economic sabilization and not supported by any law passed by congress are we acting with a single purpose in this war is it possible that we can scatter billions around to every country on earth and at the same time drive our own laborers to a substandard wage scale generous abroad but miserly at home does not seem to be found in the four freedoms we either have too many bureaus departments agencies directors and what have you or we do not havle enough i do not know which i doubt if anyone else knows my judgment is that we should make further appointmentsone more in particular and that is to create an office big enough to keep all these bureaus and directors in their proper place what is the use of attempting to carry out orderly processes of government if we have one director who can ignore our whole system of government under an act of congress that gives him no such power after all the office of economic stabilization director is merely an executive agency created to aid and assist the president the director is responsible to the president and therefore the duty of the president to untangle this situation is plain and unequivocal i realize the situation of the president i can imagine what difficult matters he has before him constantly pertaining to the war first of all and to our own affairs but perhaps he can find time to round up this loose bunch of directors and potentates and find out what they are doing while in this congress i expect to remain free to speak in behalf of the least of our citizens regardless of race religion or anything else i want the people of the united states to know what the merits of this railroadlabor case is i want to do my small part in averting what i consider a serious tieup in transportation and most dangerous to our war effort we are in this war to the finish we have a complete understanding with our allies so it seems we should have wisdom enough to straighten out our own domestic affairs

accomplishments and impede its advancement similar speeches were made on december 3 1941 on that day predictions were made that if antilabor legislation were not passed production would collapse and the war lost in a very short time three months later in march 1942 a repetition of this antilabor spectacle was staged in congress when the socalled smith bill of a year ago was up for consideration again about 6 weeks ago the same campaign against organized labor emanated from the floor of this house and a repetition of the same speeches calling for the same shackling of labor in the socalled hobbs bill in spite of the above seasonal assaults against the war workers and the defense producers of this country american labor has overproduced and far exceeded the most optimistic predictions on the turning dut of tanks bombers cannons ammunition ships and the other essential needs to win this war the latest authentic reports indicate that in february 1943 3 months ago less than 2 workdays out of every 10 000 were lost on account of strikes in march 1943 less than 3 workdays out of 10 000 were lost on account of strikes on monday war mobilization director james f byrnes in a speech at spartanburg s c stated that in 1942 only onetwentieth of 1 percent of defense production manhour days was lost on account of strikes all available data indicates a net loss of manhours averaging each month approximately threetenths of 1 percent this record does not show the necessity for legislative measures of the character of the socalled smithconnally antilgbor bill defense workers have performed what is universally regarded as a production miracle every member of this house the people of the country and the members of organfzed labor deplore and repudiate the actions of john l lewis in bringing about strikes and stoppages in the coal production of this country during wartimes i am not personally familiar with the economic conditions and company store set ups in the various mining localities but i am opposed to penalizing the millions of loyal and patriotic members of american organized labor engaged in other fields of industry everybody knows that in recent months the food budgets of the american family have reached critical proportions in fact in every avenue of american life great sacrifices have been made on account ofthis war no section of our economic setup has suffered more than the small businessman in fact thousands of grocery men meat dealers automobile dealers gasoline stations and dozens of other retail establishments have closed their doors and lost everything but are taking their sacrifices without complaint and in the spirit of patriotism does anybody claim that with almost 50 000 000 engaged in war production in this country that there would not be some unauthorized tieups of production scattered over the thousands of mills and factories throughout america theseinterruptions have been condemned by the great leaders of labor organizations which supervise 95 percent of american labor to wit the a f of l c i 0 and the railroad brotherhoods a few months ago absenteeism was the vehicle being used to discredit organized labor throughout america it has been adequately proven to the american public that absenteeism was greatly exaggerated and not all onesidedbad housing inadequate transportation lack of medical services lack of day nurseries inability of foremen and superintendents to haihdle increasing numbers of women workers and so forthall contributed to the absenteeism that existed in time this is gradually clearing itself up without legislation volumes of bitter poison were distributed by a few newspapers and commentators whenever certain misunderstanding by local differences between labor and management took place in factories and industries this vicious lying propaganda has a farreaching purpose and effect both employers and the leaders of our large labor organizations are entitled to every credit for their cooperation and unified understanding during the last 2 years without which the great success of our war effort could not have taken place we must not overlook that labor is entitled to its real place and credit in this great war effort along with industry and when the history of labors accomplishments since december 7 1941 is told to the people after this victory is won i feel that american labor will receive its proper credit and honor for the part it has played in preserving american free dom and liberty it is significant that one of the first official acts of adolf hitler 10 years ago was to destroy organized labor and labor unions in germany the free institutions of our american systerh of government need not fear that our constitution and our liberty and our privileges will ever be in danger because of the freedom and progress and advancement of organized labor persons advocating this type of legislation should take into serious consideration the results its final passage might have upon the morale and mental attitude of millions of members of labor in this country individual members of orz ganized labor by reason of their inherent american patriotism are jubilant and proud to be able to takepart in this great american war production accomplishment members of congress should visualize for a moment the feeling in the mind and also in the homes of the average american worker if legislation of this nature becomes effective millions of our most patriotic workers might assume an attitude that their government found it necessary to pass legislation to supervise and compel them to work when the liberties of themselves and their families are at stake since pearl harbor the production of american war workers has astounded the world and it was personally called to our attention by the prime minister of england a few days ago on the floor of this house let us be careful that by reason of our actions on this legislation that the morale of the american worker is not seriously hampered and our victory endangered all by reason of unnecessary bitterness engendered at frequent intervals by legislation of this kind hatreds bitterness intolerance and witch burning brought prohibition and its penalties during the last war we should now reflect to the lesson learned in those days government cannot legislate in mens minds that which is notin their hearts this legislation will lead to confusion repulsion and impede americas war effort a few quotations from the industrial leaders of america might be important at this time william batt president of the s k f industries said the following at town hall n april 17 1941 where there is delay due to strikes i doubt if the solution can be found through legislation report of the department of manufacture committee of the united states chamber of commerce january 24 1941 said the following the national chamber believes that antistrike laws prove ineffective and that they will deny fundamental rights to our citizens the chamber further believes that public interest will be best served by voluntary cooperation john s kemper past president of the chamber of commerce of the united states in an address at the twentyninth annual meeting of the organization april 28 1941 said while cie strike situation is apparently on the mend it still is the most sprious obstacle in our military defense as a result there has developed astrong minority calling for the outlawry of strikes and lockouts as i see it such a step would be the worst possible way to deal with the problem compulsory arbitration or the attempt to deal with labor and employer disputes by any form of legislative compulsion never haz worked out satisfactorily william s knudson former president c general motors in testimony before te house judiciary committee february 10 1941 said i dont believe you can make a man a criminal because he is striking in his speech before the veterans of foreign wars april 5 4941 he said i do not believe that legislation against strikes is necessary or enforceable b c forbes on april 22 1941 in the journal and american new york wrote this writer has constantly opposed legislation outlawing strikes for the reason that cooperation is infinitely preferable to compulsion an article by stewart chase condensed from the factory management and maintenance magazine in this months readers digest

labormanagement problems are being ironed out without work stoppage are du pont bethlehem steel radio corporation of americavictor united airlines western electric general motors caterpillar tractors winchester arms general electric international harvester and hundreds of others this presents to the neutral and fairminded citizen the question are these wildcat and scattered work stoppages wholly the fault of the leaders or members of organized labor neither labor nor management has any first mortgage on patriotism but uncalled for greed and avarice on the part of either may easily bring about local wildcat strikes and work stoppages let us not throw the red herring of communism across the pathway of organized labor in america the public is fast realizing that this smoke screen has been the rendezvous for enemies of organized labor over the last 30 years if ever this great free land of ours was onthe verge of communism and standing on the brink of national discontent and revolution it was during 1930 1931 and 1932 when over 12 000 000 american men were walking the streets and high ways looking for work to feed and clothe themselves and their families the same agitation and prejudices and hatreds arl croppirg up today that thrived immediately after the last world war this prejudice and hatred against organized labor in the 1920s gave industry the employer and the promoter a free rein and brought us the stock market real estate and the promotional booms which led up to the financial debacle of in the middle west during 1930 and 1931 our farmers the most conservative class of people were resisting mortgage foreclosures with pitchforks and ropes and industry and labor alike were crying for a just solution of their troubles let us not repeat the
