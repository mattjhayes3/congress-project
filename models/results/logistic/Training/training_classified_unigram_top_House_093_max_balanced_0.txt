resulted in a gross inequity in our collective bargaining system by allowing strikers to be eligible for food stamps the federal government in essence is subsidizing strikes just as i would be totally

be free of any government intervention except in two main instancesif either or both parties request a federal arbitrator or if the president calls for a cooling off period by invoking the tafthartley act however the present eligibility of strikers to receive food stamps has resulted in federal intervention in the collective bargaining process that i feel is unwarranted and must be stopped it is my

bill passed by a margin of 380 to 26 and i was pleased to be among those voting in favor of the measure i did so for several reasons it provided assistance to school systems throughout my district according to a formula which will benefit the children there substantially it contained impact aid provisions which are of critical importance to a number of school districts in the area i represent and to top it all off the icing on the cake was a set of antibusing provisions which offered real hope for releasing our nations children from the cruel burden of forced busing we all know the grim history of the bill following our approval of it on that day in march the other body failed to approve language regarding busing which was identical to ours by a single vote 46 to 47 they sent a much weaker busing prohibition to conference committee and their conferees representing those who had been part of that bare onevote majority consistently refused to accept the antibusing language which was so nearly approved by the other body as a whole three times this house voted overwhelmingly by a 2to1 margin to instruct our conferees to insist on the strong house antibusing language but after a 2month impasse the conferees accepted what has been termed a compromise in this language i would like to state now for the record that this language is not worthy of being termed a compromise and that it is very little better than no antibusing language at all the conference version of the bill before us this afternoon represents essentially the senate version insofar as busing is concerned the ashbrook amendment which has been adopted by this house several times in recent years would have prohibited the use of any federal funds for busing but the version now before us permits the use of impact aid funds for this express purpose we cannot approve this language and then go home and tell our constituents that we have done everything in our power to establish a federal policy which rejects busing as a proper and viable method of treating americas schoolchildren the esch amendment adopted by this house overwhelmingly would prohibit the busing of a child to any school other than that school closest or second closest to his home on first glance this provision appears to be contained in the bill now before us but in fact it includes an engraved invitation to the courts to ignore this provision entirely simply by saying that the 5th or 14th amendments to the constitution may be invoked as a reason for busing as far as the court may wish thus instead of establishing a hard and fast congressional position in opposition to busing as a means of pursuing some absurd notion of mathematical racial balance in schools we will instead be saying to the courts go ahead and bus to your hearts delight if your interpretation of the law differs from ours i think it is important to reflect for a moment on jult what the constitution says in this area the 14th amendment states that no person shall be deprived of equal protection under the law and in far too many cases around the country federal courts have ruled that a de facto situation where attendance at certain schools is heavily black or heavily white constitutes denial of this constitutionally guaranteed equal protection now none of us will deny that in cases where school attendance district lines have been demonstrably drawn for the express purpose of creating schools which are predominantly black or white the civil rights of those students are being violated but this falls into the category known as de jure segregation and is a completely different animal and even here the situation car be corrected by fairly and equitably redrawing the district boundaries to reflect neighborhood areas not by busing these children miles from their homes the position of this house is clear we have consistently voted according to a view of the constitution which holds that efforts to consciously segregate schools on the part of localities is wrong but that simply allowing a child to attend a school near his home does not constitute any willful effort to segregate schools nor does it violate that childs civil rights in fact to bus schoolchildren many miles from their homes simply to pursue a game of mathematical balancing is to violate the civil rights of those children not the other way around the very distinguished senator from north carolina mr ervin argued this point convincingly on the floor of the other body just 1 week ago the senator is a man widely regarded for his expertise and judgment when it comes to matters of constitutional law and he told his fellow senators when a court orders a school board to bus children solely for the purpose of integrating their bodies rather than enlightening their minds the court orders the school board to violate the equal protection clause in two respects in the first place the court states to the school board you must divide all the schoolchildren in this school attendance zone or district into two groups you may let the first group attend their neighborhood schools in their school attendance zone or district but you must deny the second group of children the right to attend their neighborhood schools in their attendance zone or district that is an order from the court to the school board to violate the equal protection clause because it clearly orders the school board to treat in a different manner children similarly situated in that all of them are residents of the attendance zone or district in question in the second place the court orders the school board in a schoolbusing decree to violate the equal protection clause in an additional way the court says to the school board the reason you have to divide these children into these two groups and must deny equal protection of the law treatment to the second group is that you must bus the second group to schools elsewhere either to increase the number of children of their race in the schools elsewhere or to decrease the number of children of their race in their neighborhood schools oceans of judicial sophitry cannot wash out the plain fact that is denying the children who are ordered to be bused the right to attend certain schools solely on account of their race and that is exactly what the supreme court held in brown against board of education of topeka to be unconstitutional i have quoted extensively from the senator from north carolinas remarks because they express so well the truly relevant constitutional considerations to which i believe most of us subscribe by adopting the conference bill before us this afternoon we will be turning our backs on this position and will instead be inviting the courts to go on ruling as they have so often in direct contravention to the interpretation so well articulated by senator ervin i for one cannot condone such a move finally the conference committee deleted a set of provisions now commonly known as the reopening clause the house had adopted language which directed the courts to reopen cases where busing had already been ordered and review those cases in light of these newly enacted laws regarding busing the senate replaced the word shall with the word may an alteration which renders the provision meaningless the courts may already reopen such cases if they wish the house language would direct them to do so and would establish a uniform policy regarding busing and the courts throughout the nation but the language before us here this afternoon will merely say for those of you who have not yet come under a court order to bus here is some relief for those of you who have already been ordered to bus tough luck clearly the antibusing language in the bill before us here today bears little resemblance to the strong provisions we adopted back in march thus while i continue to strongly support many of the other provisions of h r 69 i am going to vote no on final passage of the conference report i do so in the knowledge that a bill will quickly be resubmitted and that in the near future our school districts will benefit from the many aid provisions contained in this act but i believe we must show the other body that we are not willing to give in on the drive to curb forced busing and that we do not consider an arrangement in which we give the other body 90 percent of what it wants in this area a compromise i urge the members to vote down this bill in order that we may move quickly to adopt a more acceptable measure in accordance with the wishes of the

future development yet i think all of us realize that no one technological step is going to resolve the energy problem the production of electricity consumes huge amounts of relatively limited natural resources some 25 percent of all our natural gas is consumed for electric power generation and this is one of our scarcest resources in some places it will be practical to use coal to substitute for natural gasbut this still creates vast problems in terms of environmental pollution transportation and storage so clearly we have to find not just new fuels but new technologies for producing electricity and this bill is a step in that direction nevertheless it is only part of what must be done clearly the greatest promise in the future for meeting our power needs lies in the field of nuclear generation even in this field however the need for new technology is clear and urgent we have only a limited amount of fuel for conventional fission reactorsperhaps only enough for 20 or 30 more years of use after that something new must be found there are two possibilities for new nuclear power generating technologythe development of breeder reactors which produce their own fuel and a wholly new concept that of fusion breeder technology is in a fairly advanced state but i have my doubts that this is really the best answer to our ultimate needs in terms of danger to the environment and the possibilities of accident such reactors are not essentially any better than existing units fusion technology is different it allows the use of virtually limitless cheap resources it is a technology that promises to be far safer than existing fission reactors and which produces less danger to the environment conceivably fusion reactors would be safe enough to locate in heavily settled areas which would greatly alleviate one of the most serious problems now confronting the development of any new generating facilitesthat of powerplant siting there is no question that fusion technology involves extremely difficult problems for one thing operating temperatures involved in this process are so high that it is impossible to build a container vessel that would hold the materials involved this will have to be done by developing a magnetic bottle of one design or another and there are other problems as well however the possibility of having a safe inexhaustible source of power is so great that it cannot be ignored every effort should be made to determine at the earliest possible time whether fusion technology is feasible and i think that the answer is going to be a resounding yes other countries are pressing forward with fusion technology they see in it enough promise to proceed with all possible speed our own approach has up until now been far more conservative and deliberate i wonder whether this is wise in these critical days i believe that we are obliged to search out every possible source of new energy to spend all that we need to spend on it and have in place alternatives for the future we already know that the price of running out of fuel or exposing the nation to the whims and aggressive tactics of fuel suppliers from abroad is too great to pay the only way to be prepared against the day when our natural gas resources run short or the possibility that fission reactors even those of the breeder type might be inappropriate to our needs is to find still other possible answers solar energy is one fusion technology is another i renew my call which i made a year ago for the country to enter into a crash program for the development of fusion as a process for large scale electricity generation there is no time to lose when our needs are so great and when the promise of this technology is so great it may be that in this new approach we have the answer that is big enough to solve our problem i urge the committee and the house to consider this and bring forward a program of research that will enable us to cover every potential avenue every

action by congress it ha been suggested that the act could be inferpreted as resulting in a denial of due pocess for somebody the grant provided for in section 203 c of this bill does not violate the due rrocess clause of the fifth amendment the only provision even arguably appli able section 203 d and f of the bill whch precludes judicial review of the granting of rightsofway permits and other forms of authorization is a constitutional exercise of congressional pwer as decided time and again by the federal courts in many instances congress has seen fit to proscribe or limit judicial review in the past 40 years no act of congress limiting judicial review has been declared unconstitutional moreover statutes limiting judicial review have been interpreted to permit the judiciary to reverse lawless agency action and are therefore given a saving construction for example section 10 b 3 of the selective service act of 1967 provided thatno judicial review shall be made of the classification or processing of any registrant by local boards appeal boards or the president except as a defense to a criminal prosecution under section 12 of this title after the registrant has responded to an order to report for induction an exception to this nonreviewability provision was only upheld when the order was basically or blatantly lawless breen v selective service board 396 unitedstates 460 1970 oestereich v selective service board 393 unitedstates 233 1968 this exception has been limited to those cases in which the registrant was entitled by the very terms of the statute to an exempt classification and the board for reasons unrelated to the merits of the claim denied him the sought after classification to which he was entitled section 10 b 3 however has been held to be a valid prohibition of preinduction judicial review when the board has used its judgment and has determined a classification for a registrant based upon the merits of his case the civil service retirement act

stated i concur in the denial of certiorari in this case but solely out of considerations of timing questions of great importance to the washington area are presented by the petition not the least of which is whether the court of appeals has for a second time unjustifiably frustrated the efforts of the executive branch to comply with the will of congress as rather clearly expressed in 23 of the federalaid highway act of 1968 82 stat 827 if we were to grant the writ however it would be almost a year before we could render a decision in the case it seems preferable therefore that we stay our hand in these circumstances congress may of course take any further legislative action it deems necessary to make unmistakably clear its intentions with respect to the three sisters bridge project even to the point of limiting or prohibiting judicial review of its directives in this respect italics added in those cases in which congress could not possibly have intended a withdrawal of judicial reviewthat is where there is unconstitutional or otherwise blatantly lawless action on the part of an agencythe courts have interpreted such provisions accordingly to assume that the judiciary would entertain an action for declaratory relief or otherwise by simply alleging the unconstitutionality of section 203 d is to ignore both the saving construction placed upon provisions such as thse in the
