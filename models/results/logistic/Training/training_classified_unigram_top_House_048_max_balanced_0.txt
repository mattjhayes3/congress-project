agricultural department for the fiscal year ending the 30th june 1885 hiving carefully considered all of the wants of that department have been as liberal in their recommendations to the house as they could well do from an economic standpoint the bill appropriates 430 590 which is an increase of 24 950 over the amount appropriated for the present fiscal year and is 81 550 less than the estimates sent to congress for the next fiscal year but the above sum it appears meets the approbation of the commissioner who has spoken complimentally of the liberality of the committee the sum appropriated for this department one of the most important in the country when compared with the appropriations made to carry on any other department of the government looks very small and insignificant but the committee believed it was sufficient and the commissioner has approved it and expressed himself as fully satisfied with our action the great prosperity atfending every branch of business and especially that of agriculture for the past few years the great increase in our population and growth of our manufacturing industries is wonderful the benefits derived by the agricultural interests of the country at large from the many valuable scientific examinations and reports made through this department in regard to modes of farming the habits and mode of destroying insects injurious to the crops of the country the contagious and infectious diseases of animals the distribution of improved and valuable seeds have had a wonderful effect upon the country and i am constrained to believe that this department if properly encouraged by liberal appropriations to enable it to carry out and perfect all such examinations and reports will in the future develop a greater interest in its success and management than has ever been exhibited before the wonderful growth and increase in our wealth and population is mainly due to the agricultural interests of the country to prove this i herewith submit the following statement which was furnished me by hon j r dodge chief statistician of the agricultural department in regard to the production and export of three of the leading articles of our export trade to wit cotton breadstuffs and animal industries which is as follows in eighteen years before the war cotton production amounted to 53 000 000 bales in eighteen years since 1865 the production amounts to 75 000 000 bales the annual average in the first period was nearly 3 000 000 bales in the latter more than 4 000 000 the consumption in this country is almost exactly twice as much in the latter period amounting to nearly onethird of the product whereas it was before but onefifth the average exports ofcotton between 1825 and 1830 were valued at 826 624 436 in 1883 the value was 247 328 721 yet in the first case the exports were52 6 per cent of all agricultural exports while those of last year were but 36 1 per cent of agricultural exports great as these exports of cotton are the aggregate foreign shil ents of our agriculture are nearly three times as much breadstuffs amounted to 08 049 29 and animal products to 131 015 453 this comes from variety in industry there is no less cotton on the contrary there is very much more and many other productions besides of far greater value even than the cotton since 1865 the exports of cotton have brought 3 665 940 553 into the country and yet those of bread and meat have been greater amounting to 4 180 734 410 for seven years past breadstuffs alone have brought more money from abroad than cotton the following statement

183 619 269 449 77 00 from these figures it will be observed that the export trade in cotton has not increased since the year 1866 up to the year 1883 because the demand abroad would not justify its exportation the amount exported for the past nineteen years averaging about the same but the increased manufacturing facilities in this country with our large increase in population has consumed the balance including the large increase in production while this is the case with cotton the export trade in breadstuffs has increased more than 100 per cent from the year 1870 to the year 1876 and nearly 100 per cent from 1876 to 1883 over the export trade the previous six years the export trade in animal products has increased in a like ratio or from 1870 to 1876 it had increased over 100 per cent over the three years preceding that date and then from 1876 to 1883 the export trade in animal products had nearly doubled the last prior six years when our total exports for the last fiscal year reached the enormous sum of 804 223 632more than it was ever known to reach before except in the years 1880 and 1881 seventyseven per cent of this or 619 269 449 was of agricultural products this exhibit ought and i think will convince the most skeptical financier that the present great and growing prosperity of our country is due in a great measure to the agricultural industries of the country which have produced this large surplus that has fed and clothed more than 50 000 000 of our own people and then brought more than 619 000 000 into this country from other countries who hpve purchased our products to feed and clothe their people in one year the lowest average per cent of our export trade in agricultural exports from the year 1850 up to the year 1883 is 72 per cent ranging up as high as 83 per cent of the whole the average value of all animal products except that of cattle remains near the same for the past ten years while that of cattle has more than doubled in thattime and the price of breadstuffs which is always governed by supply and demand fluctuates according to the supply and demand in the country then in my judgment the great agricultural industries of this country are greatly superior in value to that of any other industry in fact all other industries are dependent entirely upon it and could not prosper but for the hardfisted yeomen of the country who till the soil and produce this vast wealth then let us deal fairly and liberally with this branch of the government not extravagantly for extravagance begets corruption and fraud but let congress always vote money to anything that promotes the agricultural industries of the country the farming interests have a very small representation on this floor farmers never hang around congress as lobbyists nor do they employ any one to lobby for them but they till the soil and bring forth nearly all of our riches for which they should have due regard and protection in their honorable pursuits and congress should never forget the men who thus produce so much wealth annually i claim to be an humble farmer and know whereof i speak in thus giving my views in regard to the agricultural industries of the country i trust it will not be considered out of place in me to express my opinions in regard to otherquestions pending before congress some of which are yet to be acted upon and others that have been disposed of i know it is common for men to differ and upon great political questions it is right and proper that men should differ and that they should freely commune together and exchange their views upon all questions that they may have to pass upon and when the time for action comes let us look alone to the welfare of our common country i believe that every member of this honorable body desires to legislate for the good of the whole country but it is natural that men should differ and differ widely as to what is best for the country at large i know that local interests influence the action of many of us i think it is a duty that every representative owes to his constituents who elected him to this honorable and responsible office to represent the will and wishof those constituents so far as they may make it known to him and to endeavor to the best of his ability to carry out their wishes upon all bills of a public nature a member who will not do this should be retired by his constituents and one selected who would have due regard for those he represents believing this i think in my course in this congress i know the wishes of my constituents which are in accord with my own views having opinions of my own thus backed by an honorable and noble constituency and believing them to be for the best interests not only of those whom i have the honor to represent but for the whole country i dare express my opinions and to stand by them under no circumstances could i be induced to cast a vote that i believed would be detrimental to the best interests of those whom i am endeavoring to represent i may differ with many of my friends on both sides of this house but my convictions are from an honest heart and a desire to do something that will remove a great and an unjust burden that rests upon the people of the country and upon none with a heavier and more oppressive hand than upon farmers producers and laboring men who can not come to congress to lobby for relief nor ein they employ counsel to advocate their claims for relief but must depend upon the slow and tardy action of congress on the 1st day of april the report ofthe secretary of the treasury showed a surplus of available cash in the treasury of more than 150 000 000 with more than 400 000 000 cash in the treasury with a surplus over demands flowing into the treasury annually of about 120 000 000 and with collections wrung from the pockets of our constituents of more than 1 000 000 per day now with these facts before us it is conceded on all sides that we should reduce taxation to such an extent as the revenues will be ample to pay the ordinary expenses of the government economically administered pay pensions and pay our bonded indebtedness as it matures then how shall we reduce it and by reducing taxation relieve the people of the burdens above referred to in my opinion the best way to do so is to abolish the entire internalrevenue system the country demands and exp cts this congress to meet and dispose of this issue to cease collecting this large surplus that goes into the treasury and is there hoarded up as a temptation to extravagant legislation fraud and corruption i have been a steadfast advocate of this proposition ever since a surplus was being collected and now when the surplus is growing and the demands upon the treasury are growing less by diminishing the public debt by reducing interest and the payments of the arrears of pensions it is the best time we have ever had to abolish the entire system some honorable gentlemen argue that they will never vote for free whisky with a tax upon sugar and salt i do not advocate free whisky if it was in my power to do so i would prohibit the use of whisky or any intoxicating drink as a beverage but that is an impossibility and should not now be discussed when a bill was brought into the house by the ways and means committee of the fortyseventh congress to reduce internal taxation i had strong hopes thatwe could accomplish much morethan was done by that bill but was disappointed our republican friends who brought in that bill made a great flourish of trumpets as to what they would do to reduce taxation and they are entitled to the gratitude of the world for their liberality and magnanimity in removing the 1cent stamp on matches 2cent stamp on patent medicines 2cent stamp on bankchecks and upon bank capital and deposits and by hard pleading by the friends of the farmer we did prevail upon them to let a farmer or producer of tobacco sell one hundred dollars w~rth of his own production of tobacco without paying a license tax but they refused to allow him to remove his tobacco from the place of production in order to find a purchaser this they considered magnanimous to the farmer they then began a revision of the tariff with an assurance that they would make large reductions as recommended by that humbugging tariff commission and among their first efforts was to show their friendship for the agricultural industries by knocking the tariff down upon american wool without a corresponding reduction upon woolen manufactures in other words they struck down american wool to enable the american manufacturer to make the better profits upon his manufactured goods and when they had forced their tariffbill through the house under the gag and with much labor and tribulation and then when the calm after the storm has come and a close examination as to the effects of the tariff reduction we find that the reduction upon an average is only about2perent but then they hadaccomplishedagreat work instead of abolishing the entire internalrevenue law as they should have done they had relieved the poor distressed banks whose annual net profits are about 40 000 000 of the tax upon deposits circulation and checks they had relieved the manufacturer of matches of 1 cent per box and patent medicines 2 cents per bottle all of these reductions inuring to the benefit of the banks and manufacturers they did not touch an article that abolished an office or saved a dollar in the expense of collecting that was in keeping with that party so long as they have been in power they have not shown a disposition to abolish an office or curtail expenditures in the administration of affairs and now the question is brought squarely before this democratic house as to the best means to reduce taxation and reduce the large surplus that is daily flowing into the treasury some disposition of this kind is an imperative duty upon this congress it is our duty tomeet the issue and we should do so at once and save the taxpayers from the unnecessary burdens resting upon them my convictions as tothe best means to get rid of this surplus and to reduce taxation to the demands of the government economically administered are well known by every member of this house who served in the three last preceding congresses i have given the subject a thorough consideration and feel a very great interest in the subject because my constituents are interested and i believe the total abolition of all internal taxation would be one of the very best moves that could be made by the democratic party internal taxation has never been resorted to by our government except as a war measure it was always obnoxious to the masses and was repealed at the very earliest day possible and now nearly twenty years after our late civil war with a treasury full and overflowing with money there can be no valid reason for continuing the law i may differ with many of my good democratic friends upon this subject nevertheless i claim the right to judge for myself and for those who sent me here i have as much faith in the ultimate success of the democratic party as any one here and i propose to stand by my party and do battle for her triumph if a majority of my party differ with me it does not discourage me nor will it drive me from the party i will always go with my party jn everything that tends to promote its success or that will benefit the country and if i choose to differ with some on grave questions it will be a difference of opinion only and will in no wise alienate me from the party my only regret on this point is that we can not all see alike that we could have no party divisions but as the question how best to go about reducing taxation and revenue is before us i like many others have my views and i propose to advocate them let the consequences be what they may personally i have very little feeling upon the subject but i know those whom i represent have a great interest at stake and knowing this increases my desires upon the subject there are but two propositions to reduce taxation one is the abolition of the internal taxes and the other is by a reduction of the tariff and i propose to show that it is better to reduce taxation by abolishing internalrevenue taxation and let the tariff alone for the present if it is an odious tariff the republican party are responsible for it and i am willing to give it a fair trial without indorsing any of its unjust discriminations if we scale the tariff as proposed by the honorable committee on ways and means we are not certain as to its effects we do not know whether it will increase or diminish the revenue when we want to reduce the revenue if by reducink the tariff rates as proposed in that bill it increases the importations in a corresponding ratio we will have as much revenue as now but if the importations remain the same as now of course there will be a reduction of revenue to that extent but no human being can tell how that will be whether the tariff bill reported will increase or diminish the revenue a scaling tariff duty will not save a dollars expense in the collection as it costs as much to collect a low tariff duty as it does a high one upon the other hand if we will abolish the internalrevenue law we know exactly what we are doing we know that we will reduce the revenue about 120 000 000 annually we know that we will save over 5 000 000 paid annually to over 5 000 internalrevenue officers employed to collect it and at least five millions more that is paid out annually in costs fees of professional witnesses spies informers marshals attorneys and others thus at one swoop we would save at least 10 000 000 in salaries and expenses which could be added to other receipts of the government the repeal of this law would rid the country of many thousand men employed in the execution of the law who care tbr nothing save the money they can make out of it whether honestly or not and who are a curse to the country and a disgrace to the government do this and the people who have been harassed and bedeviled by this class of men will once more feel like free and independent american citizens the ways and means committee a few weeks ago reported their first relief bill to this house in the shape of a bill extending the period for whisky in bond to five years and that being a bill of great importance alone to the distiller and wholesale dealer it took precedence and we consumed one entire week in listening to speeches for and against the bill and every speech and argument used in favor of the passage of that bill was that the treasury was full and the country or the government djd not need the money if that is true why keep the law upon the statutebooks why not repeal or abolish the law and stop collecting this tax that is admitted upon all hands is unnecessary the plea that there was an overproduction was not a good one and one that congress could not entertain if they did the manufacturer of iron and other products might follow the example as they doubtless would and claim relief from congress by reason of overproduction and claim that prices were not regulated by supply and demand every argument used by the friends of the bondextension bill confirms me in my opinions as to the necessity of repealing the law as stated before i am no advocate for free whisky buti want toget rid of this curse upon the country turn the whole question over to the states let them levy and collect a tax by their state officers upon the manufacture and sale of spirits give grand juries inquisitorial powers to prevent frauds and by this means they could raise a very large revenue which they could add to their school fund or deduct it from taxes upon real estate and other property it would be a great source of state revenue to many of the states that would be glad to levy and collect such a tax and i have no doubt every state where it is manufactured would avail itself of the benefits of such a law if the honorable gentlemen comprising the committee on ways and means will heed the appeals made to them by the people oppressed by the law they would soon report a bill if not to repeal or to abolish the law to change and simplify the collection of these taxes and thereby greatly reduce the expenses of collection and prevent the many outrages perpetrated upon people of the country by unprincipled subordinates employed in its execution if in their judgment congress can not abolish the entire system then let them report a bill coming half way by abolishing all of the small privilege taxes also the tax upon tobacco cigars and snuff and upon distilleries used exclusively fbr the distillation of fruits and berries this would reduce internal revenue about 26 000 000 per annum as shown by a statement furnished me by the honorable commissioner of internal revenue which shows that the receipts from fruit distilleries for the first seven months of this fiscal year were only 716 461 20 from tobacco all sources 14 938 905 39 now this reduction can safely be made and if the tariff bill should make a reduction of even forty millions there would be no deficit in revenue even this much would be of vast benefit to the people of the country it would relieve owners of orchards of a great embarrassment would encourage the growth and culture of fruit and would in no wise increase the consumption of spirits as a beverage the report of the commissioner of internal revenue shows a list of officers consisting of 126 collectors 981 deputy collectors 852 gangers 1 855 storekeepers 1 435 clerks and other employds and 35 inspectors of tobaccoin all 5 284enough to form a respectable brigade of officeholders employed to execute a law that is now unnecessary besides the above there are thousands of deputy marshals united states commissioners professional witnesses informers and spies who live entirely by the pickings afforded them by this law and who should be made to go to work for a living the commissioners report makes a favorable report als to the expense of collecting this revenue in the main but when you come to look at the cost of collection by district and get a little farther away from the department every one is bound to admit there is a great waste of public money for which no valid excuse can be given take tennessee for instance the second collection district collected 119 241 32 ivenue at a cost of 33 240 68 or about 28 per cent the fifth collection district collected 979 279 85 at a cost for collecting of 93 686 58 nearly 10 per cent the eighth collection district collected 75 369 12 at a cost of 12 004 51 or 16 per cent in thesecond gorgia district the cost of collecting was 23 per cent and in the third georgia district it was 25 per cent in the second alabama district the cost of collecting was 31 per cent in the second north carolina district the cost of collection was 33 per cent and in the sixth north carolina district it was 40 per cent now with these facts before us with a large surplus in the treasury are we justified in keeping such a law upon the statutebooks there is no excuse for it unless it be expressly for the purpose of giving away the revenue thus collected to an army of officeholders because no sane man will argue that this large expenditure is necessary in addition to this heavy expense look at the cost trouble and expense this law executed as it is by such a class of men in the interior entails upon the people of thecountry who are charged with its violation o i could find hundreds of instances of outrages that have been perpetrated by these pretended officials upon honest unoffending citizens purely for the purpose of blackmail and fees then is it good policy to keep such a law upon the statutes a law that is more abused than any in existence all when we do not need the money and right here in reply to the idea that this large expenditure was necessary to suppress moonshining i desire to say that all the moonshiners in the country together have not swindled the government out of half as much as have the regularly licensed distillers i do not mean to charge that they all do so or that any do now but that such has been the case as was proven in the whiskyring scandal a few years ago the commissioners report shows suits began for violations of internal revenue in the year 1883 to be4 558 eachsuitofthis characterwillcostthe defendant if acquitted at least 50 in counsel fees traveling and other expenses and if convicted it will cost him not less than 100 making upon an average thirty or forty thousand dollars per annum wrung from the pockets of a class of people usually poor and unable to bear such expenses and generally not well informed as to the law all of this money goes into the pockets of the shylocks who are thus seeking their pound of flesh take the above number of suits and costs for the past ten years and you have 45 000 suits at a cost to the defendants of three or four hundred thousand dollars all with a treasury full of money on the second monday in january last the unitedstates court met at knoxville it was a cold wintry day with a deep snow on the ground there were present three hundred and twentyfive witnesses and one hundred and fifty defendants all ruthlessly dragged away from their homes and their families during that severe wintry weather by the united states marshals upon charges ofa violation of the internalrevenue law and when the district judge learned that a majority of the defendants had been arrested for buying and selling saint jeromes bitters and hostetters bitters he instructed the grand jury not to find any true bills and told the parties thus arrested to go home but that did not pay for the humiliation of being arrested and carried off fifty to seventyfive miles to court their expenses and counsel fees this is a sample of the way in which the law is executed throughout the south then is it any wonder that the people clamor for its repeal it is generally in the south executed by men of little character and less regard for the law and justice there were 3 036 suits dismissed last year the government or the defendants have the costs to pay there were pending 1st july last 3 227 suits the expenses of the department of justice last year were nearly 3 000 000 and it was not all paid to starroute attorneys at one to two hundred dollars per day but it is reasonable to suppose that large sums of this expenditure went to district attorneys and others on these frivolous prosecutions in internalrevenue cases against a poor class of people generally unable to pay counsel fees the authorities deal very harshly with the people in the interior for very trifling offenses much more so than it does with men for greater ones it has not been very long since an officer in this city holding a high and honorable position was found to be a defaulter not to use a harsher name to the amount of 150 000 he was arrested and imprisoned for a few weeks and then turned loose in this city in broad daylight bya united states deputy marshal and apparently no effort made to recapture him i allude to captain howgate i am no apologist for any lawbreaker but my opinion is if captain howgate had been a common countryman he would today be undergoing a long sentence in some penitentiary the reports show the convictions last year for violations of internalrevenue lawto be2 664 acquittals 600 nolled or quashed 1 400 all this trouble expense and litigation when we do not want the money now i say let us repeal the entire law raise money enough to run the government by import dues and if at any time it should be necessary to raise more revenue then it would be easy to place a small income tax upon the wealth of the country its rich banks and bankers railroads manufacturers bondholders and the like and not be making the poor of the country pay all of the taxes while there is so much wealth in the countrymtaxed the national banks and railroads built by land grants and subsidies are the creatures of congress they are all protected by the strong arm of the law the annual profits of this untaxed wealth is more than a thousand millions of dollars per annum and still they do not pay a dollar toward defraying the expenses of the government while every dollar of internalrevenue tax is collected directly from the products of labor and the soil this is all wrong and there is no better time to right this wrong than now"], [0.005915727466344833, 0.005915727466344833, 0, "i hardly think it necessary for ime to say more than a word on this subject nor would i do even that were it not for the fact that it is a question to which i have given careful and long investigation i need not say to the members who have served with me previously in this house that i am in favor of the improvement of the mississippi river my position upon that question is well understood and i took it after very laborious work upon examination i came to the conclusion that the mississippi iver commission had devised the proper plan and i have never yet tanged my mind in that regard that commission is composed of able careful capable men and their plan is the result of long and atient study of the river and the principles which govern these siltbearing streams now this special appropriation of 1 000 000 simply involves the question of whether we will permit that commission to go on with their experiment for i must say to my friend from arkansas that i differ with him in this regard i do not think the success of their plan is settled beyond question by any means indeed i consider it still an experiment i wish it could be set down among the certainties but do not let us appropriate money here under any misunderstanding there are many good men in the united states able men who sincerely believe that every dollar we appropriate to the mississippi river upon the plan adopted by that commission might as well be dumped into the river that it is a mere waste of money i say good men intelligent men believe that on the other hand many good men believe the other way have faith in this plan i know that because i believe that way myself is not that convincing proof i believe that the commission have adopted the only plan that will ever successfully improve and control that stream i know it will involve a large expenditure of money before we get through but i believe the enterprise is so magnificent so fir reaching in its results of so much importance to the commerce and development of this country that as a nation we ought to undertake it in doing this i do not believe it will ever be done successfully without leveeing the banks as the commission has determined now if in building these levees for the purpose of confining its waters and thereby deepening its channel so as to improve the navigation of this river what if it does happen to benefit the people who live upon its shores and admit if you please that they are a people who have differed with me seriously in the past so seriously that it requires an immense effort to work myself up to a point where i can labor in their behalf and i admit that it costs me a struggle still i say even if it does benefit thesepeople in the name of god shall we withhold an appropriation of this kind on that account i glory in the fact that it is likely to redeem from the overflowing waters of that stream land enough to make a state that fact is an additional reason to me for favoring the project and not an objection to the enterprise but the only question which we have before us today is whether we will permit this commission to go on withits plan and complete its work if we intend to do so then we should give them this money because the last appropriation will be exhausted and then the delay will cause more damage than the amount of this appropriation if the work is suspended until the regular river and harbor bill can be passed work on that river can not be prosecuted during the floodtime they need to get ready for the high water of the springtime thus you see it is simply a question of whether we will rely on that commission and stand by them in their attempt to do this work or whether we intend to abandon them and the work altogether i am glad that my friend from iowa has abandoned his effort to add another appropriation to this bill this is not the first time we have passed a special appropriation for aneeded work in advance of the regular bill members will remember that in the last congress the engineers reported they were in need of 50 000 at hell gate for the protection and completion of work there and that they needed the funds before we could pass the regular river and harbor bill and a bill was passed in the fortyseventh congress meeting that emergency which gave them that amount of money in advance as a rule i do not believe in putting these special appropriations through in advance of the regular bill but this case i think is an exception a just and proper exception one which should be made in deference to the public good i do not believe in passing an appropriation for this stream simply because it is the mississippi river any other work with the same surroundings should receive the same attention i said the other day that some men seemed to think that the mississippi river was the only water way in the united states i live upon a chain of lakes tbe cominerce of which in tonnage is

as to whether or not the plan on which the work is progressing will succeed i know there is a serious question in the minds of many who have studied this matter carefully as to whether we can tame this great river and control its forces some think it an undertaking beyond the power of man it is a big job a grave question great doubts exist in the minds no doubt of many of us i know that i have my fears on this question but i prefer to take counsel of my hopes rather than my fears i believe that this great nation should make the experiment and if we fail we can survive it while if we succeed it will be to our glory as a nation and as a people for all time then let us try it for a while longer let us not higgle about the matter let us do the work like business men and if the men who are intrusted with this important labor are out of funds let us give them sufficient to keep the work going until we make of it a success or are satisfied that it is a fiflure when the people become

at the remarks of my friend from illinois after what had takenplace between us i do not quite understand his criticisms but i want to call attention to some facts in connection with the necessities of commerce at this point you are legislating for the commerce and for the wants of the navigation of this country do you realize where the commerce of this country is do you realize the fact that out of about 24 082 vessels belonging to these united states 18 178 belong to the atlantid coast the members of this house are asking for liberal appropriations for the rivers and lakes of the interior and i am with them most heartily for i am in favor of liberal appropriations but i call attention to the statistics of our commerce which after all is the best indication of the condition and wants of the country of the entire commerce of the country as measured by vessels 18 178 are engaged in the trade on the atlantic coast of that 18 178 5 888 vessels or nearly onefourth of the whole commerce of the

their grandchildren have long since gone the way of all the earth but the hoary claims themselves are immortal they appear before us this january morning in the year 1885 as fresh and vigorous as when in the last century they commenced their journey to the nations treasury i know of only two possible grounds on which the liability of the united states to these claimants can be based it has been suggested not by the gentleman who has just taken his seat but elsewhere that between the years 1793 and 1800 our government failed to do its whole duty to the merchants and others who met with losses on the high seas that there was some negligence in failing to press with zeal these claims upon the french government there is a suggestion though it hardly takes the form of argument that because the french government allowed its cruisers to prey upon our commerce and because our merchants were unable to obtain redress there arose in some way a claim for redress against the home government but i am satisfied that it will not be contended by the lawyers upon this floor or anywhere that there is any validity in such a claim a good government is always eager to protect the rights of its citizens from foreign aggression but there is no rule of law which compels a government to reimburse its citizens for the losses they may incur in the hazards of commerce moreover it can be confidently asserted that no government ever struggled more assiduously to obtain redress for the wrongs of its citizens than did our struggling republic in those eventful years between 1793 and 1800 if time permitted i could review the long series of acts which brought our government to the vbry verge of war in its attempts to enforce these claims but i pass at once to what i conceive to be the only plausible ground on which these claims can be based it is alleged that when the final treaty of 1800 was made between france and the united states our government traded off these private claims of its own citizens growing out of the losses i have mentioned for a claim which france held against us and that thereby in law and in justice our government assumed the payment of these claims on that basis rest all these claims on that assumption is founded this whole argument i admit sir that theargumentis ingenious iregard the argument made by mr sumner in that famous report of 1870 as one of the ablest productions of that remarkable man but with all deference to the distinguished gentlemen who assert the validity of these claims it seems to me that their argument rests upon this false assumption that france hada valid claim against our government it has been argued with much earnestness and force by thomas h benton by silas wright and by other eminent statesmen that when the treaty of 1800 was made it was the settlement of actual war between france and the united states if that view be correct under the laws of nations these claims were no longer valid against any government but without stopping to press this argument i may admit for the purposes of the discussion that our citizens did hold valid claims against france growing out of the depredations upon our commerce the more serious question is did france have any valid claim against our government if there was such a claim existing and valid under the laws of nations there is some solid foundation upon which the ingenious arguments of gentlemen can rest now sir out of what did this pretended claim of france arise there is but one answer out of the old treaty of alliance between france and the colonies made in 1778 and the alleged violation of that treaty by the united states when the french monarchy passed away and the new republic arose from its ruins the visionaries of france were disposed to draw our young republic into the great struggle which was convulsing all europe it seemed to be the opinion of the impetuous french minister genet that the treaty of 1778 bound our government to enter upon any war in which france might be engaged offensive or defensive he claimed that french privateers had not only the right to enter our ports but to enlist american seamen for foreign war and to build on our soil ships fbr foreign aggression in fact that they had the right to make america the theatre of this great war between england and france but the gentlemen who composed the administration of the government of the united states in 1793 and between that time and 1800 never for one moment yielded to any such absurd pretensions at the head of that government was the father of his country the cabinet was composed of such men as jefferson hamilton and edmund randolphmen who knew something of international law who knew something of that treaty and the force of its obligations the history of that time shows that these great men carefully considered the provisions of that memorable treaty they concluded that it imposed no obligation upon our government to enter upon that offensive warfare which france was entering upon and which not long afterward indulged the ambition of napoleon i must not trespass upon the time of the house to read even extracts from that treaty for one i am willing to accept the construction placed upon it by the sages and the fathers of the republic no one will contend that jefferson can be accused of any leaning toward england or any prejudice against france it is enough to say without entering into elaborate argument upon this treaty that the great statesmen of that day never failed to insist that our government was under no obligation to engage in this great european war do gentlemen understand the full meaning of this claim that our government under the administration of washington violated its treaty it means that we must reject the views of the men who formed that treaty and who bore so conspicuous a part in those memorable events not only that the suggestion imputes a breach of faith a violation of solemn obligations made with frdnce on the part of those very men who of all others were likely to be animated by sentiments of gratitude toward their old ally at this distance from those events gentlemen flippantly assert that our government violated this solemn treaty i appeal from these claimants and their advocates to the opinions of washington of jefferson and of hamilton they always insisted that our government had kept its faith and that france had been the first and constant violator of this treaty and they were right it was one of the vital and most valuable provisions of that treaty that free ships should make free goods in 1793 at the very outset of these difficulties between france and the united states the french government issued a proclamation renouncing this principle from the day that france gave this stab to the treaty of 1778 it had no worth or vitality to the united states but from that day on until 1798 france was violating every month i think it safe to say every day the provisions of the treaty what was our government doing between 1793 and 1800 american ships were being driven from the seas preyed on today by the french cruisers tomorrow by the english cruisers both france and england violating not only their treaties hut every rule of international law did our government fail in any way in its duty toward these claimants not at all from the very beginning our government was carrying on negotiations for the redress of these wrongs she sent commissioners and envoys repeatedly to franceto secure for these claimants their rights she exhausted every art of diplomacy not omrly that our government was not only negotiating in a peaceable way but went to the very verge of war preparations were made for war expenditures for troops and the building of vessels were authorized american vessels were authorized to retaliate and to bring into port for condemnation vessels bearing the flag of france finally washington after he had ceased to be president was called from private life to take conimand of the american army he gave as one of the reasons for responding to the call that the aggressions of france had become unbearable and he referred to her repeated violations of the treaty how can it be claimed that france could make this treaty which she had persistently violated and spurned for years a basis of a claim for damages will gentleman contend on this floor that france was not the contracting party which first broke the compact could france violate and ignore the treaty for seven long years and then invoke its aid and seek indemnity when did france discover that she had a claim against the united states when our commissioners in 1800 went to france to negotiate concerning these claims and also to secure future peace to american commerce then for the first time as i remember the facts arose this most remarkable pretension upon the part of france then it was that france put forward the claim that we were indebted to her in the first instance the french commissioners scouted the idea that private citizens had claims against france they asserted that there had been war between france and the united states and that our citizens like other must accept the hazards of war but as i will show presently talleyrand came to their relief with a more diplomatic if not more plausible defense what was the condition of france her armies were scattered her treasury was exhausted she had not a sou with which to pay these claims of 20 000 000 or more what did she do her minister of foreign affairs talleyrand was equal to the emergency with sublime audacity he trumps up this pretension that our government was indebted to franco in a far greater sum and upon what ground because we had failed to keep our treaty the very treaty which france had despised the treaty which she had been breaking from 1793 to 1800 the treaty which had long since ceased to be in effect between the two nations then they brought forward this claim what could our commissioners do they could not say to talleyrand or his commissioners you are a pack of knaves and rascals the claim you present is a pretense and a sham that would not have been diplomatic language

take the floor at this time for the purpose of saying that i believe it will be demonstrated in the future that this mississippi river improvement plan is the colossal waste and extravagance of the age i do not care if in the improvement of the navigation of the river it should result in reclaimniug all of the inundated lands along the margin of the riverthat is if such shll prove to be the result of the plan intended in good faith for the improvement of the navigation of the river indeed as i have had occasion to say once or twice already upon this floor in the discussion of this and kindred measures i hope such may prove to be the result of any plan that may ultimately be successful in making its navigation complete but i have said that i believed it would be demonstrated that this is a vast waste and a tremendous extravagance because i do not believe it is within the power of science by any manner of construction of embankments to confine the waters of the river within a narrowqr channel to either improve the navigation of the river or secure from inundation the lands adjacent to it on either side years ago i have myself seen the mississippi river when it seemed to have no banks on either side i was convinced as i think every intelligent gentleman would be who has witnessed it in those days of flood that it was not in the power of science or within the limits of the possibilities of the treasury of the people of this country to levee the mississippi river within such limits as will protect the riparian owners and it is singular to me that this system adopted by the mississippi river commission is intended to improve the navigation where there is too little water and also to continue the same plan when there is too much water now i can understand perfectly well that where the river is shoal where the bed is wide where the water is shallow by confining its waters by narrowing the channel you may improve the navigation and if this systesn of levees or embankments or whatever you may call it was confined to such portions of the mississippi river i would have some fiith in its ultinate success but whatis the truth as was said by the distinguished gentleman from ohio and i think i may say from my own knowledge of the lower mississippi river for eight to ten months in the year there is abundance of water all the way from the city of memphis to the city of new orleans indeed the trouble that is experienced on the lower mississippi river is that there is too much water and yet it is assumed here that an appropriation is to be niade to make more navigable a river which is already too much so what you gentlemen wantand you might just as well tell us soon the lower mississippi river is not to improve its navigation when there is difficulty in getting your boats along over its satdbars but you want an improvement that will confine the waters of the stream within a channel when there is too much water there and when your lands are inundated by it and the mississippi river commission has adopted a plan to diminish the volume of water by attempting to confine it within narrower limits when anybody whether he is a scientist or otherwise who knows anything of the laws of hydrostatics knows that what you want when you have too much water is to get clear of it and you may say as much as you please about captain cowden being a crank and all that my belief is that the rglief you seek can only be got by the outlet system tapping the mississippi river when there is too much water and drawing it off the surface the time was when the lower mississippi country was not inundated as it is now and why because when the river was at flood the water escaped into your bayous and your lagoons and your lakes and they were filled with water nature had made the outlet it went when it left the river into these places where it remained but by the system of levees adopted by the states you endeavored to confine the river within its embankments and a muskrat or a crawfish making a hole in the embankment after a while the waters waging their war in that direction cut your levees and your country became inundated in the mean time while in this way you rescued these low places the result is they become filled and now when your waters escape there is no place fbr them to go except all over the country and you are inundated

submuits that according to the nearest estimate that can be reached it will take for the present fiscal year 2 000 000 more than the 9 250 000 that was appropriated we know that for 1883 10 300 000 was required we are assured that for this year the cost of this branch of the service will be 9 250 000 plus 2 000 000 but the gentleman says we have given 10 500 000 and the department only asked for 10 600 000 the postmastergeneral says after a considcration of all the circumstances of the case i am of the opinion that the amnount maid for the quarter ended march 31 1883 2 660 339 53 is the best present basis for an estimate which multiplied by four would give 10 641 358 12 for the fiscal year 188485there the gentleman stopped but the postmastergencral does not stop there he continues as follows exclusive of the annual increase in this item placing this natural increase at 750 000 for the present fiscal year and at 835 000 for the next year which periods will imcl tide two readj ustments of salaries at first second and third class offices i judge that the total amount required for compensation to postmasters for the fiscal year ending june 30 1885 would be about 12 216 358 12 of this amount it is estimated that at least 4 000 000 willbe required to paypostmastersat presideintial oflices the numiber of these offices on theist of october last was 2 t95 and it is thought that for several coming quarters the increase will average about 45 offices per quarter or 180 annually on the knowledge of what it was two years ago and on a fair estimate of the known increase of the service for fie present and the next fiscal year the department asks for 12 250 000 comuing to the question of percentage the gentleman does not quote correctly the language of the postmastergeneral the latter says on no preceding occasion has it been so difficult to make anything like an accurate estimate for compensation to postmasters as at this time for several years past or since the passage of the law of june 17 1878 it has been ascertained that an estimate based upon from 20 to 25 per cent of the eslinmated receipts of the department for the fiscal year under consideration would approximate as near to the amountrequired as by any othermethod thisisno longer practicable however in consequence of the changes by the act of march last in tle rates of commissions paid postmasters which law has been interpreted so far is the compensation of fourthclass postmasters is concerned to take ellect from the date of its approval by the president march 3 1883"], [0.8894699215888977,

defect if i may say it without offense which has made it impossible for him to prepare a bill which would be operative and therefore useful one that would work and therefore that could be enforced itis an inability to make proper and natural distinctions i stated what under the laws of trade and nature will be and the gentleman claims that i stated what ought to lie as if i were the almighty

see the prophecy fulfilled and the business of this country blocked by the gentlemans bill and the action of the railways under it whether i am a true prophet or not time will show whether i have grounds for making this prophecy or not the past and its history fortunately can show there are precedents take a case coming out of this house not very different from this case which the gentleman from texas is anxious to inject into it both cases struck the legislation of the country probably the gentleman is not familiar with the case i refer to were he he would have recognized that my prophecy was only an easy prediction of the future from the past the gentleman from texas was in another section of the country and engaged in giving his high character and his great ability to the support of another cause when ka distinguished representative of pennsylvania equally able equally respectable giving his efforts to the cause of the union concluded that he would undertake by legislation to correct the crying evil of those times he thought the great obstacle to a successful prosecution of the war which was waged for our country was the speculation in goldwas that speculators would buy and sell it and raise its pricejust as the great trouble at this time in the opinion of the gentleman from texas is that railways will manage their business with the object of making money by it will charge for their services and will not consent to carry the freight and passengers of the country for nothing he sees that it would be for the interest of his section of the country if they were forced to change this policy so it was for the interest of mr stevenss section of the country in its loyal struggle that gold should be kept at par and he made the attempt to do it is there a man on this floor unless possibly my friend from texas who forgets the result of that effort the great republican leader passed his bill prohibiting all dealings in gold he too was shocked at the suggestion that any act of this august legislative body should stand helpless before the facts yet how short was the time before he found that his attempt to overcome the natural laws of trade and comnmerce was a pitiable ihtilure the price ofgold in proud defiance rose rapidly out of sight business was checked the existence of the country was threatened and wise as patriotic no

eloquent peroration that when the laws of commerce and trade should be found to bejust as potent against his edict as they were againstthat of thaddeus stevens lie would be just as wise and patriotic
