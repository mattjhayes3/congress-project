adequate and proper defense for america should this house reject the bloom warpromotion bill which has been dressed up in the robes of neutrality and should the president of the united states and his

people and i look forward to the day provision may be made to care for all our needy citizens whatever may be their occupation each of these changes in the law is desirable but i am particularly proud of the part played by the republican party in correcting the most unfortunate provision of the existing law the indefensible gigantic reserve fund which would have opened the path to a spending policy of even more incredible proportions than the one in which we are now floundering the elimination of this reserve and the placing of our funds in a true trust fund on a payasyougo basis are among the outstanding legislative achievements of this session of congress the republican members of the ways and means committee deserve the thanks of the nation for their part in establishing this change every congressman who votes for this measure does so with a complete awareness of its many shortcomings despite these failings i favor its passage in the interests of our deserving needy and the fulfillment of our obligations to them you gentlemen from georgia alabama and mississippi whine that your states cannot pay their just share of oldage pensions if your people would start voting the republican ticket they perhaps would not be in such dire need and your states would be able to pay the taxes of some northern republican states"]], "top_unsure": [[1.621246337890625e-05,

when he asked whether or not this authority has been requested for any other national park in the united states it has not and under no conceivable circumstances will such authorization be made as has been pointed out there is a unique situation existing in alaska tourists that come to alaska go up there get on the government railroad and end up at mount mckinley park when they reach there they are taken care of at a hotel we already have invested about 350 000 in facilities in this park and when i say we i mean the government after they get there if they want to go around the park and see some of the beauties of that region this private concessionaire takes them around but the cost has been excessive i think members of congress who were up there last summer complained to me when they got back to seattle about the cost it runs to around 30 or 35 the tourists are taken up to a camp at the foot of the mountain and there they live in tents all we are trying to do is allow the alaska railroad whch brings people there and houses them at the entrance to the park the right to take these tourists in busses around the park erect some cabins or a shelter over there so that the tourists may be comfortable when they get up to the upper reaches of the park where at this time there are only some tents the situation is unique it does not put the government in business any more than the government is in business now in mount mckinley national park it adds only to the existing facilities this year we expect double or triple the number of tourists that have been going there for the past few years on account of the situation abroad people are traveling in america from january to may the park is closed and it is necessary that this bill be passed now so that they may get supplies and materials up there to run this operation it is a rather unusual bill but when you lock at the circumstances involved you will see there is nothing wrong with it and that this is the only possible solution we have to the problem now existing in mount mckinley national park the government has invested this money the facilities are there and we bring our citizens up there show them the government investment take them on a government railroad house them in government hotels and when we take them around to see this grand glorious park and its beauties we charge them excessive rates we take them up to some tents in the upper reaches of the park i think this is the only way to solve the problem"], [1.627206802368164e-05, 0.5000162720680237, 0, "i understood the chairman to say this was
