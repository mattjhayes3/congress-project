this bill if enacted into law will confine transactions on the exchanges to crop products actually in existence and ready for delivery fixing proper penalties for violations of its provisions at the same time i introduced this billjuly 12 1911i knew in a general way the evils of exchange methods but their enormity was not known to me fully until the closing months of that year only a few years ago a large per cent of the lands and homes of southern farmers were under mortgage reduced to poverty by the war the southern soldier came home to enlist in an industrial struggle full of deprivation and little less terrible in its effects than the scenes of blood and carnage through which he had passed cotton by reason of its climatic adaptability and ready market value is the natural southern crop and its cultivation offered the 6nly hope to the southern farmer after the war of secession in the history of its decline in price to less than half the cost of production could be written a history of deprivation suffering and even want never before experienced by a people of like refinement and intelligence northern cotton mills were reaping a harvest they extended their investments to the south and north and south mill interests flourished as never before in the history of this country southern homes were swept from their owners and converted into mill profits and these in turn placed in new mills hard as was the struggle with the cotton farmer it was not without its beneficial results in creating new demand for his cotton though many were driven from their farms to seek work in the mills a better day began to dawn on those who remained on the farms increased manufacturing took cotton more and more out of the hands of the speculator and it began to command a price that gave a profit to the producer mortgages yellow with age were lifted from southern homes and peace and contentment could be read even in the lines of the furrowed brow these dark days in our history will never be reenacted our people have concluded that they are entitled to a part of the profit of their crop they have built warehouses and have so diversified their crops as to stand the assault of the cotton gambler and a few of them at least will share the profit with him and the mill man l etermined then as a few of our people are to have a share in the profit on their cotton the indignation they feel toward a lot of cotton gamblers whose market manipulations have robbed them of millions of dollars profit on this crop is not hard to understand the poorer the more helpless farmer had been squeezed out and forced to part with his crop below the cost of production this has already been fed to the greedy bear two years ago when messrs brown hayne scales and others were charged with maintaining a pool to hold up the price of cotton the attorney general of the united states had them indicted before a federal grand jury and for whose protection it was done at the instance of a lot of bear thieves who had systematically robbed southern planters for more than 30 years the indictment alleged that mill men had to pay a fictitious price for their cotton and many of them were forced to shut down i know something of the inside history of that socalled bull pool and i state as a fact that the idea originated with a southern mill president of la grange ga that the details were worked out at greenville in my own state and that socalled bull operators were brought in to aid the cotton manufacturers to uphold the price of raw material against the manipulations of a conscienceless baud of robbers as evidenice that the attorney general proceeded at the instance of the bear clique on the exchange not the character of the witnesses called without exception they were representatives of firms who had sold cotton heavily in excess of the supply and note the further fact that not a single mill man appears in the list of witnesses at the time the socalled bull pool came into existence the future cotton market was a cent a pound or more below the spot market held down by the bear gambler the drygoods merchant wanted to base the price in buying on the future and not the spotcotton market and refused to buy except on that basis this produced stagnation in the cloth market and it was to eliminate this feature that mill men originated the socalled pool to maintain a parity between the spot and the future market but suppose american cotton mills were placed at a slight disadvantage by bull support of the market call the attorney general be excused for protecting even them at the cost of millions to american commerce when we consider that the united states raises 69 9 per cent of the worlds supply of cotton and consumes only 24 7 per cent the magnitude of the injury done to american commerce and american business by the effort to depress the pric6 of cotton is apparent that his act did not reduce the price of cotton at the time more than 2 cents per pound is due to the stubborness with which hayne brown scales and others bought all actual cotton offered instead of accepting settlement of margins which is a trick of the trade to sell large quantities of cotton not in existence such a decline was confidently anticipated a week before brown and hayne knew that they were going to be prosecuted a bear firm in trying to get a certain party to sell the market said i know something is going to happen that will cause a break in the market of from 100 to 200 points suppose the break had materialized the result would have been on a basis of a 12 000 000bale crop and at a 2cent decline to give foreign spinners about 90 000 000 to save about 30 000 000 ostensibly to american spinners really to wall street gamblers will the time never come when government representatives and officers can see other interests thail those that are centered in new york is the hardworking respectable citizen of the united states to be held up by the government and fleeced under its protecting arm the enormity of the attorney generals act did not fully appear until the present crop was brought into sight the worlds consumption of cotton as stated in bulletin 113 page 23 of the department of agriculture is 21 000 000 bales on the same page we find the statement it appears probable that 14 500 000 bales of american cotton can be absorbed during the year ending august 31 1912 in other words the present crop will barely meet the demand conditions being normal in other cottonraising countries but conditions are not normal in other cottonraising countries in india for instance the crop is conceded to be short about 1 500 000 bales and we have heard lothing of a large crop in any other part of the world we raise as heretofore stated approximately 70 per cent and this represents say 15 000 000 bales the other cottonproducing countries raise 30 per cent or 6 400 000 bales the total then will be 21 400 000 bales as against a consumption of 21 000 000 but india as stated is 1 500 000 bales short which taken from the total supply would seem to indicate a shortage in the worlds supply of the crop of something like 1 100 000 bales of cotton we need 21 000 000 bales of cotton we have only 19 900 000 bales with which to supply them in the face of these facts cotton has been hammered down to 8 cents per pound 2 cents below the cost of production by a merciless set of vampires meaning no disrespect but in criticism of the narrowness of the attorney generals view and the shortsightedness of his policy i charge that he more than all other combined agencies is responsible for this condition his prosecution of the socalled bull element of the exchange has driven out competition and made the market a oilesided affair no single operator can affect prices on the exchange and no sane bull operator would enter a combination while he or his fellows were under prosecution by the federal courts charged with this very offense the bears may combine at will but for the bulls to combine is in restraint of trade is an affront to the gentlemen of wall street and proper cause for government intervention what a spectacle if the attorney general concludes finally that he can not proceed against bull operators i believe a committee of congress should make investigation of exchange methods if it is a fact that millions of bales of cotton are sold annually on the exchange that never had and were never intended to have existence thereby abnormally depressing its price then the evil should be eradicated in the name of common decency in consideration for the southern farmer who contributes more to the export trade of the united states than half of the rest of this country combined this piracy on his products should be stopped if the cotton exchanges are to be onesided affairs dominated by the bears it would be infinitely better to abolish them altogether congress should know the facts and knowing them should pass such legislation here as will protect the producers of this country a normal price for the present crop of cotton would have been 12j cents per pound much of it has sold as low as 8 cents per pound owing to bear manipulations aided and abetted by the government the cotton producer has easily lost 3 cents per pound on the entire crop or 215 000 000 and twothirds of this amount or approximately 145 000 000 has been given to foreign spinners"], [0.014670574106276035, 0.014670574106276035, 0, "i see in the bill provisions for virginia north carolina texas porto rico cuba and

taxation but if that is corrected i have no objection to that section in my judgment section 2 ought to be first amended and then stricken out of the bill if it is proposed to have the osage council

for recommendation and approved by it and then that the secretary of the interior after that approval shall have the right to permit the exchange i do not quite understand why these exchanges are

to get rid of them in some way by the exchange of homesteads and produce a condition of unrest among the indians which ought not to be produced the indian who has a homestead now ought to be using it as a homestead reducing it to cultivation but the moment you offer him the opportunity to trade it off you will excite his trading desires rather than his homestead desires and he will not be left in quiet because every man who has a chance to skin the indian will be proposing an exchange of homesteads and every homestead that is of particular value either because of the surface of the soil or what is under it will be subject to the temptation of having somebody making a trade with him these trades as a matter of c6urse would ordinarily be approved by the council or generally disapproved by them and i do not think it is fully safe to leave it even to the secretary of the interior who acts through agents there all of whom may be perfectly honestthough that would be an unusual condition of

this act sac 5 that this act shall go into effect on the 1st day of july 1913 the basic principle of this bill is compensation by the federal government for the use of the roads traveled by the mail carriers in the star route and rural delivery service tile constitutional power of the federal government to construct or promote works of internal improvement has been debated fromi the foundation of the republic heretofore the question of federal aid to the construction or maintenance of highways has been considered from the point of view either of appropriations in aid of the construction of such works as are authorized by the states and are national in their character or of appropriations for the direct construction of roads and canals in order to facilitate promote and give security to internal commerce among the several states and to render more easy and less expensive the means and provisions for the common defense rho chief obstacle thus far in the path of appropriations in aid of road miiaking or of road maintenance within the several states has been the indisposition on the part of the states to agree to any measure of fedoral control or authority over their roads no practicable scheme of joint operations using in part federal and in part state money has been or is likely to be devised one sole and responsible agency whether state or federal must do the work and all the funds appropriated for this work whether county state or national should be turned over to this agency this is what this bill proposes to do with respect to federal payments in compensation for use of the state roads the specter of federal interference with state or local affairs has been eliminated by the form ih which compensation will be made the public is familiarwith the system in vogue of compensating the railroads for tile transportation of mail matter and of government agents and agencies connected with the mail service the aggregate of these payments in the last fiscal year amounted to about 51 000 000 thousands of miles of exclusively state roads are in nse by rural and star route carriers at present these roads are maintained by the states though the federal government enjoys their free and uninterrupted use for its mail service whether by rural or star route carriers no reason is perceived why the government should not pay for use of these highways the amount of the payment to be determined in any given instance by the character of the road traveled by federal employees performing federal service for the purpose of this determination tie bill divides the roads in use or to be used for this purpose into three classes class a is the highest form of improved road in country use for a road of this character used in the ruraldelivery and starroute service it is provided that the government shall pay at the rate of 25 per mile per year class b is the next form of improved roail defined in the bill a road of high quality but not so good as that defined in class a for this road the compensation fixed is at the rate of 20 per mile per year class c comprehends the ordinary dirt roads of the country and for these roads the prescribed compensation is at the fate of 15 per mile per year payments are to be made at the end of each year to the appropriate custodian of the road funds on the warrant of the postmaster general no payment will be made for a road not falling within one of the prescribed classes and as the determination of the proper character of the road used will be at all tines in the hands of the agents of the federal government the interests of the government in this respect will be adequately conserved if the road is not maintained to the prescribed standard the road authorities will not be entitled to receive compensation if it is maintained to the standard fdr a portion of the year then the compensation will be paid pro rata fie most zealous end tenacious advocate of state rights will be unable to find in this bill any encroachment upon those rights the states will maintain and control their highways and the federal government will pay for using them provided that they are adequately maintained in the prescribed condition if the maintenance of state roads is a function of the states that function will not be trenched upon or in anywise impaired by this bill the states will continue in the sole and exclusive control of the state highways and will be under no compulsion to receive the payments contemplated for their use it is hardly necessary to enlarge upon the benefits to the whole public that will follow upon the general improvement of the highways sn the several states in the matter of good roads this country lags behind the older countries of the civilized world in part this is due to the fact that this country is the only one of the great powers that makes no national contribution either to the construction or to the maintenance of public roads for this our dual system of government is largely responsible since this duality has made it difficult to furnish this aid in such a manner as to reconcile the conflicting rights and interests of the states and the nation it is believed that the measure proposed is not only no infraction of the constitution but is in harmony with its general purpose the number of miles of state roads now traveled by the rural and starroute carriers is approximately 1 179 000 the mileage in class a is 35 000 miles in class b 83 000 miles and in class c 1 001 000 miles according to the prescribed scheme of payments the amount per year that this bill will carry on the above basis should payments be made for the entire mileage will be 18 450 000 but it must be borne in mind that only a small proportion of this aggregate mileage is in condition to receive immed ate compensation the improved roads totaling 118 000 miles may be considered as ready to comply with the requirements of the bill and receive compensation but the aggregate payments on this account will be only 2 535 000 per year a very large proportion of the mileage of dirt reads will require much work at the hands of the local authorities before any claim for compensation can be presented hence it is believed that for the first year the payments on this account will be comparatively small the exact amount required being impossible of estimate in proportion as the mileage of the rural and star routes increases and dirt roads are improved so as to fall within class a class b or class c the payments under this bill will increase but the increase will be a legitimate and natural evolution the inevitable effect of this measure will be not only an immediate improvement of the roads of all the states but a stimulus to road construction in every direction the tendency of road building hereafter will be in the direction of a steadily progressive change on the character of the state roads the dirt roads being transformed into improved roads as rapidly as possible so as to entitle the local communities to receive the large tolls contemglated for roads of the latter description the universality of the enefit of this measure is one of its striking features of merit it will touch every state and practically every community wherever a rural or a star route runs however remote that route many be from the great centers of trade and commerce the stimulating effect of this bill upon road improvement will be proportionately felt so far from stifling or impeding the spirit of local improvement and development this measure of federal compensation for roads actually used will energize that spirit since the payments provided will swell the local contributions into a working total on the whole it is submitted that the bill is meritorious in its purpose and constitutional in its character this measure is the composite production in conference of a number of members who have heretofore shown their interest in the subject of national aid to roads by the introduction of bills on this subject at the time this measure was introduced in the house mr shackleford of missouri made the following statement as a part of his remarks sir speaker those participating in the conference signed the following document to the committee on agriculture the undersigned members who have introduced bills on the subject of good roads desiringto secure as far as

25 1910 entitled all act to further regulate interstate and foreign commemce by prohibiting the translportation therein for immoral purposes of women and girls and for other purposes 36 stat 825 it is commonly known as the white slave act the constitutionality of the act was assailed by demurrer and as its sufficiency otherwise was not questioned a brief summary of its allegations is all that is necessary the charge against effie ioke is that she did on the 14th lay of november a d 1910 in the city of new orleans and state of louisiana unlawfully feloniously and knowingly persuade induce and entice one annette baden alias annette hays a woman to go from new orleans a city in the state of louisina to beaumont a city in the state of texas in interstate commerce for the purpose of

in interstate commerce for the purpose of prostitution with the intent and purpose that the said woman should engage in the practice of prostitution in the said city of beaumont tex the second and third counts make the same charge against the defendants as to another woman the one named in the third count being under 18 years the demurrers were overruled and after trial the defendants were convicted and sentenced each to two years imprisonment on each count 187 fed 092 the indictment was drawn under sections 2 3 and 4 of the act which sections are as follows sec 2 thab any person who shall knowingly transport or cause to be transported or aid or assist in obtaining transportation for or in transporting in interstate or foreign commerce or in any territory or in the district of columbia any woman or girl for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery or for any other immoral purpose or with the intent and purpose to induce entice or compel such woman or girl to become a

in any territory or the district of columbia shall be deemed guilty of a felony and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine not exceeding 5 000 or by imprisonment of not more than 5 years or by botii such fine and imprisonment in the discretion of the court the third section is directed against the persuasion inducement and enticement of any woman or g rl to go from one place to another in interstate or foreign commerce whether with or without her consent to engage in the practices and for the purposes stated in the iirst section and provides that anyone who shall thereby knowingly cause or ald or assist in causing such woman or girl to go or to bo carried or transported as a passenger upon the line or route of any common carrier or carriers in interstate or foreign commerce or any territory or the district of columbia shall be punished as prescribed in the first section section 4 makes criminal the persuasion inducement and enticement of a woman or girl under the age of 18 years from amiy state or territory or the district of columbia to any other state or territory or the district of columbia to engage in the immoral practices enumerated the person guilty thereof and who shall in furtherance thereof knowingly induce or cause such woman or girl to be carried or transported as a passenger in interstate commerce shall be deemed guilty of a felony and on conviction the offenders punishment may be a fine of 10 000 or imprisonment for 10 years or by both fine and imprisonment in the discretion of the court the grounds of attack upon the constitutionality of the statute are expressed by counsel as follows 1 because it is contrary to and contravenes article iv section 2 of the constitution of the united states which reads the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states 2 because it is contrary to ind contravenes the following two amendments to the constitution aiiv ix the enunmeration in the conqtitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deiy or disparage others retained by the people art x the powers not delegated to the united states by the consiltution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people 3 because that clause of the constitution which reserves to congress the power art i sec 8 subdiv 2 to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states etc is not broad enough to include the power to regulate prostitution or any other immorality of citizens of the several states as a condition precedent or subsequent to their right to travel interstate or to aid or assist another to so travel 4 because the right and power to regulate and control prostitution or any other immoralities of citizens comes within the reserved police power of the several states and iinder the constitution congress can not interfere therewith either directly or indirectly under the grant of power to regulate commerce between the states we shall discuss at length but one of these grounds the others will he referred to incidentally the power of congress under the commerce clause of the constitution is the ultimate determining question if the statute be a valid exercise of that power how it may affect persons or states is not material to be considered it is the supreme law of the land and persons and states are subject to it congress is given power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states the power is direct there is no word of limitation in it and its broad and universal scope has been so often declared as to make repetition unnecessary and besides it has had so much illustration by cases that it would seem as if there could be no instance of its exercise that does not find an admitted example in some one of them experience however is the other way and in almost every instance of the exercise of the power differences are asserted from previous exercises of it and made a ground of attack the present case is an example commerce among the states we have said consists of intercourse and traffic between their citizens and includes the transportation of persons and property there may be therefore a movement of persons as well as of property that is a person may move or be moved in interstate commerce and the act under consideration was drawn in view of that possibility what the act condemns is transportation obtained or aided or transportation induced in interstate commerce for the immoral purposes mentioned but an objection is made and urged with earnestness it is said that it is the right and privilege of a person to move betwten states and that such being the right another can not be made guilty of the crime of inducing or assisting or aiding in the exercise of it and that the motive or intention of the passenger either before beginning the journey or during or after completing it is not a matter of interstate commerce the contentions confound things important to be distinguished it urges a right exercised in morality to sustain a right to be exercised in immorality it is the same right which attacked the law of congress which prohibits the carrying of obscene literature and articles designed for indecent and immoral use from one state to an other 29 stat 512 united states v popper 98 fed 423 it is the same right which was excluded as an element as affecting the constitutionality of the act for the suppression of lottery traffic through national and interstate commerce 188 u s 321 357 it is the right glven for beneficial exercise which is attempted to be perverted to and justify baneful exercise as in the instances stated and which finds further illustration in reid vi colorado 187 u s 137 this constitutes the supreme fallacy of plaintiffs error it pervades and vitiates their contentions plaintiffs in error admit that the states may control the immoralities of its citizens indeed this is their chief insistence and they especially condemn the act under review as a subterfuge and an attempt to interfere with the police power of the states to regulate the morals of their citizens and assert that it is in consequence an invasion of the reserved powers of the states there is unquestionably a control in the states over the morals of their citizens and it may be admitted it extends to making prostitution a crime it is a control however which can be exercised only within the jurisdiction of the states but there is a domain which the states can not reach and over which congress alone has power and if such power be exerted to control what the states can not it is an argument for not against its legality its exertion does not encroach upon the jurisdiction of the states we have cited examples others may be adduced the pure food and drugs act is a conspicuous instance in all of the instances a clash of national legislation with the power of the states was urged and in all rejected our dual form of government has its perplexities state and nation having different spheres of jurisdiction as we have said but it must be kept in mind that we are one people and the powers reserved to the states and those conferred on the nation are adapted to be exercised whether independently or concurrently to promote the general welfare material and moral this is the effect of the decisions and surely if the facility of interstate transportation can be taken away from the domoralization of lotteries the debasement of obscene literature the contagion of diseased cattle or persons the impurity of food and drugs the like facility can be taken away from the systematic enticement to and the enslavement in prostitution and debauchery of women and more insistently of girls this is the aim of the law expressed in broad generalization and motives are made of determining consequence motives executed by actions may make it the concern of government to exert its powers right purpose and fair trading need no restrictive regulation but let them be transgressed and penalties and prohibitions must be applied we may illustrate again by the pure food and drugs act let an article be debased by adulteration let it be misrepresented by false branding and congress may exercise its prohibitive power it may be that congress could not prohibit the manufacture of the article in a state it may be that congress could not prohibit in all of its conditions its sale within a state but congress may prohibit its triansportation between the states and by that means defeat the motive and evils of its manufacture how farreaching are the power and the means which may be used to secure its complete exercise we have expressed in hipolite egg co v united states 220 u s 45 there in emphasis of the purpose of the law we denominated adulterated articles as outlaws of commerce and said that the confiscation of them enjoined by the law was appropriate to the right to bar them from interstate transportation and completed the purpose of the law by not merely preventing their physical movement alt preventing trade in them between the states it was urged in that case as it is urged here that the law was an invasion of the power of the states of course it will be said that women are not articles of merchandise but this does not affect the analogy of the cases the substance of the congressional power is the same only the manner of its exercise must be accommodated to the difference in its objects it is misleading to say that men and women have rights their rights can not fortify or sanction their wrongs and if they employ interstate transportation xlix2s0 as a facility of their wrongs it may be forbidden to them to the extent of the act of july 25 1910 and we need go no further inthe present case the principle established by the cases is the simple one when rid of confusing and distracting considerations that congress has power over transportation among the several states that the power is complete in itself and that congress as an incident to it may adopt not only means necessary but convenient to its exercise and the means may have the quality of police regulations 114 u s 196 215 cooley constitutional limitations 7th ed 856 we have no hesitation therefore in pronouncing the act of june 15 1910 a legal exercise of the power of congress there are assignments of error based upon rulings on the admission and rejection of evidence and upon the instructions to the jury and the refusing of instructions the asserted errors are set forth in 25 bills of exceptions and the special assignment of errors in this court occupy 28 pages of the record and present the constitutional objections to the law in all the aspects that counsels ingenuity can devise a like ingenuity has been exercised to represent the many ways in which the conduct of the accused can be viewed and shown to be inconsistent with a guilty purpose to discuss them all is unnecessary we shall pass more o less rapidly over those we consider to be worthy of attention 1 it is contended that there is variance between the indictment and the proof in that the indictment charges that the women were transported over the texas new orleans railroad co s road and that the government failed to prove that such road was a line extending from new orleans to beaumont tex these places marking the beginning and end of the transportation of the women further that the proof showed that their tickets were purchased over the southern pacific road the indictment alleges that the texas new orleans railroad was a part of the southern pacific system and was commonly known as the sunset route and there was through transportation the variance is not much more than verbal and that it prejudiced their defense in any way is not shown if it is error at ail it does not appear to have caused even embarrassment to the defense but was it error see westmoreland v united states 155 u s 545 549 also sec 1025 r s 2 the evidence does not show that the defendants or either of them induced etc the women to become passengers in interstate commerce the particulars are recited wherein it is contended that the evidence is deficient it is not necessary to review them it was for the jury to consider and determine the sufficiency of the evidence and we can not say they were not justified by it in the judgment they pronounced 3 t is contended that florence baden persuaded her sister gertrude to go to beaumont and an instruction of the court is attacked on the ground that it declared the charge of the indictment was satislied against the dfendants if florence acted for them there was no error in the instruction under the circumstances shown by the record 4 error is assigned on the refusal of the court to give certain instructions requested by defendants to consider them in detail would require a lengthy review of the evidence for they present arguments on certain phases of it as to the degree of persuasion used or its sufficiency to induce or entice the women there was no error in refusing the instructions 5 the court permitted the women to testify as to the acts of effie hoke at her house at beaumont restraining the liberty of the women and coercing their stay with her such testimony was relevant the acts illustrated and constituted a completion of what was done at new orleans they were part of the same scheme and made clear its purpose there were other instructions asked by which the jury was charged that they could not convict effie hoke for the character of the house she kept or economides for the business lie conducted the charge of the court sufficiently excluded both views it explained the act of congress and the offenses it condemned and directed the attention of the juy to them 6 defendants complain that they were not permitted to show that the women named in the indictment were public prostitutes in new orleans such proof they contend was relevant upon the charge of persuasion or enticement this may be admitted but there was sufficient evidence as the court said of the fact of the immorality of their lives and explicitly ruled that they could be shown to be public prostitutes the court however excluded certain details sought to e proved under the circumstances there was no error in the ruling in conclusion we say after consideration of all errors assigned that there was no ruling madb which was prejudicial to defendants judgment affirmed true copy test clerk supremec ootrt united states"]],
