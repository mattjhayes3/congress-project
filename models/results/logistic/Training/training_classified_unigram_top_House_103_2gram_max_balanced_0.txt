the opposite it dramatically increased taxes and spending the new democrat it turns out is the same as the old taxandspend democrats the presidents budget this year maintains the status quo it is not

tough crime reform candidate clinton promised allof these things president clintons budget contains none of them just as we did last year the republicans on the budget committee have come up with a better alternative to the status quo instead of increasing the size of government we downsize government instead of raising taxes we cut the tax bill for families and businesses instead of empty promises of change we do it honest health care reform does not have to create a massive federal bureaucracy we can control costs and improve coverage without undermining the quality of the best system in the world our budget proposal gives americans what they want from reform elimination ofpreexisting condition restrictions portability comprehensive malpractice reform and medical savings accounts

bill the spending would skyrocket from 388 million this year to 541 million in fiscal year 1994 and 1 billion in fiscal year 1995 my amendment would prevent this profligacy and save the taxpayers 800 million it was just a few short weeks ago that the democrats in this house passed a 5year budget plan which included the largest tax increase in american history we were told then by the democrat majority that this hefty contribution on the part of hard working taxpayers was necessary to reduce the federal budget deficit and here they propose increasing spending on corporate giveaway programs by 158 percent and what does h r 820 do under this bill the federal government is going to build an enormous network of technology centers so bureaucrats can show business men and women what machines to buy and how to run their businesses and the same people who gripe about socalled junk bonds are putting uncle sam in the venture capital business if you thought the s l crisis was bad wait until bureaucrats start making multimilliondollar commercial loans and finally the government is going to spend hundreds of millions each year picking winners and losers in the name of promoting technology here is what we are saying to the taxpayers today the government that brought you amtrak the post office the usda and 500 toilet seats at the pentagon is going to teach real entrepreneurs how to beat international competition the reason this bill is on the floor of course is that the majority believes that committees here in congress and the bureaucrats at the commerce department know how to run the economy as george will noted in a column 2 weeks ago the liberals in washington dc believe they know far more about competing in the marketplace than the undiscerning men and women who have risked their life savings to start a real business in the real world well let us take a look at what the democrat majority has already done for business this year it has heaped another mandate on workers and business in the form of mandated leave legislation it has passed a budget resolution which promises business higher energy and corporate income taxes the majority has promised the business community and the country another 5 years of huge budget deficits which will deprive the private sector access to capital but we have only just begun on the way is striker replacement and the rest of the big labor and trial lawyer agenda which will undermine americas competitiveness the finest illustration of the economic illiteracy of the majority is this the democrat party opposes indexing the capital gains taxwhich lowers the cost of capitalyet supports indexing the minimum wagewhich increases the cost of labor but the democrats are here to help business today they say the party that beleaguers business with higher taxes and regulations at every opportunity now wants to help the majority wants to promote economic growth and jobs through investment sounding ironically like supplyside onservativq republicans but as my friend jude wanniski says the majority is operating on the dark side of the supplyside modelinvesting in government bureaucracies instead of the private sector so as russia sweden mexico france poland and on and onmove away from state planning to emulate the american model of free enterprise the majoritywhile paying lipservice to the market seeks to move more and more resources from the productive private sector to the wasteful public sector if my democrat friends are genuinely interested in creating real jobs in the private sector they should consider this over the last 4 years the tax and regulatory burden on small business has increased 34 percent these small businesses create 76 percent of the new jobs in the economy if you want to help the entrepreneur lower his cost of capital stop tying his hands with unnecessary red and green tape do not raise his energy costs and corporate taxes reform americas legal liability laws amend antiquated antitrust law in short get the government off the backs of small business but do not burden all businesses with massive new taxes and regulations and then give away a billion dollars to the politically wellconnected that will not make america more competitive i would close with a quote from adam smith who warned us of politicians who were onceited enough to try to direct an economy he wrote the statesman who should attempt to direct private people in what manner they ought to employ their capitals would net only load himaelf a most unnecessary atten tion but same an authority which

election last year did they tell the voters that they were intending to vote for the largest tax increase in unitedstates history i dont think so did they tell the votersthat they would cast their vote to raise taxes dramatically long before ever voting for any spending cuts i dont think so i dont think my colleagues ran as business as usual tax and spend democrats well then let me explain this budget bill the clinton administration is asking freshmen representatives to support its called the omnibus budget reconciliation act the name is purposely confusing so that the american public is deceived into thinking its something harmless or even good i want the american public to know that this now budget bill really is the largest tax increase in american history it will cost american taxpayers at least 332 billion over the next 5 years as a freshman i have a hard time committing american taxpayers to 332 billion as an engineer i always like to quantify figures using basic math lets see how much this tax hike will really mean to the american family my district is one of 435 districts so i took 332 billion and divided it by 435 the result is 760 million per district that means my district in california alone would be obligated to pay 760 million in new taxes over the next 5 years then i took this simple math a step further there are about 570 000 people in my district so i divided 760 million by 570 000 people i was shocked to see that every man woman and child would have to come up with over 1 300 this means that the average family of 5 will be assessed nearly 7 000 in new tax increases let me repeat 7 000 in new tax increases america has never had this huge a tax increase in its entire history but thats not all this tax bill also includes a new btu tax again lets be honest this is a hidden gas tax this btu tax means 8 cents a gallon that might not should like much but it is were told avg 450 yr of new btu taxes per family is not that big a deal to the average american family i guess this is true its only the price of 2 haircuts but this is not all this btu tax is indexed annually for inflation the cost of this new tax will grow higher and higher each year but wait there is more the btu tax isnt just a gas tax on automobiles it also translates into more taxes on electricity water heating oil and almost every other products so by the time all these new taxes are added together i wouldnt be surprised if the total burden to the average family of 5 will exceed 10 000 in new tax increases thats outrageous we must stop this madness the point i raise for my fellow democratic freshmen is that a yes vote on this tax bill will have grave consequences in 1994 good luck going home and telling people that we voted for the biggest tax increase in unitedstates history i just wanted to quantify this bill using simple mathematics so that the american public will be told the truth let me repeat for the average family of five were looking at nearly 10 000 new taxes i say dont raise taxes no nation has ever taxed its way into prosperity cut these hundreds of wasteful government subsides instead"], [0.00023416485055349767, 0.00023416485055349767,

lot of us from the state of california two years ago i came here as a former small business owner thinking that i could have a real opportunity to help this nations small businesses however i found out over the last 2 weeks that that is not necessarily true let me tell what happened the lkst 2 weeks several weeks ago i found out that sba a federal agency that is supposed to act as an advocate of small businesses spent over 100 000 of taxpayers money to promote employee mandates i was shocked that the sba would do such a thing especially since small business owners and employees overwhelmingly oppose employer mandates they are frightened for good reason every credible study predicts substantial job losses as a result of the employer mandates so i decided to offer an amendment which would change this ridiculous situation my amendment was simple it would prohibit the sba from spending taxpayer dollars to promote employer mandates the first thing i found out is that my amendment will not be allowed to be offered on the floor unless the rules committee approves the rules committee decides which amendments can and cannot be offered on the house floor for debate so i went to the rules committee to offer my amendment i thought that this was a simple amendment and that it should not have any problem being accepted when i walked into the rules committee i was surprised i found out something interesting there are nine democrats and only four republicans serving on that committee suddenly i had a bad feeling about my amendments chances sure enough the democratcontrolled rules committee rejected my amendment remember my amendment is simply asking sba not to spend taxpayers money to promote employer mandates it was simply rejected they said that the sba bill was not the appropriate place to debate health care issues despite the fact that my amendment dealt specifically with the sba and despite the fact that our own house parliamentarian ruled that my amendment was perfectly germane this ruling was obviously very unfair so i went to the house floor to try and overturn the rules committees decision and you can guess it i was defeated again even though 10 brave democrats stood up lid joined all of the republicans in voting to overturn this unfair decision my amendment again was blocked despite this defeat i was not willing to give up the fight for small businesses in fact i found out that i had one last chance to get a vote on my amendment i decided to offer a socalled motion to recommit which would have forced the house to debate and vote on my amendment just as i was preparing to offer my motion the democratic leadership removed the entire sba billthe bill i was trying to amendoff the floor why did they do this let me tell you why because

american people dont want employer mandates and being taken over by government small business people do not want employer mandates california people do not want employer mandates because they know that with employer mandates it is not a question of whether jobs will be lost it is just a question of how many jobs will be lost this is exactly why the american people are so frustrated with congress they are frustrated because instead of debating issues openly and honestly the democrat leadership of this body delays and hides behind parliamentary rules the american people are frustrated because instead of telling the truth about employer mandates the democratic leadership uses its dominance of the house to force members to toe the biggovernment line on health care reform the american

american people have not had a chance to see it let me tell you how many americans have read the democrat leadership plan that we are supposed to vote on in a few days zero not a single one of the 250 million americans have read the democrat health care plan we should be saying my colleagues let the people see it let the people read it it is unfair for us to try to vote on a plan that our constituents have not had a chance to even look at when it is their right to choose a doctor their right to run a small business their right to invent a new medicine you know we are one of the last nations in the world that does not have socialized medicine theoretically having socialized medicine is a mark of civilization for all the people who have stood up and said we are one of the few nations in the world that doesnt have socialized medicine we ought to have it i look at places like cuba with mr castro who has socialized medicine china has socialized medicine a lot of other third world nations have socialized medicine that is not a sign of civilization it is not a sign of sophistication if you look at the other side of that debate you will see a great nation the united states of america more than half of all of the cures for diseases that are invented annually in the world are invented in the united states isnt that interesting that means we invent more cures more medicines that save lives than all the rest of the nations in the world combined and i would suggest that that is because we do n6t have socialized medicine i would suggest that our freedom has been the driver for innovation our freedom has built a health care system that draws canadians down you know the canadian system was health care nirvana it was heaven on earth and we had a lot of well meaning groups who came in last year and told us how great the canadian health care system was then around christmastime the biggest hospital in ontario shut down for a couple of weeks because they ran out of money funny socialism always runs out of money because governments never spend money in an efficient manner so canadians saw their biggest hospital close down for 2 weeks because they ran out of money then we discovered something else about canadian health care there are 177 000 canadians who are waiting for operations they are waiting in line for operations because you know what socialism causes lines if you do not think so go to the kremlin sometime take a trip to some of those liberated countries in eastern europe socialism causes lines and about 25 percent of the people who were surveyed in canada of those 177 000 waiting in line for an operation 25 percent of them said they are in pain while they wait 01610 we looked at other places we looked at japan that theoretically spends less money on health care it does spend less money but do you know why they spend less money because the average japanese doctor sees 49 patients a day and i had this impression i do not know if my colleagues or you have seen that have read about those professional packers that they have in japan on the subway trains where they get everybody they possible can into the train right at rush hour then they have two professional packers these packers are like sumo wrestler they are big healthy people they do not hurt anybody but their job is to pack the last possible person that they can get into that train they want to get that guy picked right inside there so they can close the doors and go out with a full train that is the impression i had when i read that their doctors see 49 people a day they do mass examinations americans do not want to walk in with 15 or 20 people and do an examination en masse that is japan they are heavy on efficiency they are a little bit short on privacy let us look at great britain which has socialized medicine that socialism that winston churchill described as shared misery they have a system in which senior citizens elderly people are not given lifesaving operations that is because socialism never works very effectively and they ran out of money so they tell senior citizens who are over a certain age you cannot have this lifesaving operation because you have lived a long and full life and you have to fall off the tree like a leaf in the autumn and let a younger person have that lifesaving operation that is great unless you happen to have fathers and mothers and grandfathers and grandmothers who mean something to you and you know american families have a lot of grandmothers and grandfathers who mean something to them and so we do not want to have that brand of socialized medicine to date this administration has not shown us one model country that has a medical system a socialized medical system that we should follow last let me talk about something that is kind of near and dear to americans hearts that is a job remember that gentleman herb kane who stood with the president on a nationally televised program and he said he is a guy who owns godfathers pizza his father worked three jobs a day so he could go to college and become a success and herb kane said mr president i have put a pencil to your numbers here to your plan i will have to fire a lot of people i am paraphrasing him he said this is not going to work out i am going to have to close down franchises and get rid of folks the president said to him i do not know why you just cannot raise the cost of your pizza i could see a look of shock on mr kanes face and when he addressed the republicans recently he said to the effect if i could get more money for my pizzas i would be doing it you cannot just raise the price of your product and expect to continue in business he said i am asked by people why i do not feel i have a duty to give every single person who works for me a health care plan he says that is because my first duty is to give them a job and we are going to lose a lot of jobs under socialized medicine the plan that the gentleman from missouri is putting together with other democrat leaders right now is socialized medicine it is socialized medicine that is going to require employer mandates that means employers are going to have to pay a big new tax we have a group that is a think tank and there is plenty of think tanks around the country but the consad study group did an evaluation on how many american jobs will be lost under the ways and means committee plan that is the democratcontrolled committee that developed the plan in this house that is being followed by the gentleman from missouri by the democrat leadership is putting together their socialized medicine plan let me tell you how many jobs they say will be lost and how many will be affected what is an affected job it is a job not lost it is a job where you never get any raise you do not get any raise because your employer is spending the money he would have used to give you a raise buying this health care plan that he is forced to buy

10 percent of californias exports of manufactured goods this is in spite of tariffs of 20 percent or more on the kinds of hightechnology products manufactured in california nafta contains other significant advantageir for california industries like improved intellectual property protection for motion pictures and computer software because of such provisions the agreement will help produce

communities impacted by a military base closure or major realignment one of the lessons learned from past base closures is that once a base or installation has made the final list or even before much of its vital equipment or infrastructure begins to disappear out the gate this can cause tremendous problems for the local community in trying to come up with a private reuse for the facilities this compounds the already difficult economic adjustment the community faces from the loss of jobs for example the removal or disposal of groundskeeping equipment has left some communities in the past with a new and urgent financial burden of acquiring the same equipment just to maintain and keep the grounds and facilities in proper maintenance in other cases the closing of an air base has seen the radar and runway lighting equipment removed which renders the bases reuse as a commercial aviation facility much more expensive and difficult for the community there are many such examples which can be examined from the experiences of communities affected by past closures this was recognized as a problem by the current administration and on july 2 1993 secretary of defense les aspin issued a 5point policy statement signaling needed changes in dealing with future base closings point 5 stated that dod will no longer automatically remove personal property out of a dosing base effective immediately the new policy will strongly emphasize the needs of the community while i was encouraged by this policy statement it did not outline specifics and i was concerned that there were no federal statutory provisions delegating the secretary of defense needed disposal authority for related personal property that is why this amendment is needed this amendment requires that an inventory of related personal property be taken by the affected military service as soon as practicable following the selection of a military base for closure or major realignment once that inventory is complete the local base reuse development group recognized by the secretary of defense as developing a base reuse plan will be given a minimum of 12 months in which to decide whether or not to retain a portion or all of the listed personal property it is possible that the community would be able to act much quicker than that however 12 months would seem to be a reasonable guaranteed minimum time period for the community to determine its needs for purposes of the statute related personal property is defined generally as property which is an integral part of real property or specially designed for or adapted to the functional or productive capacity of the real property and the removal of which would significantly diminish the economic value of the real property the statute also specifically identifies office furniture and equipment machine tools and industrial production equipment dormitory and food service equipment airport operating equipment and spare parts sufficient for 3 years of civilian use as personal property covered under the statute the statute is also careful to exclude military unique items such as military aircraft vehicles ships weapons systems and munitions it also preserves the discretion of the secretary generally to remove items that are urgently needed to support the national security interest associated with a specific mission of the armed forces it is also not the intent of this statute in the case of military supply depots and warehouses that lineitem storage and routine inventory be covered personal property which is not selected by the community for retention is removed disposed of elsewhere within the federal govemnent or to state and local governments according to existing federal property disposal statutes finally my amendment grants the secretary of defense specific personal property disposal authority only in the case of dosing military facilities and allows the secretary to accept consideration from the community not to exceed fair market value in exchange for the retained items this amendment establishes a realistic commonsense and workable mechanism to assist local communities affected by traumatic military base closures it gives proper recognition to the militarys presence in their respective areas it grants those communities specific rights and gives them a sense of stability to know that they can have a reasonable time in which to come up with the best reuse plan and not have to worry continually about vital equipment sneaking out the front gate if communities can rebound quicker from a base closing to a viable economic reuse of the property everyone benefits the community certainly benefits through continued employment and a new tax base the federal govemnment and the taxpayer benefit through the elimination of excess properties and the continuing overhead and maintenance costs assodated with them it will also make future base closings more palatable to affected communities this amendment has the endorsement of the national association of installation developers which is a nonprofit organization which for over two decades has represented communities affected by base closures and which represents many communities affected by the 1993 round of closures i urge the adoption of this amendment today as part of the first group of en bloc amendments to h r 2401 the defense authorization

water entitlements it ensures that there would be no undesirable impact on the colorado river and its operations as a consequence of this act speciffcally this amendtment does three things first it specfles that the federally owned dams located on the colorado river in the lower basin would not be affected second it protects state water law and the interstate compact pertaining to the colorada river in the upper basin third it ensures that no federal rights to the colorado river are reserved expressly or impliedlz witft respect to the havasu and imperi l wilderness areas i want to point out that this language is not new it was also included in the arizona desert wilderness act passed in october 1990 public law o162g when this bill came before the house the members wisely included language to ensure that there would be no adverse impact to the colorado river operamtons as you know the havasu and imperial wilderness areas straddle the colorado river and the arizonacalifornia state line when these refuges were established as wilderness on the arizona side with the arizna wilderness act provided that no rights to the water of the colorado river were reserved expressly or impliedly this was done in recognition of the fact that the havasu and imperial designations were in close geographic proximity to the colorado river and while the boundaries had been drawn at the high water mark and any effect on the colorado river was thought by them unlikely arizonas senators deconci= and mccacn nonetheless to avoid any confusion unequivocally stated in the bill that no such rights were reserved these provisions were put in the act and assurances were also given dring the debates that the act was not to supersede any existing compacts treaties federal statutes of supreme court decrees governing interstate or intrastate water allocations the law of the river which included the operations of existing and future dams in either the upper or lower basin was to be protected and not affected as a consequence of the wilderness designations congress now has the caifornia desert protection act before it and this proposal also designates wilderness in the california portions of the havasu and imperial national wildlife refuges on the california side of the colorado river the senate recognizing the desirability and need for treating both sides of the river in the same fashion included the same protections for the colorado river in its recently passed s 21 the common treatment thus accorded both halves of the two refuges lying astride the colorado river along the arizonacalifornia horder is important not only from the management and administration aspects but in addition as the senate committee report observes at ix 3these two refuges already have a reserved water right which is unaffected by the legislation that right has already been quantified by the decree of the unitedstates supreme court at the conclusion of the arizona versus california litigation 376 us a49 at 346 39641 with any consumptive use of water within a state to be charged to that states apportionment of the waters of the colorado river while the water rights thus accorded and quantiffed by the court were for the lands as wildlife july 1 3 11994 refuges certainly their additional designation as wilderness should not require any greater quantities of water it would accordingly be duplicative as well as totally inconsistent with congressional action with respect to the arizona lands to now place a federal general reserved water right on the california side of the river to say that the havasu and imperial wilderness boundaries have been drawn so as not to include the colorado river is hardly determinative of the concerns that have been expressed throughout both the upper and lower basinswhich include significant portions of seven states arizona california colorado new mexico nevada utah and wyoming the only significant water source in the two affected areas is the colorado river itself including its impoundments and underflow uses of waters in these two areas would necessarily be supplied from the colorado river accordingly the protections provided by congress in both the arizona act as well as by the senate in acting on the california desert billin s 21should be included in any final action by the congress on the california desert legislation the allard thomas language would provide consistency for the treatment of the colorado with respect to the havasu and imperial wilderness areas in california also noteworthy is the fact that the allardthomas language is included in report language of h r 518 however we do not believe report language is sufficient as it is not legally binding if the authors of this bill want to prevent the disruption of the colorado river compact and they felt it was important enough to include in report language then there should be no reason why this cannot be clarified in the bill it is obviously a very important point for those of us in the west where water is our most precious commodity and this bill does not provide enough certainty for members who represent states that supply water throughout the west without the allardthomas language the bill would unravel the extremely complicated and fragile colorado river compact worked out by the states california arizona nevada utah new mexico colorado and wyoming our concerns have been heightened by the discussion of boundaries and what constitutes water of the colorado river contained in the bureau of reclamations draft regulations for administering entitlements to colorado river water in the lower basin just released may 6 the bureau says they have developed a method with the unitedstates geological survey to identify wells yielding water originating from the river this method employs a presumption that all water beneath the lower colorado river floodplain and certain areas adjacent to it are believed to be hydrologically connected to mainstream colorado river water which will be subject to these regulations and will have to have a contract for the water with the secretary of the interior the details of these proposed regulations for simply defining the boundaries of the mainstream are extremely involved and comprehensive not only with respect to the surface but to the subsurface one simply cannot be assured that any wilderness boundary that has been drawn excludes the impact of a federal reserved right unless any reserved right to the water of the colorado is itself denied as provided in the arizona act of 1990 and in s 21 even users of waters from wells in these areas as well as all areas upstream on the colorado river could otherwise be adversely affected before statehood in 1876 colorado submitted its constitution to congress to be ratified in connection with water considered the most precious and scarce resource in the west the colorado constitution provided the right to divert the unappropriated waters of any natural stream to beneficial use shall never be denied ever since that time colorado has sought to protect its water resources from any federal intrusion the importance of water resource management on the western way of life is not widely understood beyond the arid west and the technical intricacies involved in such management are even less understood any impact on the ability of colorado and her sister states to maintain state control over water decisions which a federal reservation of water can entail has been resisted because such reservations could prohibit colorado and other basin states from protecting their interests under the interstate compacts on the colorado which are so important to them some states nevada for example provide that groundwater is subject to appropriation in a similar manner as surface water a broad federal reservation could indeed interfere with and possibly preclude a state official from approving an application for ground water in any areas adjacent to a wilderness holding such a reservation the draft regulations of the bureau of reclamation call all water below the floodplain of the lower colorado river and below certain elevations in adjacent areas to be water of the colorado river which must have contact with the secretary of the interior in light of these proposals the only way to assure a federal reserved right cannot impact an individual water right or a states compact entitlement is to deny that a reserved right to water of the colorado river and its tributaries either expressed or implied is being created in summary the protections provided by congress in the senate version of this bill and the arizona act should be included in any final action by the congress on the california desert legislation"]]}
