interests and nobody else and that is all they have lone since this administltation started i notice in th papers this morning the president stands out for a sales tax or no bonus he is more generous with the international bankers than he is with the exservice men i noticed in the washington star recently an article by will p kennedy in which he states that doctor fuss of ohio chairman of the republican congressional campaign committee expects to visit the various states get the republican campaign spellbiflders togetl~er and open up a school for their benefitthat is to tell them what to say in the campaign this fall doctor fuss is a wonderful teacher i understand i am wonaering if he is going to tell these schools about this bill and tell them how to defend it there are other issues that he ought to discuss in his political class as he goes from state to state however i doubt very much whether he will have them dwell on very many of the things that this administration has done there are a good many issues in this campaign of course the chief issues would be the revenue bill that you passed the tariff bill when you pass it because as it is written today it is the highest tariff law ever placed upon the statute books of this country every special interest was represented at the ways and means committee when the bill was being written i recall that one of the ablest of the woolen manufacturers was present practically all of the time during the hearings and i understand was present when the bill was being written by the republican members of the ways and means committee colonel woods was his name from philadelphia i think when the bill went to the senate the steel trust had its representative in the finance committee room of the senate and as a result the bill toclay and as it will probably become a law will be much higher than the paynealdrich law which all but destroyed the republican party you will be called upon to explain just why you passed the transportation act in 3 920 a bill which the railroad companies themselves wrote under which the shippers of the country have been robbed of hundreds of millions of dollars in freight rates every farmer who had a bushel of corn to ship to the market a car of cattle or hogs a car of hay a few thousand feet of lumber to go into a home for his family a bale of cotton as also all of those necessaries he has to use in the course of a year to sustain those that are dependent upon hal will want you to tell them why he was the object of the wrath of the republican party who enacted this infamous eschcummins bill and how will teacher lss explain the action of your party in placing this bill on the statute books the only honest answer of course is that you are controlled by the raiload and other special interests and opposed to the interests of those who produce and toil in this country you will probably be called upon to explain just why the president of the united states and the republican leaders want to pass a ship subsidy bill taking out of the treasury the peoples tax money anywhere from 50 000 000 to 100 000 000 annually and giving it to the shipowners of the country in order that their business may be prosperous you may have difficulty in explaining just why your president and many of your leaders are insisting that the congress shall pass a general sales tax so that the burden of the great war debt may be shifted from the shoulders of the rich to the bacls of the poor you may find it difficult to explain just why your president and the leaders of your party insist that we appropriate nearly 300 000 000 for the navy the coming year whereas we only appropriated 147 000 000 in 1916 when we were really preparing for war naval appropriations have been doubled notwithstanding the fact that you have sent broadcast through the country the proposition that your limitation of armaments conference has been the greatest thing in the history of the world you may also find it difficult to explain to the people just why your president and the leaders of your party are insisting upon a big standing army in this country of course you aie going to be called upon to explain just why you repealed the excessigrofits tax by which you lost 450 000 000 to the treasury and relieved the big profiteering corporations who made during the war 38 000 000 000 net above all taxes and expenses of every hind of course you are going to be called upon to explain just why you relieved the millionaires and the multitnillionaires of the high surtaxes by which you lost 90 000 000 to the treasury you lost 540 000 000 by repealing these two taxes upon othe rich corporations and rich individuals and now secretary mellon tells us that we have a 500 000 000 deficit staring us in the face if you had just left these taxes you would have avoided this deficit but the republican leaders think more of rich corporations and multimillionaires than they do of the treasury and the people of the united states yes the white house doors have been wide open to every special interest in the country since that day eacly in his administration when president harding called in his best minds headed by j p morgan to advise him and this bill shows that the same best minds are still on the job and that the president is still doing their bidding and yet gentlemen have said on this floor that the president of the united states is more popular than his party that be is stronger in the various districts of the country than you are i deny it and just as soon as the voters of this country get a chance to express themselves as to the presidents popularity you will not hear the republican leaders here boasting of the presidents popularity in the country in fact you have not heard much about his popularity since beveridge defeated new for the senate in indiana the other day i trust every democrat in this house and i hope of course a majority of the republicans will vote against this bill because if you pass it you are going to vote to subjugate the negro republic of liberia you are going to vote to permit international and investment bankers and their friends to exploit this negro republic you ought not to vote this 5 000 000 loan in order to help these international bankers out of a hole"], [0.012875020503997803, 0.9871249794960022, 1, "no i want to finish i was talking

proof of their achievements for which they claim credit turn to page 543 of the congressionai rf cor d of december 18 1920 and you will find the roll call on the passage of the resolution for the revival of the war finance corporation and lo and behold of the men who fought that resolution which now is admitted has done so much for agriculture and who voted against that relief the name of the gentleman from ohio chairman of the republican congressional committee like that of abou ben adhem leads all the rest and yet he today has the affrontery to stand up here as a leader of the republican party and claim credit for having rehabilitated american agriculture and cites this act which he opposed and against whicli he voted as one of the measures that did it on that roll call voting against this measure of relief or the american farmer i noticed the name of mr mcfadden of pennsylvania chairman of the committee that reported the measure to the house i also note as voting against the resolution the name of the gentleman from illinois i could if time permitted call the names of the other republican leaders who voted against the farmer that day including the name of that distinguished brilliant versatile dashing leader of whom i am very fond the gentleman from massachusetts oh yes gentlemen you remember what was said then about the democrats and the republican members from the west who were trying to do something for the american farmer we were denounced then as political grandstand players and demnagogues and they and their followers in the press talked in tones of derision and simulated fear of the agricultural bloc and yet today these same republican leaders come forward and claim credit for their party and this congress for the passage of those measures which they derided then and which were passed through this house by the democratic membership joined by a sufficient number of republican members from the agricultural states in the west who were even derided by their party leaders and denounced for joining the democrats the only difference in the minds of some gentlemen between a statesman and a demagogue is that the statesman according to those gentlemen is one who wants to open the treasury to the railroads of the country and then give them rates that will guarantee a fixed profit and exempt the big financial interests of the country from a just proportion of the burden of taxation and that a demagogue is one who recognizes the elemental truth that the cotton grower of the south and the wheat grower of the west ought to be given equality of treatment in the distribution of credits and in the enactment of laws that affect their economic welfare whenever a few republican members join the democrats for this laudable purpose they are referred to sneeringly as an agricultural bloc and are told they are about to wreck the republican party notwithstanding the protest and declamation of these republican leaders today the members of this house know that during the last two and a half years since republicans have been inthe control of congress the only way the american farmer has gotten any consideration has been by the rolling of the republican leaders of this house and the printed record shows it what about the act passed in this congress which increased the agricultural credit facilities of the war finance corporation the same old story the leaders of the republican party while professing sympathy for the farmer sought by subterfuge and by substitution to defeat it the administration leaders had worked a flank movement in the senate on the distinguished senator from nebraska mr nornis and tried to pass a makeshift when the measure reached the house banking and currency committee the solid democratic membership of that committee were joined by enough republicans to report the measure out to the house and here on the floor you know that the democrats joined by those brave loyal republicans from the west who put country above party such as strono of kansas and two other members of the committee rolled the republican leaders again and passed the measure over their opposition it is true that while they were really opposed to the m easure they made discretion the better part of valor and voted for the measure on the final roll call but it was a fact understood by all of us that we had the silent stubborn opposition of a majority of the republican leaders who while voting for the measure did so on the theory that the case was hopeless and that it was wisdom to join what they could not beat in spite of that wellknown fact the gentleman from ohio now tries to show that as an achievement of the republican party when the record shows to the contrary now what else was done explain why the federal land banks can not meet the demands of the farmers of the west and the south for 1 000 2 000 or 3 000 loans it was a recognized fact that these banks on account of conditions growing out of the war and their suspension while the case attacking their constituti6nality was pending in the supreme court and not on account of any unsoundness of the system were left with an insufficient working capital to make them independent and enable them to stand alone the democrats solidly supported every effort to go to their relief but the republican leaders had their way and cut down the relief and after first by an arbitrary rule limiting their activities to a total of 200 000 000 a year that same leadership has now cut down the limit to 150 000 000 a year the roll calls of this and the last congress show thatthe democrats were united f6r every practical proposal to grant adequate relief and their efforts were defeated by the republican leadership who grudgingly permitted measures to pass only granting partial relief what about transportation rates at the very hour the republican party was trying to open the treasury to the special interests of thfs country the railroads in the public press were announcing that they were going to make some small reductions in freight rates some of these same railroads were filing notices of increases and the shippers of my own state were put to the expense of combating these efforts and sending their attorneys and representatives here to washington within the last few months we saw the markets of the farmers of the west and the south restricted and in some instances destroyed by prohibitive nonrevenueproducing freight rates while this republican congress was busy playing polities and seeking to relieve the great financial interests of a just proportion of the burden of taxation and unless this republican congress does more to relieve that situation in the next session than it has in this truck growing and some other farm activities in the west and south will be absolutely destroyed because even with the proposed slight reduction just announced transportation rates in many cases will remain so prohibitive that the farmers will not be able to get some of their products to market"], [0.017051422968506813, 0.017051422968506813, 0, "iir speaker i move that the house resolve itself into committee of the whole house on the state of the union for

the democratic party brought forth measures in this house that i did not believe to be for the best interests of my country i opposed them i do not see how any man whether democrat or republican who

the washington times which today editorially says a worse economic measure than this fordney bill it would be hard to imagine partly the product of profound ignorance of conditions and of economic causes and effects and partly an unconcealed payment of political debts to powerful interests the bill if passed will tend to raise prices and put an additional handicap upon our exporting trade and our merchant marine the fordney tariff is not a protective tariff it is an almost prohibitory tariff upon many things it is not constructive but destructive it will not diminish taxes but business it will make it harder for our debtors to pay us and make us poorer and more in need of collecting our debts the proposed fordney tariff act is a vicious measure because it will tend to restrict trade to increase prices to decrease tme power to pay taxes and to breed and foster home monopolies it is such an extreme measure that it is hard to see how any sensible man in the congress can vote for it
