the doctrines of tyrants the makers of that history sometimes differed but never on the fundamental principles of liberty once we were under the then mildest despotism in all the world administered by men of our race by a government of our kindred which had every inducement to deal justly and rule us for our good we grew strong we prospered under it england professed to rule us for our benefit and to grant the colonies every liberty to which they were entitled had our ancestors entertained the views of the republican party today the declaration of independence would have been unwritten and european monarchies would now control america from labrador to patagonia but lust of power and greed of plunder did not blind them to the wrongs of foreign sovereignty or the right inherent in separate communities patriots wrote the declaration in all profane literature it is the most blessed message yet published to mankinda charter of human rights fit for every age land and people without the doubtful language of fear the falsehood of hypocrisy the injustice of greed or the favoritism of selfishness timeservers denounced it as incendiary but brave and honest men proclaimed it true and by sacrifice and blood established it as a heritage to freemen under it the republic grew great and made the pacific our western boundary conferring its blessings upon every man in all that vast domain and giving to him the constitution of our fathers following its teachings the people that gave to us lafayette amidst convulsions that shocked civilization slew its king and in the name of liberty equality and fraternity assumed the form of a republic mexico and the south american states looked northward and inspired by its fruits one by one broke the rule of kings and became selfgoverning commonwealths the continents had no corners where it did not inspire mankind away off beyond the equator across the seas little bands of men in form in right in religion in aspiration such as we established themselves into two republics fashioned after ours built upon the same doctrines to preserve to themselves and their children the blessings of liberty that imperial power which denied the truth of the declaration of independence and by force endeavored to destroy it proud through generations of colonialism stronger than when our ancestors diove it from these beloved shores by pillage and plunder and death though at a cost that staggered humanity has at last destroyed their independence and has decreed as effectually as one generation can decree that republics shall not exist in south africa the business in the philippines in which our government is unfortunately engaged may forbid the official expression of sympathy and the party feeling of republicans may repress in them the sentiments of regret at the fate of the dutch republics but there is no business and no condition that can prevent the free courageous citizens of america who would fortify virtue and strengthen liberty throughout the world and who hope that the blessings of popular government will some day protect the rights of all mankind from shedding a tear of sorrow that the boers were unable to survive the terrors of british power darkness can not exist with light error with truth nor wrong with right our liberty can not exist with the tenets of kings the principles of free government can not exist with imperialism both can not survive we today confront the issue what shall our conduct be shall we indorse or abandon the solemn adherence of our ancestors to the undying rights of individuals and communities shall we approve or protest against the imperial doctrine that permits one community to rule another against its consent shall we uphold or reproach the best principle known to humanity in all its social relationsthat of local selfgovernment shall we commend or accuse that tenet of cruel tyranny that taxes a people without representation shall we denounce or embrace the hated policy of colonialism which our forefathers impeached as a crime for whatever purposes pursued or by whomsoever administered the settlement of the philippine problem will in large part determine our destiny we still have the power to effect that settlement for the benefit of mankind or to permit its settlement to the hurt and injury of the remotest generations the noise of war and the excitement of victory over spain have perhaps so far subsided as to allow us to exercise manly candid patriotic consideration of the difficulty confronting us and our posterity i shall not by wholesale condemn the men responsible for the present situation nor indulge in bitter criticism of the wrongs committed by the administration against the cherished ideals and best sentiments of our people i utter no malice against those who have violated the spirit and the principles of the american bill of rights the subject is too serious the results too vital for bitterness and spite some have doubtless earned by selfish and partisan advocacy of matters subversive of our principles the indignation and scorn of brave highminded men but indignation and scorn however just and righteous do not convince men nor render the problem easier i believe it is better and hope it is fairer to those who shaped the policy our country has pursued for three and a half years to admit their honesty and patriotism and attribute their errors and mistakes to the weakness of human nature when power tempted their ambition and circumstances flattered their vanity and to lament that their moral convictions were not strong enough to resist these seductions the historian will contrast the position of the administration with the policy of our country uniformly pursued from its beginning to the spanish war and search in vain for sound reasons for the departure from our ancient faith his charity may discourage a conclusion that plunder and greed or a desire to subserve the demands of trusts or a longing to obtain other mens land or to destroy other mens rights were the controlling influences around the administration in these days in kindness he may say the hot fever of war glory alone produced that condition of the mind which heard the whisperings of tyranny without rebuke and yielded without remorse reared in security amid the blessings of free institutions they enjoyed what they did not appreciatethe right of men to popular government with the fever on their they seized an opportunity which they imagined never carne to their predecessors and which had it come would have been promptly and proudly rejectedthe opportunity of ruling a distant and strange people and establishing for us the dangers and wrongs of colonialism the historian will write that the acquisition of the philippines was neither the necessary nor the natural result of the war with spain for the freedom of cuba and that the war in the philippines resulted from our needless aggression against a people whose civilization can not elevate whose power can not protect and whose resources and commerce can not enrich us i have now neither the time nor the inclination to discuss why or how the trouble arose we have the philippines we have the trouble the question is what shall be done what course shall we pursue about them in endeavoring to set forth briefly the course which appears wise just and right i shall perhaps make observations with which partisan republicans may not now agree but with which i hope the sober judgment of american patriots who are not personally charged with responsibility to defend the present policy will accord the course that i advocate leads to the independence of the philippine people as a selfgoverning republic and to the independence of the american people from the cruelties corruptions burdens wrongs and dangers of colonialism be it known to all men that unless the american people speak their sentiments at the polls and uphold their manhood and conscience and require a change on the part of their government the present policy will continue true the republican party has not taken the people into its confidence and defined its policy in reference to the philippines and we know the purposes of the dominant party only from its conduct in the islands from the bill now ending and from occasional outbursts from administration sources of strenuous references to the flags staying put references which are usually more in keeping with the character of bullies and braggarts than of good men or statesmen the administrations policy will deny them independence and commit us to colonialism unless the people are willing to sacrifice the moral influences of this republic change its essential political doctrines and adopt the creed of kings they should speak in accents strong and clear against the administration i know of but one test to apply to matters arising for my consideration and the great masses of the people desire their representatives to apply that test to all matters that test is not will it pay not are we in it not can we do it not who opposes it not who favors it but the simple plain question is it right in all ages there have been conflicts in the theories of government some believe that it is unsafe to allow the people to have part in the governing business and that it is prudent and wise to confine participation in government to a few this belief creates oligarchies monarchies and absolutism and princes emperors kings lords dukes and other titles are common to that idea others believe that the people who are to be governed are capable of providing for themselves a proper government and that it is prudent and wise to permit the people to share in the governing business this belief makes the pure democracies and republics and in them there are no emperors or kings or dukes both these beliefs resulting in separate systems of government have with varying success secured peace happiness and prosperity to those governed if all in authority were perfect in mind in conscience in every good quality it would hardly pay to discuss the differences between a republic and a monarchy but all men are imperfect and it is important that mankind shall have that form of government which will be of the greatest benefit to it in its imperfection a monarchy and a republic can not have equal merit both can not be right in one system the theory is that all governmental power resides in and belongs to a feworiginally in the nobility in the royal family with the king as its headand whatever share the people have they have not by right but by the grace of that respected class in the other system the theory is that all power resides in and belongs to the people and whatever power congresses governors judges generals or presidents have is by the will and consent of the people in every republic there are some who believe in the other system and in every monarchy there are those who believe in the peoples theory this has resulted usually in every monarchy having in it many of the characteristics of republics and sometimes in a republic having tendencies to monarchic powers the belief in the right of the people governed to provide the form and machinery of their government and define its duties and powers is the great american doctrine the monarchic or imperial theory pernits not only the few to govern the many but it permits one state or community to govern the people of a sep arate state or community the american theory does not permit it the right of selfgovernment requires local selfgovernment it is the great essential of liberty and progress kings and emperors have denied this right and by force have for centuries repressed it where they could under the government of others people have been plundered in every age whenever one community governs another it is despotism it is tyranny for a people on one side of the sea to rule a people on the other side without their intelligent and free consent and the creator has so made man that he will not intelligently and freely consent for another people to rule his people no people has yet been created that loved not liberty and happy it is for the world that all intelligent people resist tyranny an allwise god made the earth and divided it by oceans ridged it with mountains and belted it with varying climates and the races of mankind he made and to each of them he gave a fitting country no people has yet welcomed the friendly invader of another race and each has resisted the approach of those who sought its land or its freedom this spirit is as universal as the belief in a future state so universal that we believe god gave it to all his reasoning creatures those who violate the laws of nature are wicked and those who violate the rights of people are tyrants reason and justice nature and experience pronounce selfgovernment a sound and safe doctrine the united states four years ago proclaimed it true when we declared that the people of the island of cuba are and of right ought to be free and independent no body of men could be found under our flag to deny that the people of cuba of right ought to be independent cuba was separated from other states by natures barriers her people desired to be free they fought to be free they deserved to be free and independent the cubans have no greater rights than others similarly situated the policy of the republican party forbids the american people to repeat their former proclamation forbids them to say that 10 000 000 of people 7 000 miles away from us whoni admiral dewey declared were more intelligent and more capable of selfgovernment than the natives of cuba ought to be free and independent heretofore in every struggle for independence on either hemisphere success filled every american heart with joy and every failure produced regret can a policy which paralyzes american sympathy for libertyberight supposewhen we were preparing to drive spain from america and establish independent cuba some one had risen in his place in this house and to all the world charged that the administration would take the philippines would overrun them with soldiers would extend to them no hope of independence would require an increase in the regular ainy would require enormous increases in annual expenses would put us in such a position that we could not speak for liberty throughout the world would cause us to enter upon colonialism would have us to bear the humiliation of torture and cruelty conimitted in our nanie upon those people what would have been the reply to such a member you would have denounced him as a wild dreamer a false prophet and a slanderer your papers would have exceeded you in denunciation you would have invoked the glories of 1776 and the constitution of our country you would have appealed to the best sentiments of our nature and to the purest impulses of america to convince us that such things could never occur in the land where jefferson and washington and webster and calhouns memories survive you would have persuaded us that you were only going to break the imperial grasp of spain on cuba and thus give another people the rights of liberty can a policy be right that will compel this country to hold an imperial grasp upon the philippines instead of the policy of the administration the democratie party in accordance with american traditions and principles in the name of right and eternal justice believing that it is wrong to hold the philippines as a subject people and that it is unwise to admit them as a part of our union with many senators and 50 representatives in this congress to help govern us proposes for this country to declare that a stable government shall be established and the people under the name of the philippine republic be given independence what a glory my countrymen that would be heretofore our example has inspired the establishment of republics on other continents here let our action release one let it be not said that america holds chains upon a people is it not better for our country to continue a career as a great people who have established republics who have inspired republics who have promoted throughout the world the universal hope of political freedom than to mar the best pages of our history and join the ranks of the republic crushers and hope destroyers let the free men of america realize that our government is their agent and that they are morally responsible for the deeds of their government unless they promptly repudiate them a responsibility which they can not if they would avoid let the people understand that the powers of imperialism and the denial of independence are just as wrong just as despotic just as mischievous when exercised by our government over a distant people as when exercised by the monarchies of europe over a distant people that we are the perpetrators of iniquity does not change its character in the sight of the almighty god and in the judgment of good men we have no special dispensation to relieve us from the criminality of wrongdoing god never gave the right of lib6rty to one people and gave them the right to destroy the liberty of another people can brave noble men with clear consciences and good hearts deliberately deny to other communities the rights and privileges which they demand for theirs has the golden rule no application among states and statesmen is it right to continue a policy that would abrogate the divine injunction whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so unto them such a policy can not be right an impartial man whose vision is clear can see in the arguments against the administrations policy the dearest principles of societyhonesty not robbery brotherhood not tyranny candor not hypocrisy liberty not despotism we are clothed in thd armor our fathers wore and the weapons they used against the foes of americas independence are our weapons we drink without fear from the fountains of democratic institutions and would extend their waters to others knowing they have blessedourselves we embrace in our arms the declaration of independence and stand hopefully b3neath our constitution using no disinfectants to preserve us from the contact while those who defend the policy of the administration resort to unholy methods to limit the spread of their contagion shades of our 1776 heroes what a spectacle is presented to you when an american statesman avoids the principles of your revolution in discussing questions of importance to mankind thesqber judgment of your descendants will condemn the position of those who apologize for your immortal declaration and who ignore its plain meaning for selfish and partisan ends but they say we have become a world power and the intimation is that if we are a world power the rules of right and conscience are no longer useful to us does power corrupt and never purify and elevate a world power forgetting that if we are to abandon those essentials that make us a world power we shall no longer be worthy to remain one deweys victory at manila and schleys at santiago were because of the element of liberty and patriotism instilled into us by our predecessors we never rumbled our artillery we never flashed a sword we never marched on mmn army we never fired a cannon in south america yet we were a world power when brazil argentina and bolivia became republics under our influence nineteen republics on the western hemisphere stand erect in liberty today to attest the fact that we were a world power long before the thought of colonialism ever touched an american president we are a world power not on account of but in spite of the philippines but never again in all the ages will we have the influence for freedom in the world we heretofore enjoyed until the flag of the philippine republic raised by our consent is saluted by our cannon but they say it may be that we have sacrificed our principles but we have sacrificed them for the filipinos we rule them for their benefit we deny them independence that they may rejoice ini our liberty we destroy their people that they may enjoy our benevolent assimilation our general has ordered a province to be made a howling wilderness for their sake we have established concentration camps to bless them we torture them to impress our christian civilization we burn their homes and devastate their lands for their good all this we do that they may be happy and contented spaincruel despotic and selfish spaindid all this in cuba and the philippines for the sake of spain and spanish interests but we they say do all this for the interest of those we outrage and plunder and kill are we a nation of hypocrites will the american people permit this country to be written down in history as a false pretender will they consent to have it entered upon the balance sheet of eternity anmong bloodstained conquerors as a robber ah we are able to subdue the last aspiring filipino we can make a peace so universal that the laughter of a child will never there be heard again we can acify them till not a native shall respect or fear our flag we ave the power the courage the means to conquer them till protest shall be silenced our policy appeals to fear not love tyranny may give peace and quiet but peace and quiet are poor compensations for the loss of freedom and hope despotism can not secure national happiness we may circumscribe them with liberty by means of our army the liberty that we think them entitled to enjoy the liberty we think will bless them but liberty imposed can not satisfy liberty imposed is not liberty the wild bird caged longs for natures freedom and though you feed and shelter him he beats his wings against his prison sides for the liberty of his cage is tyranny why those people are ten millions in number three times more numerous than we were when yorktown was fought they have a territory as large as japan or italy larger than england ireland scotland and wales together larger than virginia north carolina south carolina and maryland combined larger than all new england new york new jersey and delaware they have churches and colleges their chief town manila is as large as this city of washington they have farmers mechanics merchants and bankers scientists doctors preachers lawyers judges they have much education so much that our government has employed over 4 000 native filipino teachers in the public schools the filipinos have homes there are husbands and wives whose lives are gladdened by the prattle of little children they love their kindred their homes their country they are human beings endowed with certain inalienable rights such as you and i claim they have human sympathies human feelings of pride and resentment they have aspirations such as our fathers had they have the motives and the feelings of resistance just as we have they are our fellowmortals they have read the declaration of independence and more they have believed it are such people to be denied the right of a national existence and have that denial from washingtons country how often have i rejoiced at the everlasting desire of irishmen for a separate national existence and hoped with them for final success republicans how can you censure any american citizen for desiring to see the filipinos have an independent national existence hope is their offense can any good man in america denounce as a crime a peoples hope for independence aside from the filipinos the american taxpayer has rights every citizen is entitled to peaceful conditions to low taxes and to require his government to be just and do right the philippine islands as a permanent colony of the united states will probably require a large army and will for generations probably now and then break out in insurrection against our authority and require the blood and anguish of this land to put it down a peoples desire for liberty once aroused never abates the philippines have already cost us 600 000 000 which is about 50 for each family in the united states and thousands of lives and the end is not yet the navy and army will require vast sums of money every year on their account five years ago our army cost about 25 000 000 a year now about 100 000 000 then our navy cost about 30 000 000 now about 80 000 000 a year our pensions will cost many millions a year for the next fifty years on their accounfit our children and theirs will feel these great burdens severely imperialism is a costly wrong even on those who exercise it there is one thing sure unless the people consider these vast burdens of taxation and expenses and rebuke the party responsible for them they will not diminish if we could today have the philippine republic enter the ranks of independent nations with prudent and proper reductions the taxpayers of our country would save more than 100 000 000 a year or several times our entire trade with those islands is it right to continue a policy that will cost our people for whose benefit alone our government exists many millions of dollars a year and which will give the great body of the people absolutely no benefit in return is it even possible that the republican party supported as it is by the great trusts of the land can convince the people that such policy is right the wishes of the good men of this country who devote their energies to quiet life are entitled to as much respect by our government as are the wishes of those devoted to schemes of great exploitation and conscienceless commercialism or whose fortunes are cast with our army and navy it is not difficult to find some reason for the advocacy of the republican policy by certain classes of our citizenship without impugning their patriotism except by comparison with other sentiments it is natural for officers in the army and navy to approve conditions which furnish them service render promotions more numerous and rapid and enlarge in public esteem their occupation we understand how those who make fortunes by contracts with the government for coal ships guns powder provisions clothing and a thousand other things can favor a continuation of a policy which they probably advised and which puts money in their pockets we understand why stockholders in great syndicates engaged in exploiting the natural resources of those islands and in getting valuable franchises for public service functions to enable them to collect large dividends from the inhabitants who believe there is money in it t for them insist that no change shall be made in a policy which probably they advised it requires no peculiar ability to comprehend the reason which prompts republican postmasters and papers whose editors or owners have political patronage or places under the administration internalrevenue officers and others who or whose close kindred by the grace of the republican party draw salaries from the federal treasury and others in office representing the republican party or candidates for its honors to stand by the policy maintained by the administrationthe administration which has not the moral power or the original purpose to resist the wishes of the classes first named all these are ready to defend the policy now in force at all points to deny the bestestablished facts and when not denied to justify the most terrible wrongs and to attempt by countercharges to distract the minds of good men from the real situation the classes i have named and their close friends in my opinion constitute the greater part of the strength of the present policy few others heartily approve it yet among them are good men some ministers of the gospel even forgetting it seems the holy precepts of their own religion and the gentle method of its propagation in a devouring zeal for theirs justify the policy which they trust will result in weakening if not destroying the domination of that religion they most greatly fear but sirs the great majority of the good men of this land who have no ax to grind no especial interests to serve who love their fellowmen and serve justice and truth of the lawyers the editors the doctors the merchants the manufacturers the farmers the mechanics the laborers the preachers the teachers and others engaged in honest private toil are in my judgment in favor of liberty throughout the world are against the present philippine policy and against its resulting cruelties burdens tendencies and dangers if realizing its importance they will fearlessly and candidly express themselves the problem will soon be solved in the best interests of all concerned except the military folks the army contractors the exploiters and republican officeholders and office hopers the present policy may profit a few but never in all this world will it help to the extent of one solitary cent the humble plain men of americathe great masses of our countrywho bear its burdens except that here and there a widow or aged man will draw a pension for some loved ones death i wish to say a few things about the cruelties which have been committed by our agents under our flag and which were unrebuked by the administration until democratic speeches and publications riveted the attention of all upon them it is not my purpose to mention all the barbarities connected with our conduct in fhe philippines the public has already become fully acquainted with some of them of which knowledge has reached our country nothing in all the range of warfare can surpass the heartlessness of the shooting of every filipino found within 150 yards of a telegraph pole or of our general bells order that neutrality should not be tolerated and that no person should be considered loyal simply because he does nothing against us and takes the oath of allegiance he must denounce and betray his countrymen and his kindred to escape general bells hostility living quietly and working peacefully the land of his ancestors for his loved ones sake though swearing allegiance to us is disloyalty under that inhuman order our general smiths order to kill allover 10 years of age desiring no prisoners burn their homes and make samar a howling wilderness is as atrocious and beastly as any edict that ever cursed humanity in its darkest periods how terrible is war against a peoples liberty when the representatives of christian civilization can promulgate such heavenshocking savagery the anals of mans butchery of man contain nothing more awful in its ferocity it is painful to recall the instances of transgression against time laws of god and man committed for us in those distant islands but unless we recall them how shall the people understand what their agents have done those agents have laid waste fruitful lands and burned populous towns they have slain noncombatants and put to death prisoners in their care these have they committed under our flag our fellowcitizens have read in histories and heard from their fathers of laying waste lands burning towns shooting with guns and slaying with swords but it has been reserved for these times to teach them of new torturestortures which senator hoar declared have never before been used by englishspeaking people against their enemies the horrible water cure which is described in private weirs letter which i ask to have printed together with captain wests report has been administered to filipinos to extort from them treachery to their friends and the more horrible flesh twisting and tearing torture has been performed to compel from them the secrets of their fellows excruciating horrors brave humane honorable christian americans shall such heartrending heartsickening deeds be charged to the wicked depravity of a few privates and fewer officers as the necessary outcroppings of mans sinful nature or will you charge a part of it to that policy of aggression adopted without your consent and followed without your approval against a people who want independence and who never denied you citizenship never taxed your business interests never searched your ships never violated a treaty with you never threatened to invade your country never disputed your boundary nor did any other thing for which nations go to war will you charge these cruelties alone to the miserable individuals who erpetrated them or will you not assume some of the responsiility for allowing your government to continue a policy which created the conditions under which human nature has so fearfully sinned ordinarily in civilized warfare about three or four and occasionally five times as many men are wounded as are killed that has been the proportion among our soldiers in the philippines the proportion among the filipinos has often been four times as many killed as wounded and sometimes ten times as many killed as wounded no mind can conceive and no heart appreciate the tragedies concealed in those startling proportions god pity the men who kill or torture wounded and captured enemies and make needless anguish for widows and orphans and god pity those who justify or palliate such inhumanity so widespread has the spirit of cruelty become among our officials that in courtmartial trials for some offenses i have named acquittals have resulted almost as of course when right is ignored civilization so soon degrades that officers heretofore kind hearted and humane have performed or approved deeds of startling depravity permit me to leave this harrowing phase of our conduct across the pacific which has been an offense not only to the filipinos but to ourselves our army our people and all humanity and which can not be justified by reciting the savage deeds or recalling the bitter prejudices of either side during the civil war between our states it seems to me that every clearthinking man must believe that we are engaged in a business that is wrong and that we ought to get out of it as soon as a stable government can be established there and ought to let the people of those islands know that we are willing for them to assume an independent station among the nations of the earth and work out their own destiny as to them shall seem best sirs the republican party must believe that but finding itself in an embarrassing position it has not the moral courage to take a manly way out of it but remains in it cringing before the shylocks and gold hunters it is not power nor force nor judgment that is lacking but it is moral sentiment and moral courage in order to do right the administration needs the command of the people however plain may be its duty to change its course it will not except under compulsion by the american voters the administration has wonderful pride of opinion and of position but not the strong sense of right sufficient to enable it to adopt a better opinion or take a better position in the face of temporary humiliation which may attach to the change the noblest manliest thing a mortal man can do is to change from the wrong to the right will the american people permit a continuation of the present philippine policy out of respect to the false pride of the administration or will they require that their wishes and their judgment calm clear and pure be pursued by their governm ent we can hold those islands and survive we can take their lands and goods and still eat drink and be merry we can year after year send noble young men from this county to take the places of those who fall in battle or succumb to the diseases of that torrid climate we can maintain an army there sufficient for any purpose we can tax the american people far more than they have ever felt for the luxury of the sin of imperialism we can magnify the fighting ann of the government at the expense of peaceful ideas we can do all this and more and yet possibly escape for some generations the fate of other nations that sinned but even then we would no longer be the country our fathers bequeathed to us ponce de leon searched in vain in the tangled wilds of florida for the fountain of perpetual youth for men our fathers searched amid the mingled doctrines of all nations of every age and the principles of all hearts for such a fountain for government and found it we believe springing from the mountain side of everlasting right in a government of the people for the people by the people and as a neverfailing guide to its waters they established the declaration of independence most nations lie as most men diefrom internal causes we might oppress the filipinos forever we might destroy their 10 000 000 people and annihilate every product of their hands so that no evidence of them should remain on earth we might sacrifice 10 000 american men annually over there and pay out 200 000 000 annually in the business without necessarily destroying the american republic that is possible only in the event that it had no resultant effect here in order to fatally harm us it must affect us internally with a malignanf disorder the gradual loss of money and blood would weaken us but the worst would not be the loss of money and blood those who plunder there would plunder here those who wish to rule the filipinos against their consent will wish to rule us against our consent cruelty there will result in cruelty here despotism there will mean despotism here contempt for human life there will mean contempt for it here those who will deny liberty to them may deny it to us to magnify the army there is to magnify it here a man who will steal there will steal here the spirit of plunder despotism and cruelty will pervade our government in its relations to us and our children if it pervades it in its relations to others so these resultant effects of a colonial policy i fear will be the poison that will in the years to come destroy our childrens liberty and inflict upon them by slow processes a tyrannical government in which the great trust magnates of the future shall more boldly oppress the people under a form of government in which they will be the privileged class and whose source of strength will be not in the love and respect of the people but in the power and dread of the armed soldiery and glittering steel there is nothing that more plainly demonstrates to us the consciousness of wrong on the part of the administration and its defenders than its methods of reply to our arguments we mention cruelty against which every true soldier revolts and they pretend that we attack the army we would preserve the honor of our army by having its torturers and criminals punished and dismissed in disgrace and having its conduct honorable but when we condemn the atrocities of heartless officers and men under our flag they pretend to regard it as an assault upon the entire army they can not deceive others by their false pretenses they know that we honor the army rejoice in its victories sustain it wherever it goes and constantly vote it supplies but we will not disgrace ourselves by approving the crimes committed by its members in our name they would have us keep silent deny ourselves the freedom of speech so essential to justice and to liberty and have the people to remain in ignorance of much which has been done for them in the philippines they criticise those of us who look the facts squarely in the face and speak boldly about them they have even spoken of hostility to our army and even hinted at disloyalty but they will learn that contemptible criticism of free speech false charges and bitter calumny against those of us who believe in american principles in truth in right in liberty to all mankind can neither intimidate us deceive the people nor strengthen their own position the people i have the honor to represent want to know the truth at any cost ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free the administration and its policy are not so far above the people as to be exempt from their vigilance and criticism our people have never recognized the tyrants claim that the king can do no wrong it was a despot louis xiv who exclaimed i am the state my enemies are the enemies of france a free peoples executive has never arrogated to itself the incarnation of righteousness or regarded the criticism of the people as disloyal in all governments there is a tendency to usurp powers and privileges but never before has the executive department of a republic deemed censure of itself as hostility to the people another evidence of weakness of their position is the constant endeavor on their part to shift the responsibility of their policy from themselves to providence and sometimes they seem to think it unassailable if supported by the assertion that it was the policy of our late assassinated president throughout all ages hypocrits knowing the deep religious feeling of good men have 6ver sought to enlist the favor of the people for measures they could not otherwise defend by declaring that providence had the matter in charge usually the manifestations of providence are not in the exclusive visions of the powerful or discernible only to aggressors the afflicted the weak the downtrodden the meek and lowly have fortunately been blessed with the power to know the presence of providence i would expect providence to be on the side of suffering humanity praying for deliverance on the side of struggling liberty begging for existence on the side of appealing justice pleading for sympathy and not always on the side of greed and pomp of power and oppression or as a great conqterqr claimed on the side of the heaviest artillery for one as a believer in the bible and in the holy doctrines of jesus of nazareth i deny that the administration has produced any satisfactory reason for proclaiming that their policy is under the guidance of providence instead of appealing to facts of adducing argument of reciting the declaration of independence of speaking of mans natural rights and of his love of liberty of mans universal brotherhood and other matters that ennoble and convince the administration itself has resorted to the acts of the demagogue and pettifogger it has denounced the policy of the democracy as snarling criticism this was to arouse the prejudice of its partisans without enlightening their understanding it is the method of error writhing under the lashings of truth and is evidence of despair as they face the people in the ensuing campaign but sirs if the secretary of the navy has spoken of snarling criticism the president himself has perhaps for the same purposes and certainly as an evidence of the same weakness in argument to support his policy more widely transgressed the rules of reason and debate on a great occasion in a place dedicated to the memory of heroes around which the tenderest and most patriotic sentiments cluster president roosevelt in a memorial address took occasion to endeavor by references to lynching in the united states to either distract attention from the cruelties practiced in the philippines or to unjustly criticise those who have spoken about them or both while at the same moment he declared that these lynchings are no excuse for such cruelties it is hard to understand the partisan mind that can compare a filipino killed or tortured because he wants his country to be free and a brute lynched because he assaults a womans virtue did any other official of such dignity in all the world ever resort to such speech he told the old veterans of the union army gathered there before him that those who foully slandered them in the civil war had their heirs today in those who traduce our armies in the philippines it is remarkable that the president a generation removed from the civil wax whose duty is to create a spirit of fraternity throughoul our land should revive its bitter memories and in his imagination conceive traducers in order to silence criticism of his indefensible philippine policy it is hard to believe that such speeches will strengthen him in any section of the country but probably he thought so and iadmit his right to look out for his political future such speeches are not made for that section of the country where it is safe to rely upon offices to gather the entire strength of his party and both sections may be of use to him hereafter he failed to specify a single instance of slander or traduction of our army in the philippines a man of straw he made and attacked with strenuous vigor to such straits are the defenders of colonialism driven the people will have the facts power and place and intimidation can not limit their minds or bind their consciences free speech may be criticised and honest patriots may be denounced but our countrymen will think they will consider well what touches them and their posterity they will reason as free men about it and fear can not divert their hearts from striving after what is pure and fair and just and right i believe there is a spirit of universal right that binds together the good deeds and worthy enterprises of the world that inspires noble conduct and virtuous living among men that resists vice in private and corruption in public life that lifts up the fallen and protects the weak that cheers the upright and confounds the wicked that creates liberty and destroys tyranny that engenders hope and honor and sympathy and love and teaches all mankind to reverence the mercy and goodness and wisdom of almighty god in solving this philippine problem we appeal to the intelligence of the american people to discern this spirit of right and to their consciences to sustain it i shall append to my remarks some

sentiment god forbid that the day should ever come when in the american mind the thought of man as a consumer should ever submerge the old american thought of man as a creature of god and endowed with inalienable rights this noble and inspiring thought of a distinguished soldier a profound lawyer and a pure statesmanwill fall muheeded upon a party which he once honored held now in the grip of a sordid commercialism which it dare not shake loose if it would and which bids it to pass this unamerican unjust hasty and wholly indefensible measure ostensibly the bill is to provide revenue for the philippine islands but its true purpose and meaning is only thinly veiled by its title instead of a bill temporarily to provide revenue for the philippine islands and for other purposes it should read a bill to fasten the protective tariff and its resultant system of trusts more securely upon the american people and for no other purpose opposed as we are to the general tariff law as applied to foreign countries as being grossly unjust both to the american consumer and producer we are in still greater measure opposed to its application to any part of our own territory we can not assent to the doctrine that any part of american territory wherever situate is foreign to the american laws and constitution it is little wonder that statesmen belonging to different schools of political thought should deplore the departure as contemplated by this bill from wellestablished historical precedents and rules for governmental action well may the american people pause at the rapid assaults made upon constitutional government and the repeated efforts to graft the offshoot of monarchy on the fair tree of the republic the supreme court in its latest decision known as the fourteen diamond rings case holds that importations from the archipelago to the united states are not dutiable because the islands are american territory and not foreign under the treaty of paris congress now proposes to make them foreign by passing this measure relying upon the majority of one the court seems to have no difficulty in determining what is and what is not american territory until congress passes a tariff law and then by a clear majority of one it may be relied upon to reverse its decision and to declare as foreign that which it had before declared as domestic the question which lovers of liberty and constitutional governinent will ask is what shall be the end of it all for if congress should see fit to place a tax upon all goods from oklahoma or new mexico entering the states of the union such a law if precedent is followed would be declared constitutional by a majority of one some of the american people who have been in the habit of supposing they were an inseparable part of the republic would be made to realize their error and those wonderful countries clamoring for space on the flag for two more stars to represent sovereign states would see their high hopes perish as they would be inadmissible to the union by a majority of one all honor to those judges who have refused to follow the devious andperilous windmngs of these opinions and who have declared that no tariff bill passed by congress can amend the constitution of the united states or alienate one foot of american soil but in submitting to a decision giving congress absolute authority over our new possessions and making its will the supreme law of the land we shall still insist that it shall not be used except in fairness and moderationwith due regard to the rights of our own people and the rights of the islanders who have involuntarily been brought under our dominion and control we insist that the tariff schedule prepared by the philippine commission should not be validated by congressional action for it is less flexible and more prohibitory than that of any other enlightened colonyholding nation of the world we insist if we must keep the archipelago that its products shall enter our ports free of duty and that absolute free trade shall prevail between the united states and all her possessions and we demand it whether the protected interests of this country are injured or not as the only true rule of right between a nation and its colonies or if free trade shall not prevail we demand that an autonomous government be erected so that the islanders may say what if any the tariff rates shall be on goods which enter their ports or if this be denied and the schedule prepared by the philippine commission should be made effective by congress and the revenue thus derived is to be expended for the benefit of the people on the on the islands we then insist that on principles of common justice they should have a part in determining how this revenue should be expended which the proposed measure denies them so far as the importations from the philippine islands into the united states are concerned the dingley tariff law which this bill proposes to apply to the productions 6f the islands places a prohibitive duty upon hemp tobacco and sugar which constitute their most valuable commodities and we protest against it as the worst form of a medieval colonial policyan affront to the moral sense of mankind as well as antagonistic to the just laws of trade so far as importations from the united states to the islands are concerned onerous tariff duties are imposed by the philippine commissiofi on raw cotton and all its varied products on agricultural implements hardware of all description and in short upon every article necessary for the development of the country thus does the alluring picture vanish which the republican party drew of the trade advantages which this country would enjoy with these possessions and thus by the operation of this bill are the ports of both the united states and the philippine islands closed the one against the other the work of legislation for these islands should not begin with this wrong which all the military force we may send against them will never undo it is a breach of international good faith and places our country in a position where not only may its declarations be questioned by foreign powers but invites discrimination and prohibition on their part against american trade we demand the open door to china but close our own to ourselves and to all the world it places us in the front rank of selfish grasping nations and fixes upon the republic with a written constitution every word of which is a living protest against this measure the odious system of coercive monarchies for one i am not willing to thus surrender the honor of the republic to the demands of the protected favorites of government who are clamoring for the passage of this bill when we govern a willing people by our own system of laws and apply the rules of conduct to them by which we are governed and do not tax them without representation we have the true type of republicanism when we govern an unwilling people by different laws and apply to them different rules of conduct and tax them without representation we have the methods of the crown when we are told that the revenue to be derived will be used for the benefit of the philippine islands we quote the language of john jay the first chief justice of the united states in his eloquent appeal to the people of great britain in which he protested against taxation without representation these and many other impositions were laid upon us most unjustly and unconstitutionally for the express purpose of raising a revenue in order to silence complaint it was indeed provided that this revenue should be expended in america for its protection and defense these exactions however can receive no justification from a pretended necessity of protecting and defending us thus are the high scenes in the parliament of england when the wrong against the colonies was consummated transferred to the floor of the american congress to the burning shame of the republic when we are informed that a contract to clear the harbor at manila has been awarded at the cost of 3 000 000 we ask why it was that a republican congress last year failed to appropriate one dollar for american rivers and harbors when claims of necessity are made for the expenditure of enormous sums in a remote country in a state of outlawry and among a people who can never become american citizens we point to that great river which at times gathers the waters of a continent and bears on its mighty tide the wraith of the dreaded flood we ask you to look upon the map of your country and there find in the lowlands of the south a soil rich beyond compare and capable of the highest excellence and development we beg you to remember that these lands of measureless value belong to sovereign states and are a part of the american union the men who are there and who will go there love their country and their countrys flag and stand ready to build american homes and turn up the soil if protected against disaster why leave this fair field to batten on that moor when it is urged that public roads must be built we call attention to the fact that the islands are not yet pacified and that a large and highly expensive standing army is required to hold in subjection even the small area of american occupancy if built at all it is conceded they will involve a heavy outlay and run through a country ill adapted to the purpose if used at all they will be for military purposes only and we are opposed to the military road in the philippine islands just as we were to the military roads of spain in cuba and porto rico by which that ancient monarchy sought to sustain her despotic sway if it is replied that paternalism is involved in this idea so it is in the one proposed when it is asserted that the revenue derived from this bill is to be used for the education of the filipinos we answer that no tropical race has ever been or ever will be educated out of its heredity and environment when it is urged as a reason for the passage of this bill that 4 000 schoolteachers have recently been employed we answer that the islanders demand free trade and not free teachers we direct the attention of the country to the enormous sums to be expended in this doubtful experiment of education and denied to the 8 000 000 or more of ignorant blacks at home who could at least be taught the industrial arts and whom the southern people are taxing themselves to educate without governmental aid and often to their sore distress the republican party placed this heavy burden upon the south which has contributed so much to the glory and honor of the republic we have heard much of the new south i deny that there is such a thing as the new south it is the same old south who gave a jefferson to state american liberties and a washington to achieve them it was the old south who strewed your flag thick with stars of sovereign states it is the same old south who parted with the union for just cause and came back at appomattox in good faith but without apology it is the old south who has ever stood for the constitution it is the same old south in whose fair and loyal bosom the serpent of anarchy has never slept it was the old south who knelt with you at the bier of martyred mckinley and mingled her tears with yours it was the spirit of the old south which followed the flag to the islands of the sea it was the old south who gave winfield scott schiey to his country who stood on the brooklyns bridge and wrought imperishable glory the luster of which no naval cabal can ever dim if this bill should pass every child born in the philippine islands would be without a country i never want to hear the term mother country applied to the united states for she has never bred a colony and from her womb none but american citizens have ever sprung and they have made american states who is there proud of his country and drawing his inspiration from the crowding and glorious memories of every battlefield for human freedom from concord bridge down to yorktown who would sell the proud birthright of an american citizen for that of an american subject representing as we think the true american policy we still revere the declaration of independence which the republican party has spat upon and relegated to the lumber room of useless things holding fast to the constitution which has safeguarded us through every peril and pointed the way for the feet of libertyloving men to walk hitherto untrodden heights of glory we again enter our protest against the passage of this measure here we plant our standard and refuse to yield one principle in the firm establishment of human rights or forget the lofty story of american independence the flag is spoken of as if we were its enemies the intimation is untrue i revere that symbol as the highest and holiest earthly emblem and whether on land or sea it commands the respect of the nations of the world but it is because i do that i never want to see it wave except in honor wherever it is raised i would have liberty and the blessing of selfgovernment shaken from its folds and i would furl it forever in every land where it stands as the physical sign of american sovereignty if the constitution the soul and spirit of the republic could not follow it"], [0.0060866475105285645, 0.9939133524894714, 1, "that question is one in the extreme that is unnecessary it in effect assumes or states that trusts are all commerce which i deny trusts are not legal or moral commerce commerce is moral business and

reminded the party and the country of those pledges inspired by patriotic motives this side of the house went to the relief of the dominant party and assisted in passing through this body the measure to give trade concessions to cuba but we did not do this until there was placed upon it a proper amendment repealing the differential duty on sugar this amendmentinjuriously affects the sugar trust and for this or some other reason deponent sayeth not what the republican party refuses to pass the measure and keep its promises and maintain good faith toward cuba in 1896 the party pledged itself to save the country if possible from the gold standard and reiterated assurances and pledges it had given in its national platforms of 1884 1888 and 1892 that the party was in favor of bimetallism it promised with an audacity unparalleled that if intrusted by the people with power it would promote international bimetallism it totally and ingloriously violated this promise and instead thereof proceeded to enact legislation committing the country to the single gold standard they passed what they called the goldstandard act march 14 1900 and whether this policy was right or wrong wise or unwise i am not now inquiring i am only saying it was a palpable violation of anteelection pledges to enact that legislation after obtaining power upon the strength of pledges and promises in direct opposition to that policy was a base violation of the trust committed to their hands and was the building by that party of an enduring monument to its own perfidy and unfaithfulness the passage of that currency act was in flagrant violation of all their former professions and anteelection pledges and no election frauds or stuffing of ballot boxes in philadelphia or elsewhere in all this land is of grosser immorality and more truly deserves the just condemnation of a betrayed people in its platform of 1900 when again asking for power and place it pledged itself to the principles of the gold standard which it declared it had set up and established in the act of march 1900 and yet when the battle was on and the conflict was raging between the two great parties that same year it declared through its chosen chief financial officer and mouthpiece the secretary of the treasury and many other lesser lights that the goldstandard act was not safely on the statute books and that unless he or someone like unto himself was kept in his office by a republican president that that standard was insecure and that its blessings might not be enjoyed and made perpetual although they had arrogantly boasted in their platform and on the hustings that the parity of all our money and the stability of our currency on a gold basis had been secured this secretary of the treasury and other leaders of his party brazenly announced to the voters and the country that the parity of all the money had not been assured and that the stability of all the currency on the gold basis could be destroyed by a presidential order if this latter statement was true the real financial situation had hardly been changed or modified by the currency act of march 1900 and thus this boasted act of congress was proclaimed by the party itself to be a hollow mockery and must have been passed either to deceive the country or it was evidence of the lack of ability of the party to enact intelligent legislation they are left to take either horn of the dilemma the argument made by the secretary of the treasury and other leaders of their party again beguiled the sovereign people and a further lease of political power was given the dominant party the scarecrow of some presidential order overturning the goldstandard act was held up on every stump throughout the campaign and fervid appeals were made to capitalists and indeed to all classes to once more give the dominant party power that this defect or alleged defect discovered by the astute secretary of the treasury in the currency act might be corrected and the country saved from irretrievable misfortune and disaster it was therefore most natural to expect that when the opportunity was again given to the dominant party to cure the alleged defect in the law and an opportunity be given to place the stability of the gold standard beyond the power of destruction by executive or presidential orders that no time would be lost by them in the enactment of such legislation they promised that if power be continued in their hands that the gold staidard and the parity of all our money would be conclusively established yet when the congress republican in both branches assembled in december 1900 just subsequent to the election of that year although their promise and pledge to cure the defects in the law mentioned were fresh in their minds and in the minds of the american people they permitted that session of congress to close without any effort to amend the currency law and so again this session of congress convened on the first monday of december last and although we are now near its close not one line of remedial or alleged remedial legislation of the currency act of 1900 has been enacted if any such remedial or amendatory act has been considered by the dominant party or even introduced into congress it has been permitted to sleep unnoticed by the powers that be the conclusion is therefore inevitable that the party discredits their great financial oracle the late secretary of the treasury and gives no weight to his alarming prophecy of disaster to the business interests of the coirtry in the event of defeat to that organization in consideration of these facts and the light of history may we not charge that when the party through its secretary of the treasury sounded the alarm i have mentioned and assumed to rally the people around the financial saviors of the country his party was simply building another monument not this time one of perfidy but one of its twin sister hypocrisy not having witnessed since the last election any effort to enact legislation to place the gold standard and the parity and stability of all our money beyond the power of executive disturbance we may safely assume that in the next campaign we will not be told that there is any danger to be apprehended or injury to come to the country or its business interests from this source no matter what may be the result of the election but i will here dismiss this subject if i were called upon to name the agency or factor in american affairs at this time most dangerous to our institutions and threatening to their permanency i would name the trusts this may seem on casmd thought to be an exaggerated statement but i verily believe it is true some idea of the magnitude and extent of the trust business in our country maj be had from a recent statement made by james j hill in an address to the illinois manufacturers association in this address he said that the capitalization of 183 american corporations commonly called trusts is in round numbers 5 000 000 000 i have in my possession a printed list of these combinations which shows that there are more than 290 of them in this country i believe this list is reliable and it further shows that the capitalization of these corporations amounts to over 10 000 000 000 if we accept the more conservative of these two statementsthat is that the capitalization of the trusts amounts to 5 000 000 000it is difficult for one to realize what is meant by the statement it means that the capitalization of these concerns exceeds the total stock of money of the united states by 2 000 000 000 of great britain by nearly 3 000 000 000 and of germany by about 4 000 000 000 in other words the total stock or capitalization of these 183 concerns accepting mr hills statement is more than the entire stock of money of the united states great britain and germany combined it is almost impossible to overstate or exaggerate the immense and almost limitless power they can exert in the forum of politics in the marts of trade and in social life it should be borne in mind too that they constitute a new element in our trade and business operations and experience that they are a factor to be feared and one that imperatively demands the strong hand of the federal government for control can not be denied but must be apparent to all persons if one doubted this that doubt could be removed when he is reminded that one of these trusts has the power and only recently exercised it of extorting more than 1 000 000 in a single month from the consumers of one article of food over and above what would ordinarily have been taken from them and that of prime necessity to them in one city of our country this was done in philadelphia as was freely charged in the newspapers of that city by an arbitrary raising of the price of beef and when the state and condition of the meat market did not justify or warrant such increase in price this is only a single specimen of what they can do and are doing all the time and everywhere throughout the land other instances might be given but time will not permit a striking illustration of their marvelous influence and power will be found by consulting the price lists of today it will be seen from these lists that scores and hundreds of articles the products of highly protected manufactures in this country manipulated and controlled by the trust are made and transported to foreign countries all freights duties and other expenses paid there where they are sold daily in the foreign market at prices considerably lower than those demanded and received from our home consumers in our home markets i am not here demanding that these organizations shall be totally suppressed and destroyed by congressional legislation it may come to that later in our history at present there comes up from every village and hamlet of this broad land an irrepressible cry for their government and control congress alone can answer this cry and afford the desired relief and why should they not be subjected to the domination and control of the government if they are not curbed and restrained in their oppressive and heartless commercial greed they will in time absorb all the wealth of the country and defy the power of the government itself they do not hesitate even now to make the boast that the life of the public man will be promptly taken by them if he has the temerity to attack them or to raise his voice against them it can not be successfully denied that they are potent in politics i have already said they were of recent origin this is true as they were never heard of in our fair and happy land until it was afflicted with the highest protective tariff law ever known in any land or among any people that this tariff is their mother we ence by its operations if it is defective why has it not been have the sworn testimony of many of their chief beneficiaries amended and made effectual not a line has been added to this these trust magnates under oath freely admit the parentage act of 1890 by the dominant party though as stated it has been of the high protective tariff and confess that without its be for a long time in the supreme control of the government and nignant nursing and coddling they could not exist and would during which period these concerns have enormously multirapidly perish plied i said a moment ago that they were almost allpowerful in pol seeing that they had nothing to fear from congress and that itics and it is charged that they dominate and control the party no real efforts to stop the robbery of the trusts were being made in power the strong arm of the federal government alone can they have gone along in the broad open daylight with their negovern them and stay their progress and stop their intolerable farious work until nearly all the business of the people has been greed and prevent their cruel supremacy in all our markets will organized into monopolies and combinations and the prices of the government stretch forth its restraining hand and do these commodities have been fictitiously forced upward to the conthings what is the government at present it is

enter into their daily cost of and the congress the appeal for relief is made by a suffering living people but that appeal goes unheeded and is treated not alone i have referred to the abnormal

fervid appeals tant price to which they lifted the price of beef a few months ago crowd thick and fast upon that forc7m which alone can afford the claim was falsely set up by the trusts as a justification for relief a deaf ear is turned and the comforting answer is made this outrage that it was due to the scarcity of cattle to show that we should let well enough alone conclusively that this was untrue and that there was no foundalet me ask to whom is it well enough surely not to those tion for the defense they were falsely making i call attention to in one city from whom 1 000 000 is extorted without cause the real facts as to the exports of meat products from this counfor beef in a single month the party in power has hereto try at the very time they were making the claim that there was a fore recognized and do now recognize the evils of which we scarcity of cattle here i complain in its national platforms it solemnly declared against the treasury export tables recently issued show that for the trusts it sought and obtained power upon an express promise month of march 1902 the united states exported meat as folto give relief to the country from their rapacity and

abroad in the month of march so that it appears protect and promote competition and secure the rights of producers labor that during this month according to the contention of the beef ers and all who are engaged in industries and commerce trust there was such a scarcity of cattle that it became necessary the language is we condemn all conspiracies and combina to advance the prices of meat to prices that were prohibitory to tions intended to restrict business this is a plain and simple thousands and tens of thousands of families and yet it could declaration but we have no evidence that it was made in sin easily ship out of this country this enormous quantity of meat cerity what they condemn in the words just quoted is exactly the facts show that the trust shipped this meat to great what these trusts do every day and for which complaint is made britain and other countries and sold it in their retail markets who can remedy the complaint the party alone which so and at prices considerably below the prices demanded from home severely condemns it in words consumers the price list shows that on april 30 last american if their condemnation was sincere why have they not legislated beef was selling in london at 14 cents a pound which was 10 and why do they not now legislate to put a stop to these con cents lower than the new york price for the same class of beef spiracies and combinations intended to restrict and which do so at that date and yet congress enacts no remedial legislation effectively restrict business the republican party alone can the result of the conspiracy to exact tribute from the people apply the remedy and although that party has been in the su upon the beef they were compelled to buy as shown by the market preme and absolute control of all the branches of the government reports has been a large falling off in its consumption the confor more than five years they have not within that time passed a sumers of beef have been compelled to resort to substitutes thereline of legislation to put a stop to the great evil complained of for but the relief obtained in this way was only temporary for no friend or apologist of the trust will deny that they create forthwith the substitutes were cornered and their prices at once monopolies limit productions and control prices if for these raised to exorbitant figures some persons resorted to poultry things they are condemned by the republican party and by the and eggs but by a wellorganized monopoly the retailers who whole people i again ask why is the remedy not applied the dealt in chickens were forced to pay for them as high as 50 cents same platform declared that the republican party favored such per pound legislation as would effectually restrain and prevent all such the fresh eggs which formerly filled the market places now find abuses i again ask if this declaration was true was it not their way into refrigerator cars and coldstorage depots until consimply an anteelection declaration made alone for the purpose of sumers are forced to pay the trusts and monopolies higher prices obtaining votes and with no intention of enacting restraining for their daily supply of stale poultry and eggs than ever before legislation in our history monopolies like those which were granted by the again that platform declared that the republican party fa crown in france

trusts have been put out of exist law can be placed on the statute book which will restrain trusts so long as the execution of these laws is left in the hands of the trusts if we would remedy these bad conditions the appeal for relief must be made not to the trusts and monopolies nor to any political party which they can control the appeal will lie and must be made to the masses of the people who in their everyday lives feel the heavy hand of the trust upon their means of subsistence it must be made to those who realize that the rise in the price of meat cruelly made by the trusts is theft from the j oor mans dinner plate at home and from his dinner pail when e is at work the efficient and natural remedies for the lubearable evils complained of are of comparative easy application there are two remedies for such evils the one is through the tariff law and the other through governmental control it is not necessary to resort to absolute free trade nor is it necessary to demand or require a total destruction of corporations in very many instances corporations are necessary and beneficial agencies of activity and serve to develop industrial exercise and many business interests but being the creatures of the sovereignthat is the artificial person created by lawthe sovereign the creator may impose the conditions of their existence and place due and proper limits upon their operations it is not their total destruction or prohibition that is demanded but their control and government so that while being protected and fostered by the government neither it nor the people shall be injuriously affected by them in 1890 now twelve years ago it was discovered that the power of the trusts was becoming so great that there should be some restraint placed upon them by congress and as a result the act known as the sherman antitrust law was passed i have already referred to this act it has failed in its purpose the necessity for its amendment is apparent and admitted and yet it has not been amended by the republican party the subject was considered and amendments to that law making it effectual were considered in the last congress which as stated was republican in both branches when the defects in the sherman act were fully pointed out and nde clear the amendments curing the defects and the omissions in that act were then conclusively shown no one contended that the sherman act was sufficient to accomplish the end desired and no one controverted the fact that the bill then before congress amending that act and which was fully considered by the house if enacted into law would give relief to the people from the wicked oppression of these trusts the mockery and farce of the consideration of the bill for relief was gone through with and although the people were unanimously in favor of its enactment and their representatives nearly so it was put to sleep by the dominant party who controlled the congress its passage was defeated by the republican party in the meantime combinations and conspiracies intended to restrict business have multiplied in number like the locusts of egypt the end of this session of congress republican in both branches is in sight and yet no measure of relief has been passed or even considered even the efforts put forth by the party in power in the last congress to pass a repressive measure has not been repeated during this congress and it is now too late our fiends on the other side appear to be paralyzed by their fear of the trust power and influence they cry out in their dismay and ask is not the president and the attorneygeneral endeavoring to restrain the trusts by an action in the courts this is true but at the same time they know and admit that the present law under which the president is proceeding is not strong enough and that the relief desired can not come to the people through the one action against the one beef trust congress as i have repeatedly stated must enact other legislation but action is not taken while the masses are crying for relief the dominant party is overcome with apathy they are overtaken with a kind of legislative lethargy and they are content to make the effort to substitute a dose of executive strenuosity for congressional ennui in other words they seem to hope that presidential perseverance will atone for their absence of legislative energy and activity measures to control and govern trusts are pending now in the committees of this house which if reported by the majority composed of republicans in every committee and taken up and passed would afford speedy relief if supplemented by the second remedy i would suggestnamely the reforming revising and reduction of the rates of duty prescribed in the present tariff laws one of the measures of relief to which i refer is a bill introduced by myself into this congress amendatory of the sherman antitrust law this bill is almost identical in its provision to that passed by the house during the last congress and which the republican majority in that congress refused to enact in the law although they permitted it to be passed by the house this bill is h r 14947 and is entitled a bill to amend an act entitled an act to protect trade and commerce against unlawful restraints and monopolies approved july 2 1890 as i have already stated it was believed when this bill was pending before this body in the last congress that if passed it would give relief to the country from the grinding exactions of the trust we have tendered it again to the majority in this house and earnestly ask for its consideration and passage at their hands to the enactment of this or a measure similar in its provision every member on this side of the chamber stands solemnly committed we will today and at any hour give unanimous consent for its passage enact this measure into law and make some reasonable and fair reduction of the rates of duty prescribed in the present tariff law and i confidently believe no intelligent man would contend that a most effectual check if not the total suppression of trusts and monopolies would speedily follow beyond all peradveiiture their power to do evil would be greatly reduced the claim is made however that the tariff must only be reformed by its friends do they not control all the branches of the government their utter failure to reform it shows that the reformation can not be left altogether to its friends one might as well expect the wolf and the fox to reform themselves and give up their passion for the lamb and the fowl and become respectable and wellbehaved denizens of the farm and poultry yard as to expect the ravenous and greedy beneficiaries of high protection to voluntarily surrender any portion of their benefits under the law or to assist in any reformation of protective rates that reduced their profits but i repeat what i stated a little while ago that it is not necessary to resort to absolute free trade or even to a radical or farreaching reduction of tariff rates time and again during this session of congress the opportunity has been given the majority party in this house to enact moderate measures that would have afforded immense relief to the country another one of these relief measures which i had the honor to introduce into this house and which could have been considered on any day of the session that the majority might name is a measure to which i will now call attention even now unanimous consent would be cheerfully given by this side of the house for its consideration when the opportunity was offered for its consideration in the house such consideration was refused by the republican majority the measure to which i refer is very simple in its provisions but that it would be effective i believe can not be controverted that measure provided that when it is shown to the satisfaction of the president and secretary of the treasur that articles and commodities are manufactured and con trolled or produced in the united states by a trust or trusts the importation of such aticles and commodities from foreign countries shall be free of duty until in the opinion of the president and secretary of the treasury such manufacture control or production shall have ceased the proposed measure contained the further provision that when it is shown to the satisfaction of the president and secretary of the treasury that any article or commodity which is manufactured in the united states is sold in a foreign country more cheaply than the price at which the same article or commodity is sold in the united states the rate of duty on such article or commodity shall be reduced by the president and secretary of the treasury 50 per cent of the present rate or to such extent as to prevent the continuance of such irregularity and injustice and remove the indirect tariff bounty which promotes the same if it be true as i have already contended and as has been admitted by many of the beneficiaries of the trusts that the high protective tariff under which we now live is the mother of trusts then it can not be denied that if the measures i have mentioned brief and simple as they are were placed upon the statute books many of the opportunities that the trusts now avail themselves of to oppress the people and to wring from them exorbitant prices for the absolute necessaries of life would be largely removed if not altogether destroyed i can not undertake to mention at this time all the combinations afflicting the body politic but i do at this point mention one which is among the most unjust and oppressive of all of them it is the steel trust this monopoly has become so obnoxious and offensive that even one great leader of the republicans mr babcock of wisconsin has been constrained by the pressure upon him at home to introduce into this house a measure to give some relief to the people from its exorbitant and iniquitous exactions and allow me to inquire when that gentleman forced as he was to seek some measure of relief in what direction did he turn in other words what relief measure did he propose naturally enough and not strange to say it was a bill to reduce the tariff on the items of steel and iron and the products thereof as set forth in the metal schedule of the dingley tariff law allow me further to inquire why it is that when a republican can no longer withstand the pressure upon him by his own people for relief from the burdens imposed unnecessarily upon them by these monopolies and trusts that the answer to that demand if met at all is met by an effort to reduce tariff rates it must be because they know that the high protective tariff is the cause of the oppression their action in all such cases show more conclusively than if admitted in a hundred declarations that they know that the fountain of their woes is the tariff law when they can not longer persuade or cajole the voter to sit still and be bled by the beneficiaries of high protection they seek to satisfy them by the introduction of relief measures reducing the tariff and they too often pretend that they are earnestly supporting such measures while they let them slumber and die in the pigeon holes of their committee rooms the morgue of many meritorious measures the republican authors of these measures then return to their tooconfiding constituents and meekly claim that they did all they could to obtain relief for them that they presented the proper bills and had them referred to the appropriate committees ut that under the rules of the house they could not get them considered they do not tell them that they assisted in making the very rules which prevented the consideration of their measures and that they made them for the express purpose of preventing the consideration of such measures they not only makethe rules but they enforce them against themselves most rigidly and yet they return to their outraged constituents and appeal to them to be pacified and tell them fanciful stories to satisfy them that they had done all in their power to pass their relief measures the pressure for some relief from the oppressiveness of the high tariff has become great in many portions of the country and it has not infrequently found vent even in the conventions that nominate republican candidates for congress some of these conventions have only recently passed resolutions solemly instructing the nominees to support tariffreform bills and yet i am sorry to say after accepting these nominations and winning their seats on this floor by a mock support of the platforms and resolutions upon which they were nominated they utterly and totally disregard their instructions and anteelection promises and when the opportunity is often given to them to keep and perform their pledges and vote for the measures of relief demanded by their people and their platforms they straight forget what manner of men they are and either vote directly against the measures or evade the issue by having them declared out of order when called up by others under the rules of the house to demonstrate clearly that i am not exaggerating this matter or drawing upon my imagination for facts i will read to the house a resolution adopted in a nominating convention held not long since resolved that we favor a revision of the tariff without unreasonable delay which will place upon the free list every article and product controlled by any monopoly and such other articles and products as are beyond the need of protection i am sure that there are gentlemen on this floor who on hearing this resolution read would promptly say that it came from some democratic convention and that it meant the disturbance of business and the utter ruin of the country it is not out of place for me to call attention to the similiarity of this resolution to the relief measures i quoted a little while ago introduced into this congress by myself and which i said if enacted into law would greatly benefit the country can it be true that the placing of such an act on the statute books would bring disaster to our business interests this resolution was unanimously adopted in a republican convention in the now republican state of wisconsin it was the convention in the district represented on this floor by mr jenkins who for several years has been an honored member of this house it was further declared in that convention that the country had outgrown protection and did not now need high protective rates"], [0.009489715099334717, 0.9905102849006653, 1, "i wish to state at the outset that tfe remarks i shall submit to the house this afternoon will not have reference to the pending question my purpose is in the time allotted to me to say something in regard to what might be characterized as the southern question the only apology i have to make for obtruding my remarks upon this question at this time is that it is currently reported and well understood that when the resolution requiring an investigation into the suffrage laws of the different states is reported no time or very little time will be allowed for general debate therefore if i can have the attention of the house for a few minutes i desire to place my views upon record it is well understood in political circles that the solid south is not a dream or a supposititious condition or situation but is a real fact standing then upon the threshold of this discussion i purpose offering some reasons for the existence of this situation and explaining briefly why there is in one section of this country a people solidly and unanimously united in matters of politics it will be my purpose in the discussion of this question to say nothing which may tend to irritate the gentlemen upon the other side of this chamber nothing calculated to arouse their passions or their prejudices but it is my purpose to state facts as they are and appeal to the sober common sense as well as to the sense of justice of the gentlemen who occupy seats upon this floor it is a wellknown fact that the people of the section which i have the honor in part to represent are allied with the democratic party and the reason that this party is so largely in the majority in that section is not only because of the treatment which the south in the past has received at the hands of the dominant party but because we believe with all our hearts that the democratic party stands for all that is highest and best in governmentthe things best suited to our condition and to the condition of the country at large why mr chairman and gentlemen has the resolution known as the dick resolution been introduced in this body what has caused the gentlemen upon the other side of this chamber to conclude that it is necessary or proper that this resolution should be offered whence comes the demand for this proposed legislation is it a result of a broad spirit of patriotism and love of country found in the breasts of our republican friends who is so ignorant as to answer yes the fact is gentlemen this resolution is the offspring of sectionalismnarrow bigoted sectionalism the conservative people in every section of this great union desire to see close fraternal relations exist between all our people it has been our boast as well as our hope that the new century would be free from the bigotry and rancor of the old we of the south had hoped that we would be allowed to work out our manifest destiny without the patronizing demagogical supervision and espionage of politicians and mercenary statesmen i have no idea that the great body of the people of those states from which come the advocates of this measure desire any such legislation the people of the south do not now nor have they ever presumed to dictate to other sections of the country as to their suffrage laws and matters of domestic policy local selfgovernment is a principle tear to the heart of every true american and gentlemen who advocate the dick resolution need not delude themselves with the idea that the people of this great country demand this legislation or will sustain those who attempt it again what good is the pending measure intended to conserve does the great republican party see a handwriting on the wall and fear that the south will once again control legislation and shape the policies of this government considering present conditions the dominant party~s large majority in this body the arbitrary rules foisted upon the house and its consequent absolute control of legislation upon this floor i again ask what good is to result from the proposed investigation of the suffrage laws of southern states what good is to come from the proposed reduction of southern representation when you already have legislation in your own hands yes it is a fact that there is a solid south and it will remain so the people of that section are obliged to stand together for their common defense we would have it otherwise we would have conditions more conducive to larger individual freedom of opinion but the attitude of the republican party toward the governing class in the southern states has made the solid south a necessary political condition it is a matter of surprise to the people of the south that the leaders of the republican party should persistently interfere in the domestic affairs of the southern states and by vicious legislation thwart them in their efforts to build up their section the republican party seems to lose sight of the fact that we of the south are more than southernersthat we are americans of kin to the people of every other section of our country connected by birth history and tradition with you of the north bone of your bone and flesh of your flesh as proud of the anglosaxon blood in our veins as are you and yet americans though we all are some of you are prone by vicious legislation to oppress your brethren and kinsmen under the specious guise of aiding an alien and an inferior race found in our midst and for whose presence in our locality you are largely responsible to my mind the golden rule is as applicable to political as to private affairs and under its binding sanction we demand at your hands the same measure of consideration which you expect us to accord you this above all to thine own self be true and it must follow as night the day thou canst not then be false to any man the condition which the advocates of this resolution claim exists in southern states is greatly exaggerated and misunderstood but so fax as it does exist the responsibility therefor lies at the door of the republican party we have high authority for this statement mr blaine one of the leading lights of the republican party and in many respects superior to his party in his book twenty years in congress admits the truth of this proposition in speaking of some of the conditions which resulted from the civil war and the reconstruction methods of his party he said the consequence was that some of the states had wretched government officered bv bad men who mislead the negroes and engaged in riotous corruption their transgressions were made so conspicuous that the republican leaders of other southern states who were really trying to act their part worthily and honorably were obscured f dd not obtain a air hearing at the bar of public opinon the government of south carelia under its series of republican adminis trations was of such character as brought shame upou the republican party exposed the negro rotors to unmerited obloquy and thus wrought for the cause of free government and equalsuffrage at the south incalculable harm this situation honestly stated by yourgreat leader is theprob lem w which the south has had to grapple for a third of a century the people of that section alone uderstand the true situation they alone are competent to settle what you call the southern question the southland is their home and country and they will control it in spite of the ravings of bitter partisans and politicians when you tell us that we oppress the freedman and deny him the right to vote we ask what is the status of the large nmber of negroes found in your section of the country notwithstanding the fact that those among you are of a higher type than the great majority found in our midst yet how many negroes hold office in massachusetts pennsylvania ohio indiana and other great states whose representatives upon this floor are so extremely solicitous of the welfare of their southern brothers in black how many of you recognize them as yore social and political equals vote for them for political positions or try to lead them into the higher walks of life and yet be it said to your shame in this the highest lawmaking body in the american union you declare by your conduct if not by your words that we of the south should accord to the colored man privileges which you yourselves deny him the situation in the south is peculiar two distinct races occupying the same territory one race the owners of the soil and tuiti recently the absolute owners of the other race one race the highest type of civilized man the other a people without a country just freed from the yoke of bondage ignorant of the rights and duties of citizens and yet by cruel wicked and unphilosophical legislation suddenly placed upon the same legal footing with the other declared to be the equal before the law and entitled to share equally in the functions of government the situation is without a parallel in modern history and for its proper solution we need reason and cool judgment exercised by broadminded statesmen rather than by bitter partisans as a result of the bitterness engendered by the civil war the republican party deliberately undertook to humiliate the people of the southern states that party for its own purposes ignoring its duty to the common country and particularly to the southern section thrust the ballot into the hands of the untutored and irresponsible freedmen declared him the equal of his former master and even placed him in the halls of state it is needless however to say more upon that feaure of the situation the bitter struggle of the south is recent history and i have no desire to revive those unpleasant memories the people of that section have met the issue fairly have solved it in a reasonable philosophical and legal way it is a case of the survival of the fittest the socalled southern question is a sociological question and not a political one it can never be successfully solved as a political problem and the more such attempts are made the more complicated and annoying will the situation become but we are told by the gentlemen on the other side of this chmuber as well as by newspapers that echo the enlightened sentiment of the republican party that representatives from the southern states need not become excited or go into hysterics over this proposition that no wrong is igntended and that there is no disposition to place the south uder negro domination and control what thenais the purpose of this resolution is it to conserve the best interests of this country the best interests of the southern states or is it not rather to advance the interests of the republican party hiwe hear it said however that the real purpose is to reduce the representation from the southern states in accordance with the provisions of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the constitution of the united states we deny the right of this body to interfere with our representation as at present composed the constitution of ithe united states declares that the house of representatives shall be composed of members chosen from the several states of the union in proportion to population it has never been the theory of tits government that representation should be predicated upon the number of electors in a state but only upon population and each representative upon this floor is the spokesman not only of the electors in his district but of all the people whatever their condition white or black male or female it is true that section 2 of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the united states reaffirming the doctrine of representation based on population does provide that representation may be reduced in any state where male inhabitants otherwise qualified are disfranchised on account of race color or previous condition of servitude but even then this body can not constitutionally reduce the representation of any state unless it can show the exact proportion that such disfranchised persons bear to the whole number of electors furthermore the proviso would not be applicable if the abridgement of the right of suffrage applies to all classes alike another section of the constitution provides thatthe electors in each state shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislature therefore beyond question the federal constitution concedes to the several states the right to determine for themselves the qualifications of their voters here again it appears that we should treat the socalled southern question as a sociological proposition and deal with the freedmen of the south with the same freedom that all the states of this union exercise in dealing with the question of woman suffrage in other words each state has the right to extend or withhold the elective franchise accordmg to the enlightened conscience of its people provided of course there is no discrimination as to class strange things happen in the school of politics gentlemen upon the other side of this chamber who will doubtless vote for the dick resolution when it is reported and thereby provide for a committee to go into the southern states to examine into the condition of our suffrage laws are radically inconsistent the southern black man is the object of their especial care and yet the filipino is considered neither competent nor worthy to cast a ballot in the land which is their birthplace and for which they are fighting today in the discussion of the philippine tariff bill it was vehemently denied by some of the republicans upon this floor that filipinos are capable of governing themselves and yet so blinded by prejudice and swayed by partisan zeal you demand that the people of the south submit to negro domination for you know that that would be the practical effect of the complete enfranchisement of the southern black filipinos according to your argument are unfit to govern themselves while on the other hand you seem to consider that the southern black men are capable of governing anglosaxons your brethren allow me to quote from the published report of the philippine commission in this condition of affairs we have thought that we ought first to reduce the electorate to those who could be considered intelligent and so the qualifications for voting fixed in the municipal code are that the voter shall either speak read and write english or spanish or that he shall have been formerly a municipal officer or that he shall pay a tax equal to 15 a year or own property to the value of s250 if such is your judgment in regard to the filipinos a people who have at least a measure of civilization and a kind of government why is it that you want to remove all restriction from the negro and give him the right to vote regardless of qualification speaking particularly for the state of south carolina we are willing to rest our case upon the record we are willing to have the constitution of 1895 construed in the light of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the constitution of the united states it is true these amendments are the product not of the cool and deliberate judgment of the wisest statesmen of the period in which they were adopted but rather are the offspring of the passion and rancor prevailing at that period the ratification of those amendments so far as the south is concerned was obtained at the point of the bayonet i have no desire however to reopen those unpleasant questions or give utterance to thoughts unbecoming tis period of our history or unbecoming a representative of a great people yet the introduction of this resolution emphasizes the fact that the spirit of 1860 is still abroad in the land whatever may have been the sentiment of the great body of the people of the north at the time those amendments were adopted one thing is certainthe conservative people throughout the entire country now confess that the enfranchisement of the negro was a mistake a mistake of the republican party a mistake the bitter consequences of which we have had to suffer while you have stood by and expressed amazement that the people of the south have not gracefully submitted to this great injustice and have not been ready to kiss the hand that smote them the right of suffrage is neither a natural nor an absolute right it is not one guaranteed by the constitution of the united states it is a relative right one which is subject to control and the people of the sovereign states composing this union have the right to declare for themselves who shall be entitled to cast the ballot this right is inherent in the state as a sovereign and no power anywhere can deny this exercise of sovereignty unless it is exercised in such a way as to contravene the provisions of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments of the federal constitution here again let me quote from that eminent republican mr blaine speaking with reference to the adoption of those amendments mr blaine in his speech on basis of representation in congress used this language these propositions differ somewhat in phrase but they all embrace the one idea substantially of making suffrage instead of population the basis of apportioning representatives or in other words to give the states in future a representation proportioned to their voters instead of their inhabitants as an abstract proposition no one will deny that population is the true basis of representation for women children and other nonvoting classes may have as vital an interest in the legislation of the country as those who actually deposit the ballot indeed the very amendment we are discussing implies that population is the true basis inasmuch as the exclusion of the black people of the south from political rights has suggested this indirectly coercive mode of securing them those rights were the negroes to be enfranchsed throughout the south today no one would insist on the ado tion of this amendment and yet if the amendment shall be incorporated in the federal constitution its incidental evils will abide in the loyal states long after the direct evil which it aims to cure may have been eradicated in the southern states basing representation on voters unless congress should be empowered to define their qualifications would tend to cheapen suffrage everywhere there would be an unseemly scramble in all the states during each decade to increase by every means the number of voters and all conservative restrictions such as the requirement of reading and writing now enforced in some of the states would be stricken down m a rash and reckless effort to procure an enlarged representation in the national councils foreigners would be invited to vote on a mere preliminary declaration of intentions in these latter days it has been found that the federal constitution which has been of force for more than a hundred years is somewhat in the way of those who are now in charge of our governmental affairs and while as to some questions the republican party insists upon a strict construction of the constitution yet when they find it necessary to have at least some apparent authority for doing an act which in the past has been considered foreign to the purposes and principles of our government they want a liberal construction so when we come to discuss the socalled southern question and ask why this resolution has been introduced we are pointed to the constitution and its amendments and reminded thus saith the law the constitution has been found sufficiently elastic to adjust itself to the changed conditions of the country and the highest court in the land has interpreted it in the light of present circumstances and in a philosophical way rather than in a strict and truly legal way in other words the decisions of our supreme court indicate that the constitution will not be allowed to stand in the way of the present administration whether we believe its construction relative to the powers of this government to acquire and control foreign territory is sound and in keeping with our past history and traditions is of no importance now the court has declared the law so when we come to consider the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments as applied to existing southern conditions we ask for a fair and liberal interpretation like that you place upon other provisions of the constitution in dealing with porto rico and the philippine islands but we are told that we have made invidious distinctions in our suffrage laws in the south and that therefore there should be an investigation to see whether or not we are denying the right of suffrage to anyone contrary to the provisions of the federal constitution it is unnecessary that i enter upon any further discussion of the legal questions that arise under this proposition it will be time enough to argue that phase of the case when the proposed committee shall have made its report but speaking particularly for the state of south carolina i dare to say that so far as their legality is concerned we are wining for you to make a most rigid investigation of our suffrage laws we are willing to stand by the constitution and laws which we have adopted and we believe that when it becomes a practical question we will be able upon purely legal grounds to satisfy even a partisan majority that we are right in our contentlons and that we have not illegally treated the colored people of the south the suffrage laws of south carolina are fair and apply to all alike we have simply

000 less for miscellaneous support alkd 75 000 less for the current contingent expenses of the department the increases are about 90 000 and are practically entirely within the heading of miscellaneous gratuities and all of that increase is more than accounted for by the single item of 100 000 for the benefit of the mission indians in southern california which we deem to be necessary

plain and the highest court in the land has passed on its validity and sustained the constitutionality of its provisions the antitrust act of 1890 declares that every contract or combination in the nature of a trust in restraint of trade and commerce among the several states and territories or with foreign nations is a conspiracy illegal and void and punishable by fine and imprisonment under the law of our country trusts are criminal and there is no distinction between a socalled good trust and a socalled bad trust between a big trust and a little trust every trust is contrary to both the spirit and the letter of the law to seriously contend otherwise as a legal proposition would be preposterous if we did so by analogy we might as consistently assert that there were good pirates and bad pirates if robbery is criminal it is immaterial so far as the crime is concerned whether the robbery is a big one or a little one the violation of law is the same under this antitrust act it seems to me every trust in the united states can be prosecuted for violation of law the charter annulled and the men behind it punished for conspiracy every trust by its very nature is in restraint of trade and commerce and in violation of this law if you will read the antitrust act of 1890 and the dedisions of the united states supreme court in the transmissouri freight case and the addyston pipe line case the conclusion will be irresistible to the logical mind that the fault is not so much with the law as it is with the men who are sworn to enforce the law the law so far as it goes is all rightthe donothing attorneygeneral is all wrong the imperative mandate of the day is enforce the law and every trust in the country will dissolve whenever the trusts have been brought before the courts and their true character shown they have been declared illegal in my opinionand i say so advisedlythe department of justice under the present law can institute and successfully maintain actions against every trust doing business in the united states nothing would be more welcome to the trusts than to change this lawespecially its criminal penalties these it is true have never been enforced but some day the people may get an attorneygeneral who will enforce them and if they are enforced a few trust magnates may have to go to jail and that will be the end of the criminal trusts one trust magnate behind the bars will be an object lesson that will do more good than all the speeches ever delivered here against the trusts the gentleman from maine seems to me to be in an embarrassing position he changed the title to his billhe gave up his original billand substituted for it a weak apologetic makeshift that will accomplish nothing or do great harm now i want the members of this house to see how cleverly the trust lawyers amended the title of the original bill if you will take the title of the original bill introduced by my friend from maine you will find it required all corporations to make true returns and the trust lawyers some way or other induced the great trust buster from maine to amend his bill so that it leaves out entirely all corporations and true returns the entire billi mean the new trust billnow before us is a hollow sham i had an idea at one time that amounted to almost a conviction that my goodnatured friend from maine was as earnest as honest and as sincere a friend of the people and as bitter a foe and as intense an opponent of the trusts and monopolies as i am but i am compelled reluctantly compelled i regret to say to be constrained to stand here today after having carefully read the bill originally introduced into this house by the gentleman from maine and the substitute bill prepared by the trust lawyers which the gentleman from maine substituted for his bill and which he now offers us and stands sponsor fori am reluctlantly constrained i must confess to say that this substitute as a remedy to more effectually curb the power and the sway of the criminal trusts and monopolies is seven pounds lighter than a straw hat now another matter inthis connection somewhat personal and i dislike exceedingly to refer to myself but i must i introduced a bill an antitrust billa real antitrust billa bill that would do something and that meant somethinga genuine trustbusting antitrust bill in december 1902 more than a year ago i thought my bill in my modest and humble way was a better bill than the bill originally introduced by the gentleman from maine it was referred to the gentlemans committee i went before the gentlemans committee and made a strong and if i say it myself i believe an eloquent argument in favor of it i thought at that time the gentleman from maine liked my bill perhaps not so much as he did his own creation but i got the idea that we nearly agreed as to the necessary remedy a great many distinguished gentlemen who are opposed to trusts representing labor organizations representing the american antitrust league representing commercial bodies and other industrial enterprises also went before the gentlemans committee and spoke long and earnestly and eloquently in favor of my genuine antitrust bill the gentleman from maine intimated substantially that my bill was a most excellent bill but that he was just a little afraid that it went too far perhaps and might hurt the trusts just a little too much but he in substance suggested that there were features in my bill regarding publicity which he thought ought to be incorporated in any bill which the committee reported that was all very niceand i thought so then and i am glad to stand up here and say that the gentleman from maine my friend the erstwhile trust buster did put into his bill some of the provisions of my bill but they were the mild provisions of my bill which amount to little or nothing the gentleman from maine studiously left out of this bill everything in my bill which would do something which would amount to something which would check and cure the trust evil and which would more effectually curb the potential power and the autocratic sway of the trusts now another thingand this is a good time to say it again and i want to repeat it every chance i get on behalf of my democratic colleaguesthat when the department of commerce bill was pending in this house i offered my antitrust bill as an amendment to one of the sections of that department of commerce bill and every democrat in this house voted for it and every republican in this house including the great the only and the original trust buster my good friend from maine voted against it applause and laughter on the democratic side i have noticed however that since the department of commerce bill has been pending in the senate a farseeing and sagacious senator contemplates amending that bill by incorporating in it an antitrust provision very similar to mine i hope the senator will do so he can have my antitrust bill in toto and i believe it is the best bill ever introduced in this house to establish publicity regarding the trusts i have no personal vanity in this matter i am only a humble servant of the people with mediocre ability and being in the minority i can not hope to do more than construct legislation i can only prepare good bills i can not pass them only republicans can make laws nowadays but i care not for the glory all i want is to secure results for the people yes we witness quite a spectacle today we see the eloquent former trust buster from maine now the advocate of the octopus the historian of monopolies and the special pleader of the trusts perhaps it may be unconscious but the fact can not be overlooked and the republican party as represented on the floor of this house has changed its position very materially on this question if you compare the promises made with the meager bill presented my friends on the other side seem to be running away from the president i believe the president is honest in his antagonism to the criminal trusts of the country i believe he is sincere in his recommendations to check their apparent evils i know he is a true american and i believe the president wants this congress to do something to curb the power of the trusts in the interest of the people the republicans pretend that they do also but you do not carry out your promises or the recommendations of your president you wink at the exactions of the trusts while you throw a sop to the people in the nature of a futile bill like this that will be just about as effectual to remedy trust evils as a last years birds nest it is apparent you are fooling the people again you seem to glory in it and they seem to like it if it were not for the sadness of it allthe misery the woe the want the poverty of it allit would be to laugh every time i see the republican elephant at his old tricks i am reminded of what p t barnum facetiously said the people like to be humbugged the republican party has evidently copyrighted that remark and on every occasion religiously lives up to it when will the people open their eyes and wake up how much longer do they want to be humbugged the president asks for and recommends antitrust legislation the people all over the land plead for relief from the exactions of the trusts and the sad experience of the past and the urgent exigencies of the present demand drastic legislation against monopolies and the rigid enforcement of existing laws but what do you do what you always do fool the people some more when they ask for bread you give them something you call bread but which is really only a stone this bill now under discussion will accomplish nothing it is a misfit a makeshift a miscarriage its ostensible purpose is to please the people and not displease the trusts its hidden object is to strike a deadly blow against the penal penalties of the antitrust act of 1890 and i believe and i say that if this bill with all due respect to the legal ability of my friend from maine should i become a law in its present shape it will go far to repeal by implication the criminal provisions of the antitrust law of 1890 y not allow me or some one to amend the bill so that there will be no question about it let me say in this connection that it is remarkable that no attorneygeneral under the provisions of the antitrust law of 1890 has ever instituted a single prosecution to enforce the criminal penalties of that act and i believe and i stand up here and assert and defy successful contradiction that if the attorneygeneral would enforce in one prosecution the criminal provisions of the antitrust act of 1890 and put one trust magnate behind prison bars for violation of law it would do more to effectually curb the power and the sway of the trusts than all of the oratory and all of the little popgun bills will ever be able to do i do not believe this bill that is now before this house this socalled substitute bill this bill which really does nothing will be any more effectual so far as the enforcement of any remedy is concerned than if the gentleman from maine should try to stop the progress of a mad elephant on the rampage with a putty blower i do not believe this bill is going to accomplish what the country demands i believe it is really liable to accomplish harm i think there ought to be some provision in this bill similar to that which the distinguished senator from massachusetts put in his billthat nothing in this bill should in any way repeal any law now on the statute books against the trusts so that no matter how the courts may construe this bill if it becomes a law there shall be nothing in it by which any part of the civil penalties or the criminal penalties of the act of 1890 shall be repealed or eliminated now this bill is a mere makeshift it is a mere sop to the people it is what the republicans always do they talk all right at the moment they talk all right during the crisis they talk all right before the election but after the crisis is passed after the election is over when they begin to legislate they legislate so as to do no injury to those who sustain them to those who aid them to those who make large contributions to their campaign fund in every political campaign it can not be successfully denied and it will not be truthfully denied that every trust in this country from the greatest to the smallest in every congressional state and national campaign makes contributions some great some small to the republican campaign fund i want to say that on account of that fact the intelligent people of this country know that there will never be enacted into law by the republican party any legislation that will do material harm or substantial injury to the great monopolies to the great criminal trusts and to the great corporate wealth of this country"], [0.010151028633117676, 0.9898489713668823, 1, "because we can not get the economy that we desire so much on this side of the house the democrats being in the minority frequently follow the lead of mr cannon sometimes uncle joes white plume leads to victory as did the white plume of henry of navarre sometimes to defeat

the thing was hot but the gentleman from indiana dragged my name in made statements that were not true and then when i wanted to reply said get time on your own side when he knew full well that all

win some votes it may do it for all the fools are not dead yet it may be a good enough morgan until after the election but the cry is villainously false and it is founded on voltaires dictum keep on lying and some of it will stick by the courtesy of the house i hereby reproduce an article which i wrote for the new york american and journal on invitation of the editor and which in condensed form expresses my opinion on this whole philippine problem and which is as follows the philippines like the rajahs diamond have proved an unmitigated curse to all who have possessed them the english had sense enough to abandon them they were a heavy load about the neck of spain for three hundred years wiih unparalleled good fortune for themselves the span4ards sold them to us for twenty millions in cold cash and we are left with the bag to hold the vital issue before the american people is this what shall be our permanent policy in the philippines it goes to the root of our institutions a greater question was never debated among men for upon its proper determination depends the perpetuity of the republic the tariff trusts finance building of the isthmian canal and economy in the public expenses are all important questions pressing for solution but farreaching and urgent as they are they in no wise involve the existence of free government jingo jugglers vociferously and vehemently insist that the overshadowing question as to our policy in the orient was settled definitely and irrevocably by the last election not so however a multiplicity of issues contributed to the result of the campaign of 1900 william mckinleys wonderous personal popularity was a largeperhaps the decisivefactor therein mr mckinley was many thousands of votes stronger than his party many men wie doubt the wisdom of our becoming an asiatic power supported mr mckinley by reason of his unfailing amiability and his blameless livate life while believing him wruig they had implicit faith that at lst e would come around allright they knew that he had changed his mind on that question radically once swinging from the american doctrine that forcible annexation is criminal aggression to the unamerican theory of benevolent assimilation they hoped that he would experience another change of heart and retun to his original position so far as his influence upon our destiny is concerned it would have been far preferable for mr mckinley to have been a bad man with good policies rather than a good man with bad policies for it is as true today as when shakespeare wrote it that the evil that men do lives after them no love for him however intense no admiration for his virtues however sincere no regret for his tragic death however profound no eulogium upon his character however fervid can alter or palliate the fact that y recanting his first opinion and by throwing the weight of his great name in favor of the philippine propaganda he involved the country in dire difficulties and placed our institutions in imminent deadly peril for one hundred and twentysix years we have vaunted ourselves as the propagandists of the idea of government of the people by the people and for the people now we are engaged in crushing a people 7 000 miles away whose only offense is that they desire to practice the theory which we have preached from the housetops nor have we preached in vain for following our example and hearkening to our voice a score of nations have shaken oif the yolk of their royal masters broken their shackles and established for themselves governments modeled upon ours for three years the boers of south africa inspired by the words of jefferson and the deeds of washington made the most leroic fight for freedom recorded in the entire annuals of the human race to our ineffable shame be it said that while england was murdering those brave little republics we stood by consenting like saul at the stoning of stephen wherefore because we are engaged in the same sort of bloody business in the philippines we appear to have entered into a sort of tacit agreement with john b ull that if he will not interefere with our foreign conquests we will not raise our voice against his foreign conquests on the one issue of permanently retaining the philippines and ruling them by the sword democrats would have swept the land from sea to sea for let it not be forgotten that in 1910 it was in the east that we made substantial gains and it was in the east that imperialism was most exploited as the dominant issue the same per cent of gains spread all over the union would have given us the victory if we hope to win we must ex necessitate rei secure recruits from the republican ranks thats plain as the nose on ones face are republicans a unit on this question by no ma ner of means true that not long since uncle jos c nnon chairman of the committee on appropriations in the heat of debate with frantic gesture yelled at the top of his voice we intend to keep the philippines forever and a dayl but it mustbe remembered that on that occasion uncle jon was in a hole and fighting to get out republics are constitutionally unfit to successfully or economicailw administer colonial affairs proconsular government has been notoriously corrupt unjust and tyrannical since the world began and will continue so till the end of time all history sacred and profane demonstrates the truth of that proposition it matters nothing whether the proconsuls are romans britains spaniards or americans the corruption injustice and tyranny grow inevitably out of the proconsular system it is written that evil inventions return to plague the inventors and the corruption injustice and tyianny which we indlict upon the filipinos by our proconsular government will at last he practiced upon ourselves we areo progressing after tae manner of the crab backward already one of our military traps in the philippines has said the constitution is played out there is no use to discuss it another has deelared that men have been sent to prison in the philippines for such utterances as those of professor schurman in his boston speech yet another has pronounced the declaration of independence to he a damiied incendiary document which is precisely the opinion of it entertained by george iii and lord north considered for military purposes the philippines would be a sore of weakness just as they were to spain were we engaged in a war with a great poweras we at any time may hethe philippines would be the place of attack and we would he compelled to do our fightiog 7 000 miles from our base of supplies which would place us at a groat disadvantage doubling the cost and quadrupling the chances of defeat why should we run such desperate risks when we have all to lose and absolutely nothing to gain the basic principle of republics governments derive their just powers from the coisent of the governed is true or we as a nation have io raison detre if that proposition is not true washington

familiarizes the american people with the idea of a large staidiig army general cha en says that we will need 50 109 soldiers in the philippines alone for five years judging the future by the past we will need that many there till the judgment day we are told that waiving the quantum of the sin of subjugating a distant people we must hold on to the philippines because we want their trade it is not denied that trade with the filipiiiosand every other people is desirable democrats are as anxious for trade as are the jingoes but they place liberty and good conscience above money democrats do not believe that we must own a man in order to trade with him the dollar argument is the most sordid of all but let us take it on that low basis and see how the matter stands the philippines to say nothing of the loss of life and the huge pension load we are fastening on our children and childrens children have up to date cost us nearly 600 000 000 according to the arithmetic of senator hoar during the fiscal year ending june30 1901 we expended in the philippines 0 000 000 during the same period our profits from trade with the philippines allowing for orselves 20 per cent profit on all we exported to and imported from those islands were only the beggarly sum of 1 085 511 exp ending 890 a year to get 1 profit may be solarwalk statesmanship but to a plain man who understands mathematics it appears to be stark idiocy the only reason such an insane policy does not bankrupt the united states is because the united states is so rich no other nation on earth could stand it and we cant stand it long without disastrous results our institutions were indeed bought with a great price shall we now recklessly jeopardize them through greed or by reason of a vainglorious ambition for foreign conquest i do not believe that the american people will so decide it surely can not be that the spirit of 1876 is entirely dead in the american heart to that spirit and that heart democrats

taxation labor is likewise burdened by trust exactions imposed by the combinations mentioned by the gentleman from north carolina these trusts and monopolies have flooded the field of industries in the last few years why do you not consult the interest of labor when you mold the policies of government so far from consulting it you would impose taxes on labor that you may further oppress it under the plea of trade expansion by bringing into competition with it the lowestpaid labor in the world our present colonial policy which so vitally and adversely affects labor received its full measure of encouragement by a taxation of the masses to augment the surplus in the treasury the toilers who bear the taxation are made to feel the heavy hand not only in taxation but in appropriations to bring within our domain and hold asiatic and tropical peoples who will dispute with them in all the walks and avenues of labor from earliest time there has been a conflict for supremacy between those of the race well favored with worlds goods and those who struggled for subsistence at first this conflict was waged by force of arms brute force and violence held full sway the weak succumbed to the strong and became their serfs and slaves later in the progress of the world governments were established to equalize conditions to guarantee rights and to redress wrongs the struggles between the contending forces have gone on through governmental institutions and in this country today the only real power of government that needs to be controlled by any interest to dominate all the others is taxation it involves the raising and equipping of armies the creation of navies it involves expansion it involves everything in government for appropriations which are the life of administration must be preceded by taxation taxation can create or destroy in government it has done both if taxes were so adjusted as to charge by tolls and tributes those special interests clamoring for colonies and expansion and exclusively receiving the benefits of it in short if the people were by a system of taxation relieved from this burden and it was placed on commercialdom where it belongs this policy would cease and we would be spared the evils that follow in its train the power of taxation has been used to foster infant industries and is still used to protect them after they have reached full manhood everything in government that is known is made or unmade through the great power of taxation the producers of wealththe laboring menpay the greater part of the tributes levied by the government in the form of taxes but what recognition is accorded to them in legislation the government in late years under the policy adopted by the administration has come to tax the people each year on an average 10 a head for the support of national government this amount falls heavily on the laboring man and his family when to it must be added the state county and municipal taxes necessary to support local administration a large share of the national taxes is expended for the luxury of a colonial policy that tends to bring closer to us and into our dominion an asiatic cheap and competing labor which lowers the level of our labor and makes it less able to bear its burden of tax the annexation of every new island opens a flood gate to cheap labor it will be a menace so long as boats ply between the ports you can not keep it out when the bars are once laid down unless you can eradicate the cupidity of man it will be useless to try when you are adding more coasts to watch more territory to patrol with the ingenuity and cunning of man and the sordidness of the navigation corporations it will be physically impossible to keep cheap labor away not to mention the impolicy and destructive consequences of attempting to prevent free migration from one part of our country to another where will the line be drawn how long will a people under our flag be bound down by restrictions on their travels will they not ever be in revolt or be abject slaves to the unjust system of american colonial rule california and the pacific coast states that have been afflicted as with a plague by the incoming of asiatics seek by act of congress to keep out the chinese inhabitants of hawaii this is manifestly in the interest of labor but can it be lawfully done the japanese and filipinos are as great a menace to labor as the chinese many of the former as artisans are along the streets of the populous cities many are working as domestics and many are on the farms and in the gardens of california and the western states and many more are scattered over the face of this broad country disputing with their low grade of living and low wages that labor which has heretofore been performed by americans but it seems we must deal gently with the japanese because they aided us in the trouble in china because forsooth she is ready to aid in the division and exploitation of china so far from showing the proper interest in labor you make not the least efforts to keep out the japanese a more dangerous menace to american labor than the chinese you exclude the latter why not the japanese you have the power the japanese treaty of 1894 gives you expressly the power i read on page 353 of the compilation of treaties in force of 1899 article 2 paragraph 3 it is however understood that the stipulations contained in this and the preceding article do not in any way affect the laws ordinances and regulations with regard to trade the i igration of laborers police and public security which are in force or which may hereafter he enacted in either of the two countries sir the reason for the retention of the philippines is for the exloitation of china this policy is urged on and encouraged not y the patriots not by the men who labor and pay our taxes but by those who want to profit at the expense of weaker people what is our attitude in china it can all be gathered in brief from pages 43 to 45 of president roosevelts message the president says owing to the rapid growth of our power and our interests on the pacific whatever happens in china must be of the keenest national concern to us the general terms of the settlement of the questions growing out of the antiforeign uprisings in china of 190 having 1sen formulated in a joint note addressed to china by the representatives of the injured powers in december last were promptly accepted by the chinese government after protracted conferences the plenipotentiaries of the several powers were able to sign a final protocol with the chinese plenipotentiaries on the 7th of last september setting forth the measures taken by china in compliance with the demands of the joint note and expressing their satisfaction therewith promptly accepted are proper terms of designation of the action of china which seeks to rule 400 000 000 people with an inert soldiery why should not china promptly accept what all the powers of europe and what the united states all with trained soldiers on her territory demanded of her what further does the president say provisions have been made for insuring the future safety of the foreign re sentatives in peking by setting aside for their exclusive use a quarter of the city which the powers can make defensible and in which they can if necessary maintain permanent military guards by dismantling the military works between the capital and the sea and by allowing the temporary maintenance of foreign military posts along this line an edict has been issued by the emperor of china prohbiting for two years the importation of arms and ammunition into china here is a surrender of sovereignty by a weaker country to the superior force of the joint powers here is the first step in the dismemberment of china by the other countries of the world we join in the erection of military forts and establishments in a foreign country under the provisions of the joint note of december 1901 china has agreed to revise the treaties of commerce and navigation and to take such other steps for the purpose of facilitating foreign trade as the foreign powers may decide to be needed here it is shown that china yields to the other countries the powers the right and authority to dictate and decide what is needed in the revision of chinas treaties of commerce and navigation and is to take such other steps for the facilitation of foreign trade as the foreign powers may decide to be needed this is an abdication of power of government by china forced by the powers again this surrender of power is shown the chinese government has agreed to participate financially in the work of bettering the water approaches to shanghai and to tientsin the centers of foreign trade in central and northern china and an international conservancy beard in which the chinese government is largely represented has been provided for the improvement of the shanghai river andthe control of its navigation then follows a statement which shows how far the united states and europe has encroached on china it shows a monopolizing of a material part of the taxing power of government by the united states and the powers it reads in the same line of commercial advantages a revision of the present tariff on imports has been assented to for the purpose of substituting specific for ad valorem duties and an expert has been sent abroad on the part of the united states to assist in this work a list of articles to remain free of duty including flour cereals and rice gold and silver coin and bullion has also been agreed upon in the settlement thus we control the tariff laws of china is this proper is it wise for our country to enter into the affairs of another country would our country submit to any such rule such exactions by other countries we lay a tariff tax on wheat and flour and rice in our dingley bill but in the tariff bill that we joined the powers in forcing on china we put them on the free list a singular and portentous anomaly republicans standing for protection in america and for free trade in china in tariffs they stand for one thing in the united states another thing for cuba for one thing at one time in porto rico and for another at another time and for still another policy in china and for a mixed policy in the philippines to this incongruity does the avidity for power and thirst for dominion lead us surely in polity and in domestic rule each nation is the equal of any other surely no rule of this government can be found to justify us in levying a tribute on or assuming a governmental function in or exacting a right to pass a revenue law for china continuing the president as if in palliation of our conduct says during these troubles our government has unswervingly advocated moderation and has materially aided in bringing about an adjustment which tends to enhance the welfare of china on page 45 of his message the president says leaving no effort untried to work out the great policy of full and fair intorcoursebetween china and the nations on a footing of equal rights and advantages to all we advocate the open door with all that it implies not merely the procurement of enlarged commercial opportunities on the coasts but access to the interior by the waterways with which china has been so extraordinarily favored only by bringing the people of china into peaceful and friendly community of trade with all the peoples of the earth can the work now auspiciously begun be carried to fruition in the attainment of this purpose we necessarily claim parity of treatment under the conventions throughout the empire for our trade and our citizens with those of all other powers what has the philippine open door done for us in the philippines it has given us a war that has cost hundreds of millions of treasure and thousands of lives and in return for this according to the last annual report of the secretary of war on pages 76 and 77 we get in trade let me read out of a total in one year of 53 000 000 of imports and exports the united states got the paltry amount of 5 000 000 both amounts in round numbers ten per cent of profit in this trade would represent 500 000 as the recompense to the traders for the expenditures of war by the nation does it pay let us be honest with ourselves let us be fair to the people does it pay this is a new system of internationalcomitythis nation to rule another for her benefit this sounds again like manifest destiny but used in a different sense than that in which the president used it once in his work on thomas h benton of missouri in that work he styled those who favored aggression on weaker peoples as men of easy international morality the president shows in his message our purposes and intentions to share in the arbitrary rule of china and mellows this harsh and unwarranted treatment by the assertions that it is our right and for her good thus we face the great and momentous problem whether this nation should assume the dangers and evils and entanglements that will ensue from the dismemberment of china to which this policy of the party in power unerringly and inevitably leads the president likewise shows that the open door which is englands colonial policy will prevail in china under the rule of the powers and we are thus committed irretrievably to the open door so long as we retain a foothold in the philippines how fortunate it would have been had this nation been checked in its policy of imperialism by a lack of revenues that furnished the means for these new and dangerous enterprises how much would we have saved in blood and treasure and in national honor occasionally some one with a sinister design concealed rises up and says give us expansion with the golden rule these principles do not go together no such incongruous thoughts can inspire one prompted by true americanism the golden rule is too sweet too harmonious too christian to enter into a problem that involves the shedding of human blood why invoke manifest destiny and the golden rule to justify oppression bloodshed and warfare he that does this clothes in the livery of the best masters to serve the devil in if appeals to religion can be made if the golden rule and manifest destiny can cover the crime of imperialism how much i wonder will these great cardinals be appealed to in years to come to cover up national sins it is claimed that we annexed the hawaiian islands by reason of their strategic value as a key to the pacific and to prevent the peaceful invasion of them by the japanese it is asserted that porto rico came to us as a fruit of war and that she is also of value as a key as a strategic point in the atlantic of these two keys one was admitted under the constitution the other outside its pale we hold a suzerainty in form over cuba because it is alleged she is near our shores and the monroe doctrine is again invoked the same class of statesmen would have us purchase the danish west indies from the king of denmark not for a strategic point for we have already porto rico but in furtherance of and maintenance of the monroe doctrine they appeal to the monroe doctrine to justify colonial rule in the west but abandon it in their attitude in the far east why appeal to the monroe doctrine to justify the holding of islands in the west and refute and repudiate it by holding islands in the east those in whose interest this policy is urged without compunction if indeed the word conscience can be found in the lexicon of commercialdom with a versatility and elasticity they claim that manifest destiny guided us to the philippines if manifest destiny and not the commercial interests guided us to the philippine islands what power is it that urges on to the rule of china was there ever an instance where the exercise of a power was more exacting and autocratic than that in which we joined the powers in the rule over china can we dissociate this exercise of sovereignty from the abject submission of china and the absolute rule of the powers the united states in conjunction with the other countries of europe becomes a tyrant for the rule of a weaker country why this departure why should this country enter into the politics of asia thus are islands annexed entangling alliances assumed and the insidious wiles of foreign influences courted against our traditions and against our most familiar notions of american prudence and policy because the commercial powers of this country which already fully control the legitimate markets of the world desire the government to use its power and its m0pey to open up new and untried and unamerican felds for exploitation the american laboring man who has the power to control his countrys policy can not see in this newfledged system any guaranty for his interests or his future safety and protection you have bound the philippines down with chains you have oppressed porto rico you have joined the powers in the control of china you have curbed the freedom of cuba and after tying her hand and foot you are getting ready to still extend your character as men of easy international morality by stifling your consciences against her appeals for humanity you have raped her industries and if you refuse her full reciprocity you lay her helplessly at your feet hawaii so far has escaped she was annexed in 1898 when we were imbued with the spirit of true americanism the hawaiian islands were admitted to full fellowship under the constitution and the flag in passing the organic law for their government we ruthlessly and rightly tore down the slave flag that covered the serfdom there before and snatched from the drivers hand the lash that beat the backs of men and women who labored under contract i voted against the admission of hawaii believing that american labor would suffer by its inclusion to those who favor island annexation the unwelcome truth has been unfolded by our experiences in hawaii the census of 1900 shows that of the total population of 154 000 in an area onefifth the extent of indiana 25 767 are chinese as against 17 002 in 1890 and 61 111 japanese in 1900 as against 12 360 in 1890 the census shows a population of native and mixed hawaiian blood of 37 918 this is the heterogeneous admixture of the unamerican races that were afflicted upon the laboring men of this country by the resolution of the gentleman from nevada and as he has recently introduced a resolution for the annexation of cuba i hope that in the interest of american labor he will see the evil consequences to our workingmen and forbear bringing islands into our dominion let us aid cuba to help herself with this our mission is ended can our laboring men compete with the chinese and the japanese of hawaii or with the native hawaiians this is full american territory they must be admitted with full privilege with the mainland or the constitution be endangered by attempts to keep them out such is colonial rule in its protection to labor and thus must you abandon the interest of the toilers or give but a limited constitutional guaranty and protection to the inhabitants of hawaii there is no reason for duplicity or deception for uncertainty or vagueness our government is strong in military prowess it should be just and merciful and magnanimous it must deal fairly with the soldiers and their families who are tortured and distressed in body and inmind by deadly war and pestilential disease our government must be fair to them or retribution will come the president and his advisers know full well the meaning of language and they can say that it is the purpose to give the philippines their independence as we did to cuba and at that instant the war in the philippines will be ended the president has not said so his advisers have not said so and the war goes on all civilized nations know the consequencesof war americans know them full well our duty lies along the pathway blazed out by the declaration of independence the constitution our traditions and humanity the bacon resolution introduced in the senate before the direful consequences in the philippines had befallen us would have spared and rescued us from its misfortunes it reads like this resolved further that the united states hereby disclaim any disposition or intention to exercise permanent sovereignty jurisdiction or control over said islands and assert their determination when a stable and independent government shall have been erected therein entitled in the judgment of the government of the united states to recognition as such to transfer to said government upon terms which shall be reasonable and just all rights socured under the cession by spain and to thereupon leave the government and control of the islands to their people this resolution was opposed by the body of republican senators and was supported by the democrats the vote resulted in a tie and was decided in the negative by the deciding vote of the republican vicepresident it may have been thought at that time that there would be no serious insurrection no serious rebellion no strenuous war for human liberty and no great drain in money all these matters have been made clear to us now to our misfortune our duty is made plain to us in the language of the democratic platform which but voices true americanism it says we favor an immediate declaration of the nations purpose to give to the filipinos first a stable form of government second independence and third protection from outside interference such as i has been given for nearly a century to the republics of central and south america there is not a filipino of the millions on the islands from the most cultured to the slaveowning polygamous inhabitants of the sulus who cares for us or for our institutions except as their attachment is held by the mighty arbitrament of the sword or by the more mild and seductive influences of money filched by taxation from the islanders to hoist into office mercenary filipinos whose attachment to our government is measured by the tenure of their offices and the amount of the perquisites they afford every filipino who has a sense of patriotism as it is understood by americans is to us an enemy a traitor or a spy this is shown by the testimony of our officers military and civil our warfare shows it and it is disclosed in the history of the islands filipinos may be in the service of the united states they may pretend to be our friends but they will wait forever to strike the invader and when the opportunity comes and the blow is struck it will show us the folly of lulling ourselves into a security while treachery was so plainly written in their dissembled conduct from all the reports that come to us it does not take much penetration to see through the slight veneer that covers the real character if this position is not correct then no one heretofore has correctly written the history of these islands and the 8 000 000 people if this position is not sound then no one heretofore has understood human nature the world over the spirit of rebellion as we call it the spirit of patriotism as they call it is on the islands to stay and the only question that concerns our people is whether we should be taxed to hire soldiers to buy war ships and war supplies to suppress it all told colonial rule costs us annually over a hundred million it can not be eradicated entirely it will smolder on in embers while wheatons 50 000 soldiers patrol the coasts and are quartered among them under daring chiefs and leaders they will rise from year to year in insurrection and rebellion sickness and death stalks in the wake of our army there and plague and pestilential disease overtakes them to carry on this colonial philippine policy we are taxed not only for war but we are taxed in the lives and limbs and health of our soldiers taxed in tears nd anguish of mothers and sisters whose sons and brothers have been sent to those faraway islands on a dreadful mission to mitigate in some measure the horrors of that climate it is recommended that the soldiers be relieved in a year or two of service the necessity for this regulation shows the danger in the climate but who can tell how many will fall in that time victims to it by diseases peculiar to the climate surely more than in battle how many will be wrecked for lives and how liberal will the government be to them in pensions let these considerations enter into the questions of taxation the managers of the republican party were wont to tell us on this floor for several years that it was but a shadow of an insurrection in the philippines that our prophecies that it would be long stubborn and dangerous were ridiculous and that the facts upon which this judgment was based existed nowhere but in the mind of some weak or designing and unpatriotic person but the spark that kindled the flame grew to be a dreadful conflagration that takes more than onehalf our army to smother they can only allay it they can not conquer it altogether how different the conditions here and there seventyfive million people here and an army less than onehalf of the whole an insurrectionary and dissatisfied people there numbering 8 000 000 and more than onehalf of our army needed to coerce and suppress them and such a method of warfare a system that punishes the promulgation of the declaration of independence and constitution of the united states these considerations are not sentimental they are real they are substantial if sentimentality were to be appealed to we could cite that the war in cuba was waged in the cause of liberty and humanity now we offer them a sort of liberty a diluted liberty diluted by the platt amendment but we give them a form of liberty and when they set up a stable form of government it will be easy enough for the cubans under the sentiment that prevails in america if i mistake not to shake off any hold that this country may claim to have or any restraints it may have imposed which were notoriously secured under duress from the people of cuba why not give the same guaranties to the philippines there is a similarity between the case of cuba and the philippines if not in its goed and humanitarian purposes and objects at least in its harsh misfortunes the result of war weylers order to the cuban reconcentrados meant torture death and starvation our generals in the philippines are giving out the same reconcentrado order in efforts to suppress the insurrection xxxv119 england finds the same effective means in her war against the boers who fight for the south african republic england against the boers follows the example of spain in cuba and has it come to this that we must follow the example of both to suppress the filipinos today little boer boys snatched from their homes in the absence of their parents and imprisoned now are crying for their fathers and their mothers and little boer girls in reconcentrado camps today are crying bitterly crying for their mothers and their fathers must we follow their example they were kidnapped many of them and carried from their homes and are now held in prison in the name of human warfare they are kept from care and protection of parent this is warfare as england understands it as spain understood it and it is the system that is being adopted in the philippines by our officers can such acts be brutalities only when practiced by spain and england our history is moving in cycles our soldiers who went to cuba in that war for liberty and humanity found reconcentrado camps with untold sufferings under the spanish our soldiers now who go to the philippines find the same camps of suffering and distress under american officers the laboring man is taxed to support a system of colonial rule that strikes at his vital interest let him beware when he understands the situation he will rebel against it if he fails to heed the admonition enforced by a departure from more than a hundred years of constitutional government for his protection if he fails to do his duty for he still has the sovereign power and a horde of asiatics and kindred peoples are brought in closer relations with us then not only will labor suffer in his day but the cloud will hang over his

proposing to buy it back m 1r cannon iam not advised as to that that may be true but it is now the property of individuals i will not enter upon a discussion of its merits it may come later in connection with this bill or some other bill my position and that of your committee i think without dissent as i understand it is about as follows that for construction of public buildings to carry on the public business in the city of washington we stand quite ready to cooperate and recommend all apt appropriation as speedily as the public service requires and the public revenues will allow with due regard for the public service elsewhere in the united states the second proposition is to beautify the city without regard to the public service and to make it a beauty spot in the united states as to that great project the position of your committee is that we shall go just so fast in beautifying the city of washington as the people of the city of washington are willing to go and no faster paying half the expenses thereof by taxation that is a very good check upon that kind of improvements therefore in the improvement of this park 70 000 which but commences it we provide that onehalf of that suni shall be paid frdm the revenues of the district and so as to all the great park systems of the district of columbia your committee are thoroughly of opinion that they ought to be and must be improved onehalf from the treasury of the united states and the other half by local taxation there is one other matter that i want to call to the attention of the committee there is a great cry for a hall of records in the district there is a great cry for the erection of a palace of justice a new state department and so on and so on some of these works might well be commenced but they ought to be commenced with care to make them fairly agree with the improvements that have been made in the district on the one hand and to shut off extravagance upon the other much that is said about a hall of records might well be unsaid if the government of the united states paid enough attention to the records of the united states to preserve the records that ought to be preserved and to destroy those that are of no account i will illustrate what i mean your committee made an investigation touching the records in the census office and we found there in a rented building substantially fireproof the population schedules from the first census down to the present they came asking an appropriation of 15 000 to bind the population schedules of the census of 1890 they have done it for several years we have turned it down for several years and on this investigation we find now of those old useless population schedules commencing with the year 1790 400 tons kept in a rented building heated and lighted with watchmen and laborers and a force of clerks they are of no manner of use on earth in my judgment except to furnish a reason for paying rent to somebody to house them and to afford employment to the employees who have charge of them you know what a population schedule is that is the schedule that the enumerator makes out when he visits you all over the country how many in the family married how many children ages residence where born and so forth and so forth well now those schedules come in and are tabulated and the tabulation is published and after that in my judgment they are of no account when the question of destroying them was presented those having them in charge threw up their hands in holy horror oh you say but what use are they oh somebo dy may want to know who lived at winsted in connecticut in 1790 and what was his name and whet he was married well but it is not evidence well but sometimes we get inquiries they are not evidence now then i undertake to say that 400 tons of population schedules some of which has been taken care of for a century and all of which are being cared for now by a force of clerks laborer watchman light heat and rent ought to be destroyed and there are lots of records of no more account than these if we had the slepartments intelligently cleared of useless records in my judgment there is plenty of space to accommodate the public service of the united states in the cityof washington another matter that your committee investigated on the sundry civil law for the current year the following provision is found to enable the architect of the capitol to prepare and submit to congress at its next session plans specifications and estimates of cost for reconstructing and extending in a fireproof manner the central portion of the capitol building the renovation and decoration of the notunda also for the construction of a fireproof building adjacent to the grounds of the capitol building to be used for offices storage and power plant purposes connectd with the capitol building 1 l to be immediately available the architect of the capitol took this question up gentlemen may be aware that the capitol never was completed that on the east part the original plans specifications and drawings were all made long ago there was to be a wing east corresponding with the wing rest the dome itself extends over the wall on the east it would add to the architectural effect would give more room that is needed in the capitol it would permanently house the supreme court with consultation rooms ample quarters for attorneys ample quarters for a library and would almost in addition double for committee rooms space that was added in the western extension of the capitol l ow the investigation shows that to complete the capitol would cost 2 500 000 to renovate the rotunda 275 000 in addition to that under this provision of the law the architect of the capitol has ascertained that to construct a tunnel from the capitol somewhere to land that is south of us or southeast or southwest near by tht capitol grounds asd to complete a building with 400 rooms in it in a style of architecture that would comport fairly well with the surroundings of the capitol and library of congress and construct a tunnel from the capitol to such building constructing such a building with a great basement that would hold all the documents and that would hold in addition the heating apparatus of the capitol move it all out and your lighting apparatus into such a building giving additional room in the capitol for committee rooms removing the condition that we have from musty documents that the construction of such a building would cost in round numbers 4 000 000 and that with the completion of the capitol would cost 6 775 000 in the judgment of your committee this is one of the earliest improvements that ought to be made in the public buildings on the senate side senators have their office rooms in the maltby building or the capitol on the house side there is a very general complaint upon the part of members that if they have places in which to transact their business that they have either to utilize quarters at their houses and hotels or that they have got to go and lease them this scheme if adopted would enable each representative to have a comfortable room near by the capitol for office purposes now i call attention to this fact because i want the house to bear in mind that after investigation for a hall of records a new state department a new department of justice and various other schemes that are talked about ought to wait until this improvement is authorized and begun before these are authorized this in my judgment is the first thing to do now then i want to say further that your committee did not see proper to report this provision but have suggested that i call attention of the house to it for the reason that in the present condition with this reduction of a great block of the revenue that probably it would be well enough to wait until we could reasonably forecast what the revenues will be before we authorize or recommend the constructionuntil the next session of
