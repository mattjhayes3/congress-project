or for women we are voting for or against 50 percent of the voters and i think that really really is the kind of statement that americans want to see less of from this house i say this sincerely because when we vote against or for women and or girls in this house we are voting for or against our daughters our mothers our sisters and our grandmothers not voters back and forth we are here to serve as my colleagues know the people out there in the real world and the political jargon i think people are really really tired of bringing it up and i am sure that my dear colleague from

cooperating with the minority in crafting this language on this issue i also want to thank the chairman for allowing us this 10 minutes of debate along with the administration we in congress support

existing cooperation between the north american and european allies our partnership has provided security on the european continent for half a century today in the aftermath of a cold war a strong nato is as important as ever if bosnia and kosovo have taught us anything it is that security problems and the threats of war have not evaporated from the heart of europe simply because the soviet union no longer exists as i have said many times we should always keep a door open for future membership for nations that will strengthen nato and the security outlook in europe at the same time we
