and gentlemen in a discussion a few days ago on the question of farm relief the gentleman from illinois reached the conclusion that the sine qua non in farm relief was an equalization fee being principally and i might say wholly engaged in agriculture myself outside of my membership in this house i am deeply interested in agricultutal relief and advancement and i want to discuss just for a minute that requisite which seems to lxix76 be laid down for any agricultural relief from the standpoint of the cotton raisers of this country i appreciate the attitude of the people who raise wheat the mcnaryhaugen bill with the equalization fee in it temporarily at least would have been a benefit to them but i want to show what it would have done to the cotton people we raised 1 000 000 000 bushels of wheat in 1926 we consumed 800 000 000 of it at home and about 200 000 000 bushels were exported those are the round figures there is a tariff of 42 cents a bushel on wheat and it is natural to suppose that if we could control that surplus so as to make the domestic market a purely domestic market and prevent wheat from being shipped in to compete that naturally it would have raised the price of wheat about 40 cents a bushel before it could have been interfered with by outside wheat well let us look at what would have been the result and you can see why i do not blame the wheat people for standing for it if i were a wheat man i would have been standing for it if you raise the price of your 800 000 000 bushels 40 cents a bushel you have put a profit of 320 000 000 in the pockets of the wheat farmers if you export your 200 000 000 bushels and sell them at a loss of 40 cents a bushel and make it up by the equalization fee you have only lost 80 000 000 if you take that from your 320 000 000 you have a net profit to the wheat people of 240 000 000 therefore i say i am in sympathy with the wheat people and i do not blame them for wanting that arrangement but let us see the picture of the cotton folks we made 18 000 000 bales of cotton the most optomistic prognostication that was made in the whole debate was that if we got that into operation it would raise the price of domestically sold cotton 20 a bale or 4 cents a pound well let us look at it a minute from that standpoint we consumed 8 000 000 bales in this country raise that 20 a bale and it would increase the price 160 000 000 well they made that of course but we exported and will export 10 000 000 bales that has got to be sold at a loss of 20 a bale and made up by the equalization fee that would mean a loss of 200 000 000 and we made 160 000 000 so you will see that the cotton people ale 40 000 000 out and we are faced with an equalization fee of 10 or 11 a bale to make that up"],

things i am willing to vote for it or not as gentlemen who represent those states where they raise them desire here are the facts relative to the statement issued by the department last september the

the gentlemen not from cotton states that the farmers who raise the cotton do not get the price you read in the paper that cotton is bringing in new york they get about a cent and a quarter less than the new york price which the buyers of cotton say is required for freight to get the cotton to new york where the price is fixed cotton was selling in americus ga my home town for about 23 cents a

downward it would not have had much effect on the trade for the public would have thought they werc lears on the market and wanted the price to go down but when the department of agriculture issued

n3y colleagues of the house this debate has convinced me that husnan nature is very much the same in congress as it is back home or out on the street it is difficult to eliminate the hsuman equation the personal interest frosn our consideration of legislation an d our vote thereon it is very much easier for us to give favorable consideration and affirmative vote on mtters which benefit or which do justice to our home state our hosne district or to ourselves personally coming over this norning my good friend and colleague told me he hoped this bill would not prevail because it took away from his state and added to my state that was his reason frankly expressed for his opposition to this legislation i have much sympathy for those who feel that this legislation adversely affects the states which they represent or adversely aiffects their personal fortunes fortunate it is that this legislation is anticipatory in character and that the members who feel that their personal fortunes are adversely affected will have at least four years time in which to readjust themselves to the new conditions which will have to be met by them however we can not let personal interest conflict with our solenn sworn duty our government is established upon the principle of political equality of all citizens and every man and woasan in this country is supposed to have equal representation in the popular branch of our legislative department the shibboleth to which our revolutionary ancestors rallied was no taxation without just representation and so it was that the fathers of this government wrote into the sane article of our constitution into the same section and into the same sentence a statement that direct taxes shall be borne and representatives in congress shall be apportioned among the several states according to the number of persons therein the fathers of our government were so determined about this that they wrote the explicit mandate into the constitution that the enumeration for reapportionment should be made every 10 years to argue that there is not a direct specific mandatory provision in the constitution for decennial reapportionmssent is but to quibble that this is so is best evidenced by the fact that for 130 years the first 130 years of the existence of our government the congress did not hesitate and did not fail to reapportion promptly every 10 years most of us can see the things close at hand better than we can see those things that are far away and therefore i am going to refer to the condition which exists in my own district and in my own county as an illustration of why the fathers of our government were wise in their mandate that the popular house of the legislative branch of our government should be reapportioned every 10 years by the 1910 census which was the last census under which a reapportionment was had the city in which i live los angeles calif had a population of 200 000 people it has grown tremendously since that time until it now has a population of 1 300 000 people and it is estimated that in 1930 when this reapportionment will be made it will have a population of 1 500 000 people there are two districts in los angeles county the district which my colleague represents has a population within 200 000 as large as my district i have the official figures as of may 1 of this year on the number of registered voters in los angeles county in the ninth district which is represented by my colleague there were on may 1 this year 338 227 registered voters in the tenth district which i have the honor to represent there are approxilately 50 000 more registered voters or a total of 384 198 registered voters a grand total in the county of los angeles calif of 722 525 registered voters it is estimated that by the time of the general election this fall there will be 400 000 registered voters in the tenth district and 350 000 registered voters n the ninth district or a total of 750 000 registered voters statisticians say that there are approximately four people for every registered voter multiply the registered vote in los angeles county by 4 and you have approximately 3 000 000 people there are 38 states in this union which do not have a population of 3 000 000 people under reapportionment there would be considerably less than 300 000 people in each congressional district the two congressional districts which we have in los angeles county should not exceed 600 000 people if reapportionment is not made as required by the constitution of this country there will be literally 2 400 000 people in los angeles county who are not represented in the popular house of our congress there are 28 states in this union which do not have a population of 2 400 000 take my district with its 1 500 000 people and its one representative if reapportionnent is not had there will be 1 200 000 people in that district who are not represented in this house there are 18 states in this country which do not have a population of 1 200 000 and when i say that these people 1re not represented or will not be represented i imean exactly what i say because the representative from that district of 1 500 000 people does not have any more votes in this house than does the representative from the district of the average population of this country of less than 250 000 moreover representatives are all on the same basis here according to their length of service and a representative of 1 500 000 people does not have any more clerk hire to take care of the wants and demands of his constituents than does the representative fron the average district he does not have any more office space he does not have any more congrtessional recordas for distribution nor any more congressional directories for distribution he does not have any more appointments to the naval academy at annapolis he does not have any more appointmelts to the military academy at west point benefits of government are largely distributed according to congressional districts and it is literally true that 1 200 000 people in my district will have no representation in this house of congress unless we reapportion"],
