committee in the last days of the session report i am for the bill but it does not go far enough under the organization of the house and its rules the committee on mines and mining have reported a bill to provide for the coinage of the silver dollar and make it a legal tender for all debts public and private now then nunder the rules that committee has an hour each day and no more just two dilatory motions one to adjourn and the other to adjourn to a day certain take the hour and the bill makes no progress this has been followed day by day the gentleman fromnew york an influential member of this house chairman of the national democratic central committee and tildens rightbower leadsoff in this filibustering with the help of the gentleman from maryland and the gentleman from iowa now the present bill underthe rules is not in the morning hour and may be considered and amended frno dy to day by a majority and passed with or without amendment and no point of order lies against the bill nor is its consideration limited by time and i want to say to the gentleman from miipouri who has charge of the silver bill and to the house that without a change of the rules this is the only parliamentary key by which the silver bill can be passed this session the gentleman from new york having charge of the bill refused to receive any amendment and moves the previous question now if the previous question is voted down the bill is open to amendment and i will offer what is known as the kelley silver bill as an additional section to the bill it is as follows there shall be from time to time struck and coinl at the several mints of the united states silver dollars of the weight of 412 grains as provided for in the act of jantary it 1837 upon which shal be the evices and

can see no hope of its being passed thiesession somegentleman says thesilver bill can pass as a separate proposition the gentleman knows there is but one way to pass it this session as a separate proposition and that is for the majority of the house to restore the rules preventing filibustering which you repealed at the first of this session if the majority of the house honestlywant to pass any bill or measure it can always find a way to pass it if the rules prevent a majority of the house made the rules and a majority can change them if the committees will not report a majority of the mouse elected the speaker who appoints committees and the majority can elect another speaker who will reorganize the committees so they will report but i do not believe you the majority of the house have the honesty of purpose or the etera ge to do this and for that reason i want you to allow me to offer the amendment which i have before read we have bad lipservice enough from you let your action

inquiry into the management and control of said homes and make due report of the same the purpose and spirit of the government in the establishment of soldiers homes is in keeping with that humane policy which has dictated the passage of all of our pension laws it is to provide for the eomfbrt and support of those who in the service of their country by wounds or loss of health incurred in the line of duty have become incapacitated for selfsupport pension laws and soldiers homes have become so firmlyfixed in the minds of our people as proper and the duty of the government that it is too late now to discuss them as measures but we must deal with them as a part of our public debt which good faith and honor require us to pay that gross frauds are practiced in the administration of the pension laws and gross abuses in the management of the soldiers homes will scarcely be denied and to the correction of these we must address ourselves recognizhag these laws and homes as just and prop er to enable the government and to induce the people to fully perform this duty in providing for these classes of citizens we should see that only those who are entitled shall enjoy the privileges secured by the law and that honesty and economy are practiced hl the administration of the funds provided for their support four of these national branch homes have been established and the rapid increase of the number of inmates in them suggests the propriety of an inquiry into the manner in which persons claiming these benefits are admitted the following extract from the report of the secretary to the board of managers contained in their report to the present congress miscellaneous document no 147 page 12 will show the number now provided for and the yearly increase the total number of disabled soldiers and sailors cared for during the year end ing november 30 1875 at the for regular branches of the national homo for disabled volnnteer soldiers has been as follows at the central branch near dayton ohio 3 769 at the northwestern branch near mllwaukee wisconsin 987 at the eastern branch near anuceta maine 1 024 at the southern branch near waapton virginia 871 total number cared for during the year 6 651 increase over 1574 592 increase over 1873 tii increase over 1872 2 019 in creaso over 1871 2 34t increase over 1870 3 133 in my report of 1871 i ventured the opinion that the number of disabled sol diers who require aid will not soon diminish but will for some years to come stead fly increase this prediction has been more than vori led the increase in five years hs been over 3 000 being an averago increase of 600 tr year and making the total number cared for in 1875 nearly double the number supported in 1870 the increase has been principally at the central ind souther branches invalids seeming to prefer to go southl rather than north into a warmer rather than a colior climate the southern increased the whole number cared for in one year from 324 in 1871 to 871 in 1875 and the central from 1 954 in le70 to 3 769 in 1875 indeed last year the central cared for 857 more mon than the three other branches together it seems from the testimony of one b d whitney which will be fonnd on pages 20 and 21 of report no 45 from the committee on military afiirs third session fortyfirst congress that each of the eleven membersof the board of managershas authority and does give certificates of admission to the homes when found disabled by an examinhg surgeon but this testimony of whitney discloses the fact that he has been in the habit of giving certificates of admission he was asked his residence and occupation horeplied i reside in washington i am a clerk that he had resided four years in washington as a clerk in the office of general butler and sometimes as clerk to corporations and that in the absence of general butler and his clerk during the intervals of the sessions of congress i represent the national asylum so far as giving transportation and examining soldiers he further states i have to examine the thousand applicants that call at general butlers office during the year to ascertain their fitness for admission he further states i have books of record stating the examination of six or seven hundred soldiers that have been forw arded under my own examination and that he had sen t forward to the asylum within three years six hundred persons now it must be admitted that this is rather a loose mode of granting admission to these homes when an unknown and irresponsible clerk is permitted to perform this important duty protoction to the public and protection to worthy objects of this national bounty demand that greater care should be taken in granting ddmissions and that it should be exercised only by those whom the law clothes with the althority the act to establish the national ense for disabledvolunteer seldiers was passed march 3 1865 and by the act of march 21 1866 the means for carrying on the same were provided which were all stoppages or fines by sentence of a courtmartial or military commissions all forfeitures for desertion and all moneys duoe deceased inmates of the home not claimed iu three years but subject to be paid to the heirs or legal representatives on denand and the board of managers were authorized to receive all donations of moncy or prop rty given for tli benefit of the liomc blt by the act of march 3 1875 this mode of supporting the home was abandoned the money arising from these several soerces is now covered into the treasury and the home is supported by direct appropriations by congress as all other expenses of the government are provided for by reference to the united states statutes at large section 4830 it will be seen that the board of managers are authorized to providesuitable sites for these homes and only those are entitled to admissionnot otherwise provided for who have been or may be disqualified for proeuring their own support by reason of wounds received or sickness contracted wrhis in the line of duty during the rebellion here we have prescribed the classes entitled to the benefits of the homes and to secure a faithful execution of this beneficent design the law should be strictly adhered to the home has been incorporated under the name and style of the national home for disabled volunteer soldiers and is clothed with all the attributes essential to a corporation such as perpetual suecession to take and hold real estate establish a common seal sue and be sued and to make bylaws rules and regulation for their government the board of managers is composed of twelve members the president secretary of war and the chief justice are ex officio members of the board the remaining nine are elected by congress section 4827 of the revised statutes provides that the twvelve managers shall elect a president of theirown number two vicepresidents and a secretary but no treasurer to the board is provided for nor is there any necessity for such an officer to the board but when you come to the establishnut of the branch homes section 4829 provides for a governor a deputy governor a secretary and a treasurer and such other officers as the managers may deem necessary notwithstanding there is no provision for a treasurer to the board of managers yet since the establishment of the home general b f butler has been filling the positions of both president and treasurer and handling all the moneys that have been provided for the support and maintenance of the homes treasurers for the branch homes are provided for and for them alone is such an officer necessary but general butlers connection with the home will be referred to more in detail hereafter the money provided forthe support of thebomesis as follows total amount received by the soldiers homes from june 2 1866 to april 1 1875 6 944 503 92 it will be remembered that the above sum was derived front fines forfeitureg stoppages c and from interest on investments on march 3 1865 congress passed a law providing for the future maintentnce of these homes by direct appropriations from the public treasury as other liabilities of the government are provided for and to meet the expenses of the homes freom april 1 1875 the time when the act of march 3 1875 went into effect to july 1 1876 congress appropriated the sum of 350 000 which added to the sum above makes a total of 7 294 503 92 let it be borne in mind also that congress by act of march 22 1867 provided that every inmate of the home on his oriia adnission should receive one complete suit of clothes as a donation chat by the act of juno 10 1874 congress donated 10 000 suits of clothing and by the act of december 31 1875 10 602 suits t hus making a complete donation of 260 suits anod add to this the suit of clothes given to each of the 10 590 iniates since the establishment of the home and you have a total of 37 192 suits which at the moderate sum of 25 per snit amounts to 933 800 this added to the money received prior to april 1 1875 and the appropriation of 350 000 makes the total cost of the home 8 228 303 92 in making up this amount i have not included the pensions received or the profits realized from the workshops gardens and farms which is much more than sufficient to meet any demands for outdoor relief which the home claims to have extended to worthy objects in pursuance of law who were not inmates general butler in his report of the board of managers of the national home for disabled volunteer soldiers for the year ending december 31 1875 estimates the cost per capita for each inmate at 135 13 he says at first thought the sum of 88 733 4 l is a largo one but it will he seen that not regarding the amount expended for censrution and dividing it asong the numher of beneficiaries 6 651 the cost per man is at the rate of 135 13 the fallacy and error of this statement are apparent when it is remembered that 6 651 is the whole number of beneficiaries admitted during the year year 1875 when the average number present and mebsent during the year waf 4 523 and the average number present during the year was only 3 6f3 only a little over ildf the number admitted during the year now it is evident that it is not correct to take the total number of inmates as the basis upon which to calculate the expense per head for the average numher present shows that many of the inmates were in the home only a short time and hence entaiied but little expense to the institution if you take the average noember present and absent namely 4 523 we will find the cost per head to be 198 70 but oven this is not fair the correct basis of calculation is to take the averago number of inmates present dnring the year namely 3 683 and we find the cost per head to b 244 which is 109 per head more than general butlers estimate but in order that we may understan i folly the management and cost of this institution another statement is necessary among the 6 651 inmates of the home 3 184 arc persons who xyere drawing pensions from the government and hence were pensioners in a double sense if you deduct the average nimber of pensioners present and absent anmely 1 485 from 4 523 the total present and absent yo will ind the rate per head per annum to be 262 and by deducting the averago of pensioners present namely 1 193 from the total average present namely 3 683 the cost rate per annum will be found to be 361 this it most be admitted is rather expensive and well justifies a most careful investigation into the management of these homes and the expenditures of the money provided for their support the estimates for the support of these homes for the fiscal year 187677 are 898 733 44 but in these estimates no account is taken of the net profits of the workshop which are 24 447 30 tir of 4 963i 55 the net profits of the farms anti gardens which are kept up at these homes nor of the fnrther sum of 57 113 82 which is retained by the homes from thepensions paid to theinmates by the government to understand this i will state that when a soldier who is a pensioner enters a home he is required to assign his claim for pension to the home which the homc undertakes to administer in part for the benefit of the inmate during the last year the home received on account of pensions the sum of 279 773 and disposed of it as follows sent by treasurer to dependent relatives of the inmates 79 581 11 estimated amount sent by inmates 34 220 68 amount approprialce by the home to its own purposes 57 113 82 making a total of 170 915 61 leaving a balance of 108 857 39 this balance the home claims to hold in trust for the benefit of the inmates but how or when it is to ho paid does not fully appear from anything contained in the report in the testimony which was taken before the committee on military affairs of the fortyfirst congress it was proven by general b f butler that while acting as the president and treasurer of the board of managers for the national home he mingled the money that came to his hands as treasurer with his individual funds by depositing the same in bank to his individual credit as the following extract from his testimony will show question did yoa deposit this money answer yes sir but not in the name of the national asylum q where and with whom did you deposit itl a i deposited it as money in my own hands according to my residence at the time sonol imes in washington as a portion of my bank account here sometimes in iew york aid sometimes in lowell q it wqs a portion of your own individual bank account a cerainly wi ovth nothing to distinguish it fron your own private property certainly not in what anks did you deposit it in waslington with jay cooke sometimes and in the national hank q in lowell wvith which bank in the national bank 0 who are the officers of that bank i camoet tell you i am there so little that i do not know who they are excest perhaps the cashier q ave yon any interest in that bank i a not adollar 1 wish i had 0 is mr field connected with that bank never to my knowledge q have yo al agent in lowell who draws or deposits in ibis bank for the national asylum for you a i have a part of the time who is he a idecline to answer inquiries into my private affairs q i wish to know who is your agent s ho deposits or draws money for yon from the national bank a i have no agent who does either 2 you have none never had i i have none q hav yo anry objection to exhibiting to the committee your bank account showing thi deposit of those funds a i cannot exhibit my bank aceoent showing the deposit of this fund without exhibiting my private bank account hero we have the distinct admission that he mingled public funds with his individual funds and positively refuses to make any exhibit upon the ground that he wouhi thereby necessarily make an exhibit of his own private affairs was ever pretext more flimsy 7 he admits the wrongful act of mingling public and private funds and then seeks to screen himself from all discovery as to the use and manner of disbursing these funds because it would disclose his own private transactions and a committee composed of a majority of republicans quietly submitted to this assumption of immunity from discovery and general butler has continued to this day president and treasurer and defies discovery i desire to call attention to general butlers connection with the purchase and sale of the property at hampton virginia now used as oine of the national homes general butlers version of the matter is ttat lie becamo involved in the purchase of this property in 1864 at the request of the secretary of yar but that the government doelliting to take it be was compelled to complete the purchase afteor the war for bis own benefit which lie did by pilas lg tnder a idecree of the court so that all liens were extiugnished and the title united in himself and that be afterward sold the property to the board of anaigers this property had been the chesapeake female college and was owned by a number of persons now what the property cost general butler is shown by a letter of colonel thomas tabb who was general butlets attorney in the matter and who in a letter to general negley chairman of the committee on military affairs dated february 6 187t says the date of the contract purchasing the property from messrs flume morris armistead aond wright was juo 9 a869 general outler haid previously namely january 14 1865 purcliased tho interests of mensrs cox salisbury and dennis in the property ly the agreement made june 9 1869 general buter was to give 34 200 less 12 010 which he had paid cox salisbury and dennis so it appears from general butlers attorney that the price of the property was only 34 200 colonel tabb concludes his letter with this statement i stated in my examination that the property cost general butler about 40 000 lmy meaning was that it stood him about that sum at the time he parted with it janimary 14 186 paid cox salisbury end dennis 12 000 00 interest on sl00s for five years id six months t s3960 00 amiointpaid i y me as per statonunt rendered 22 6g2 43 interest on 22 662 43 say six months 379 87 m y fee 750 00 total 39 752 30 so that by counting interest on paymnents and including the attorneys fee an individual umatter the cost to general butler was only 39 752 30 which he sold at once by indirection for 50 000 it will be admitted that snore than 10 000 was a right pretty speculation for general butler to make out of these soldiers homes when lie himself was president of the board of managers and treasurer he did however when the board of managers went down to examine the property with a view to purchase have the modesty not to go with them but sent lis clerk mr clancy who was at that time receiving a salary of 1 500 per annum as clerk to general betlerin his capacity as president to the board of managers an office unmown to the law and paid out of the means which congress had provided for the support aid iainteinance of disalled soldiers he declined to go in erson to hampton but seeing he might effect a sale and realize 10 000 profits besides getting back in clea cash all the money he had paid out principal interest and attorneys fee of 750 because as treasurer he hati the money in his own hands ie made a sham transfer of the property to a facile brotherinlaw of his named f a hildreth who was under obligations to hini for relieving him from the penalty of imprisonsuent nuder sentence of a military commission general butler claims to have entered into an agreement with hildreth by which hildreth was to advance him 38 000 and be made him a deed not a mortgage or deed of trnst but a deed in feesimple to the hampton property hildreth in his examinaio before time investigating committee of this house admitted that he did not require any such security for the advance that he was coatent to take general butlers individual obligation for it but that general butler without consulting him executed the deed and bad it recorded and then after the sale to the card of managers had been effected in which mr hildreth seems to have played a silent and unimportant part he executed the deed to the managers and delivered the deed not to the managers but to general butler and to show conclusively that tis deed to hildreth was a shal to cover up general butlers tracks in the trade it turns out that hildreth never at any time made an advance to general butler of more than 12 000 but i will let hildreth speak for himself in regard to the deed and the advance here is an extract from his testimony question upon making the deed did you make him te advance answor i think not i do not rcmnbcr the specific time i trusted the matter entirely to him i did not so far as iwas concerned myself care anything about the aced at all y ou were ready to make the advance upon his personal security i was bat it was rather his choice to make the deed q and you say that when he gave you the deed you lid not make any advance of ooeoy a i em not certain i would net be positivo whether i did or not q did yoi tell himyou would not tako the deed a i think he had already made it i told him i cared nothing about it it would seem that mir hildreth was in the dark as to the real character of the transaction q did you send it down for records a lie had done that himself lie did all the business q did yon ever receive the deed in your possession and keep it in your possession 7 a i did not keep it i think i received it q it as shown to you and you gave it back i a it woo shown to mo and i think it was already recorded i wold not be positive about that i paid very little attention to it it was a matter i cared very little about q tle got it recorded then sbgwed it to you but you did not keel it a ididnot kop it i would not say positivoly hetit had been recorded q yea iaid at advance of ltnesy at that time a i may have done i do not think i lid a that time q did you make any advances from that tline to the time you deeded the land over to the aylunm q i mde adtvances to him almounting to about 12 000 between the time of that letter may 10 1870 and the time i made othe deed otober 17 170 q that was after the tinte you got the deed a yes i do you know what yon made advances for i donot know whaft lie waited the tcuouey for q and you do not know in how many instklments you made itl a i think abut three q how muchl at each timei a y would not uode take to give th stus q flow did you make these advances by your cbeek a i think by my cheek or in cas q are you surewhich a i am not it i had the money in my pocket i would give it to him if i had not i would give him my check q did any of the board of managers tell you they wanted to purchase this property before you deeded it over i o o sir i did not knew that they did tq did you have any conversation with any of them except general butler about itt a no sir i wrote a letter to judge bend i think offering the property for sale this wee at general butlers suggestion from the above extract from the testimony of hildreth it appears that he advanced only 12 000 of the 38 000 he agreed to advance on this point he and general butler differ the latter in reply to the question have you received all of it yet namely the advance replied i tlink i did and considerably more with it and i have been able by the sale of property to rc imbrso hia for that and other money which was due in the above extract from the testimony of hildreth when asked what the advances were made for he said i do not know what he wanted the money for tie reply of general butler to the following question discloses another discrepancy question but did you receive at any time altogether since that transaction w35 050 which he was to let you have answer he was to pay ot in matters in which we were engaged certain moneys and i received it in his account in that way it would seem from this that there was some sort of a copartnership between them in which hildreth furnished the said advance if so it is strange he should not remember it but there is another still more remarkable discrepancy between these gentlemen general butler says that hildreth received the money for the hampton property from the managers and hildreth says that general butler received it it is certainly strange that any man could forget the receipt of 50 000 whether he was a borrower or a leader especially as the sale of the property and receipt of the money had taken place not six months before the examinations took place but in order that the statements of these gentlemen may be seen and properly weighed i will quote from them in parallel columns general butler was asked mr hildreth was asked question when the 50 000 was paid question did you receive the cousidfoe the asylum property it was paid to oration of the deed 150 000 him all ofit answer no sir answer yes sir q you have never received it q and you ddnet receive a dollar a no sir i neverreceived 150 000 of snd it pd r did you receive anything a ino iir it passedlato his hands ayes sir h wea much did you receive for the a i advanced to general butler h4 flow much lid ou receivei i received what i had advanced i think i had advanced altogether about 12 000 which general butler repaid me is comment upon this testimony necessary can any one resist the conclusion that the sale of the hampton property to hildreth was a pretense and a sham intended by general butler to cover up and conceal a transaction which he felt to say the least was of questionable propriety here was a piece of property that colonel tabb says all other parties had lost lnoney upon yet general butler by a sale of it to a board of managers of which he was president and treasurer in a short time realizes a profit of certainly over 10 000 and this at a time when he had in his hands as treasurer 95 947 and yet general butler is still the president of the board of managers of national home and is still the treasurer an office unknown to the law and he still as ssch draws the appropriations which congress makes for the support of these homes mingles them with his own funds pays over to the homes as their necessities demand and uses the surplus on hand as he thinks proper nor has he ever paid interest on any balance in his hands and for this neglect of the interest of the home the whitewashing committee of the fortyfirst congress offered the excuse that general butler had never charged the home any interest when he was in advance according to the report of that committee there had been eighteen quarterly settlements of general butlexs accounts as treasurer of the board of managers and balances were found against him fifteen times and in his favor three times the balances are shown at the close of each quarter as follows 1866november 36060 53 1867february 217 139 14 m ay 110 107 92 august 41 837 21 november 74 84 1 1868 february 31 656 27 m ay 27 931 7 august 14 875 87 november 81 927 40 169february 61 62 49 may 97 956 92 angust 5 173 94 nov ember r 671 30 1870m ay 145 863 38 august 10 695 42 but 1ialanecs were found in favor of the treasurer as follows 1870fbruary 3 560 11 november 4 134 65 december 31 86 222 11 it is unnecessary to carry this branch of the inquiry further the foregoing fully establishes the reprehensible management of the tresslarer by reference to the foregoing statement it will be seen that at the quarterly settlement in february 1867 there was a balance of 217 139 14 the settlement shows that during the next quarter embracing the months e march april and may there was expended 107 031 22 which left a balance in the hands of the treasurer of 110 107 92 which had thus lain unemployed for three months and perhaps considerably longer notwithstanding the law required all surplus funds to be invested in united states bonds and thus in this one single instance there was lost to the home interest on 110 107 92 for three months which amounts to 1 651 61 but does any one believe that this money was in fact idle general butler could well afford to charge no interest on balances in his favor when lie paid none on balances against him and the wants of the home were not so uncertain as to constitute a good excuse for keeping such large unexpended balances unemployed in view of all these facts i insist it is high time that there should be a thorough overlanuling of the management of these homes for the purpose of seeing how the public money appropriated for them has been expended and notwithstanding more than five years have elapsed since the nogley report was made and since the evidence taken before the committee on military affairs disclosed general butlers connection with the sale of the hampton property and the very handsome profit he realized out of it at the expense of the very important trust committed to his good faith he is still president of the board of managers and still as treasurer draws the money appropriated by congress for the home and still mingles it with his own how long is this disregard of law and duty to b tolerated how long shall these provisions of the countrys bounty be controlled and employed for individual profit a knowledge of these abuses and the improper management of the homes has induced this democratic house to direct the inquiry contained in the following resolution resolved that the committee on military affairs be and is hereby directed to inquire into the management and control of the soldiers homo and the national home for disabled volunteer soldiers and report in writing thereon also what reform in such management should be made for the comfort and welfare of said soldiers the committee on military affairs owing to pressure of business upon their hands have not been able as yet to make the desired investigations nor do they believe that they can be made thoroughly and satisfactorily except through subcommittees sent to the several homes where the officials and the complainants can be confronted since this invustigation has been ordered by the louse a large unumher of letters have been received by members of the committee asf others making the gravest churges against thu official integrity of some of the offlcers of incompetency and ignorance against others and of hardships and cruelty in the discipline and management of the homes many of these charges are of so grave a character as to demand inquiry and it is the purpose of the committee to make it i shall content myself i this conueetion to make only a few extracts from letters to show that the action and purpose of the committee in pressing the inquiry are well justified"], [0.10175997018814087, 0.8982400298118591, 1, "in reference to the nevada mint i take it that the original purpose of the committee on appropriations was to 4lo away with the mint at that place and to establish an assay office there upon the urgent solicitation of the director of the mint we changed that purpose and he submitted an estimate which i will incorporate in myremarks upon which we subsequently acted conforming in part to his views in this snbsequent estimate he asked that 50 000 be appropriated for wages of workmen and adjuster the coumnittee recommend that 40 000 be given for that purpose he asked that 30 000 be given for materials acid repairs and other incidental expenses the committee recommend that 25 000 be given as we deem that amount ettirely adequate i suppose this mint will receive in addition some benefit from the refining of gold as provided for in this bill that is as far as we deem it at all essential to go in fact we deem that quite adequate"], [0.10575979202985764, 0.10575979202985764, 0, "i suggest to the chairman to give us ten minutes to speak on this paragraph then business can go on this is a

of state recommended that the chargd dafltires for denmark greece switzerland portugal paraguay and uraguay now receiving salaries of 5 000 a year each shoul be restored to their former status of ministers resident at a salary of 7 500cach the bill which passed atthe last session has worked very well and the committee on appropriations differing with the secretary pf state on that point have not thought proper to make any change iil that respect from the bill of last year if gentlemen will turn to line 54 of this bill they will find the following item for contingent expenses of foreign intercourse proper and of all the missions abroaul 85 000 the amount appropriated for that purpose last year was 875 000 upon consultation with the secretary of state he thought that amount might not be sufficient and recommended that it be increased to 100 000 after fnl ii consideration of the sn liject the committee thought proper to iscrease the amount to 85 000 or 10 000 more than tse appropriation of last year again the secretary of state recommended that the salaries of the consulagencral at berlin vienna frankfort and montreal and the consuls at hamburg bremen leipsic lyons manchester beirut ilelfast birmingham bradford chetanitz sheffield sossneberg dresdeu havre marseilles fayal nuremberg leith naples stuttgart mannheim and tunstall be increased from 1 250 to 1 500 a year last year there was appropriated for that purpose the sum of 42 600 and the salaries of these officials were limited to 1 250 each after fuller consultation with the secretary of state the committee did not deem it neessary to increase the salaries of all these officials indeed they came to the conclusion that the salaries of some of them might be reduced below that which they now receive by way of meeting the views of the state department it was agreed that the same ansount shoul be appropriated for this purpose that was appropriated last year 42 000 and that discretionary power should be given to the secretary of state to regulate the pay of these different officials as he might deem best none of them to rceive nmore than 1 500 a year the amount for this purpose therefore has not been increased some of them will have their salaries inereased to 1 500 while the salaries of others will be reduced toless than 1 250 on page 12 of the bill will be found this item for contingent expenses of united status consulates stlh as staionery lookcases arms of tie united states sals presses and flags rent freight postage and other necessary miscellaneous matters including loss by exchange l15 000 the secretary of state asked that this appropriation be increasedto 0125 000 as all the accounts for last year have not yet come in and the secretary of state was unable to say what was the exact amount necessary for the past year the committee deemed it proper to make the same appropriation for this purpose 115 000 which it is believed will be ample again under the item for the salaries and expenses of the united states and spanish claims commission we appropriated last year 4 500 respectively for the pay of commissioner and of counsel the secretary of state recommended that the appropriation be reduced to 4 000 for each after investigation the committee found that the gentlemen who were engaged in the work of this commission both the commissioner and the attorney to the commission are engaged in active practice attending all the courts hence we considered 3 000 as ample pay for them and this is the amount we have fixed in the bill some little change is made as to the messenger and also in regard to contingent expenses of this commission saving thereby on this item 3 512 for the relief and protection of american seamen in foreign countries we propose in this bill an appropriation of 80 000 last year we appropriated for this purpose only 70 000 but there has been an unusual number of disasters to our shipping in different portions of the world and it is believed that more than 70 000 will be needed for this relief and protection of our seamen the secretary of state thought that 100 000 would not be too large a sum buttheaccounts in this case as in the other i have mentioned have not yet come in and hence the necessary expenditures for the present year are not definitely known we think the amount appropriated will be sufficient another provision of the present bill is the following to meet the necessary expenses attendant upon the execution of the neutrality act to be expended under the direction of the president pursuant to requirement of section 291 of the revised statutes 10 000 the appropriation for this purpose last year was 0 000 the comumittee however believed upon investigation that 10 000 would be amply sufficient for this purpose as only 1 800 was expended for the purpose last year i should have mentioned at a previous point in my remarks that the secretary of state recommended a change in the appropriation for salaries of consuls viceconsuls commercial agents and thirteen consular clerks for which purpose we propose to appropriate in this bill 300 600 last year we appropriated for this object 333 300 but the secretary thought that we might flispense with the sum of 32 900 a corresponding reduction of that amount has been made in this item 1 believe i have now explained all the provisions that require explanation we have not changed the grade of any of the united states officers abroad and there is very little change indeed in the amounts proposed to be expended in some few instances we have increased the amount and in one instance upon the recommendation of the secretary of state we have as just stated made a reduction of 32 900 upon the whole the reduction made by this bill on the amount appropriated last year is 28 000 and this reduction is made almost entirely upon the recommendation of the secretary of state there should be no controversy about this bill and i hope there will be none as it was reported by the unanimous conshnt of the committee and to meet the wellknown and determined purposes of the senate not to allow a general law to be changed by amendments to an appropriation bill"], [0.11044394969940186, 0.8895560503005981, 1, "it affords me pleasure to bring to the attention of the house a measure of retrenchment which while it proposes a large reduction comes here with the indorseneut of the entire committee on appropriations it is only due to the secretary of the navy for me to state that in our conferences with him upon this bill and the reductions therein proposed he has entered no protest he has yielded to us all the sources of information freely and fully there has been no attempt to oppose us in our purposes but wohave been uniformly met with the statement this is yournavy make such appropriations as you may deem fit it is only my province to conduct tie duties of my department sir i have no fear that in these reductions the public service will be at all injured in the first place i do not consider that the continued keeping up of the navy of the united states at a high state is at all consistent with the genius of our people any more than to maintain a large standing army it is ourgreat good fortune that unlike the great powers of europe which are continually meditatiug destruction of each other both upon land and upon sea we are isolated disconnected with those controversies which are continually and as it would seem necessarily arising there while this government has been in existence but a hundred years our navy has been called upon but once worthy of mention to go out against a foreign foe and that was during the war of 1812 i know we have bail other troubles but they amounted to uught it was charged against the administration of jefferson as well as against the administration of madison that they had almost wholly ueglcectedthe navy whatwasthoresult w ten thetrial of strength did come althoigh we encontered an enemy who by reason of the hloivs she had given to the spanish french and i5ulth navcis was riding the ocean with contempt for the rest of the world who does not remember with pride our struggle and that it was our own despised little navy which first brought her to a recognition ofthe fact that there was oime power she must and should respect but how did it happen much was due to the fact that our navy was composed of men of skill of courage and of endurance and a great deal that we found our commercial marine ready at once tocome to our rescue it was our hidden but our easily available strength the alarm sounded on every occasion when an effort is made to enlarge our navy is not justified from our own experience the moral force of reason does not justify it and the great aid of diplomacy does not justify it if i entertained a doubt oii this point the fact that on my own committee are gentlemen of long experience who have been here for many years who without regard to party concur in this report and the further fact that a high cabinet officer at the head of the departmet fails to enter any protest are sufficient reasons why i should not hesitate to go fernard in addition to this who does not feel the paralysis of the industries of our land tell me a state in any section of this country in new england the middle states the southern or western states or upon the great 1acific slope tell me any of them whose representatives upon this floor will not testify to the fact that labor with them is in enforced idleness that bushiess of every kind manufacturing mercantile or agriculture refuses to yield those profits which we found in the days of our ieace and prosperity if this be true if this is the popular dmnain if this is the feeling of the committee if this is the feeling of cabinet officers the country i say is to be congratulated that here there is to be retrenchment to which there can be no reasonable objection now with these preliminary remarks it is but due to the house that i should briefly call attention to the reduction in the navy appropriation bill we have brought forward and to give some of the reasons which induced the committee to report it i will add however that the appropriations under this bill as reported amounted to 12 808 655 40 andte apiiropriations for the last year or rather for the current fiscalyear were 17 011 30i 90 siluowing a reduction on the appropriations for the last year or the current fiscal year of 44 202 651 50 to which may be added if tie statement of the fourth auditor be correct that the pay of the navy fund has heretofore been sufficient by reason of unexpended balances of previous years not covered back into the treasury but which balances are now exhausted and upon which now there can be no reliance to which may be added if that statement be correct another million of dollars making a reduction in the expenditures of the navy depaltment for the current fiscal year of 5 202 651 50 the estimates for the next fiscal year were 20 871 666 40 and deducting from that the appropriation contained in this bill we have a difference between the estimates and the amount actually appropriated of 8 063 011 i siall take up the discussion of this bill by paragraphs in the order in which they appear in print first i am brought by that arrangement to the pay of the navy the estimates were 7 600 000 and the appropriation in the bill is 6 250 000 i think i shall be able to show to the satisfaction of the house that that reduction is not sufficient and i shall therefore at the proper time introduce an amendient reducing it still further i will here call attention to the following tables of the years 1857 1859 and 1860 and 1873 1874

275 350 50 1 811 878 69 i have selected the years 1857 1859 and 1860 because it has been so common on this floor to charge that the administration of mr buchanan was an exceedingly extravagant one i do not propose to raise the question whether it was or was not i am not here to defend any administration but i take these years for the purpose of comparison with the years 1873 1874 and 1875 i will now call the attention of the house to the fact that in the year 1859 when the number of men in the navy was the same as it is at this time the pay of the navy was 4 536 707 32 the estimate of the department for the same number of officers and men for the next fiscal year is 7 600 000 the difference is a very marked one members can at their own leisure compare the tables for those several years and they will find a difference of several millions of dollars in this matter of the pay of the navy i shall ask in this connection to publish a statement made and handed to me by the secretary of the navy in which he shows or claims that his estimate for 1877 is absolutely correct and from which it appears that less than 2 000 000 of that sum are paid to the seamen and petty officers showing that a very large proportion of it nearly 5 000 000 goes to the retiredlist and to the pay of the officers the piatometit as furnished by the secretary of the navy is as follows table 2 showing estimates

of service in the navy sea service shore service and waiting orders an examination of the table furnished me by the secretary of the navy will show that not onetenth of the officers on the payroll are on waiting orders or furlough the rest being on sea and shore duty the statement of iny friend from tennessee as to the small number of vessels in the service is one well worthy our attention in this connection the revised statutes expressly provide that in addition to this pay the secretary of the navy may in his discretion furlough officers and further reduce their pay before the war it was exceedingly common to put the best officers in the service on furlough gradually there was a disposition to depart from it officers were put upon waiting orderswhere they could have nothing else to do until now it seems it has grown up notwithstanding the laws of the land to that point where officers feel it an indignity to put them on furlough pay there is no question in my mind in addition to that but what there are a grent number of officers who are on shore duty and that that duty is almost absolutely nothing the only correction that can be made in this matter is by the appropriation bill itself i make no charge against any administration or against any cabinet officer 1 can understand that these importunities will come upon any officer that may happen to be at the head of the department and come from gentlemeu of courage of learning of honor and come with power rbe representatives of the people have it in their power to check this abuse and they ought by all means to do it and with this view and being thoroughly aware that i am correct in the statement i am making i shall offer an amendment hereafter for a further reduction of this appropriation again sir i feel it my duty in passin to call the attention of the house to a note in the estimates by the f ourth auditor on the subject of the pay of the navy in reference to the estimate of the current expenses of the year he says this is the amount made up byelose computation and examination of the rolls by both the fourth auditor s office and the navy depvment the appropriations for the last three years have been too small to make the payments required by the provison of onis6 laws the doflcit has only been made up by the balanes of the appropriations for pa available by law foe this purpose all these that can ho legally used are now ox ansted now this statement cannot be true in 873 when the numnber of the navy was eightyfive hundhed men the appropriations were 6 315 000 while the expenditures were 6 432 882 being in excess of the appropriation in 1874 the appropriatiops were 6 316 000 and the expenditures were 7 633 000 it will be gomembered that was the year in which the secretary of the navy enlisted some fifteen hundred additional men when we were apprehending trouble with spain in 1875 the appropriations were 6 285 000 and the expenditures 6 511 000 it will be observed therefore that every year the expenditures have exceeded the appropriations but while il practice they may have relied upon the fund here referred to with the single exception of 1874 they never have reached in the expenditures of the department the amount here claimed now there has been an effort on the pait of the fourth auditor to make an explanation of this based on the fact that officers and men were off on duty and did not get home in time to get their pay during the fiscal year but when we take it year by year and strike the average we shall findthat this point was never reached except in a single instance when we were apprehending trouble abroad and enlisted an additional number of men it is not my purpose siri to say how this statement happens to come from the fourth auditor it seems to me sir to say the least that it shows that the accounts in that office are not perfectly kept i would not say it would be unkind to say that there was purposely a false statement"], [0.11091625690460205,

upon record certain statistical information which i think will he of use to gentlemen who may not have obtained it from the departments and who may require it in the succeeding conference we have two branches of our foreign service the consulax and the diplomatic the consular service is not paid out of the ordinary funds of the treasury it is paid by fees collected upon foreign mercantile transactions and should be expended for the benefit of the commerce of the country the first statement i submit is a comparison of the appropriations for consular salaries from the year 1856 to 1875 showing also how the revenue from fees has grown with the increase of the consular service the fees however in the larger ratio in 1856 the salaries amounted to 280 000 in round numbers with no report of fees the next year the salaries amounted to 273 750 and the fees to 110 802 from that small beginning the consular service appropriation rose in 1872 to 477 000 as the highest figure while the fees have increased to over 700 000 this statement is important as showing that the facilities we afford to commerce by consular appointments are actually increasing the revenue to the treasury and the effort to abolish those consular appointments where the fees are small is like a telegraph company abolishing every office on its line that does not pay the expenses of its maintenance last year we reduced the paynsents from the figures of 1872 333 000 while the fees are about 700 000 hence i maintain that the dostruction of the consular service proposed in this bill is a destpletion pro tant of the commercial interests of the country i desire that the next committee of conference may bear in mind that the consula service is one which merchants pay for and that they have a right to demand its vigorous support while they also pay in part for the diplomatic service i submit also the following statement of contingent expenses showing a yearly average from 1869 to 1873 of 109 759 about the

i said before i have simply stated the facts that this report which i hold in my hand was reported hy mr thait signed by him as chairman of that committee and in it he states that the committee thereupon voted to adopt the report and also to report the same to the house with the reemmendation that the same be printed aiil recomlittedy ithink the words mean what they say the reason why it should be reeonemitred ihavestated that holad said in the report that the testimony lad not been written omit and therefore it was recommitted and as ai evidence of that fact when the lestimony was written ont it was printed as part of this docnment which is signed by the chairman of that comniittee that is part 2 of report tno 101 now the senator from ohio says further that this committee acknowledged the legality of that board the committee say the law provides that this board shall consist of five persons from all political parties it etnsisted at the opeing of their ast session of live repeblicano upon th retlgnation of one of whom rcueitl longotrecti ar arroyo a conservative was talknto till the vacancy after protesting against the actton of tho nard it secret session to

subsequently made by the majority of the committee they report the saite thing that the law was not complied with 8o far then i think the senator from ohio wasit error whec he said that this committee said nothing its regard to the illegaliy of that transaction but i want to go further he said thatthehouse committee when it came to the personal character of that boardsaid nothingagainst it lie used this langagc also btotatthesame time they certified to the honorable character and general conduct of the board now let us see whether or not the report carries out that on page 2 of the report the commnittee say the pitlilie sittings of the roteroing board were attended by the counsel of the repiblican and conservative state committees objentiono were received from lio counsel of the respective parties to the returns frost different polls jibe ob jectiag party was generally allowed to produce alidavits to support the objoction and the otiier paty to reply by adldavits a day was fixed when these proofs were to be closed after these public sessions the board went into private or as they were called executive sessions where the proofs and mattersin dispute wore discos sid a decision arrived at i call the attention of the senate to this the ninutes of the board are very meager they containlittle more than a record of its meeting going into exeeutiv soession and its adjourning and some formal ltile orders they contain no iinutes whatever of the proecefdinnos in executive session and furnish therefore little light upon the findings of the hoard now i read what refers especially to the chairman of that board mr j madison wells and lot us se whether or not the ideas of this committee who visited the city of new orleans for the very purpose of ascertaining the truth in regard to the official action of these gentlemen correspond with the ideas of the senator from ohio the parish of rapides chose three members of the legislature the retarns elected all three conservatives when the proofs closed the only paper filedwilt the riturning board was the affidavit of the unted states supervisor that the ecleion was in all respects full fair and free mark you three conservatives were returned and it was sworn to by i lie supervisor that the election was fair foll and free in the parish of rapides it was net known in the parish that any contes existed against these nombets they left their hmes snd proceedod to now orleans to ie present at the opniig of tlhe legislature no intimtion of contesting teir seats or objectiot to their olection havitg been giveni by their opponents at one of theirlast sessions the returning board declared all the ropublican tenihrs elected fron that parish the supervisor reported the three conservatives elected there was no contest no paper whatever wai filed except the proper paper of the supervisors thus i went up and it is only at the last session of the rettrnsitig btard that they declared all the republican members elected from that parish now lot tos see how that was accomplished by what stnuge means by what legerdemain it was that the three conservative members from the parish of rapides were thrown out dtringone of the last days of their session and one of their last sessions and three republican members counted in in their place and it will be retnenbered that tte same four men with the same cha irman who consfituted the board to which the committee refers constitute the board now the committee say when the papers of the returning board were pendteed before your cominittee titre was found among them an aibdavit by ri wells the president of the board declaring that intimidation had existed at certain polls in that parish and that th retnls from those polls shoul therefore be rejected

dated the day of dcomber 1871 it appeared that governor wells was nothimsolf in therpiosh en the day of the election i ask honorable senators how it was possible for an honest man to file at affidavit stating that intimidation occurred in that parish on cletion day when he was not in that parish oin the day of the elcetion and theogh at the opening of their first session yonr committee declared their intention to examine into the action of the rcturniij board governor wells neer came forward as a witness that is one time he declined at cite close of ottproceedings leave was asked that his

truth atd yet ont every occasion lie declined to come forward and subject himself to the rigidityof a crossexamination yrea committee are therefore constrained to declareusing the word constrained it is the report of honest men against the interest of their own partyyour committee are therefore constrained to declare that the actou of the returning board i rijecting these returns iathe patish of liapides anid giving the seats fti that isaish to tin republican candidates was arbitrary unfair and without warrant of law i ask honorable senators if an honorable man can knowingly do an unfair thing and when the subject of the act is brought directly in question when he is invited in all the mode known to the lae to come forward and give his testimony decline to give it in any shape or manner either by personal appeara nce or by deposition or by commission and interrogatories if the committee were to go behind the pprs before the board and consider the alleged charge of intimidation upon the pesof before the committee their finding would necessarily be the same how here mr j madison wells swears that there was intimidalion and a committee with a majorityof his own party or a subcommittee in that clause upon examination state that if they were reuiired to go behind thepapers before the board that their report would be the same it was assorted in fovernor wellss affidavit that the itfcenery officials had nsnrped the etlics of the parish and thereby intimidated voters immediately after the 41i of septemober when the kellogg authorities in now orleans were put out by the peonn authorities certain clianyts took place in soee of the parishes when the news from now orleans reached these toarishes the mcenery officials demanded their places of the ktllogg officials an they were at once given up whet the lei al govrtteine interened and unseated the menery authorities the kellogg officials demanded and received back their places but in rapides some tifle seems to ho elapsed before the kellogg officials took their places hack indeed the c ettey register of deeds was still acting as such when yor committee wero ii new tlrleisis the kellogg register never having eoms to reclaim the placo which was said to be worth nothing that is a good reason why they did not want to remove him now in itapides the kellogg clerk was mr wellss son hlaving yielded his place to the meecry competitor it september lie doe not appear to have ieclaimed it and he was acesertungly sent for after the election to come front his residence some ueiles distiet to sign the returns of the election which be did your coottittee are at a loss to see in this action any intimidation of llt wells still less of the electors of thi parish and yet the affidavit of j madison wells did state although he was not there to know the truth whereof he testified that the electors in that parish were intimidated this is not a democratic paper that i at reading i am perfectly willing totake the testimoty of charles fost ru william walter phelps and clarkson n potter in a case of this kindt or any kindmen whose repttation is known the first two are trusted members of the republican party and the last i know stands high in the ranks of the democratic party atd is one of the ablest lawyers that practices in the country as to their integrity no one has brought it in question and cannot then it does not make any differece to me whether it be that this is mr hoas report or whether it is not mr hoars report it is the report of men as good as mr iloa and of the same political faith and order whose business it was to go down there to investigate facts and make a report after ftll investigation i will read what they say it regard to this parish of rapides which they have discussed it so happens that that parish was taken as a sample parish of intimidation if they could not establish intimidation in rapides anid that was the samtle they had taken the case failed maey witnesses from both parties were examined in reference to it they show beyond question that there was a ftree full fair and peaceable election anil regis tr tion there atid yet the president of this board mr wells swears that there was intimidation there there was no evidence of any intimidation of voters precticed on thie dayof ee lion although it was assertedilthat intimidation of colored ment befre eledtion had been efted eythreats of reflsal to employ thei nr iscbargo then if they voted the republican ticket nto evidence either of discharge or of refusal to cmploy was produced certain witnesses

whother before or after th election the action of the returning hoard in thu arih of lapidee amo changed the psiltel cmplsioti of the lower ouer hot their action in otherparishes was eially jetinaie b they then go on and give the facts in regard to other parishes but i will pass on to save time to de soto e in the parish of do soto in which the returs showed a conservativo elected by over 1 000m njority it was alleed that the supervisor of rogistration had breaght the returns to now orleans and tad left them with a woman of bad oharacter who offered to p roduce them on payment of 1 000 that is a place for them the conservative committee took legal proceedings to compel their production but tim court held that it bail no juisdictiio to that end they th i canoed to be produced before the boarl the duplicate of those returns froim the ofice of the secretary of state together with the tallysheets pill list e filed there according to law these duplicates corrsponided exactly with the allogod result of the compiled returno which the said woman hail produced and of tiese alleged facts unisputed proof woe also submitted to the board nevertheless the boarl refused to count the otc for that parish here is a parish which gives an snquestioned and nndisputed majority of 1 000 votes the return from that parish is placed iu the hands of the supervisor and he brings those returns down to the seat of government at new orleans and instead of filing them where ihe law required them to be tiled they are turned over to a woman of bad repute who asks 1 000 for them these facts are irought to the attention of that board and nevertheless the hoard refused to muake a demnd for them and refused to count the voto for bhat parish and yetthis is board which the senator has seen fit here to say was coinposed of men as honorable as any senators on this floor in the conclusion upon that part of the ease they say without now referring to other instances we are constrained to declare that the action of the retorning board on the whole was arbitrary unjust and in our opiniion illegal and that this arbitrary unjust and illegal action alone prevented the return by the board of a majority of conservative members of the lower house we are told that the action of this board is as binding upon the country and is entitled to as nmch respect as the court of last resort the supreme court of the united states i ask when it was that any man in all this land has ever accused the supreme court of the united states of arbitrary and unjust decisiins i they may have decided questions about which lawyers may differ as to the true construetion of the law but so far as their action is concerned the charge of arbitrary and unjusteonduct has never yet been made against that august eoutt an honorable man with a knowledge of the facts cannot act unjustly governor wells when lie made his affidavit in regard to the parish of rapides should have cnown the truth whereof lie testified the testimony before this board shows that governor wells himself was not in the parish of rapides on the day of election and therefore that he testified in regard to a subject about which it was impossible for him to know and which upon investigation the committee report turned out to be untrue the law of evidence characterizes this hind of testimony i should not have troubled the senate with maing these statements and with quoting from the testimony of geeral sheridan in regardto the ipersonalcharacter of the chairnman of that board or the testimony of these gentlemen messrs foster phelps tend potter in regard to the arbitrary unjust and illegal conduict of this board nod their sharpt criticism in regard to j madison wells but for the fact that the senator from ohio saw proper in his opening remarks upon the louisiana matter to send forth to the world as honestmen this returning board and to further say that their action is entitled to ns much credit as the decision of the supreme court of the united states it is therefore but just and proper that the testimony of men of his own party with equal facilities for knowing the character and integrity and the work of these men shooll go before the country also they might possibly be mistaken i cannot well see how they could upon the facts be mistaken but at all events the senator from ohio has indorsed the personal integrity and official action of this board and the committee do not in respect to the report of the presidents committee we know by experience that party influences and party biases sometimes warp our judgment if the president designed to secure a perfectly reliable report front the state of louisiana it seems to me that it would have been more prudent and more to tie and wiser to have selectel representative men from both of the great political parties so that the bias or prejudice which each party might have in respect to the evidence or the facts before the board might be corrected by the other party in this manner the truth could have been deduced and then ajoint report signed by both sides would have been entirely acceptabile to the american people but it is a matterof fact that every one of those who were sent down there at the presidents instance are of the same political faith as the president there is another poimt i desire to refer to so far as my information of affairs in the state of louisiana goes i do not remember to have seen a single publication ohargingintimidation threats or violence toward voters otn account of political sentiments during the entire canvass so far as the publieations went that fell under my observation the canvass was gairy aud peaceably conducted the first news that came up from louisiana undisputed so far as i know was that the ection had beti absolutely fair and peaceful in every precinct in the state yet we have now charges of intimidation whereby we have a democratic majority of nearly 9 000 wiped out anti a majority of some 4 000 coeunted in on the other side making adifferenee of about 13 000 votes this startling fact must be fully andsatisfactorily explained before the american people will believe it jast if the testimony when it comes to be examined shows it to be right and in accordaunee with the votes legally east that the state of lonisiana should be counted for the 1iayes electors if it is j ust if the will of the people of that state fairly expressed through the ballotbox was for him theu it shouil be so counted anti if it was for the electors for governortilden then it shouli be counted for tilden whatevernmity be the truth of the case the decision should be in accordance with the law and with the facts the democratic party court the most searching investigation of the disputed returns the senator from ohio agrees to that sentiment but his trouble seemed to be as to who had authority to make this investigation can any one believe for tn instant that when our system of laws ont the subject of elections is so jealous of the rights of the people that there are trib nals for establishing by contest the right to the smallest office in a state from constable up to governor it is so fatally defectie that there is no constitutional and legal tribunal to determine who has received t majority of the electoral votes cast for president and vicepreidetit the power to open all the certificates is by to constitution in the president of the senate and the power to examine the votes and determine questions raised as to their validity or invalidity and of counting what are thus ascertained to bie valid legal votes is in myjudgment vested by the coustitution in the two houses my opinions about this expressed in the debate at the last session have undergone no chesg i will say in respect to this meatter in oregon that i have no objection to the investigation there is a difference of statement ott apitoint of great concern between the senator front oregon and the governor of that state that is to say as to the publicity and its extent of the alleged ineligibility of one of the hayes electors the governor says louse of representatives and the great weight of english authorities toth parliamentary and judicial the law of oregon providing for tilling vacancies in the electoral collego reconizes a vacancy only in cases where there has been an numment and such in conbent has died refised to sit negleeted to attend or is otherwise absent in this case theui was no incanimbunt uiisib the nxthighest candidato should take ihe p oitiot and there wos no vacancy which could it filled by the other members of the electoral college the neat highest uanlidate eligitle under the constitutiaion of the unitcd states was therefore ceitided to be duty electedl i f grtovetrt governe of oregon the seiator from oregon states that he made twentyfive speeches in the interest of the republican party in that state and lid not hear the ineligibility of watts nientionel then there is a question which it seems to toe is proper for investiga tion and however this may result whoever is fairly honestly and lawfully entitled to the disputed vote of oregon should have it and the same course shouhl be pursued in south carolina florida anu louisiana i do not believe that philippics that denunciations do any good herb and do much harm elsewhere we all ought to look at this frot a temperate standpoint every man ought to be controlled by reason juldgment and common honesty and if we come up to the work with that spirit with the earnest purpose and desire of declaring the very troth is to who is l ifully entitled to ito inaugurateed oy jutdgent about it is that everything will pass off peacefully and harmoniously and the people will be satisfied with whomever the truth may declare as lawfully entitled by fair election conducted by i he methods of the constitution anti laws to the exalted positions of president and vicepresident of the united states"],

cut down the report of the indian agent which is part of the records of congress made in the report of the department and referred to in the letter which has been read shows some ten or twelve claims
