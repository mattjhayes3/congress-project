point to the fact that last year our increase in the revenues was 12 000 000 and that we paid nearly 100 000 000 on the public debt but sir today we are confronted with an appropriation bill increasing the expenditures for our diplomatic and consular service onefourth more than they were last year and that in the face of the good record made by this house as regards the other appropriation bills passed at this session compared with general appropriations made last year the sundry civil bill decreases expenditures three and a half millions the indian appropriation bill decreases expenditures half a million the agricultural appropriations bill decreases expenditures about 90 000 and the pension bill the army bill and the military academy bill are about the same in amount as they were last year this is not the proper time to increase the salaries of those who hold positions in our diplomatic and consular service i have great respect for the gentlemen who are now serving this country as foreign ministers and consuls and i will try to do them justice from the days when benjamin franklin was a foreign minister many of our ministers abroad have performed distinguished service for our country and i wish to say here and now that many of our consuls are good men the necessity for rigid economy was never greater in the history of our country than now business in many places is depressed enterprise is stagnant thousands of laboring men are out of employment and the products of agriculture are not yielding renumerative prices hard times are oppressing the people and pitiless poverty is pinching the poor in strange contrast with the times that surround us are the provisions of this bill what does this bill do i listened to my friend from new york with interest but he did not state all that is in this bill the bill shows that the proposed increase for the diplomatic service for the next fiscal year is 50 500 i will show that it goes further than to simply increase the salaries of two ministers as has been alleged in this debate it increases the salary of the minister to china 5 500 it increases the salary of the minister to the argentine republic 2 500 it furnishes secretaries of legation they have never had them befbre to the argentine republic belgium corea the netherlands the roumanian servian and greek mission the swedish and norwegian mission switzerland and venezuelathe increased expenditure amounting to 12 000 it increases the salary of the interpreter at the turkish legation 500 it increases the salary of the interpreter at siam 300 it furnishes a clerk to the london legation at 1 200 it allows 25 000 for the erection of a legation building in japan it allows 3 000 for repairs to the legation in siam and it increases the amount allowed as the reward for foreign vessels rescuingamerican seamen 500 making a total increase for the diplomatic service of 50 500 the bill also shows that the salaries of the seven consulgenerals are each increased onefourth although these consulgenerals are now receiving 4 000 and 3 000 per annum it also doubles the salaries of twentythree consuls and increases the salaries of thirtyseven consuls from 2 000 per annum to from 2 500 to 3 000 per annum i will not weary the house by reading from the list of consuls whose salaries have been increased but to support

to the yellowstonie park i think it is very clear that we should adopt with reference to that park the same policy that we have adopted with reference to the other parks if i remember correctly we transferred the island at the straits of mackinaw at the head of lake michigan a very interesting island to the state of michigan and the yosemite valley to the state of california both public parks both to be held in trust for the original objects to which they were dedicated the same ought to be done with the yellowstone park it is nowa precinct of one of the counties of wyoming two justices of the peace and two constables are employed under the laws of wyoruing to administer justice in the park and that territoryhas expended heretofore 8 000 a year to maintain the public peace and order in that region in my judgment the park ought to be turned over to the territory of wyoming in trust for the purposes for which the dedication was originally made gentlemen will see upon examining the subject that a very carefully prepared law has been enacted defining criminal offenses in the park a law intended to protect the objects of interest there from injury and destruction and the wild animals and to protect the forests from fire i think that the government ought to give wyoming the trusteeship of the park at the same time i think the government should aid somewhat in keeping up bridges and highways for the convenience of the people who flock to that park from all portions of the united states but wyoming can manage that park much better than congress but i rose for another purpose i hope the house will not consent to go any further this session in increasing the number of public employds gentlemen will be astonished when they come to look at the list of new offices created by this congress they will find that it is almost without precedent since the close of the war or at least since the 4th of march 1873 the list is much larger than gentlemen who have not kept a vigilant watch of the record apprehend and yet no increase in the public employments ought to have occurred it is proposed now to add quite a number of salaried officers at 1 600 a year each nine in number involving 14 400 in salaries why sir the main objection made to allowing clerks to senators was that it was an indirect mode of increasing salaries the salaries of the supreme judges are now very ample made so by the famous act of the 4th of march 1873 which increased them from 8 000 to 10 000 a year the salary of the chiefjustice being 10 500 very ample salaries for life yet it is now deliberately proposed to add in effect 1 600 to each salary making the salary of the supreme judges 11 600 a year i hope that will not be done i hope gentlemen will stop the increase of public

of that short veto of the bill to pension my constituent joseph romiser had you all heard it gentlemen i would have had what i have anyhow the right to challenge your honor and your consciences independent of party to say after i have briefly stated his case whether upon the few facts and there are but three main facts in this mans case the action of congress should be overriddento say whether joseph romi ser a minuteman and soldier of the union who was shot through the bead in the ranks in the line of duty while a member of a citizen company acting under command of a united states officer general low wallace then colonel of the eleventh indiana zouaves repelling an expected attack upon cumberland md to say whether he ought to be robbed of~he pension due to his patriotic service and wounds because president cleveland has made a blunder that he has blundered there is no doubt he has made several blunders in this single case i call the attention of the chairman of the committee on invalid pensions to the charge made by the president in this veto message of gross carelessness against that committee if the gentlemen of the pension committee listened they heard read this charge against them in the message as read the president says that although the committee on invalid pensions state that this man joseph romiser had filed a claim for pension and it had been rejected he had never in fact filed such a claim and it never had been rejected i admit sir that if that were true the chairman of the committee on invalid pensions and those who acted with him had indeed been guilty of gross carelessness but if it is not true if the president is wrong and these gentlemen are right then he was guilty of a grosser carelessness because the report of the conmittee had notified him of the existence of these papers in the pension office and he could have obtained them easily as soon as i had read the veto i went to the room of the committee and i found as i expected record evidence that they did have the papers and that they returned them to the pension office on the 16th day of may i had thrice gone to the pension office dftriug three winters to examine the papers in this unfortunate mans case and i had found them without difficulty within an hour after the message came here which disclosed the fact that the president had ruthlessly put his hand to a veto of this bill without haviug ever examined the case i telephoned for the papers and they came promptly and i hold in my hand now the jacket and the papers which the president of the united states has said do not exist because the president has made that grievous blunder because he has never looked at the case he overrides by his veto the convincing report of thegentleman from pennsylvania that carefil and conscientious democratic member of the committee on invalid pensions overrides the report of senator wrlson the distinguished senator from my own statea learned and able judge who has spent years in trying causes the president overrides without consideration the action of both houses of congress without ever having looked at the papers in the case and that is grosser carelessness than any he has charged upon the committee or congress what is the case in which the president does this joseph romisers case is a matter of history i have here from the congressional library colonel lowdermilks admirable history of cumberland md which has been in print eight years two pages of this book tell the history of joseph romisers patriotic spirit and his misfortune how in the ranks of capt frank masons company of volunteer soldiery in the defense of his country be was shot accidentally when the company were uncapping their guns by a musket in the hands of a comrade alpheus beall the bullet going into the neck back of the car going through the inner ear and destroying his hearing coining out under the eye and blinding that eye the eminent surgeon who attended him afterward asurgeonin ourarmy declariugthat from the sympatlttic ophthalmia he may go blind in the other eye the heavy minieball broke the jaw at its minus making its exit through the molar bone below the eye therewas exfoliation of the bone terrible deformity of the face followed by months of lingering suffering and twentyfive years of neuralgia and a legacy of pain for life in requital he receives no pay no bounty no pension but instead the presidents veto now who was joseph romiser and when and where did he receive this wound he was a minuteman of the union cause he served under an officer of the union army i will tell you how as early as the 19th of june 1861 there was apprehension in the beautiful mountain city of cumberland in western maryland lew wallace then a colonel had gone yonder to guard the upper potomac where the virginians had burned the bridges in order to break the communications of the west with washington they had burned the bridge over the canal and the bridge over the north branch of the potomac the homeguards had gone to new creek and were there driven back by a force of the enemy from virginia lew wallace guarded the city with his indiana zouaves he had his stores there and the baltimore and ohio road had to be guarded to keep up communication between washington and the west and he called upon the people to aid him in its defense patriotic fire was then as now native to that air and from frostburg from the mountains and the valleys from the farms and the mines our people hurried in response to his call as later these sturdy miners went almost in regiments in response to president lincolns call at this time a body of young men among them this poor carpenter joseph romiser poor but brave and true were going to enlist some were going to enlist in western maryland some were going to join my friend lere in west virginia some were going to pittsburgh others as the gentleman from ohio recalls were going to enlist where they could when lew wallace made his call joseph romiser had just received the letter which i hold in my hand and which has grown yellow after twentyfive years upon the envelope is the device of a man nailing our flag to the staff and the sentiment below is it shall yet float over sumter this letter tells how the writer had in response to romisers request just written to this man directing him to go to pittsburgh to an address given that he might enlist in captain berriers company of the tenth pennsylvania as romiser was about to do i think berrier now lives in the district of the gentleman from pennsylvania he received this letter about the 14th of june and prepared to start on the 19th when lew wallace called for aid this poor young man with one hundred others went from frostburg under capt frank mason and hurried down the mountain to defend cumberland the county seat hither they came and fell into line when our guard was driven back into the town they were on duty to repel the attack if it came these green recruits in the evening at the cars brave but undisciplined were ordered by captain mason to uncap their muskets when alpheus beall who was just behind this man let his musket fall and the musket being thus discharged inflicted this wound sending an inch minieball through this mans head passing in the manner i have described as he fell he was caught in the arms of a comrade and carried into a private house he lay in a critical condition for months until finally life was assured among the papers which your committee saw although our president says they do not exist are the photographs of the man who was thus shot and maimed in the line of duty defending his country i hold them up before you that you may see the ravages of the minieball i show you now the affidavits of the man whose musket shot him of the men who picked him up i show you the affidavit of dr fundenberg the surgeon and abundant proofs beside and this localhistory here too are the petitions of hundreds of good citizens of every pursuit and politics praying congress to pension this deserving minuteman but the pension office according to the notes which i have here in my hand found that although the man at the time he was wounded was doing good service in the line of duty yet because he had hurried to defend the flag without waiting to be mustered they were constrained that isthe expressionto reject the application although he carried the belt cartridgebox and musket into the rank under captain mason who was acting uder command of a union colonel from indiana who i believe is well known to the chairman of the committee on invalid pensions as general lew wallace now famousthey were constrained to refuse a pension because he had never been mustered into the service this man was justly entitled to a pension because he was inspired by the spirit of the minutemen of concord and lexingtonthe embattled farmers who fired the shot heard round the world because he came from his mountain home and standing in the ranks was shot nigh unto death because he was not mustered in and therefore could not obtain a pension at the pension office under the strictness of the general pension law he came to congress it is a case of all cases such as should come to congress so that the injustice done by the general law might be corrected by a special act this having been passed by the unanimous action of both houses the president vetoes the bill because as he says this soldier wounded in the line of duty was not mustered in now whom are you going to follow i put it to your conscience and your honor as american representatives as against your party zeal and party expediency perhaps i am firing at the wrong target but if so i am proud of my confidence in human nature and i leave those who take the opposite view to support president cleveland in this veto time does not permit me to refer to all the precedents in this matter but i have examined all that were accessible i looked to see what washington and other presidents had done in like cases some of the minutemen of concord and lexington and the men who fought at bunker hill were not mustered in yet they were pensioned by the colonial assembly of massachusetts and that action was adopted by the congress of the united states at its very first session and george washington unlike president clevelaud did notveto the bill but approved it i find further that when the time came to renew the right of those men to pensions where they had been wounded in service and in the line of duty but had never been mustered in thomas jefferson the father of the democratic party did not veto the bill like president cleveland but approved it i find also that andrew jackson the great democratic president and the brave defender of his country had submitted to him bills pensioning members of some volunteer corps who had never been mustered into the service of the nation or state but had done actual service and been wounded and disabled in the line of duty and he had a chance to veto the measure but he would not veto he approved the bill i find further in a case presented to abraham lincoln that when some redtapeclerk in some office had said thata manhad not been mustered in thatgrand old man said i want to know whether he served his country and if his right is based upon service in the line of duty i do not care about the musterin and lincoln did not veto the bill i say to my friends here as men of honor and conscience that from the foundation of this government injury received in the line of duty disability incurred in the service has been regarded as the essential thing giving the right toapension itis the right of rights the ground of grounds for a pension from this great nation as an evidence of its gratitude and its americanism if the men of this congress can not rise and perhaps they can not above party feeling and go with vashington and jackson and jefferson and lincoln let them go with president cleveland and send away this poor soldier who never bad a dollar of pay or bounty who i fear had to bear the expense of his own medical attendance for months who today carries the scars which he received and endures the suffering he incurred in the service of his country who is deserted by his country because he was never mustered in but i appeal to every man who thinks the founders of the republic ay the fathers of the democratic party were instinct with the spirit of concord and lexington who looks to the future of the republic when like our sires our sons are gone to vote in favorof this minutemar of 1861 who on his way to be mustered in with the boys in blue received this grievous wound from the consequences of which he has ever since suffered in neglect because he was

prosperity the proposition i have alluded to known as the morrison resolution sanctioned by myhonored friend from virginia is launched against it and when i see these two gentlemen leave the beaten highway of their fathers and along which they have heretofore been accustomed to walk i am moved to exclaim who shall be strong if these be weak who shall rebuke the wrong if these consent but to my surprise they have consented to the attempt to force arbitrarily from the national treasury the reserve which has been recognized for a quarter of a century and by every administration including the present as being indispensable to the maintenance in the financial marts of the world of our national credit which is i repeat again the foundation upon which alone we must build the sure foundations of prosperity that surplus is to be scattered from the vaults of the national treasury to strengthen your coast defenses no to meet the crying needs of the country no but as my friend from tennessee would say to quicken our industries by pouring into the channels of trade and commerce this vast sum if the observation had fallen from other lips than those of my friend from tennessee i would think it was intended solely for the gallery on the theory that there might be among the listeners some unemployed waiting for work and waiting in vain who could or would be induced to believe the moment the alleged surplus was paid out to cancel the 3 per cent bonds new industries would start into life and a thousand avenues of trade would be opened up to the watching waiting men and that was said in face of the fact that nearly 100 000 000 are lying idle in the city of new york unemployed but vainly seeking remunerative investment the gentleman on reflection will admit that the matter of quickening industry has some relation to the question of demand and supply it seems logical to conclude that when every garner is full of grain the farmer is not tempted to plow and sow a greater number of acres when shoes are on every shelf and the supply exceeds the demand there is no disposition to establish another shoe factory when the mills and factories have produced more than is sufficient to supply the wants of the people how will the pouring of millions into the already glutted channels of trade tend to help matters it seems to me patriotic intelligent men should seek in another manner to point out the highway to national prosperity than by attempting to induce the people of this land to believe there is a power in the government yes in this house which if rightly exercised would quicken every industry and give employment to every idle hand i would it were so but it is not and all intelligentmen know the power does not rest in the government to do it and yet because the struggling millions of the land are anxious to get work and be about something to make their homes better and happier the chosen representatives of the peoplethat is many of them at least stand in their places here denounce the government denounce ourselves as if we were standing in and blocking the way of national prosperity because forsooth we refuse to tear out the very foundation upon which rests every possibility of business prosperity we are assailed even here as if we could if we would loosen the wheels of our locked industries by legislative enactment as if we could by act or resolution start the healthful current of trade and commerce which is now stagnant i know of but one standing menace to our industries one impending danger that has influence to partly paralyze our vast manufacturing industries and that comes from the gentleman from illinois who constantly assaults the tariff with bills for its great reduction thus unsettling every avenue of business which would be affected by such revision my democratic friends you make a great mistakeif you suppose for one moment that i desire that you should fail in the administration of this government i would to god your administration should be characterized by such wisdom such economy and frugality such beieficial results to my country that the people of the land would be justified in continuing you in power being assured that you had dealt better by the great interest committed to your care than my own party would i have done i see nothing however in your course to inspire such hope or to justify such expectation on the contrary i submit that instead of dealing with great questions in a manner consistent with ripe wisdom and perfect candor there seems to be a constant appeal to the prejudice the passion the appetites of men a disposition too often to deal with them as if we questioned the wisdom of god when he created man as having put together anything beyond a mouth an appetite a stomach and an alimentary canal i have said and repeat it that for the defenseless condition of our country the democratic majority in this house are at fault and are without excuse you came into power with profuse promises of accomplishing all that the people demanded nobody on this side of the house expected you would quicken our industries or extend our commerce but we hoped with reason that you would not refuse to appropriate the peoples surplus to provide needful and proper defense for our vast cities and coast line governments are not made great or strong by legislation national strength lies back of that our national strength will be found in the homes of our land our legislation is but the reflection of the teaching at the hearthstones of our country there is where the decay of civic virtue will begin there the foundations of our government he undermined ifat all those who hold the guiding reins above the children at the hearthstones exercise a mightier influence over the destinies of the country than we who make its laws if this congress appealed more earnestly to those hearthstones more earnestly to the intelligence of our people if we sought to deserve their confidence by fearless discharge of duty rather than to secure applause by serving merely to please those who are supposed to hold our political fortunes in their hands we would do better for ourselves and the country and would frequently show less promptness to vote for measures that we 41o not deem wise nor exhibit such hesitation to vote for others which we know to rest in wisdom and which promise ultimate good i do not know what may be done touching this bill it is my purpose to offer an amendment increasing this appropriation 3 000 000 that certainly is little enough but it will enable this board to move in the direction of providing defenses for some of our great cities will you adopt it gentlemen if not why it can not be said that we lack the money it can not be urged that the engineers mechanics and artisans of the country are not able ready willing and anxious to begin the work nor will it be said that we are lacking in material resources it can not truthfully be said that the work can be prudently delayed the necessity is great the time and all conditions auspicious to begin it rests with the democratic majority to vote or withhold the needful appropriation from the surplus revenues and just here i want to say that the talk we have heard on the stump during the past year or two about the vast balance lying idle in the treasury was not worthy of the men who stumped the country on that issue now the promise to distribute the fbur hundred millions among the people has come home to torment you the morrison resolution aimed at the national credit is the nearest approach you can make to redeeming the delusive promise made in regard to scattering four hundred millions among the people i am informed that some persons were actually deceived by the talk about the four hundred millions of idle surplus you came into power and your secretary of the treasury found it absolutely necessary to increase the surplus so called he was bound by his oath of office and by his high sense of duty to protect and defend his countrys credit so he did not redeem the promise to scatter the hundreds of millions among the people i am not criticising the administration at all upon this point i have no doubt that president cleveland and secretary manning did what they believed to be and what was for the best interests of the financial credit of this country and i say amen to what they have done but our friends upon the other side asserted that there were 400 000 000 lying idle in the treasury while the result proves that that was a statement made to deceive and delude the unwary what was the statement made for the thousands of idlers that gathered about the various stumps from which that was proclaimed said among themselves if this balance be distributed among us there will be employment for us all even the idler will be flush yet the speakers knew that they were worse than mocking the men who listened to them not only that but when the administration inaugurated by the democracy seeks to do what is demanded by every consideration of private andpublic honor they are slapped in the face by the democratic majority in this house who promptly vote a want of confidence in their own administration and i may mention that the secretary of the treasury in reference to the object purpose and effect of the morrison resolution telegraphs to a member upon this floor my colleague mr mckinley as follows lion william cicmley jr trasury departient j14 14 houme of represetalives in reply to your telegram of this date asking what the treasury would have left for working balance besides the fractional silver coin if the balance of seventyfive millions as shown by the treasurers report of june s0 lastk4hould be used in paying bonds i beg to state that nothing would be left but trust funds which it would be dishonorable and dishonest to use for that purpose c s fairchild acting s crclary was ever such a message sent by a cabinet officer to the representatives of the people who is right and who is wrong but all this is characteristic and indicates that the democratic majority in this house deals with the finances of the country as with the civilservice reform some time ago we heard a great deal about civilservice reform yet when the democratic president who climbed up to his great office on that ladder begins to find himself unsteady on his perch substantially the only men who fly to his support to uphold him are to be found on this side of the house and when he asks for clerks necessary to properly conduct the business of the civil service commission the democratic majority in this house without a ripple of dissent votes to refuse the needful appropriation this side votes to comply with the request of the president his party friends vote against it gentlemen what can the country think of a party that comes into power with a rich profusion of promises every one of which it breaks before the middle of its second year of administration now i have but this to add and then i will take my seat regretting that i have trespassed so long upon the patience of the house this bill pertains to a matter in which there is no partisanship its object appeals equally to both sides of the house it is a proposition to provide sufficient and adequate coast defenses confessedly heeded and to make an appropriation out of the abundance of the treasury to do that which every citizen admits to be absolutely necessary and indispensable to you gentlemen belongs the glory if you do it and the humiliation if you neglect it and i assure you wewill help you to vote the needed appropriation i confess however that as to you i am almost as one without hope 9r hiscock before the gentleman closes i would like to ask him this question has he explained what good reason there is for the creation of the commission that this bill proposes and further i would like to ask the gentleman if in his judgment all of this work can not be as well done by the army and the army engineers as by this new commission which it is proposed to create"], [0.08496641367673874, 0.08496641367673874, 0, "and i appeal to him not to be biased by any prejudice or prevented by any pride of opinion from acting upon any practical suggestion even though it may come from the other end of the capitol as near as i can understand it from the arguments upon this floor and from the conferees of the two houses they all agree upon the repeal of these existing laws and the only substantial difference between them is whether the question of alleged fraud in case of any entry ot land heretofore made shall be finally tried by and in the department of the interior as contended by the house conferees or whether the settler or his grantee or mortgagee as the case may be in case his title is attacked for alleged fraud shall have the right to remove the cause into the proper court and there have his rights adjudicated and determined by due course of law as proposed by the conferees of the senate this is practically the only question of difference between the conferees now i have listened patiently and carefully to the labored and able argument of the gentleman from illinois and i certainly am unable to see why the interests of all parties can not be fully and fairly protected under the operation of the amendment tendered by the senate conferees why this house or the government should be afraid or unwilling to give anybodya fair hearing in its courts passes mycomprehension i have listened carefully to the discussion to hear whether any valid reason could be urged by the distinguished gentleman from illinois against that mode of procedure but i have heard no such reason the only question here is whether or not this question of alleged fraud which enters into the validity or invalidity of these land titles shall be tried by any executive officex of the government upon evidence which is more or less ex parte or whether we shall give to any party who desires it an opportunity where the title to his property is attacked to go into court where he can have the privilege of confronting his accusers and the witnesses produce against him and subjecting them to the crucial test of a crossexamination why should the government fear the result of such a proceeding why sir that is a privilege which is not denied to the meanest sneakthief who seeks to rob your chickenroost under cover of the darkness or to any other accused person up through all the gradations of crime to the miserable crank who shoots down a president at noonday to none of these is the right of trial by jury denied why then will you deny it to the poor settler upon the frontier whose home whose substance whose all perhaps is threatened to be taken away from him upon the testimony of witnesses whom he can not have an opportunity to confront it seems to us beneath the dignity of this great nation to deny such a remedy to its humblest citizen i appeal to this house i appeal to the public lands committee that they will not let their bias or their pride of opinion which may be bias for the gentleman says he has stood here in opposition to this thing for six yearsi appeal to them that they will not let their bias or pride of opinion stand in the way of any wholesome or adequate remedy for such wrongs as they have portrayed here as being perpetrated in procuring title to the public lands of the united states i appeal to that committee again that they accept this amendment wholesome as it seems to be so that we may have some remedy for the existing evils for it is now evident that they must do so or we shall have no repeal or other legislation by this congress which is now fast drawing to a close i suggest that their present position in this matter if persisted in and adhered to will but result in no relief at all as has their action upon another measure pending in this congressi refer to their action upon the bill to declare a forfeiture of lands granted to the northern pacific railway company when the senate bill forfeiting about 6 000 000 of acres of the unearned lands of that grant came over to this house and was referred to this same public lands committee they substituted for it and reported to this house another bill which they well knew never would pass the senate declaring a forfeiture of over 30 000 000 acres of that grant fivesixths of which had been fairly and in good faith earned by the railway company and in that form the committee urged and procured the passage of the bill by this house it went to the senate and of course was nonconcurredin and went into conference where it sleeps to this day and probably will sleep there forever in the mean time the railway company is pushing the construction of its road and earning more of the granted lands and thus placing them beyond the power of congress to declare a forfeiture the policy of the committee seemed to be to go too far and perpetrate a great wrong or else to do nothing at all now i submit in all candor that by this course of procedure which this committee seems wedded to in both of these matters to do things in their own way or not do anything the country will get no relief whatever from the evils complained of and acknowledged to exist it will result in no legislation whatever and the country will justly hold us responsible for doing nothing and for affording them no relief when a just measure of relief is at hand and offered to us to accept but which we refuse i hope the house will instruct its conferees to recede from their position and accept the amendment tendered by the conferees of the senate to the end that a repeal may be had of these laws which have become obnoxious by reason of the abuses which have grown up under them and to the end that the remainder of our public domain may be reserved and preserved for actual settlement by bona fide settlers"],

three years has been the wonder of the century ask the careful observer what one cause has done more to work this miracle than all others and he will answer the preemption law ask the cattlemen what it was that destroyedjhis range scattered his herds and ignored his wire fences and lie will answer it was the preemption law write to your old constituent who leftillinoisor iowa and went out upon the western domain and ask him what it was that induced him to go outthere and he will answer you from a kansas farm it was the preemption law i have no doubt that some gentlemen here would like well enough to cut off that emigration to kansas and retain these emigrants in their own districts and therefbre there may be some consistency in their efforts to repeal the preemption law but let us hear no more declamation against the preemption law upon the ground that it has been favorable to these cattlemen and cattle syndicates and opposed to the interests of the poor men seeking homes in the west a word now in regard to innocent purchasers in nine cases out of ten the innocent purchaser is a homeseeker who has some money and who does not desire and does not find it necessary to go out upon vacant land and improve it he is not compelled to be the advanceguard of civilization he is notcompelled to make the first tracks upon the almost boundless prairies he is able to purchase from some frontiersman who has been less fortunate the final receipt of the government officer is to him conclusive he knows that under the law some improvements must be made and the government says to him by its receipt those improvements have been made it says to him through that final receipt there is a house upon that laud and there is a certain amount of cultivation upon that land it is out upon the open prairie wherehundreds of quartersections are alike in their general surface and in the character of the soil it is not necessary for him to go out there and examine it he knows perhaps that his neighbor from the state where he now lives has gone out there and his neighbor writes back to him and gives a description of the general character of the soil upon this information many times the citizen purchases a quarter section of land and then prepares to move out there and occupy it he goes there with his family he journeys westward and takes possession he may be a hundred miles or more from the land office then some anonymous scribbler sends in a letter to the commissioner of the general land office stating that the preemptor from whom this man purchased had committed a fraud against the government the entry of the land which this man purchased is suspended but the innocent purchaser all this while knows nothing about the action of this great and good government for which possibly he fought the original preemptor has sold out obtained his money and perhaps moved farther on toward the frontier and he alone receives notice of the suspension of this entry the innocent purchaser gets no notice he awaits the slow routine of the general land office at washington he knows the patent can not be issued for a year or two years but in the mean time he works he turns over the sod improves his house plants his orchard sets out his hedge and all in blissful ignorance of the to him secret proceeding on the part of his government to rob him of his money and his home one day there comes to him a man who living near the land office has been apprised of the proceeding and who after the cancellation of the entry of the original preemptor placed his own filing upon the land and now demands possession then thisinnocent purchaser awakens to the fact thathe must buy his home over again or abandon it and his improvements this is no fancy sketch there are thousands of just such cases in kansas today thousands of men who have been living in that state for ten years are today in this situation but i hear reiterated that stale assertion that 90 per cent of the entries under that law are fraudulent i stand here to say in the light of the past and the present that that declaration by whomsoever made is false but suppose it is true can the government afford to take

businessthey advise them of the fact that they are going to make an adverse report against this entry when they advise their pal so to speak of that fact he moves on the landhe takes possession as an original settler then the report is sent in to the commissioner of the general land office and the commissioner strikes down the original preemption he cancels and sets aside the entry then when the man who purchased in good faith who has lived there for years who has invested everything he possesses in it comes forward as an original preemptor and wants to be recognized as such he is informed this man who went into partnership with the agent who investigated it and made the adverse report on itthis pal in this infamous workhe is informed that such man has a prior right and must be respected and the gentleman from illinois knows that the practice in the land office as now administered protects the man who went on the land under these circumstances and as a paid informer and strikes down the man who lived there as an honest settler for years and helped to contribute to the growth and development of the country and to the making of a home for himself and family it is against such wrongs that we protest is there anything unjust in what the senate proposes is there anything unreasonable is there anything which should not meet the approval of the house i think not there is much we would like to say in speaking of the situation there so as to impress upon the attention of this house the wrongs perpetrated upon the settlers which we by this legislation propose to remedy and correct i like my colleague was not in favor of the repeal of the preemption law i thought it was that law which gave to these great western communities their thrift their prosperity their wonderful development i knew there were thousands of acres which never would be taken under the homestead law i knew the man who went there to make his home preferred generally speaking to secure title to his land in six months in order that he might have some credit at the country stores and with his neighbors and in order that he might have his land taxed and contribute to the growth of the community and especially that he might if misfortune befell him be able to sell his home for something and save something from his misfortunes i knew they were anxious to have that preemption law retained but the house and senate have virtually decided it shall be repealed and we only ask in connection with the repeal of these laws this manifestly just and reasonable legislation we are now contending for not one cattle syndicate as suggested is here protesting against the general land office they are not disturbed so far as i know for them a special immunity seems to be given it is the honest settler the man who claims merely 160 acres of land who is poor and unable to reach the court personally that is crying against these decisions and arbitrary practices and praying that some legislation shall be passed which will give him some immunity and some security to his home these cattle syndicates of which so much is said did not obtain their land under the preemption or timberculture laws but generally in direct violation of all statutes they made their selections and then surrounded their inclosures with wire fences and bid defiance to settlers and government they did this in violation of the law and in defiance of the rulings of the general land office and if they are not removed it is because this administration refuses to carry out the law of congress which directs that these inclosures and wire fences shall be stricken down and the lands so wrongfully occupied restored to the public domain and opened to the honest settlers of the country it is not for these cattle syndicates we speak but for the pioneer the honest preemptor and homesteader the bona fide purchaser the home and the family that we are pleading and speaking today as i was observing there is much we would like to say on this subject but in doing so we would take more time than can be given to us at this late day of the session now some of these landgrant railroad companies really want this legislation i do not mean the legislation protecting the innocent purchaser and settler but the legislation advocated by the majority here because it will be just what they want where there is no law by which settlers on the public lands can enter or obtain title except under the homestead law ihundreds and thousands will go to these landgrant railroad companies who have land to sell and buy lands from them because byso doing they can pay cash and obtain in abrief time a title to their homes one word more the senate bill also provides that where there is no suggestion of fraud for two years after final proof where no accusation is made within such time by the government or others that the settler violated the law in making his proof and establishing his claim the same shall be confirmed to him or to his heirs by the commissioner of the general land office and shall not thereafter be disturbed is that wrong would you have the homesteader live there more than seven years conforming to the laws of the country making his improvements doing all he could for the development of the country befbre the land shall be confirmed to him i appeal only for this as against the

virtues in the brief time allowed it will be impossible to even allude to the many important acts of his busy and eventful life much has been said in the press in the senate chamber and in public meetings held all over the country since his death in refer ence to his character and public services i feel that i can scarcely add anything of interest on this occasion i saw him for the first time in january 1857 just thirty years ago he was then a member of the house of representatives of the state of illinois and i was a student at illinois college at jacksonville i had visited springfield to witness the inauguration of gov william h bissell when i entered the legislative hall the youthful and impetuous logan was speaking he at once arrested my attention i have never forgotten the scene there was great interest manifested and party spirit ran high he seemed to move upon his political foes as if charging an enemy upon a field of battle his speech occupied two days in delivery and in severity of language and vehemence of manner excelled perhaps all other efforts of his life he was one of the leaders of the democratic party in the legislature and had been selected by his friends as the orator for the occasion governor bissell had been a prominent democrat but had differed with his party on the kansas and nebraska bills he became the candidate of the republicans for governor and was elected he was a man of great ability and his candidacy had resulted in a political campaign of unprecedented acrimony and bitter invectives the heated discussions before the people were carried into the legislature when the motion was made to print 20 000 copies of governor bissells message logan moved to amend so as to provide for printing but half the usual number the debate lasted more than a week and was one of the most memorable ever witnessed in the state which is noted for great political contests the body was democratic and logans motion prevailed from that time forward his reputation as a party leader was established during the thirty years which have elapsed he has occupied a prominent position in state and national affairs he passed at once from the arena of state politics to the councils of the nation he was elected a representative in congress from the ninth congressional district in 1858 receiving 15 878 votes while his opponent david l phillips received but 2 796 the political contest of that year 1858 was one memorable in the historyof illinois and provoked the liveliest interest throughout the whole country it was during this campaign that the joint debates between abraham lincoln and stephen a douglas occurred the result of which was the reelection of douglas to the senate and the election of lincoln in 1860 to the presidency of the united states in this great contest logan was a conspicuous figure and one of the staunchest supporters of senator douglas in 1860 logan was a candidate for reelection and his growing popularity was evinced by the increased vote he received namely 20 863 while his opponent received but 5 207 votes he resigned his seat in congress in 1861 and entered the army as colonel of an illinois regiment by regular promotions forgallant and meritorious conduct he reached the rank of majorgeneral his military record is one of the most brilliant of the late war had he been educated at west point and thus relieved from the prejudice which existed in the regular army against volunteer generals there is little doubt that he would have risen to the chief command of the army but he did not need the training and learning of west point to make him a soldier he was a born soldier his practical training as a soldier in the mexican war and his careful study of military history and the science of war had peculiarly fitted him for a great military leader he could not only command men but he could obey the commands of his superiors he believed in military discipline when general sherman denied him the command of the army of the tennessee before atlanta a position which his skill and bravery had won for him he cheerfully submitted and urged his friends to makeno complaints or protests i can not follow him in all his battles during the long and eventful war suffice it to say that he shrank from no hardship he feared no danger he faltered in nothing beloved by his men and respected by his fellowofficers he won the admiration of thepeople and his memory will be cherished by his countrymen for all time to come he was a careful student of military history those whose pleasure it was to converse with him were struck with his wonderful fund of information in regard to the events of the war he could readily point out the positions of the opposing forces in every battle during the late war he could give the numbers and regiments engaged in every important battle and indicate the casulties on either side he frequently conversed after the close of the war with the leaders in the confederate army and notably with general longstreet with whom be was on intimate and friendly terms the last book he ever read was the memoirs of general lee much of these memoirs was read to general logan by his secretary during his last illness he never failed to detect an error and point it out at the time he read military history with the liveliest interest in his investigation of the fitzjohn porter case he carefully read and reread every scrap of testimony every report and all contemporaneous history in order to completely master the subject after the close of the war be was again reelected as a representative in congress serving in the fortieth and fortyfirst congresses he was three times elected united states senator from the state of illinois and had served not quite two years of his last term when he died his career as a statesman is scarcely less brilliant than that as a soldier his was a busy life whether in war or in peace he was always doing something his energy and power of endurance were wonderful the amount of mental labor which lie performed was enough to wreck the stoutest physique in his congressional duties he was untiring and ever vigilant his correspondence was enormous but he managed to give attention to every demand upon him the soldiers of thelate war had in senator logan a most faithful and devoted friend they never appealed to him in vain they seemed to look to him for all general and special legislation in their behalf in his death they lost their ablest advocate and truest friend i leave to others more in sympathy with his political views than myself to speak more at length and more appropriately of his public record i desire to refer briefly to his private virtues he was a most devoted husband and father his home was his place of greatest happiness he was kind to his wife indulgent to his children and devoted to them all his domestic life was a model of simplicity freed from the cares of official duties he hastened to his home always to receive the greetings of a beloved wife and happy ehildren his greatest enjoyment was at his own fireside surroundedby his family here he lost all of the cares of the world laid aside all the vexations of political contests shut out the pomp and circumstance of official station and gave himself up to domestic affairs he spent his evenings at home he rarely visited the clubs or places of public amusement his family his library and fireside were more attractive to him than the pleasures of the outside world general logans devotion to his mother and family was a marked characteristic inheriting his fathers warm heart and dauntless courage and his mothers unbending dignity singleness of purpose and untiring energy he was the embodiment of the finest qualities that go to make up a truly noble character and one worthy of emulation his father had so high an opinion of his genius and ability that he said in his will that he left john nothing as he knew he would succeed in life and carve out his own fortune and right well did he fulfill the predictions of his father his powers of endurance were marvelous his sympathies easily touched once during grants administration among the numbers calling one morning for help from general logan to procure situations c was a little boy about fourteen years old upon general logan saying to him my boy what can i do for you he replied general i am a soldiers orphan and i wish to get an appointment either as midshipman at annapolis or a cadet at west point the general inquired who have you to indorse you i know nothing about you the boy answered i have only my fathers record in the war and my widowed and good mother but general if you will do this i will surely prove worthy i am going to succeed or die the general told the boy to meet him at the white house the following morning and it is needless to add the boy got his appointment and is now an officer in the army the boys vim and honesty won the generals confidence and sympathy again one morning a young girl presented herself with the numbers that came every morning during general logans whole official life she said general i come to you without one single thing to support my statements and depending solely upon your kindness and sympathy but i am desperate my mother is dying of consumption she formerly worked in the printing and engraving bureau for the support of herself my little brother and myself but she has been lying for weeks near death and we havepawned almost everything to get her medicine and food i must do something frail as i am and i beg you to help me i could not see my mother die and not have made this effort to help her she could even die contented could she know that i had something to do to earn something for brother and myself i the generals great eyes filled with tears and he told her to go to the printing office the following morning and he hoped he could get the public printer to give her work it was done and that frail girl has ever since earned an honest living for that brother and herself having laid away that sainted mother soon after obtaining her position among the first floral tributes laid upon logans bier bore the modest card of that grateful girl who feels that in logans death the best friend of the unfortunate had gone to his reward aggressive intense and relentless in the discharge of every duty justice was so ground in his nature that it could not be warped by partisanship his maguanimity was one of the finest traits in his characterever ready to forgive and even forget an injury trustful and sincere in all his friendships he was frequently called upon to regret the bad faith of those he trusted in such cases he grieved as if death instead of treachery had robbed him of his friend there was nothing honorable he would not do to serve those who had befriended him but when those whom he had befriended turned upon him or betrayed him his mortification knew no bounds nothing seemed so base to him as ingratitude this he felt as the most unkindest cut of all it was to him more strong than traitors arms and quite vanquished him always true to others he expected and exacted fidelity in return much has been said in reference to general logans courage his courage was never questioned it was prompted by honor and principle and not born of brute force as exemplified in the correspondence and his conduct when challenged to fight a duel by a member of this house a few years ago he did not feel called upon to accept the challenge in order to prove his courage but regarding the code duello as a relic of barbarism he treated the challenge with deserved contempt he was sensitive to public criticisms his last days were rendered unhappy and his ailments undoubtedly aggravated by newspaper assaults upon his motives arid official conduct when one reads the eulogies pronounced upon his life and character by his colleagues in the senate it is almost incredible that such a man as logan had been so recently subjected to such cruel assaults as were from day to day published by newspapers having large circulation and great powers for inflicting wrong

the last thirty years like lincoln his heart and hands were ever for the people he came up from the ranks of the people believed in the purity and integrity of the masses and was always ready and eager to speak for them he was a true republican and believed firmly in republican government he despised tyranny in all its forms wherever he found it he was always true to his convictions and to his friends and no power or influence could induce him to forsake either senator morgan of alabama said he was a true husband a true father a true friend and when that is said of a man and you can add to

generous friendship and affection for those with whom he is thrown and so in the midst of a career that had been so honorable in every branch of the public service end with just ambitions and just powers to a yet longer life of great public usefulness he disappears from among usnot deadpromoted as i think leaving us to mourn not his departure for his sake but that the value of his conspicuous example the strength of his conspicuous experience in public affairs and the wisdom of his counsels have been withdrawn senator manderson of nebraska said he originated the everbeautiful memorial day and constantly urged its observance it was a revelation to many that this sturdy soldier should have conceived the poetic idea that the graves of the union dead should receive their yearly tribute of flowers the thought was born of his love for them there was much that was refined beneath the bold frank exterior the bravest are the tenderest the loving are the daring a friend who knew him well writes of him his domestic life was an exquisite idyl it was fragrant with faith and tenderness it was a poem whose rhythm was never marred senator allison of iowa said lie never knowingly did an injustice to his associates and if he found that he had done so unconsciously he was swift and ready to make reparation he was conscientious in the discharge of his public duties in his death the nation has lost one of its ablest counselors his comrades in the army one of their most ardent and devoted supporters we in this chamber a valued coworker and friend senator hawley of connecticut said he was generous he was frank he was tender possibly that will sound strangely to many people who did not know him as we did he had as tender a heart as entered these doors he was one of the bravest men physically and morally that ever lived he was a brilliant and great volunteer soldier he was an incorruptible citizen and legislator his patriotism was unsurpassed in enthusiasm intensity and faith senator spooner of wisconsin said he will live sir in the hearts of men until tie history of his time shall have faded utterly away with each returning may wherever there is a soldiers graveand

background of the past quarter of a century none will be regarded with more affection and interest than that sturdy and intrepid form portrayed in silhouette clear cut and pronounced in its outlines

and inspiration of the youth of the future senator farwell of illinois said general logan was the bravest of soldiers an able statesman and an honest man no higher tribute can be paid to man than this and this is the offering which i bring the late president of the united states general grant said to me that he could never forget general logans great services to his country in battle always brave never faltering always ready lie is greatest who serves his country best and shall we not class him as one of these such are the tributes paid senator logan by those who knew him best such testimonials coming from honorable senators representing all sections and political parties will form the aggregate judgment of his times and fix the estimate in which he will be held by future generations one would have supposed that a senator from a great state who had been prominently beibre the public for thirty years and whose character as set forth by his senatorial colleagues and associates was well known to the country would have been free from the ordinary abuse and reckless denunciation which is so frequently heaped upon those who are less known and less appreciated but not so in this land of ours which boasts the freedom of the press as one of the chief characteristics of our free institutions there are those who for the sake of publishing sensational matter or to gratify disappointed ambition or revenge imaginary neglect are ready to assassinate the characters of the purest and the best of our public men but such assaults only serve to attract attention to the baseness of their authors and can no more damage the character of a man like logan than they could fix a stigma upon lincoln or upon washington the father of his country nothing can be said to add to the fame or greatness of our departed friend his work is done his race is run he sleeps the sleep that knows no waking but his works will live after him adown the pathway of time coming generations will read of his deeds of courage of his devotion to the public weal of his love for his mother his wife his children and country and wonder as the years glide by whether they will ever behold his like again ri adams of illinois logan will be regarded as the most striking figure of our civil war he was the greatest of the union volunteers as such he will stand in history as such he will be eulogized today his eulogy perhaps would come more fittingly from his comrades in arms of whom there are many in this house but his fame belongs to all of us and each of us who knew him either in the army or in civil life may well desire to pay a tribute to his memory it might not be appropriate for me to attempt to analyze his character as a military commander that he was great in tactics or strategy i know too little of tactics and strategy to say and it may be that his military career does not afford material enough to enable even a military critic to judge whether he would have been a great commander in the sense in which cromwell and napoleon were great his military fame will rest and rest securely on other grounds he was the loved and trusted volunteer leader of volunteers the citizen soldiers of the northwest enlisted in a war for the preservation of the union were ready to follow him to the death because they knew that his courage like theirs was neither contempt of life nor disregard of danger nor thirst for mere military glory it was the courage of patriotism not less ardent because thoughtful which places the life of the citizen at the service of the state in peace as well as in war and regards military service only as a part of that larger service which the citizen owes at all times to the republic which shelters him and his children macaulay speaking of the famous army of the long parliament says these persons sober moral diligent and accustomed to reflect had been induced to take up arms not by the pressure of want not by the love of novelty and license not by the arts of recruiting officers but by religious and political zeal mingled with the desire of distinction and promotion the boast of the soldiers was as we find it recorded in their solemn resolutions that they had not been forced into the service nor had enlisted chiefly for the sake of lucre that they were no janizaries but freeborn englishman who had of their own accord put their lives in jeopardy for the liberty and religion of england and whose right and duty it was to watch over the welfare of the nation which they had saved such in the main were the volunteers of our civil war and such in a high degree were the regiments of the northwestern states who made up the famous fifteenth corps they were nmore effective perhaps as a military force under the command of logan than they would have been under a merely professional soldier they recognized in him not merely an accomplished commander but a fellowcitizen and a friend whose hopes feelings and purposes accorded with their own as they knew that he would spare neither them nor himself in the service of the union so they knew that he would expose them to no unnecessary danger or sacrifice their lives to his own military ambition therefore it was that after his troops had come to understand his character as a commander a regiment under his lead seemed sometimes to become a brigade a brigade seemed to have the strength of a division and wheresoever logan thought it his duty to lead fifteen thousand thinking bayonets were ready to follow history will take no leaf from the laurels which logan won in the civil war because he was reluctant to believe that civil war was necessary no man can impugn his patriotism because at the time when others were preparing fbr the conflict which they saw was inevitable logan still hoped against hope that some form of compromise might yet take away the bitter cup from the lips of the nation wendell phillips said in april 1861 civil war is a momentous evil it needs the soundest most solemn justification i rejoice before god today for every word that i have spoken counseling peace but i rejoice also with an especially profound gratitude that now the first time in my antislavery life i speak under the stars and stripes and welcome the tread of massachusetts men marshaled for war it was not given to all in those dark days to look through the rising clouds of civil war and see in the clear light beyond the slaves enfranchised and the union stronger than before by the removal of the great cause of difference between the sections it was not given to logan to see this to him also civil war was a momentous evil and he did not see in civil war as wendell phillips did a possible solution of the slavery question till the clash of arms actually came till the exultation and humiliation of a great battle had inflamed all hearts he thought he saw only a minority of secessionists at the south and a minority of abolitionists at the north striving to kindle their own frenzy in the hearts of the great majority of unionloving men in both sections of the country you gallant union men it the southsaid hewho are standing against a fierce and bitter storm if nothing be done to calm it and you are hurled over the precipice into the deep yawning gulf of disunion for your heroic stand in this fearful crisis history will immortalize your names and your children will read with illuminated faces the faithful sketch of your patriotic devotion to your country perhaps we must admit that for months after the fall of fort sumter logan doubted whether the union could be restored by force of arms he had said so in congress the enforcement of the law at the point of the bayonet will not cement this union again it will not make us friends nor will it settle the slavery question he probably did not believe that the north would endure the sacrifices of a long war nor did he believe that the rebellion would yield without a desperate struggle to him therefore the actual clash of arms between the union and the rebel forces seemed to mark the beginning of an eternal estrangement between the north and south which time would only embitter influenced as he was by forebodings felt at the same time by thousands of others in all sections of the country it was not to be expected that he should have given a cordial support to the war policy of the lincoln administration but the time came when logans attitude toward the administration of mr lincoln and his war policy changed as if in the twinkling of an eye it was by no elaborate course of reasoning it was by a sudden flash of insight that he saw that the war was inevitable and that the north was resolved he saw he understood he obeyed as unhesitatingly as did the apostle to the gentiles when he beheld the great light that shone on the way to damascus and heard the voice crying saul saul ii he stood one morning in washington and saw the regiments from the northwestern states his own section of the country march by him on their way to the front to take part in the impending battle of bull run the sight struck home upon his heart and his understanding like a revelation from heaven the volunteers of wisconsin and minnesota made him think perhaps of the volunteers of illinois then far to the front in the mississippi valley perhaps he thought of the mexican war and the gallant part which his own state had borne in it of shields at cerro gordo of bissell and hardin and the steady valor of the illinois line when they fhced an enemy fbr the first time on the plateau of buena vista in these raw troops now marching by fresh from the farms of wisconsin and the lumber camps of minnesota he saw the loyal north in arms resolved to maintain the union and he now knew for the first time that the only way to enduring peace must he hewed with the sword he saw his own duty also he could thank god as wendell phillips had for every word he had spoken counseling peace but his heart told him that henceforth the only place of honor and duty for him the only place where his spirit could be at peace with itself would be in the camp or on the march or in the line of battle with the volunteers of illinois he did not hesitate to restore the union he put upon the hazard not only life and fortune as others did but what was perhaps far more to him his darling popularity he went into his district he made as brave a charge upon the prejudices of southern illinois as he ever made upon the confederate lines he made his people see what lie had seen on that july morning in washington that the safety of the great republic the freedom and happiness of millions yet unborn in the south as well as in the north must be sought by the dreadful path of civil war thus the first service which logan rendered in the war for the union was a victory won by his eloquent tongue before he had drawn his sword the very mensaid general grantwho at first made it necessary to guard the roads of southern illinois becane the defenders of thve union his district which at first had promised to give such trouble to the government filled every call made upon it for troops without resorting to the draft that congressional district stands credited at the war department today with furnishing more men for the army than it was called upon to supply i shall not try to recount logans military services in the union cause during the next four years there are many others in this house more competent than i to recall the history of those stirring events of which they were themselves a part let me however speak of that one of his many victories the glory of which brighter and more enduring than mere military renown he does not share with any man or regiment or army corps it was the victory which he won over his own feeling of disappointment and personal wrong when the command of the army of the tennessee was taken from him he had served with that army from belmont to the atlanta campaign he had risen through all grades from colonel to corps commander he had taken command of the army as general grant reminds us in the midst of a hotly contested battle his glance his voice his magnificent bearing had infused courage and discipline into dispirited and retreating troops under the influence of his personal presence they became steady in an instant a few minutes more and they were moving to victory like one of cromwells brigades with the precision of machines and the wild fanaticism of crusaders at logans call they pressed forward to avenge mcphersons death with such impetuous fury that eight thousand of the enemys dead and wounded were left upon the field logan had fairly won the right to command the army of the tennessee when this command so fairly won so eagerly desired was taken from him merely because he had received his military training at the rude hands of actual war and not amid the sheltered walks and tin lawns of a military academy his patriotism faltered indeed but it did not fail he was tempted to resign from the army what west point graduat could have blamed him if he had done so but he was true to himself and to the union he had sworn to defend perhaps he remembered the words he had spoken in 1862 i have entered the field to die if need be for the government and never expect to return to peaceful pursuits till the object of this war of preservation bas been accomplished he returned to the command of his army corps by his indefatigable zeal in a subordinate position he gave a living example of that doctrine of military fidelity which many years afterward he was to urge so eloquently in the senate that neither personal dislike nor personal disappointment could excuse a subordinate officer either for disobeying orders or for slackness in obeying them of logan as a legislator i have no time to speak faithful as he was to all his public duties it is not as a legislator that he will be remembered he accomplished much in congress but if he had accomplished more his fame would still rest on his military record and his military record for this generation at least is written not only in the annals of the campaigns in which he took part but in the hearts of tens of thousands of surviving volunteers of the war who have so long looked up to him as the bright exemplar of their own patriotism the record of which they will hand down as an honored heritage to their children and their childrens children one trait of logans character has attracted the attention of all who met him in public or private life he was a sincere and devoted friend of his friends and he was not the secret enemy of any man open straightforward sincerity in word and action was such a prominent characteristic of his demeanor toward friend and enemy alike that we may not unfairly apply to him the description which clarendon gives of the great duke of buckingham his kindness and affection to his friends was so vehement that it was as so many marriages for better and worse and so many leagues offensive and defensive as if he thought himself obliged to love all his friends and to make war upon all they were angry with let the cause be what it would and it can not be denied that he was an enemy in the same excess and prosecuted those he looked upon as his enemies with the utmost rigor and animosity and was not easily induced to a reconciliation and yet there are some examples of his receding in that particular and in the highest passion he was so far from stooping to any dissimulation whereby his displeasure might be concealed and covered till he had attained his revenge the low method of courts that he never endeavored to do any man an ill office before he first told him what he was to expectfrom him and reproached him with the injuries he had done with so much generosity that the person found it in his power to receive further satisfaction in the way he would choose for himself when a great man dies in the maturity of his intellectual powers before he has even reached the threshold of old age we are apt to deplore not merely our loss but his own we are apt to regret as a loss to him as well as to ourselves the many years of usefulness and comparative comfort which he might yet have enjoyed the feeling is not always a reasonable one who can tell whether logans old age would have been a happy one some men there are like washington at mount vernon like jefferson at monticello who after a life of active participation in public affairs can quietly withdraw from the current of events and spend their declining years in private life watching the gradual decay of bodily strength and mental vigor with the same calm resignation and even with the same sober happiness with which they watch the lengthening shadows at the close of a summer day such an old age is not the common lot of public men it is possible only to a few we can not be sure that it would have been logans lot had he been spared to live out his three score years and ten his life almost from boyhood had been one of political activity would he have been content like washington to resign lifes active duties at the inexorable bidding of advancing age he was not sure even of bodily health the fatigues the wounds the exposures of the war had begun already to tell upon his constitution for him perhaps it is better as it is his death is our loss rather than his own better perhaps for this keen ambitious spirit to pass from life in the full maturity of his mental powers his career not yet completed the last and

i am not in sympathy with the majority of the committee in the advocacy of this bill whenever any effort is to be made to apply a remedy it seems to me that the first thing to do is to seek to know the evils that are to be remedied i have listened to what has been said on the subject of reorganization of the navy department on this floor i heard and have tried carefully to analyze the testimony that was produced before the committee to show the evils that exist in the navy department the material portions of which have been read in the hearing of this committee and i think it will not be disputed by any member of the committee that the testimony shows those evils to be simply the accumulation of large quantities of stores in the different government depositories belonging to the navy department and the duplication of machine shops and other works in thenavyyards if these are the evils then there is only one feature of this bill which applies to them the feature in relation to the purchase and distribution of supplies and i think this committee will bear me out in saying not only that there is power in the secretary of the navy under existing law to correct them but that he in fact is correcting them today he has provided a system by which all purchases are to be made and by which all purchases when made are to be distributed to the respective bureaus that power is in the secretary today the present secretary is putting it in actual operation and secretary chandler recognized the ikct of its existence when he issued an order to chief constructor wilson commanding him to make the necessary changes in the respective yards in that case commander wilson in his reply conceded the power of the secretary of the navy and simply gave reasons why what the secretary desired should not be done those reasons were satisfactory to secretary chandler and he did not enforce the order not however from lack of power to do so under that order of the secretary and under the admission of the chief constructor then and under the actual operation and working of the department at this time that power is admitted to exist if that be so then the existence of these evils becomes simply a question of maladministration what is the remedy why sir there is a remedy today it is not to change but to enforce the law and exercise the power now possessed the accumulation of these stores probably has grown out of the fact that during the last twenty to twentyfive years there has been an enormous increase in the amount of supplies needed in the navy and an enormous draft upon the navy in short this accumulation of surplus stores is an outgrowth of the great war through which we have passed and because the purchase of them was not properly watched under the system now adopted by the secretary of the navy all supplies will be purchased through one agency and distributed through one agency and there will be no difficulty whatever in getting them jnst when they are wanted and there will be no unnecessary accumulation therefore the existing law is snfficient for the remedy of these evils however if the bill for the reconstruction of the navy department stopped there i should have no hesitancy in supporting it but it does not stop there it takes hold of a system which has grown up during the last fortyfour years that system has grown up under whig under democratic and under republican administrations it has crystallized under the logic of necessity and of fact secretary whitney in his report to the first session of the fortyninth congress gave the following history of the transitions in the navy department organization historically it is a fact that up to the time that the present bureau system was created in 1842 and for some time thereafter the american navy though inferior in numbers to the navies of some other countries was as formidable as any for its tonnage and seems to have contributed to and appropriated inprovements in the art of naval warfare as largely and as rapidly as any other naval power during the thirty years between the close of the war of 1912 and the commencement of the mexican war our naval force increased fiftyfold and the navies of no other power were sunerior to it except in the number of their vessels as respects the navies of this hemisphere it was supreme the united marines of all the rest of this continent being unable to contend against it for an hour coopers naval history preface prior to 1842 the business of the department had been managed by a board of naval commissioners and the result of my reading leads me to the conclusion that while the affairs of the department were intelligently administered so far as the general scope of the conduct of its affairs was concerned yet the system failed in executive force in 1839 congress called upon the secretary of the navy by resolution to propose a plan of reorganization embracing a division of the duties performed by the board of naval commissioners and their assignment to separate bureaus in compliance with this resolution the secretary reported in december 1839 a system and in 1812 bureauswith independent heads were firstestablished it was quite evident that with the application of steam to naval vessels a new problem and one which has been greatly multiplied since by the constant progress of arts had been brought to the department for solution the secretary says should the introduction of steam as an auxiliary to naval warfare be sanctioned by the results of experience it must be obvious that new and very important duties will devolve oi the secretary of the navy rendering the aid of professional science and experience still more indispensable in the adininistration of the department up to that time a naval commission composed of naval officers without responsible executive heads subordinate to them had resulted for a long time satisfactorily but finally had failed with the accumulation of labor and with the problems which science had thrown upon the department history discloses the fact therefore that no political parky can justly claim credit for the present organization of the navy department and the question is in nowise a party question a democratic congress in 1839 by a resolution called upon james k paulding the then democratic secretary of the navy for a plan of organization the secretary reported the present bureau system which in 1842 under the then secretary of the navy abel p upshur was put into operation and constituted the framework of our present system from that time until the present under the administrations of presidents tyler polk taylor fillmore pierce buchanan lincoln johnson grant hayes garfield and arthur embracing every shade of political opinion this system has been enlarged and perfected by the wisdom and experience of these successive administrations as the necessities of our national life demanded it has the additional recomnendation of having been tested and approved by one of the most gigantic wars ever waged in human annals well may it be said therefore that it is the ohtgrowth of the wisdom and experience of all these years the child of no political party but a system inherited by us from the statesmen and not the politicians of the past this system was ably urged upon congress in 1841 by matthew f maury who was one of the most distinguished ofalltheofficers who have graced the american navy and his articles in the southern literary messenger for that year are acknowledged to have been comprehensive and exhaustive treatises on that subject it seems to me therefore in the light of the foregoing history that there is a lack of statesmanship in the effort apparently made by some members to drag this subject down into the turgid pool of politics we should therefore hesitate to take that structure thus built up tested by experience although it be blotted here and there by occasional excesswe should hesitate to take that structure and at one fell swoop strike it out of existence and venture at once upon the broad sea of experiment i beg this committee to remember for a moment and say whether there has been adduced here in behalf of this measure any other argumient than simply this accumulation of stores and duplication of plants if that can be remedied by the secretaryif he is doing it nowwhy make this radical sweeping change in the whole organization of the system it is saidand i regret exceedingly that my friend from connecticut who is usually so fair did not give us the whole report of engineerinchief loringit is said that mr loring recommended this reconstruction of the navy department permit me to say that he did no such thing te did advocate the removal of administrative abuses in the system he did in speaking of the navyyards say that the reform must begin with the navy department that is that the secretary of the navy himself must make the order which would reform the evil in fairness why not state in full what mr loring did say hisjposition today is consistent with his position at that time i am not his defender it is only justice to him to say that he does not occupy any different position today from what he did then at the end of that report he says that the consummation of the desirable end of which he speaks need not necessarily change the general character of the organization of the department mr loring and those who joined him in making that report rear admiral luce and mr mullett say that the reforms to be worked out in the navyyards do not involve a change in the structure of the navy department yet my friend from connecticut would have you believe that those officers advocated a change in the structure of that department my objection goes farther than this point i can not recognize this proposed change as one conducive to economy it is advocated upon that ground but do you economize by abolishing eight bureaus and practically substituting nine for that is the effect of this bill do you economize by adding to the navy department new officers as heads of bureaus or divisions whose pay will amount to more than 8 000 for as i understand upon a careful computation the additional lorce provided for in this bill will involve an expense of about 8 500 this is not legislation in the line of economy again it is urged that this change will enable us to fix responsibility this claim it seems to me is not sustained by an examination of the provisions of the bill how does it tend to fix responsibility under the present system there are eight heads of bureaus responsible directly to their chief the secretary of the navy by this bill you propose to abolish four of these bureaus and you propose to place between the secretary of the navy and the great divisions of construction and steam engineeringthe two greatest divisions in your navysome intermediary so that whenever the head of one of these divisions skilled in his department wants to communicate with the secretary of the navy he must do it through an intermediate officer you remove from the secretary of the navy by one additional step the skilled men who should be in iramediate contact with him you divide responsibility while you concentrate power you put it within the power of the officer who is to preside over that bureau to remove at will the skilled engineer or skilled constructor a nman whose whole life perhaps has been spent in acquiring peculiar fitness for his duty and the officer who is to exercise this power may be a mere politiciana mere figurehead lassume that he certainly can not be skilled in the business of both these departments for i need not say to this intelligent body that a man to become a thoroughly skilled engineer or a thoroughly skilled constructor of hulls must devote his whole life to his specialty between the secretary of the navy and these skilled men who should have immediate and direct communication with their chief you interposewhom a man through whom everything must be filtered before it can reach the car of the secretary can it be said that the man who will thus be placed over these two great divisions will be thoroughly skilled in both steam engineering and in construction such a man does not exist if the intermediary have a smattering of both of these professions the link between the skilled head of division and the secretary of the navy would be incompetent to fairly transmit the needed intelligence if he be skilled in one and not in the other branch the medium in the unskilled branch will be alike defective in either case a premium would be placed upon incompetency and ignorance not intelligence would be placed next to power you diffuse and scatter responsibility while you concentrate power i do not know that i can present this more clearly than i have done but let me illustrate how in my view instead of enabling the secretary of the navy to locate responsibility you divide it suppose that in a vessel which is being built there is some mistake in regard to the adaptation of the engine and the vessel to each other there are now but two men who can be responsibleeither the steam engineer or the constructor suppose you have between them and the secretary of the navy an intermediate officer then you will have three officers among whom the responsibility for the mistake will be divided i submit to this committee that the proposed change instead of making our vessels more perfect and beautiful will make it more difficult to secure their construction than is the case now again the theory of the bill is not perfect if a ship of war is worth anything she must be adapted not simply the engine to the hull and the hull to the engine but her ordnance must be fitted and adapted to both hull and engine yet you keep the ordnance bureau separate and distinct if you wish to carry out your hypothesis and put the construction of a warvessel under one great strong controlling mind why was an exception made in the case of the ordnance bureau but i can conceive of no such directing and controlling mind skilled in all branches of knowledge for the perfection and harmony of the construction of hull engine and boilers unless it be the almighty himself for there is no one upon the face of the green earth who at the same time is perfectly skilled in ordnance and in the construction of the hull and the building of the engine and in every other matter such a manskilled in all these branchesdoes not exist and never will if therefore your theory be worth anything there should be no exception to it in case of the ordnance department but on the contrary you must have the engine and boilers the hull the ordnance all provided for and harmonized and constructed under the control and by the direction of one man so that when the vessel shall be constructed and launched upon the ocean it will be perfectly fitted and adapted for the purposes of offense and defense now under your present system before one single stroke of work is done or any action is taken in reference to the construction of a war vessel plans and specifications have to be carefully prepared and when those plans and specifications have been approved after a most careful examination they are then placed in the hands of the respective officers for the execution of the details of the work they are put in the engineering shops for the purpose of constructing the engine precisely according to the plans and specifications which have been furnished the construction of the hull and its adaptation in every respect to the engine and the ordnance is placed in the hands of the constructor and he is bound to follow carefully the plans and specifications which are before him if there be any defect anywhere if the work be not done in accordance with the plans and specifications the responsibility for that defect can be located and placed upon the party who is guilty of it if it be the purpose to place all these departments under one man then so far as that control is concerned you have in this bill left out the ordnance which is an integral part of the complete war vessel indeed the unit of power and is also the primal consideration with the architect in designing the hull this committee can not place too great weight upon the consideration that today more depends upon the engineer who puts into the ship the engine which inspires it with throbbing and active life and which drives her with titanic force and withalmost lightning speed across the seas for the last fifty years the lines of beauty in the construction of our vessels have changed but little today we have advanced not far from the clipper model which sailed from out the port of baltiraore and became at once the mistress of the ocean today in the matter of hulls we are but little in advance of the men who upon our northern coast sent out vessels remarkable for their beauty speed and power but today the important man is the one who puts in the vessel the engine which drives it through the ocean that machine whose intricate delicacy and

of erring on the safe side on the side of economy this report as presented by the gentleman from kansas does not i think do to the soldier or the widow of the soldier whom it is intended to benefit the full justice to which she is entitled i say that the soldier who took all the risks of the war who went forth with his command who was found ever in the front who faced every phase of danger that it was possible for a soldier to find himself confronted with and who in addition to that went forth beyond and in front of his command and rescued from capture the colors of his regiment or his company valued as its standard of honor is entitled to a little distinction above one that simply stood in the ranks so far as i am concerned i make no question that the widows of those who have given their lives or have periled their lives in behalf of their country should be placed upon the same footing but i say do not give the higher rank the lower price but let us raise them to the same limit i remember a few evenings ago hearing the distinguished gentleman from indiana who has just preceded me say that so far as he was concernedand i understand he was a commissioned officer in the

it is impossible to now understandthe case as well as it was understood by those dealing with it at the time but i am coming to that more fully directly courtsmartial as i conceiveand i call the attention of every lawyer in the house to what i am about to saycourtsmartial as i conceive are founded and grounded in the very genius of our government and all that is essential to its integrity and in case of rebellion and war even more so than the civil courts by whose conservatism learning and wise adjudications liberty is preserved to and for the people and as to the character jurisdiction and powers of courtsmartial the constitution of the united states and the decisions of the supreme court place those tribunals military courts as a distinct and specific arm of the government fixed and immovable in their sphere and with whose jurisdiction and findings no other branch of the government has any right power or authority to interfere except by the exercise of that coordinate authority which is conferred by the provisions of the constitution for this purpose on the executive alone by the fifth article of amendment to the constitution of the united states it is declared thatno person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury exceptmark the language except in cases arising in the land or naval forces and says mr benet a high authority on this question the constitution therefore while expressly empowering congress to make rules for the government of the land and naval forces expressly excepts the trial of cases arising in the land or naval service from the ordinary provisions of law did not fitzjohn porters case arise in the land service is it not one of the cases which the constitution itself expressly excepts and transfers from the civil courts and gives jurisdiction over to courtsmartial what are the ordinary provisions of law and what does the constitution mean by expressly excepting cases arising in the land and naval forces from those provisions of law there was and there could be but one purpose contemplated by the framers of this constitutional provision this inhibition and exception bearing directly upon the jurisdiction of courtsmartial and that purpose was and is to give to those courts absolute and exclusive jurisdiction to try and determine pronounce judgment of acquittal or of guilt and affix punishment in such cases and to make the action of a courtmartial when concluded and executed according to the law governing such proceedings final and beyond the reach or interference or review of any other tribunal or branch of the government except the executive as prescribed by the constitution and the laws and accordingly says the same high authority already quotedoh ye constitutional sticklers listen to what this high authority says no doubt no doubt is intimated in any of the books of our law as to the competency and completeness of the jurisdiction of courtsmartial in the cases and under the conditions provided by the articles of war fitzjohn porter was tried by and convicted in strict accordance with the laws of congress and the articles of war made in pursuance of laws enacted under this provision of the constitution and the findings and judgment of the tribunal that tried and convicted him are conclusive against all other departments of the government except in so far as the executive may have interfered by the exercise of his clemency or may hereafter interpose his executive powerthis deduction by this high authority is unanswerable it is too cleartoo logical absolutely conclusive of this case there is no answer to it courts whether civil or military are the guideboards to human liberty all that we have and all that we are depend upon loyalty to their decrees when pronounced according to law life liberty property the pursuit of happiness all depend in large and peculiar measure on the reverence and respect paid to the decrees of the courts of the country and that people are governed the wisest and the best where the largest degree of respect and reverence and veneration is given to the decrees of the judiciary when pronounced according to law and according to the view which i take of this question if it is competent for congress to overthrow either directly or indirectly by one means or another the findings and judgment of a courtmartial it is equally competent for congress in its legislative capacity in the exercise of the same authority to step in and take jurisdiction and overthrow and annul and destroy the effect of the judgment of any other judicial tribunal either civil or military this conclusion seems to me to be supported by both logic and sound law and such a principle once established would be absolutely destructive of the very fabric of government itself and does not the question come up and meetus right here does itnot stareus squarely in the facethe question whether the united states is a government of coordinate departments legislative executive and judicial constituting a unity in trinity each department independentinits own sphere or whether it is a government in which the supreme power is vested in the congress or a government in which the supreme power is vested in the legislative department subject only to the approval of the executive to establish and recognize such a principle in government would be to blot out the courts of the country destroy their power and erect here in the national capital a legislative despotism subject only to the executive may it not be inquired and will not the people inquire whether or not it is possible in this government of coordinate departments with checks and balances intended to give equilibrium to the whole that after one recognized and constitutional branch of the judiciary has pronounced judgment under the law in a case involving facts ascertained in accordance with the rules of law congress has the power and can reach out and take further jurisdiction of the same subjectmatter between the same parties and thus act upon and readjudicate and reversej udgment and dispose again of the very same question that strikes at the very foundation of the whole superstructure of our national authority and i insist that the idea of such apower existing in congress is supremely absurd and makes what should be a consistent and harmonious whole a jumble of confusion uncertainty and disorder let me recall attention to the structure of our government of the three coordinate departments the judicial is put last in the order of their creation by the constitution thus clearly signifying that those two are to rest on this one which is designed to interpret the law and enforce its mandates in obedience to those acts which have been approved by the executive after originating with the legislative under its constitutional authority as the first of the three coordinate departments in other words the intendment of the constitution was and is that these coordinate departments shall harmonize in the government of the country and that neither shall invade or trench upon the jurisdiction of the other the constitution authorizes and our laws providefor courtsmartial as i have already shown as clearly and definitely as they do for civil courts and if congress can reach out take hold of and readjudicate every question which may be disposed of by a courtmartial it may do the same with the judgments and decrees of every civil court in the land including the decisions of the supreme court of the united states the constitution granted the power congress exercised it by the enactment of laws establishing courtsmartial the executive approved those laws enacted under the authority of the constitution and thereby there was set in motion the machinery of the government by which to adjudicate all military disputes and to punish military offenses our supreme court has decided time and again that when all the powers of the government have been exercised there is no way to recall the decision and act upon the question again"], [0.0002009272575378418, 0.5002009272575378, 1, "i was
