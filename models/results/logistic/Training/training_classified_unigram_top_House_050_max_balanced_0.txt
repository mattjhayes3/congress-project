sugar its importation refining and consumption in connection with the present law the amendment proposed in the mills bill and the amendment which i have submitted without further introduction i will say that there are two ways or tests fixed by law and by the mills bill in levying and collecting the tariff upon sugar imported into the united states oneis by the dutch standard and the ather by the polariscope the dutch standard is a color test alone hnd pays no attention to the amount of saccharine matter on the one oand or adulteration on the other hand in the sugar while the polariscope pays no attention to the color of the sugar but ascertains the amonut of saccharine matter contained in the sugar imported i hold in my hand four small glass bottles filled with sugar of differerent colors prepared in holland and hence called the dutch standard the bottle containing the darkest colored sugar is labeled no 13 the next is labeled no 16 the next no 18 the next no 20 the law prior to 1883 provided that sugar of the color of no 13 dutch standard and below should pay a certain duty above no 13 and below 16 a higher duty that above no 16 and below no 20 a still higher duty and that above no 20 a still higher duty the sugar when imported was to be compared in color with that contained in the bottles and a duty levied upon it according toits color as tested bythe dutch standard this law worked very well as long as the sugarplanter and the importer were honest for if no artificial means were used the color of the sugar fairly indicated the amount of saccharine matter in it that is to say the more saccharine matter and the less dirt there was in it the whiter itwould be so the color fairlyindicated the saccharine strength of tle sugar but as the darkest sugar bad the least saccharine strength in it and paid the lowest duty dishonest men resorted to artificially coloring the sugar on the plantation so as to make a sugar with a very high per cent of saccharine matter in it of the color of no 13 or below and it then paid the lowest duty when in fact if they had not evaded the law they would have had to pay a higher rate of duty upon it they called it business i call it fratd and deceit after it was imported they would take it and put it through the cheap process of refining and have for a profit lte difference between the duty on no 13 and no 20 and above which profit amounted to largely over a cent a pound this fraud led to the enactment of the present law in 1883 by which it was enacted that all sugar imported not above no 13 dutch slandard in color testing by the polariscope not above seventyfive degreesthat is 75 per cent of saccharine strengthshould pay a duty of 1 4 cents a pound and fir each degree or fraction thereof in addition as shown by the polariscope four onehundredtlths of a cent per pound that woult make a pound of sugar that was all saccharine matterone hundred degreespay 2 4 cents a pound duty buton sugarsfromn no 13 to no 16 the duty was fixed at 2 cents a pound from no 16 to no 20 3 cents a pound and all sugars above no 20 at 3 cents a pound but the polariscope is not applied to any of these sugars above no 13 so the law of 1883 which is the present law does not correct the evil it was intended to correct let me ill tstrate i have here a pound of sugar known as cuba centrifugal imported by one of the assistant secretaries of state i ask members to look at it in color you will observe itis no 13 dutch standard but it is 96 percent saccharine strength now by ordintry treatment on the plantation it would have been at least as high as no 16incolor it is cal led centrifugalsugar audwas made by the vacuumpan process and then whirled about the pan with great velocity so as to throw off all sirup see itiscomposed of pure sugar crystals great care was taken iii making it by the use of an extra amount of lime to get it as low as no 13 in color for with that color and strength it only had to pay a duty of 2 24 cents a pound whereas if it had been above no 13 it would have had to pay a duty of 23 centsa pound audif over no 20 31 cents a pound what is the result the result is that practically no sugar is imported into this country except sugar no 13 dutch standard imd below a me ninem not 1 per cent is above that"], [0.02725815214216709, 0.02725815214216709, 0, "i move then pro forma to strike out the last word the cocoa bean is as i understand a product of south america the present duty upon it is 2 cents a pound when imported it is the basis of a growing manufacture in the part of the country from which i come the cocoa bean is coming into very considerable use in the manufacture of chocolate i do not understand therefore the propriety of putting the manufactured products of cocoa upon the freelist if this proposition he persisted in the manufacture of such products in this countryan industry which as i have said is of growing importance on the pacific coast and i think especially in the district of my colleague in front of mewill be entirely and irreparably broken down this branch of industry now gives employment to a considerable amount of capital and a large number of persons on the pacific coast the rates of freight as a matter of course enter into this question the raw product being manufactured upon the pacific side the heavy railroad freights are escaped and thus great advantage is enjoyed in the supply of that product to our portion of the country i suggest to the chairman of the ways and means committee and to the committee of the whole whether under existing circumstances it would not be just to except the manufactured article from the operation of this clause of the freelist the value of the import of cocoa bean into this country is put down at 126 543 the duty collected is 9 020 here is a feeble industry just coming into importance struggling for life it may employ ultimately a large amount of american capital and american labor it will be no detriment to the revenue to admit the crude cocoa free and no detriment to the public interest to continue the duty upon the manufactured article on the pacific coast as everywhere else people are affected very much by their private interests touch a nmls pocket and you are very apt to touch his judgment i think our friends on the other side have had recently a practical illustration of this matter iin the election in oregon the pending bill struck a blow at some of the most important industries of that state the people of oregon recognized this measure as affecting injuriously their interests what was the result a verdict against the democratic party which may have carried some little consternation into their camp i would remark to the chairman of the committee in connection with this item and other items which affect in a very material degree the interests of california that if they be persisted in california will follow in the same direction in the

to have answered by gentlemen who take the position assumed by the other side of this house with referenceto this bill and iwish tostate itso clearly that it can not be misunderstood by the gentleman from illinois who has agreed to answer it i wish to know upon what principlebecause i suppose that you are acting upon some principle in the preparation of a tariff bill like this and there is a wide distinction between a protective tariff and a revenue tariff as it is explained in the democratic speeches upon this subjectnow if there is any principle in the whole matter if you pretend to claim that any principle is involved in the preparation of the bill of course you will be able to answer my question i want to know upon what principle you defend that provision of the bill which imposes a duty of 1j cents per pound and on the best grades 11 cents per pound on sheetiron imported into this country while the same sheetiron if coated over with a thin wash of tin amounting to only from 2 to 3 or at most 4 or 5 per cent of tin may be imported free of any duty whatever i would like to know upon what principle you can explain this i would like to know upon what principle of right or justice a provision is incorporated into this bill putting this duty of 50 or 75 per cent on the naked sheetiron and no duty at all on the sheet coated with tin a high rate of duty on the advanced product and no duty on the raw material i or in other woids i want to know whether it is not the aim of this ways and means committee to strike down by indirection two important industries which they did not care to attack directly i refer to sheetiron and sheetsteel roofing and siding and also to the manufacture of sheetiron and sheetsteel i desire to know if this bill is not prepared with a view of secretly stabbing these two industries under the guise of professed friendship not a word is said about striking down any other industry and yet the stroke is as fatal as if this were the main object and it is this mysterious discrimination in favor of free tin and against free iron that i want explained this is not a small matter the entire annual product of the sheetiron and sheetsteel mills of this country is 150 000 tons onehalf of which or onethird of which at least is used in roofing and siding and if tinplate is placed upon the freelist as proposed by this bill this demand for sheetiron and sheetsteel will cease and this market for the products of these industries in this country will necessarily be destroyed tinplates will be substituted for iron and a freetrade product for a protected one this is too plain to require demonstration and the manufacturers of sheetiron and sheetsteel roofing and siding will by this method of indirection be stricken down and the industry destroyed as well as the manufacture of sheetiron and sheetsteel while on the other hand there are imported into this country annually 280 000 tons of tinplates almost twice as much as the entire product of all the sheetiron and sheetsteel mills in this country and all of this 280 000 tons of tinplates is to be permitted to come in free of duty under the provisions of this bill it is not to pay a farthing of revenue while the 150 000 tons of sheetiron or sheetsteel if it were imported all of it would have to pay a duty of at least 1 cents per pound now i repeat i can not understand this gross inconsistency nor can i understand why they are attempting to disturb these industries which are established and giving entire satisfaction and on behalf of the people of this country i protest against any such injustice and unfairness"], [0.03059074468910694, 0.03059074468910694, 0, "no not even if you put the duty up to 5 cents a pound i will tell you why i was in favor of a bounty on sugar and i am still in favor of it i was in favor of that bounty in the interest of california kansas and louisiana i did not want to deprive the industry in either of those states of the advantage which it is deriving now from the protective tariff i prefer giving that industry a bounty in those states in order that it may build itself up make itself a strong industry if it lies in the power of the people of this country to make it such but can it be made such since we have got down to this proposition i do not believe you will ever make the sugar industry in this country one that will supply the wants of the american people though you may place the tariff at 4 5 or 6 cents per pound and pay a bounty as large almost as you can think of a bounty of 4 or 5 cents a pound i do not believe it can be done in this country why because there is a law of nature intervening between that industry and its prosperity in this country which no act of congress can overrule i had occasion in 1883 being one of the very few members here who were in favor of free sugar to say that that was one thing settled so far as this matter is concerned by law of nature and no act of congress can overcome that law now take the case of florida cited by my colleague you plant cane in florida perhaps florida is more favored than louisiana i do not know whether it is or not but cane will live

said that a great while has been given to the question but i do not think that we have given it more time than it deserves the gentleman from mississippi has alluded to the fact that in the past there has been a great struggle in this house over the jurisdiction of the appropriations that was a question of vast consequence and it excited the house for years exactly what was accomplished as the result of that struggle is now for you in part to decide the appropriations for the support of this government are over 238 000 000 per annum and it is well sir when such large expenditures are to be made that each committee shall understand distinctly what it has in charge and that the house shall leave no appropriation committee in doubt upon that question it is because i believe it an important question that i have seen fit to raise this question of order it has been stated that the language in the rule in reference to the indian appropriation bill is different from that in relation to other appropriation bills it reads to the relations of the united states with the indians and the indian tribes including the appropriations therefor i i the present bill reads a bill making appropriations for the current and contingent expenses of the indian department and for fulfilling treaty stipulations with various indian tribes i that identical language is the language used in the title of the appropriation bill before the separation and the language used in reference to the assignment of the work of appropriation will be found to be in harmony in idea with the language in the rule now then if the language of this appropriation bill is the same as it was befbre the separation of the bill then it would seem that the housein adopting this language in the rule had no other purpose than to define that duty until these new rules were adopted there never was any rule giving the committee on indian affairs jurisdiction of appropriations for the support of the indian service their jurisdiction related solely in the past to the relations of the united states to the indian tribes and the bill was as i have stated so in reference to postal appropriations the language used was the language used in the bill today if we are really seeking the purpose of the house we need not take up this bill and play upon the language when we have the history of the legislation of this house distinctly under this language carrying judgments even in relation to the indian tribes to the sundry civil appropriation bill there never was in the debates on this question a single expression showing a purpose to take judgments relating to the indian tribes away from the committee on appropriations therefore it seems to me no inference can be drawn from this language taken by itself you will not stop here you will take the language of these several rules you will go back to prior appropriation bills and see when such language as this was used what the house then meant you will thus ascertain what the house intended when it took from the committee on appropriations these appropriations for the indian service and gave them to the committee on indian affairs my friend from arkansas has seen fit to allude to a discussion on this floor between the gentleman from pennsylvania and the gentleman from alabama in relation to the question where an appropriation for yards and docks belonged it seemed that my friend from pennsylvania was perfectly willing to unload a large amount of his bill upon my friend from alabama who was trying to push it back but finally the gentleman from alabama yielded and agreed to take it that is about all there is in that discussion the question of the construction of the rule was never passed upon by the chair at all those gentlemen settled the trouble amicably between themselves and the matter has no place in a construction of this rule it is assumed that this bill by its very title is a bill providing ibr fulfilling treaty stipulations with various indian tribes that this claim is a judgment growing out of a treaty and therebre the committee on indian affairs had jurisdiction this argumuent is not confined to judgments and by the same process of construction these gentlemen hereafter need not wait for the judgment of a court but may take up any treaty made with any indian tribe and bring it into the house with their construction and propose any appropriation they see fit i ask you sir whether it was ever the purpose of this house which has been so careful to keep anything like legislative power or legislative construction from the committees on appropriations of this house whether it was ever designed to give to the conmittee on indian affairs a right to construe treaties and to put appropriations into the indian bill in virtue of such construction that is the logic of the position assumed i do not believe that the present occupant of the chair is willing to go along with those gentlemen to the conclusion they have reached and give it the solemn sanction of a ruling by the chairman of the committee of the whole of the house of representatives"], [0.03466198965907097, 0.03466198965907097, 0, "during the past two weeks of tariff discussion in the house i have been confined to my home by a very severe inflammation of one of my eyes in consequence of which i have not only been prevented from attending the regular sessions of congress but also deprived of the pleasure of perusing the debates on the tariff as reported in the congressional recoxb at a cost of about 5 000 to 8 000 a day to our heavily burdened taxpayers whether i am to be congratulated or commiserated with on this account i leave entirely to the judgment of my more fortunate brethren who were able to be present permit me to say however in this connection that i do not believe that anything that has been said or that may hereafter be uttered upon this floor will have the slightest effect in changing or altering the vote of a single member in regard to the mills tariff bill king caucus has laid down the programme to be followed by the majority and if the party lash can effect itif the power and patronage of the executive can accomplish itno change nor alteration in any important provision of this bill will be allowed by the majority thus believing it would seem to be the part of wisdom to remain silent and content myself with voting against this iniquitous tariff bill as a whole and every part thereof but sir coming as i do from one of the largest mining and manufacturing districts in the commonwealth of pennsylvania and feeling a deep interest in the prosperity happiness and permanent welfare of a generous constituency i would consider myself false and recreant to every obligation devolving upon me as their representative if i failed to denounce this probritish free trade tariff bill as it deserves this bill is a long stride in the direction of free trade and is the inauguration of a tariff policy that must eventually prove ruinousand disastrous to many important industries in which my people are largely interested sir the president of the united states has boldly demanded tariff reduction in his annual message and no matter how seriously the business interests of the country may be affected thereby commands his democratic followers to see that his wishes are complied with lie informs them that there is a large and a largely increasing surplus of money in the treasury and that it must le reduced sir it may be a great misfortune to be blessed with too much money but sir is this our only danger as a people would it not be a far greater evil to close up our rollingmills furnaces forges factories and workshops would it not be far more terrible to stop the busy hum of industry in our mines our factories and workshops and turn thousands and tens of thousands of honest workmen out of remunerative employment that in my opinion would be a very poor way to reduce the surplusstop the factories and open the poorhouses sir i am glad of one thing and thank the president for tearing the mask from the faces of his democratic freetrade followers one thing is absolutely certain we will have no such cries nor banners in pennsylvania emblazoned with a living lie at next election as polk dallas shunk and the tariff of 42 we dare the whigs to repeal it we will have no favorite son of pennsylvania deceiving our honest laboring men mechanics and artisans with the shameless cry that james k polk is a better tariff man than henry clay and our people will see to it that no other recreant son of pennsylvania nor of any other state in the union will give a casting vote in the united states senate by which free trade is established as the law of the land and ruin and desolation brought to our firesides and hearthstones in the great keystone state our esteemed colleague from pennsylvania will hardly have the effrontery to parade this freetrade banner in the great manufacturing states of new york new jersey and connecticut before the workingmen as the gonfalon of protection to american industry he can not again with any consistency nor without belying his past record even try to save those states to the democratic party next fall as he did four years ago if the democratic party intends to commit political harkarl by passing the mills tariff bill i feel cry sure that brother randall will hardly be one of the chief mourners at the sad obsequies i am a protectionist from principle i was born and raised in a state that is wedded to the protective policy we have witnessed enjoyed and greatly profited by reason of protection to american industry we have grown great and powerful and wealthy through the fostering care of the national government our infant industries have grown to a stalwart manhood and todayi say it with pridethere is no state in the union that is so thoroughly independent and selfreliant and none that can so well withstand the assaults upon american industry american laboring men and american mechanics and artisans as the grand old commonwealth of pennsylvania and as we owe so much to wise legislation on the part of the national government we of the keystone state wish to see oursister commonwealths through the same beneficent policy of protection in like manner grow great and powerful and wealthy by continuing in the same line of policy only a few short years ago we in pennsylvania looked with some apprehension upon the giant strides made by alabama in developing her great iron industries with her vast mineral deposits developed with her coal and iron ore and limestone lying together in such close proximity with her cheap labor and her cheap food her hospitable climate enabling her mechanics and artisans and laboring men to toil in the open air all the year round requiring but little shelter and less clothing than we of the inhospitable north it became aserious problem just how soon selma and bessemer and birmingham would become the pittsburghs and johnstowns of pennsylvania and sir but for the discovery of natural gas and its adaptability to manufacturing purposes the problem would not long have remained unsolved natural gas has revolutionized the iron industry in pennsylvania to such an extent that the ipanufacture of flat and bar and round iron east of the alleghanies has ceased to be profitable unless the works are favorably located i live in one of the great mining and manufacturing districts of pennsylvania hundreds of millions of dollars are invested in mining and manufacturing in the counties of northumberland and dauphin we have vast deposits of anthracite coal in the county of lebanon the other county composing my congressional district we have mountains of iron ore the cornwall iron mines near the city of lebanon alone having turned out over 8 000 000 tons of iron ore since they were opened and the supply is simply inexhaustible i was born and raised in the county of northumberland and can speak from actual knowledge and experience of the coal and iron industries in that county and that kind of knowledge is of far more practical importance than all the diaphanous theories of freetrade dreamers over fifty years of knowledge and experience in the coal and iron trade of my district entitle me to speak with some degree of assurance and this brings me to the consideration of the mills tariff bill the presidents message and the question of wages and the rights of labor likely to be affected thereby air chairman almost my sole interest in this tariff question consists in its effects and relations to labor and the rights of the laboring man as affected thereby i have been a laboring man all my life and this makes me stand close beside the toiling millions in all their efforts to elevate the dignity of labor and share in its just rewards and here let me add that in every struggle betwixt capital and labor all my sympathies and all my yearnings are with the laboring classes i care but little for the capitalist in this struggle for capital is always able to take care of itself but just in so far as the interests of capital and labor are closely identified i am the friend of both there ought not to be any real antagonism between capital and labor and there is none except when purseproud avarice would rob labor of her rights and refuses to share with labor her rightful earnings you may do as you please and vote as you please and legislate as you choose but if your legislation is not in the interests of labor and for higher wages and better pay for the laboring man my voice and vote will be unalterably against you the president of the united states in his annual message to congress talks very glibly about the reduced price of goods compensating for any reduction in wages which might be brought about by his tariff policy and this is to a great extent the stock in trade of the freetrade theorists with a million men today standing idle in the labor market begging for employment with their wives and children begging for bread the chief magistrate of this great republic with an annual salary of 50 000at his back coldly reasons about cheaper food and cheaper clothing making up for cheap wages or even no wages at all why sir if a man is penniless and brownstone fronts were selling for a fhrthing apiece a poor starving devil could not raise money enough to buy a doorknob others of these tariff reformers who wish to equalize the wages of labor throughout the world by free trade are eloquent in their praises of the farmer and planter that they alone are the real producers of all wealth they are full of lhorace greeleys gush about going west young man this is all very nice but if the young man has not money enough to buy a loaf of bread what is the use of taunting him and his family of children if he has any with the delusive advice to go west why sir so many of them have gone there in this plight that after working hard for years they find their farms embellished with a firstclass mortgage and all their hard earnings in the hands of moneysharks oh yes cheap goods and cheap products of the workshop and the farm are the things to make men happy and contented with their lot in life i deny it utterly adults with no one dependent upon them may be satisfied with a bare living but sir the wageworker the toiler in summers lassitude and winters frosts and snows wants more than a living he wants something for old agesomething for his children besides being fed and clothed they want books to read and pens and ink and paper and pencil they want an education with which to fight lifes battle no matter how poor a man or a woman is he does not live for himself alone this is a land of great opportunities the beggar on the dunghill today may be the man of destiny tomorrow godgiven genius is our only patent of nobility in this land of equal sovereigns a man may be great in spite of all obstacles a child may rise to power and place from the almshouse and in progress of time fill the sounding trump of fame with the record of his grand achievements but sir without money without friends without education he is far more likely to fill a felons cell or a paupers grave than to rise to power and station and fame sir go talk to the toilers in the iron hills and coal mountains of pennsylvania and virginia or the bituminouscoal deposits of the great west about the advantages of cheap food and cheap clothing and cheap commodities of every description and they will tell you very quickly that what they want is steady employment and good wages and they will take care of the food and clothing part of this whole business for myself i say to you very frankly that i am opposed to cheap goods and cheap agricultural products cheap goods and cheap products mean cheap laborstarvation wages for toiling slaves without hope and without ambition for the future huts and hovels and nakedness and pauperism and crime follow sadly after the procession of cheap labor need i point to downtrodden ireland in proof of thisstripped bare and naked by the accursed greed and avarice of freetrade england need i further point to the grain fields of egypt and the cotton and rice fields of india where the miserable coolies at the point of english bayonets and the mouths of english cannon are compelled to labor for unpaid toil and this is the kind of labor and the dnd of toil that you farmers of the great west are compelled to compete with in the markets of the world laborerswho toil from sun to sun with breechclouts for raiment with mud hovels and bamboo huts for dwellingplaces and a handful of rice for their daily food such is the banquet that freetrade england invites you to sit down to farmers of america no sir give the laboring man the mechanic and the artisan steady employment at decent wages and he will find a pleasant home for his wife and children decent clothing for their bodies wholesome food for their stomachs and all the necessaries and many of the luxuries of life with good wages you may hold your souls in patience for the laboring man will neither starve himself nor allow his family to want as long as he is blessed with health and strength to work yes you may prate about cheap imported goods manufactured in the noisome factories of leeds and sheffield and birmingham you may talk about the cheap products of foreign paupers and of convict laborers and how they will compensate for the reduced wages of honest american mechanics brought into competition in their production and thrown upon the american markets by a low tariff or no tariff at all but you can not fool intelligent american workingmen by any such stuff they understand just as well as you do that 500 000 000 or 1 000 000 000 worth of such goods thrown upon the american market takes the place of just that many million dollars worth of american fabrics and robs the american mechanic and artisan of the profit of just that amountof labor and the million of american laborers standing idle today waiting for employment know that their chances are lessened just the amount of labor naessary to make those goods in foreign countries more than this they know full well that the beggarly daily pittance paid the hands to fabricate those goodsless than half of what american mechanics would work for in this countryis paid for a days work of twelve fourteen and sixteen hours some gentleman on the other side of this chamber likened the protective policy to a chinese wall a chinese wall indeed why sir rather than see the wheat of india brought into the port of new york to compete with the products of the american farmers rather than see this country flooded with foreign goods whres and merchandise and the wages of american mechanics and workingmen brought down to the level of continental europe asia africa and china and japan instead of a chinese wall i would rather see the great atlantic ocean turned into a sea of fire what do we care for the trade of europe what do our farmers care for it there is not a tenth of our agricultural products shipped abroad oh yes our friends on the other side have become great admirers of our merchant marine they want to see the flag of the republic float upon every sea and ocean they are always ballooning struggling after the unattainable oh yes build up a grand merchant marine that will command the markets of the world why sir if it was left to those gentleman from the south on the ways and means committee to build a merchant fleet if it was left to the states which they represent with their great lines of seacoast in arkansas kentucky and tennessee and their wonderful harbors and ports of entry judging of the future by the past it would take them about a thousand years to fit up an ordinary canalboat what is the use of all this fooling whenever we want a foreign merchant marine we will build it whenever it is made apparent that foreign trade and commerce are more profitable than our coastwise trade whenever it is made manifest that our capital can be better and more profitably employed in constructing a merchant marine to engage in foreign trade just that soon and no sooner will ships be built for the purpose just that soon will every sea and lake and ocean in foreign lands be whitened with the sails of american commerce whenever the foreign carrying trade becomes sufficiently profitable to challenge american enterprise the shipyards of all new england will resound with the busy hum of industry do not misunderstand me i am by no means opposed to the putting forth of every effort to acquire foreign trade and especially in central and south america indeed it is a reproach to this great republic that we do not today control that valuable trade we are their best customers and every year the balance of trade is steadily against us whilst england 3 000 miles farther removed from us by reason of a liberal and enlightened trade policy not only controls that trade but always has a balance of trade in her favor sir had that matchless statesman and thorough american james g blaine been elected to the presidency instead of grover cleveland four years ago that valuable trade would now have been assured to us by wise treaty and close commercial intercourse so irrevocably that all of our surplus manufactures would have found a ready and profitable market to the great advantage of american mechanics artisans and capitalists r but i am diverging 1 want to tell you why i am in favor of a protective tariff in my native county thirty years ago the shamokin coal region was almost a barren waste a region of stunted timber growing on the sides of rugged hills and mountains so destitute of soil that the wonder was how the trees and shrubs managed to exist amidst the rocks and stones the land was so poor and barren that it would have bankrupted any ordinary mau to pay the taxes indeed year after year the lands were disposed of at treasurers sales for default in payment of taxes and today many of the most valuable coal tracts are held by taxtitles had you traveled through that region forty years ago you would hardly have taken the lands as a gift today they are worth the wealth of empires we have coal enough to warm all our friends and iron enough to welcome all our enemies with bloody hands to hospitable graves as witness the heights of gettysburgh and the bloody plains of antietam today large towns and cities cover those stony hillsides filled with a thrifty industrious enterprising population towns of ten and twelve thousand inhabitants in fact the whole region is a succession of towns and villages from shamokin on the north to port clinton and pottsville on the south and east the region is literally gridironed with railroads bearing to eastern markets the black diamonds from the shamokin and schuylkill coal basins sir without a protective tariff that whole region whose wealth is reckoned in hundreds of millions would still be a comparative wilderness what has accomplished this wonderful transformation labor and capital and enterprise sir the glare from workshops furnaces and rollingmills makes the darkest night almost as light as the noonday sun and the wierd forms of the stalwart men with lanterns on their hats who go down into the coal mines seeking dusky diamondsand the gleam from the rollingmills furnaces and factories illuminate the workmaus manlydorms stripped to the waist as they toil at the puddling furnaces looking more like gnomes and genii than thifigs of flesh and blood every town and city in that vast region every railroad train every breaker and colliery filled with busy workmen every house and business place every school and college andhospital and cathedral speaks in eloquent praise of the doctrine of protection to american industry sir visionary theorists may crack their throats in proclaiming the beauties of free trade every scribbler and babbler may rant about robber tariffs but it takes capital and labor and enterprise to transmute the yellow ore into iron bars our mechanics and miners and artisans understand these things well and our farmers understand them well in the greatly enhanced value of their farm products my home is in the northern part of northumberland county in the beautiful valley of the susquehanna as rich and fertile in airicultural resources as the shamokin region is in mineral wealth there and in the lackawanna region our farmers find a home market for all their surplus wheat and small grains their fruits and butter and eggs and poultry we ship little or nothing to the great eastern cities because at less cost of transportation we find a better market in the coal regions why sir before these regions were opened up and railroads constructed i remember well that butter used to sell the year round for from 8 to 10 cents a pound and eggs for 3 to 8 cents a dozen chickens and ducks for 25 cents a pair hay for from 6 to 8 a ton and oats and corm in like proportion potatoes for 25 cents a bushel and no sale for these products at any price today and for years past eggs average 25 cents a dozen butter 30 to 40 cents a pound the year round and potatoes 50 cents a bushel and our farmers have a ready market for all they can raise and during all this time farm lands have more than doubled and trebled in value more than this twentyodd years ago we in the agricultural portions of our county were obliged to bear the burden of taxation the truth was that the undeveloped coal region was too poor to pay any considerable portion of the county rates and levies today and for years that region of country pays much the largest share of our county taxes and just so it is throughout the length and breadth of our great commonwealth the coal regions and the iron regions and the great manufacturing towns and cities beside furnishing our farmers with a good home market for their products bear far the largest share of all local taxation our railroads and canals and our great corporations pay the largest share of our public burdens and in another year we mean to make them pay all the expenses of our state government and but for a protective tariff these great carrying companies would never even have had an existence inthe neighborhood of all our great manufacturing centers such as lebanon harrisburg and steelton in my district farm lands have appreciated in value from 100 to 500 per cent why sir not many years ago the town site of the borough of steelton was a quagmire and swamp today you will find raw material and manufactured products lying stacked upon the ground worth in money millions of dollars and you could not buy a town lot in the heart of the city for what you could have purchased the whole town site for thirty years ago all this phenomenal growth is due to protection and so it is throughout our entire state facts like these speak far more eloquently than all the gauzy theories of freetrade dreamers and so it is and so it will be throughout all this broad land of ours in the neighborhood of all great manufacturing centers and so it will be in the great south with all her agricultural sylvan and mineral wealth as it is at selma and bessemer and birinugham so will it be throughout all the southern and western states on saturday last i heard the eccentric gentleman from mississippi complaining that our robber protective tariff made the cotton planters of his state pay 47 per cent to new england and to old england also in order to have her cotton crop manufactured did it never occur to the gentleman that by establishing cotton factories in his state convenient to the great cotton fields that he could not only save this 47 per cent to his own people to say nothing of the cost of transporting the cotton crop from mississippi to either new england or old england and in such case they could skin the new england yankees instead of being skinned by them i know croaking and complaining will never do it but capital and thrift and energy and enterprise will do it just as it is done in new england or in liverpool or birmingham but you can never do it as long as you belittle and degrade labor you can never do it as long as you lie on your backs and dream as to whether or not it is better to own labor or hire labor you will never get skilled mechanics and artisans either from new england or old england to work in the cotton fields or cotton factories of mississippi for unpaid toil you will not get free white labor from the north to work fourteen or sixteen hours a day for 50 cents a day the truth of the matter is you are a quarter of a century behind the age you have never gotten over the idea of the cheap labor of your proslavery days and you will never see genuine prosperity dawn upon you in the south until you do indolence and cheap labor are the curse of the planting states of the south and the delusion of cheap goods and free trade are the bane of your existence as a people elevate the dignity of labor pay the toiler an honest price for his toil and prosperity and happiness will be your reward the new south thank god is just awakening to a true realization of all her grand possibilities there is no room for croakers and faultfinders there you must get out of the way or be ground to powder under the wheels of progress quit brooding and worrying over the dead past and try to realize the fact that this is an age of wonderful business activity try to catch on as the train of progress passes by or you will surely be left behind stop bothering about how much o the robbertariff money the poor laboring men have laid up in the massachusetts savingsbanks get your laboring men to follow their example and if you will only pay them decent wages they will have good bank accounts too the truth of the matter is there is little or none of your money in their savings why the mass of your people do not buy enough nor consume enough to furnish new england nor old england much profit either you hardly import enough goods into the port of charleston to pay the salaries of the customs officers the northern eastern middle and western states pay the great bulk of the robbertariff duties and they are not complaining about it either start up cotton and woolen and iron mills pay your mechanics living wages keep your money at home and you will find large balances to labors credit in southern savingsbanks if the protective features of the existing tariff are not striken down as proposed in the mills bill by this house and our ports thrown open to unlimited importations of foreign merchandise the newsouth today is just standing upon the threshold of her greatest prosperity before her are just now opening vistas of wealth and prosperity such as were never dreamed of in the dark days of slavery and sloth and indolence strike down the protective system and how soon all your bright hopes will be clouded and dissipated capital which is now eagerly seeking investment in your midstalways cowardlywill leave you as if fleeing from a pestilence northern capital and northern brains and genius and enterprise will forsake you as if pursued by the demon of destruction sir with protection guarantied the states of virginia and georgia and tennessee and alabama will increase in wealth and power and population at a ratio that will cause the bleak hills and rugged mountains of my native state to bide their diminished heads in shame you have a soil and a climate such as we of the north may wellenvy you have your virgin forests your rich agricultural lands and your vast deposits of mineral wealth and all you want is energy and capital to develop them with all these natural advantages in your favor you have retrograded in the past and allowed your lessfavored sister states to far outstrip you in all that constitutes the true grandeur and greatness and wealth of trade and commerce you know that all this is true just as well as i do the late terrible civil strife ought to have demonstrated to you the vital importance of diversified industries in the south and the utter folly of depending upon new england or old england for what you are so abundantly able to produce yourselves to be truly great every state like every nation ought to be truly independent with factories and furnaces and rollingmills and machineshops in the south twentyodd years ago it would have been as utterly impossible for the north to have overcome you as it would be today for the world in arms to destroy this great republic i implore you therefore to stand by the policy under which this great republic has prospered beyond anything in the history of civilized governments let us not be beguiled by the voice of the freetrade charmer charm shenever so sweetly let us remain true to the policy of the fathers of the republic under and by reason of which we have grown so great so wealthy so powerful and strong blessed with every variety of soil and climatenearly every state an empire within herself capable of manufacturing within herself nearly everything from a needle to an anchor from a pleasureyacht to the grandest ironclads that ever defied the fury of old neptunewhy should we be in any way dependent upon any nation or all the nations of the world combined for anything proud lofty america standing alone in the matchless grandeur of her imperial power and greatness with her matchless mechanics and artisans her fair women and noble men let the civilized world learn wisdom from our example in mechanism as well as in the science of true government and let us be grand and free as a people from any dependence upon foreign workshops foreign

this bill explanatory of a proposition which is certainly novel in its character and i believe for the first time in the history of this country made upon the presentation of the pending bill but it appears that there are no gentlemen upon the other side of the chamber among the many gentlemen who favor the measure who are prepared to give a reason for the extraordinary proposition which is now presented to take from the treasury of the united states the back taxes paid by the states of this union to be distributed among the several states of the union by which they were paid i do not wonder sir that there should be no one to defend such a proposition i say that it is a novel one it is one which so far as i am aware has never yet been presented up to the present time in the history of our country as has been well said by my distinguished friend from alabama who makes the minority report from the judiciary committee in his challenge to the opposition to say under what clause of the constitution this power is assumed by the congress of the united states there does not exist in the general grant of power to levy taxes any power to take back the taxes which have once been paid into the public treasury for if that power does exist under the general clause of the constitution which grants to the congress of the united states as the legislative department of the government the power to levy taxes duties imposts and excises to pay the public debts and provide for the common defense and the general welfare of the united statesi say if there is any power in this grant of the constitution to impose a tax who is prepared to argue that under that same clause in the constitution the power exists to take taxes already paid out of the public treasury to be refunded that is the proposition the naked distinct unequivocal proposition of this bill to put the hand of the authors of this bill or the beneficiaries of this bill into the public treasury and to take back the taxes money already paid under the law and divideit among the several states and upon what ground sir is it proposed to be done i say the clause of the constitution which authorizes it san not be pointed out the power of taxation is the most tyrannous power with which any government can possibly be invested and we are all familiar with the fact that when our ancestors had emerged from the successful struggle for liberty the revolutionary war the rebellion auinst the mother country and were prepared to found a government of their own in adopting the confederate form of government the confederation of the states they absolutely declined in that constitution first adopted after the war of the rebellion to concede the power of taxation to the federal government at all and in the debates in the convention which framed the constitution under which we now live as well as the debates in the several state conventions upon the question of the adoption or the rejection of the constitution the gravest question which was discussed both in the general convention and the conventions of the respective states was that of conceding to the general government the power of taxation it was well said bya distinguished gentleman whose remarks ihave just read in the debates in the new york state convention that to concede the power of taxation to the federal government upon all subjects and upon all kinds of property would be to have two legislatures imposing taxation upon the states and a necessary conflict of jurisdiction between them i have said sir in the first government established after the war of the revolution the concession of the power of taxation was refused to the federal government but experience demonstrated the fact that thirteen different legislatures of the thirteen different states were ill prepared to lay a tax for the support of the general government the consequence was that under the articles of confederation the quotas of the several states as called for by the federal government were not furnished to the general government and the great argumen made in the convention of the general government as well as in the conventions of the different states for the grant of power of taxation to the federal government was that the states would not levy the tax and the quota required from each state would thus not be forthcoming when the necessities of the government should require it it was the force of this argument that impelled the framers of the constitution with guarded language to concede for the first time the power to the federal government to levy taxes duties imposts and excises and they tried to guard the grant of that power sir by the terms of the constitution enumerated in this grant that it should only be exercised for three purposes namely to pay the public debt to provide for the common defense and the generalwelfare of the country it is true that in the concluding clause of this paragraph of the con stitution the power to pass all laws needful for carrying into effect the power thus conceded to the federal government was also given to congress but it went no further i repeat therefore that both in the debates in the general convention that adopted the constitution as well as in the debates in all the states on thequestion of its adoption or rejection by the states because it provided in its own terms that it was to become the constitution over the states when nine of the original thirteen states should have ratified it in their conventions and then only to become a constitution over the states which ratified it and none others it was required that this power conceded to the general government of taxation be for the purposes i have enumerated and none others that concession was made for the reasons i have indicated but this bill proposes to take back a portion of a tax imposed on lands by the act of 1861 out of the common treasury of the united states and divide it among the states confiding it to the executives of the respective states in trust for a period of six years to be handed back to the persons from whom it was originally derived where now are the people who paid it the theory upon which this bill proceeds is that you are going to refund this money to give it back to those people who paid it they will not be found easily and yet this bill proposes to take from the treasury all of this money derived by the taxing power of the government and paid by each individual taxpayer in the respective states where it was collected and give it back to the states and not to the individuals for i apprehend the individuals will not be found where is the power to do it i have said that nowhere in the constitution is it conceded the power to levy taxes duties imposts and excises is conceded but nowhere by construction or otherwise can you evoke from the constitution or any phrase or paragraph in it the power to take out of the common treasury taxes that have already been paid unless they have been illegally or unconstitutionally paid if this tax therefore was levied by the congress of the united states in 1861 and thus paid into the treasury of the united states by what authority can you take it out now and hand it back to the states and if you can do itas has well been said by my friend from alabama ifyou can do it with reference to one species of taxation why can not you do it with reference to all if you can do it upon the principle of equalizing taxation among the people of this country then you can give back and equalize the tax for the war of 1812 and you can go back still further and equalize the taxes of the war of the revolution itself what limit is there sir to this power of congress to equalize taxes if the power exists in regard to this particular and specific tax wheie then is the limit where is the restraint you will find it nowhere but it will give unlimited power to any future congress to go back and equalize every tax which is being paid into the treasury today under any of the internalrevenue taxes of the country which are direct taxes is it not therefore an assertion of power which does not exist under the constitution and the setting of a precedent that will be dangerous in the extreme if this bill should become law there is no limit to it there was a tax sir imposed upon incomes during the late unfortunate war between the states that is a species of taxation which the great parliamentarian of england said in regard to all direct taxation was the most just of all but which you long since repealed because the prediction of mr williams in the speech he made in the new yo k convention adopting the constitution has been fulfilled for he said that if this power of taxation was granted this government would become a government of the wealthy men of the country and the power of taxation would be exercised in their behalf have we not reached a consummation of that prediction made by this gentleman in the convention of new york the income tax has long since been repealed there may be many who did not pay the income tax that very portion of the country which you say did not pay a part of this direct land tax did not pay income tax and i raise a note of warning here today that if you pass this bill in regard to the refunding of this direct tax it will not be long before it will be said that that portion of country which by reason of the war could not be reached and where the taxgatherer could not go to collect the income tax ought to pay its fair proportion of that tax and ifyou can go back to that tax thenyou can go backto every other and the dangerous precedent will be set of the congress of the united states investing itself outside of the constitution with authority conferred neither by the terms of the instrument nor by necessary implication to carry into effect granted power and you will have an example set of going back to equalize any taxation that the majority of congress may think in their judgment ought to be equalized i call the attention of gentlemen upon the opposite side and warn them that if this measure shall become law there will be no end to corrections of what may be called unequal taxation it will be extended back to other species of taxation that you can say have been paid in one portion of the country and not in another i do not like to go outside of the very question which the bill itself presents this is simply a question of the power of congress by an act to go into the treasury of the united states and take out tax money paid a quarter of a century ago for the purpose of dividing it between the states themselves in trust for the people who paid it if as i have said you can do this in reference to this tax then you can do it with reference to all and why should it not be done with reference to all if at any future time it shall be said any species of taxation has operated unequally upon this country why shall you not make a proposition to take the money from the treasury and divide it suppose that the unjust and excessive taxation under which the country has been groaning for years had not been imposed upon it suppose there were now no surplus would the honorable gentleman who represents the majority of the committee that reported this bill dare to propose that a tax should be imposed on the people for the purpose of returning the money which is alleged to have been unequally paid in this case and yet if you possess the power to take the money out of the treasury and divide it amongst the people who paid this tax upon the ground that there are others who did not pay it why would you not have the power to levy a tax to raise money for the same purpose yet i venture to assert that the honorable members of the committee who favor this bill would hardly dare propose that a law should now be enacted for the purpose of levying a tax to repay taxation unjustly or unequally collected from the people nevertheless the principle in both cases is the same i repeat if the power exists to pay out the money which is in the treasury now and devote it to this purpose then the power exists to levy a new tax to make this repayment and if that is the case you may introduce a law to make uniform the income tax which was at one time imposed in this country and so with regard to every other form of direct taxation under the excise laws the taxes operating upon wine spirits beer brandy tobacco and every other article that was a subject of such taxation but the power does not exist to take the money out of the treasury for this purpose the pretext on the face of this bill is that you are going to return the money to the persons who paid it but that is only a pretext you know that you will never do that you know that it is incapable of being done you know that not one in a thousand of the men who paid this tax will be beneficiaries under this bill if it shall become a law you know that the money will go to the states for the purpose of ieing appropriated after the expiration of your trust period of six years in the discretion of the state legislatures and thus a precedent will be set by which the most dangerous legislation that can possibly be imagined may be enacted by the congress of the united states itwas well said sir by that great judge chiefjustice marshall in an early case decided in the supreme court of the united states the case of the state of maryland vs mccullough that the power of taxation was the most tyrannous power that any government could be intrusted with and that it might be used to destroy and if those who feel an interest in this question will examine the debates in the various state conventions and especially in the great state of new york they will find that the argument against the policy of conceding the power of taxation to the federal government was predicated upon the idea that the power of taxation might in the language of chiefjustice marshall be used to destroy today if this bill becomes a law there will be no restraint upon the legislative power to impose hundreds of millions of dollars of taxes such as have been imposed within the last quarter of a century not needed for any legitimate purposes of government not needed for any purpose of honest and economical administration the prediction of the debater in the convention of new york mr williams will be verified and i say that the history of this country now demonstrates that the government of the united states exercising the taxing power upon the theory of this bill holds the power of the purse and may lay taxes to the absolute destruction of the people of this country the debater in the new york convention reminded that body that if the power of laying taxes without limit was conceded to the federal government the power of the sword ever accompanied the power of the purse and that the government which had an unlimited right to levy taxes would have an unlimited right to raise armies and to arm and equip them and thus the free government of the united states would be clothed with a power as dangerous as despotic as autocratic in its character as that possessed by the most powerful despotism of the old world there is no one now i presume who would contend that the power of taxation should be used in that way but where is the limit how are you going to restrict it the discretion and conscience of the legislator will be the only restriction if you are going to set tbs precedent of equalizing taxation in this manner it has been wellsaid bymy distinguished friend from alabama better said than i can say itthat if you are going to equalize taxation at all certainly you ought not to begin with a tax which everybody concedes was legally and constitutionally laid legally and constitutionally collected legally and constitutionally expended if you are going to equalize taxation on principles of common justice honesty and equity you ought to begin with those taxes which as conceded by the common consent of mankind and the judgment of every fairminded man have been illegally and unconstitutionally laid sir while the war was going on in 1861 and even after the war bad terminated by amendments to the original law the congress of the united states selected a particular article produced in the southern states alone the article of cotton and levied a tax of 3 cents a pound upon it if the government of the united states possessed the power to levy this taxation in time of war there can be no man so bold as to assert that it possessed it in time of peace after the war had closed if in time of peace the congress of the united states can levy a tax upon a product of any one particular region of the country then as has been well said by my learned friend from georgia you may levy a similar tax upon all other products and if you may do this then the power of taxation may indeed be said to be in the language of chiefjustice marshall the power of destruction what authorily or right has the government of the united states to go into a smte seize ul on a particular product of the soil and make it the subject of taxation sir we had direct taxation for a brief period only after the war of the revolution that law continued in force for only a year having been swept off the statutebook in 1801 in 1812 we again resorted to that form of taxation but in five years it passed away during our late war direct taxation was again resorted to in 1861 and 1862 and much of that taxation has been swept away though some portion still remains upon the statutebook it was in 186162 that the tax on cotton was originally imposed but in 1866 when the war had terminated congress passed another law on this subject still more punitive in its character than the original act itself selecting a single product of a particular region of the country and subjecting it to onerous and oppressive taxation a case arising in the united states court at memphis which presented the question of the constitutionality of this tax went to the supreme court of the united states but unfortunately for the country unfortunately for the constitution unfortunately for the liberties of the taxpayers this court was equally divided upon the question and under the rule which prevails alike in the supreme court and in the state tribunals of last resort the equal division of the court amounts to an affirmance of the judgment of the inferior tribunal thus there i was a failure to obtain from the supreme court an authoritative deterruination of the question of the constitutionality of the cotton tax the judgment of the court below stood asthe judgment of the higher court so far as the parties in interest in that litigation were concerned but today there lies in the treasury of the united states 68 000 000 collected under that law which certainly could not commend itself to the gentlemen who advocate this measure upon the doctrine of equality justice honesty and fair dealingcollected from the people of the southern states at a time when they were scarcely able to bear any taxes we wero just recovering from the devastating effects of a great war between the states we were straggling to place ourselves again in a position in which our people could earn a livelihood to keep body and soul together to support their wives and little ones we were struggling to rehabilitate our states we were struggling to emerge from a condition of poverty to which no other people have ever been reduced and which no other people have ever borne with the fortitude the manliness and i may say the womanliness with which our people in the south bore their condition it was then that you imposed this cotton tax which the amendment of my friend from alabama proposes to refund you imposed it after the war as well as during the war after awhile you repealed it why was it repealed was it from a returning sense of justice and conscience on the part of those who had imposed it if it was a right tax a necessary tax a constitutional tax why was it not maintained ah you dared not continue it why because the very same principle which you invoked when you unjustly and iniquitously laid this tax upon that product would authorize a tax upon the wheat in the fields of the west and the north and upon every product of your fhrms i presume it was the returning sense of justice the reproach of conscience against that unjust oppressive and onerous tax which induced the congress of the united states to repeal it now if you intend to commence the return of taxes which have been unequally unjustly unconstitutionally imposed my friend from alabama properly invites you to begin with this unjust taxation which you imposed upon the cotton farmers of the south during and immediately after the war you derived from that taxation 68 000 000 lying in your treasury today will you not submit to the supreme court of the united states the question whether that money has been placed there rightly or not will you deny such an appeal will the friends of this measure now refuse to permit the court of last resort the court to whose adjudications we all bow in ready obedience to pass upon this great constitutional question there is one tribunal in this country that is the repository of the safety and the liberties of the citizen no great standing armies are necessary in the united states of america to protect our liberty and our independence we have merely the skeleton of an army in time of peace but there is one tribunal the tribunal of law which regulates liberty by law and which adjudges all constitutional questions and to the decisions of that tribunal the citizens all over the land bow in obedience when that tribunal decided after the late unfortunate conflict between the states regarding the first thing they had to do as they were bound to do as they were coerced to do was to recognize the great principle of home rule and community independence which lies at the foundation and is the cornerstone of our constitutional union and in accordance with that great principle that great tribunal decided this was an indissoluble union composed ofindestructible states and hence when they made that decision every man in the united states of america from maine to california bowed in obedience to the rule of law proclaimed by the tribunal of last resort if you will not take as an amendment to this bill the proposition of my friend from alabama and allow that court to decide on the constitutionality of your cotton tax if you will not adopt it as an amendment to this bill then will you dare to refuse the proposition he makes to give to that oppressed and taxridden section of our country reduced by the disasters of war at least the right to have the decision and adjudication of that court of last resort upon the propriety of returning the 68 000 000 you now hold in your treasury not only that but my friend from alabama proposes an amendment to this novel and extraordinary bill to test the sincerity of the men who advocated it oi the ground of justice equity and fair dealing lo proposes that you shall allow another fund called the calptured and abandoned property fund which originally amounted to 35 000 000 collected from the southern states after the war and the cotton sold by the firm of drexel co in the great city of philadelphia and which after taking out what the collectors of the tax took to defrayexpenses left 34 000 000tolet the supremecourt of the united states decide whether the cotton thus sold making up a fund never to be mingled with the other funds in the treasury of the united states but to remain there as a fund liable to be called for by the people who owned the cotton at the time when the government took it and sold it and put the proceeds into the treasurywill you refuse i ask to accept that proposition and let the supreme court decide whether the act was constitutional or not the gentleman from alabama proposes that as an amendment to this bill which you on every principle of equity justice and fair dealing ought to accept he proposes you shall give to every man who owns a part of that captured and abandoned property fund the right to go into the tribunals of the government and establish his right to it and obtain judgment for it it was well said by that man whom i cherish in my memory with as much regard and affection as i do any of the distinguished men who lived befbre my time in our historyit was said by the late justice story of massachusetts long before you created the court of claims with its small qualified jurisdictioni remember to have heard him say that while in the most despotic government in the old world a citizen however humble he might be had the right to walk into the tribunals of that government and sue it and compel it to pay his just claims it was a shame and disgrace to the greatest and freest government on earth that there was no tribunal in which a citizen of the united states could present his claim and ask to be heard in its maintenance to a limited extent you have removed that shame from the country by clothing the court of claims with limited jurisdiction why should not every citizen of the united states have the right to enter the tribunals of the government and establish his claim against the government and have it paid and what argument can you make against the proposition of my friend from alabama to allow this remnant of the fhnd magnificei t in its proportions which you took from the southern people after the war and putin the treasurywhatreason can you give what conscience to deny the rights of the citizens to go to yourown tribunal and prove simply that what is therebelougs to them especially when the supreme court has declared it constitutes a sacred fund to remain there forever until paid to the people entitled to it i have spoken longer than i intended upon this question mir chairman but there seemed to be none upon the other side who desired to be heard and with the permission of the committee to extend in the record with a view to copying some expressions of others upon the subject whose judgment is better than my own i leave the question for the further consideration of the committee"], [0.03536472097039223, 0.03536472097039223, 0, "i move to amend by inserting the following paragraph after line 5 lime 15 cents per cask the committee on learning something of the facts relating to this inlustry have with entire unanimity stricken manufactured lime from the freelist of the pending bill and restored it to the dutiable list it was so evident that the placing of lime on the freelist as proposed by the majority of the ways and means committee would result in the destruction of this industry in the united states that no one came forward to defend the proposition after the subject had received candid consideration air chairman i hope thatafuhl consideration of the conditions which surround this industry will satisfy this committee and the house that the amendment which i offer to substitute a specific duty of 15 cents per cask for the present ad valorem duty of 10 per cent ought to be adopted when the existing duty of 10 per cent ad valorem on lime was fixed by the low tariff of 1846 20 per cent having been the previous rate it afforded a substantial protection of about 10 cents per cask for many years it practically gave our markets entirely to our own lime producers up to 1884 even canada did not even supply her own markets notwithstanding she imposed and still imposes a duty of 20 per cent on imported lime but about that time capitalists began to develop the lime quarries of canada using the most improved kilns and methods and with the advantage of the cheaper labor of the dominion soon supplied the canadian markets and began to reach out to the markets of the united states taking advantage of the fact that our duty on lime is ad valorem and only 10 per cent at that the canadian manufacturers soon learned the european trick of undervaluing their lime in the invoices and thus practically fixing the duty themselves and gradually reduced it until today instead of paying a duty of about 10 cents per cask as contemplated by the walker tariff of 1846 and the tariffof 1883 they are paying but about 3 cents per cask duty on lime this shamefully low duty is nearly 2 cents lower than it would be if a decision of the treasury department had not excluded the cost of the barrel from the invoiced value of the lime at the place of shipment the effect of this practical reduction of duty by means of undervalnations is already being seriously felt by our lime manufacturers in 1886 82 855 casks of canadian lime were imported into this country in 1887 the importations ran up to 132 239 casks and it is thought there will be 200 000 casks imported the present fiscal year with a prospect of a rapid increase in the future in view of these facts there is grave danger that unless something is done not only to restore the duty on imported lime to the figure intended by all our tariff acts but also to increase the duty so as to meet the changed conditions within a few years thelime manufacturing industry will be in large part driven from the united states to canada unless the employds in this industry are willing to work at canadian wages and the 8 000 laborers now employed at liberal wages in this industry will be added to the army of the unemployed or be driven into other already crowded industries i am aware that the chairman of the ways and means committee insists as he did in the brick manufacturing industry a few days ago and as he had previously in other industries that notwithstanding the best class of laborers on limekilns receive in this country 2 per day and in canada 1 25 yet that our laborers do so much more work in a day that the labor cost of producing lime as well as the other products is no more here than in canada or europe this is a very pleasant theory one which the distinguished chairman has pressed with great earnestness but which has no foundation of ascertained facts to rest upon when the chairman asserted thatthis was the fact as to brick manufacture and rested his whole argument for placing canadian bricks on the freelist on the assumption that the labor cost of manufacturing a thousand of bricks was no more here than in canada i could meet the assertion only with the expression of my conviction from observation that laborers in canada performed as much work in any department of industry in a day as in this country anticipating a repetition of this labor cost assumption when lime should be reached in this bill i have obtained through intelligent and responsible gentlemen a detailed statement of the comparative cost of manufacturing a hundred casks of lime on the st john river in new brunswick and in rockland me to which i invite the attention of the gentleman from texas and the committee comparative cost of manufacturing one hundred casks of lime at rockland me and st john new brunswick excess rockland st john cost at rockland limerock

cost of labor in quarrying and transporting lime rock estimated 05 it will be seen by this comparative statement that it requires the same number of men working the same number of hours to make a hundred casks of lime in canada as in the united states thus demonstrating that the efficiency of the labor employed in canada in lime manufacture is alnost exactly the same as in the state of maine and i am confident maine labor is as efficient as any in the country what bemnmes of the theory on which the distinguished chairman is constructing this bill that notwithstanding labor is receiving 60 per cent more as daily wages in this country than in canada yet that this is offset by 60 per cent greater efficiency of our own labor there can be no doubt thatso faras the lime manufacturing industry is concerned the theory has nothing to stand upon and i have no doubt the same is true as to other industries the fact stares us in the face that canadian labor in this industry is as efficient as our labor and that labor in this country costs 60 per cent more than in canada the clear and unquestioned facts are that it costs 10 cents more per cask to quarry and transport lime rock to the kiln in rockland than on the st john at least half of which is due to higher cost of labor in quarrying and transporting to the kiln 5 cents more per cask for the labor employed in burning barreling and delivering on the vessel and 721 cents certainly 5 cents more per cask for the fuel used in burning which is largely labor total excess of cost per cask in this country over canada 23 cents of which labor in some form gets 10i cents more than the labor which does the same work in canada leaving 7j cents to go to fuel and the balance to other causes delivered in new york canadian lime costs 15 cents per cask less than our own lime the balance being made up by the advantage we have in being nearer to our own markets it ought to be evident to the committee that unless the duty on imported canadian lime is made sufficient to cover the difference in the cost of the labor employed in canada and in the united states the limemanufacturing industry in this country will be gradually driven to the wall by canadian competition or our labor be compelled to accept canadian wages in view of the changed conditions which have enabled canadian lime manufacturers to come into ruinous competition with our own there ought to be no hesitation by any one in voting to place the duty at the low rate of 15 cents for this only covers the difference in cost of labor in the materials and their manufacture and even the democratic national convention at st louis gave a pledge to workingmen that the democratic party would maintain sufficient duties to cover this i i now ask the democratic majority of this house to redeem this pledge to the laborers employed in the lime industry it appears from the census of 1880 that the lime manufacturing industry produced in that year nearly six millions of casks of lime valued in the markets at 5 772 318 and that in producing this lime 1 579 313 was paid in wages this makes the wages paid 281 per cent of the value of the producttwice as large a percentage of labor as in the manufacture of glue which the committee have transferred to the dutiable list and as large a percentage of labor as is shown in a majority of manufactured products in the district which i have the honor to represent over two million casks of lime were made last year furnishing the chief manufacturing industry of a county of over 32 000 population giving employment to thousands of workingmen supplying a market for every farmer and promoting the prosperity of every citizen what the views are of the enterprising men who are engaged in this industry in my own district will be seen by the following memorial to congress which has been signed by every lime manufacturer in knox county maine without distinction of party to the honorable the senate and house of lepresentatives of the united slates we the undersigned manufacturers of lime in the county of knox state of maine do most respectfully and earnestly desire to call your attention to the following important facts relating to and affecting the interest of the people of this and surrounding counties the vast beds of limestone in this county opened up an industry in the seaports of thomaston rockland reckport and lincolnville in the manufacturing of lime which has existed for over a century gradually increasing it now amounts to a capital invested in kilns wharves and storehouses of about 1 000 000 in limerock quarries of about q2 000 000 and it is an investment worthless for any other purpose tlere is besides a large shipping interest employed in transporting the lime and fuel for burning it about 2 000 000 casks of lime are annually manufactured and shipped from this county at a cost delivered in the markets of from 90 cents to 1 per cask excepting the rock in the quarry the fuel and lumber on the stump at an average cost of 6 cents per cask the whole cost of this article is made up of labor which includes quarrying the rock hauling same to kilns gathering the fuel making and hauling the lime casks by the inhabitants of the surrounding towns burning the lime handling and carrying the same to market before and after the formation of the dominion of canada nova scotia was one of our large lime markets but at or about that time a duty was imposed on our lime by that government which necessitated the abandonment of that market by us the said duty still remaining in force since the decline in shipbuilding the manufacture of lime is the only industry of any importance at the ports above mentioned affording as it does employment to a large number of men who have become permanently located here we therefore deem it of the utmost importance that the fiftieth congress take some action to protect this great industry upon which the future of this county depends near st john new brunswick are vast deposits of limestone with fuel in abundance and at less than half the cost of the same used here with labor much cheaper within a few yearsthe business of burning lime has been begun and carried on there and the product largely sent into our markets namely to new york alone there were shipped in 1885 less than 5 000 casks in 1s86 41 000 and in 1887 138 000 casks and it is estimated that under the present arrangement 200 000 casks or more will be sent to that market this year the dikerence in the cost of this article here and there at the kiln ready for shipmentis about 23 cents per cask in their favor and there is now a duty of 10 per cent ad valorem or only 3 cents per cask it being invoiced at 30 cents per cask which is exclusive of the package under the tariff bill as revised by the ways and means committee we notice lime among the articles placed on the freelist we therefore most respectfully petition your honorable body to not only remove lime from the freelist but to impose a specific duty corresponding to that of the dominion government i commend this memorial to the considerate attention of the coimittee and the house there is another reason why there should be no hesitation in fixing this duty at the low rate of 15 cents per cask and that is the fact that the pending bill leaves a duty of nearly 30 per cent on bituminous coal which is now being used extensively as fuel in burning lime the cost of the fuel being nearly onethird of the cost of manufacturing it would certainly be a grave injustice to the manufacturers and laborers engaged in this industry to impose a duty of 30 per cent on the coal used in burning limei and not give an equivalent protection on the manufactured lime i trust that the justice of the proposition which i have made will commend it to the committee and the house"], [0.036477308720350266, 0.036477308720350266, 0, "a word as to the effect of this provision of the bill upon the people of my state flax in iowa is the poor mans crop every man who comes to my state a poor man and buys his 120 or 160 acres of land buys it possibly from a corporation on long timeand that accounts let me say in a largedegreefor the mortgages which my friends from the other side are so prompt to describeas existing thereand lie puts i his first crop of flax under the old arrangement when a mai came to iowa thirty forty or fifty years ago and broke up thevirgin prairie soil lie could raise nothing there is not one year in iowa in twenty or in any of our western territories or states in which during the first year you can raise anything after breaking up the land sometimes in very wet seasons 15 or 20 bushels of corn may be gathered but as a rule no crops are made it became early the system in that state that the first year was devoted to get the land ready for producing corn and wheat the following year but during the last few years since there has been a fair protection of the flax industry that system has been changed and the new ground is now sown in flax as soon as the man has broken up his land 10 acres we will say in april he seeds it down in flax and as lie breaks up another 10 20 30 or 40 acres it is seeded down in the same way he goes to the flaxmills and borrows the seed and returns it with his crop the result is air chairman that at the end of the season after he has put 30 40 or 50 acees in flax lie gets for that crop 500 to 800 which not only supports his family but in many instances permits him to make his first payment on his land reducing his debt and sometimes in one or two seasons he secures his title in full in addition to that twenty years ago there was but one flaxmill in the state today there are nine great mills which crush one and onehalf millions of bushels of flaxseed annually and theirannual product is nearly 5 000 000 gallons of flaxseedoil i desire to call attention just here to the fact that flaxseedoil during the last fifteen years is cheaper than it has ever been before in this country when we procured our linseedoil from england forty years ago the price was from 45 to 60 cents per gallon but today you can buy it all over the state of iowa at retail under the protective system for less monoy than we had to pay for it in new york at wholesale in years gone by the english people produce flaxseed in large amounts in india by cheap ryot and fellah labor which costs only 6 or 7 cents per day that flaxseed is exported to england where the production of oil is but a secondary consideration it is ground there mainly for the purpose of the residuum which is used for the fattening of cattle and the large profit in the manufacture of flaxseed here on the ground is from the export of oilcake which we send abroad now if you pass this bill in myj lidgment you will strike a direct blow at the iow a flaxraiser we exported 1 900 000 worth of flaxseed from our state in addition to what was consumed at home obtained from the crushing of 1 500 000 bushels of seed in my judgment you strike a very heavy blow at this industry if you pass this bill what else hut flax can our people raise to bring their land into subjection if they raise anything else they have got to be out a years labor our friends on the other side are clamorous all the time for the poor farmers of the west who they say arc downtrodden and loaded with mortgages and all that sort of thing now if they really want to benefit the western farmers they can net find a better way of doing it than by

condemnation of the remaining papercurrency issue not wholly based on coin has since then passed to his final restingplace but the official act clearly expressing the hostility of this administration to the greenbacks of the nation remains the attack was most seriously made and the disposition to go the full measure that wall street might wish disclosed the third attack as i have seen fit to enumerate them in the beginning of myremarks is that made by the president in hislastannual message and now being most vigorously and tenaciously supported by the freetrade members of this body upon the principle of economics so well defined by the word protection and while i would deplore success on the part of the democratic party to seriously endanger this principle as applied in the collection of our necessary revenue yet i must say i have experienced a profound satisfaction in the fact that now and hereafter during the approaching presidential campaign and i trust subsequent thereto and during the period of the existence of the present great competing parties we are to know where the democratic party uis a party stands on this question for whatever the mere verbal statement of the next democratic platform may be the position of that party is now more clearly defined by presidential and democratic mayk 14 congressional utterance than ever before and no skillful manipulation of words at st louis whereby as in the last national platform of that party the protectionists in the east and the freetraders in the west could and did with apparent equal sincerity maintain that the party was committed to one or the other principle as was necessary to allure the elector can in the coming campaign obscure the fact or deceive men of ordinary intelligence as to the real attitude of the democratic party toward this important issue the fearless and able defense of the protective principle made by such democratic members as randall foran mcadoo and a few othersmembers of this housecan not break the force attaching to the presidents message and the great volume of democratic utterance in the two halls of congress in support of it i say thep welcome be the day and all the days in political discussion when the country on this question of tariff shall be able unmistakably to locate each of thegreat parties correctly and know as they must that the one means unyielding opposition to protection and the advocacy of free trade the other the same intense and uncompromising allegiance to that principle which has in every platform since the organization of the republican party marked its history and will continue to be one of its cardinal doctrines to the end of its days of the socalled mills bill let me here say that while i entertain strong feeling that congress should revise the existing tariff so as to bring about such an administration of our revenue system both of customs duties and internal revenue as will promise relief from so large a surplus in the future i can not and will not support this bill unless nmaterially amended and while doubting that in the condition of the legislative mind as it exists in the house at this time it will be possible to secure such amendments as will make it acceptable it appears to me to be my duty to favor its consideration through the various parliamentary stages of discussion both general and under the fiveminute rule in the hope that eventually it may come forth bearing far lessresemblance to its former self and presenting a face and form in no feature of which may be traceable the strong lines of freetrade venom which now so seriously disfigure it therefore if at the conclusion of general debate the opponents of the measure shall attempt to have the enacting clause of the bill stricken out as was done in the fortyeighth congress in relation to another billrelating to this subject i shall deem it my duty to vote with those who favor further consideration at the same time declaring that unless amended in nearly all the particulars hereafter named it shall receive on the attempt to pass it my emphatic negative the great demand of the hour is such legislation not alone of revision of the tariff and internalrevenue laws but of wise and judicious appropriations as will reduce the large excess now existing hnd prevent future unnecessary accumulations in the public treasury i agree that the existence of an ample public purse should lead to no unjustifiable and unnecessary expenditure of the public money but with this fact in mind i am free to say that there are some objects of national concern requiring outlays of money which may well receive the attention of congress at this time first among these objects as they appear to my mind isajust enlargement and readjustment of our pension laws with a view to the administration of a larger measure of justice to the men who by reason of service in the army during the late war are now maimed or diseased to an extent unfitting them partially or totally to earn a livelihood for themselves and those legally dependent upon them and by this is meant not only a more liberal allowance to those who have and can establish their claims under existing laws and rules of the department but also exsoldiers who while strictly speaking unable to connect their present disabilities with army service can show conclusively that their present ailments are not due to their own immoral and vicious habits but to other causes for which they may not be responsible and hence placing them where they may well receive reasonable aid from the government to this class irrespective of any disability of a pensionable degree i would add every one of our living soldiers who being in the service and line of duty was captured and incarcerated more than thirty days in any of the southern prisons these men while in a position in which capture was a wellunderstood incident of war and as to which they knew on enlistment they would stand in danger nevertheless i contend they can not reasonably be held to the understanding that the imprisonment to which they might on capture be subjected would not be in accordance with civilized warfare and that they would be starved to death in dens and pens of disgusting sickening filth nor that their terms of confinement might for any reason of public policy if such was ever the case be unduly lengthened because of any failure avoidable or unavoidable to effect their timely exchange and thereby and by reason of the inhuman hardships to which they were by their captors subjected the chances of their final deliverance so much curtailed as to amountto a most serious lessening of the possibilities of life to this class then i would immediately grant reasonable pensions to be in addition to any pension they may now draw by reason of any specific ailment or wound from my standpoint i venture to say that the sense of justice which in the fortyninth congress led a democratic house and republican senate to pass a dependentpension bill in aid of the dependent soldiers of the late war their widows and orphans more nearly met the approval of the loyal people of this country than the act of the president that prevented the action of congress becoming effectual a bill in the same congress granting a qualified service pension to every soldier sailor or marine who being sixtytwo years of age served in the war with mexico fourteen days or was during their enlistment enreute to the seat war passed the same congress and was a well understood companion piece of legislation with the vetoed dependentpension bill above referred to this measure gave not less than 65 per cent of the amount appropriated to southern men regardless of the fact whether they were rebels during the late war or not always excepting the chief traitor this bill was readily sanctioned by the president the other providing very similar benefits for the union soldier was apparently as readily denied executive sanction not only so but a strong effort is now being made to enlarge the scope of the mexican pension bill and no doubt it will be done soon after the next election now in view of all this what is the manifest duty of congress let the bill now pending on the report of the house committee on invalid pensions on senate bill no 181 entitled an act granting pensions to exsoldiers and sailors who are incapacitated for the performance of manual labor and providing for pensions to dependent relatives of deceased soldiers and sailors be soon taken up and passed that the many and deserving people coming within its terms may know that the congress of the xinited states holds in further remembrance the invaluable services of dependent exunion soldiers as well as those more unfortunate than they finally but most emphatically on this subject let the limitation upon the arrears of pension for disability be removed its continuance is a disgrace to the republic i note with pleasure the report filed today on that subject though i have not yet examined it next to these classes may be enumerated suitable improvement of the navigation of all important and navigable rivers and harbors and the construction of suitable substantial and enduring public buildings in our larger cities where the public interests are great by reason of large postal service or in addition thereto the courts of the united states are permanently located other manifestly worthy objects of public care and the public revenue might be enumerated but these may suffice to indicate my views generally on the subject of appropriations but all these being provided for from time to time as can be doneand certainly it can not all be done in one year nor two even but will require manythere will yet remain at the present rate of national income as i am led to believe a considerable sum of money more than will be disbursed in the usual appropriations and indeed millions more than will be required how shall this unnecessary amount be prevented from further lodgment in the vaults now so weary if we may believe our democratic freetraders of their contents we will see i

and in short everything the northern farmer raises dropped quietly out of the present dutiable list while the great rice and less important peanut crop is duly cared for the great food supplies of one section utterly neglected the great food product of the other section duly protected ah what sublime equity and then the potato yield of northern fields forgotten while the gay and festive peanut bobs up serenely ii kindly sandwiched between rice and raisins on one side and mustard and cotton manufactures on the other the peanut is a lucky little fellow take him up tenderly pinch himn with care fashioned so slenderly young and so fair peanut this mills bill is truly odious as has been said it proposes to accomplish a reduction of revenue by dropping out the whole range of northern farm products placing some other articles on the freelist reducing the duty on many other articles of home production at the same time making but a slight reduction in the rate of duty on sugar none on rice and carefully favoring the southern cottonraiser by letting in his iron and steel cottonties free and by making reduction on nearly all manufactured products i am unmistakably opposed to any such sectional propositions i am also opposed to placing flax and its straw on the freelist or to reducing the duty on the oil the people in my part of the country have for many years raised a considerable surplus of flax and in the general depression of prices and at timesof partial failure of crops they have found itof good reliance as to certainty of yield and price and so much so as to have been most helpful in their years of hardship and trial in developing a new country large oil mills have been erected in iowa minnesota and other states west and at sioux city in thedistrict i have the honor to represent oneof the largestand finest mills in the country hasrecently been constructed and is now operated thus to a marked extent eliminating a considerable per cent of distance and charges from the list of fees usually taxed on shipment of flaxseed to distant points of manufacture and consumption during the past sixty days i have received and presented to the house more petitions bearing more numerous signatures of people residing in northwest iowa praying that the duty on linseed oil be not reduced than on any other subject since the commencement of my congressional service in 1883 unless it be a single petition from laboring men the proposition to alter the duty on flax its oil and fiber has if i can estimate the sentiments of a large number of my constituents met their positive and hearty disapproval iam also opposed to placing wool on the freelist it is a farm product anti represents the little surplus yield of too many families in the land for me to favor its being placed on that list in the fortyeighth congress my vote was cast against restoring this commodity to the rate provided by the law of 1867 that did not seem to me to be necessary and my convictions are most positive now that the farmers and stockmen who are engaged in this industry should not be compelled to take a level with the sheepraisers of australia and the south american countries and particularly so in view of the large increase in the importations of wools and wool manufactures during the fiscal year of 1887 on page 26 of the last report of the secretary of the treasury among other articles on the dutiable list as to which there was an increase ot importations as compared with the previous year he gives the following wools com bing 0 8919 796 carpet 1 978 295 w ool m anufactures 3 481 399 these values do not represent increased price so much as of quantity and therefore of value more largely based on increased importation before passing from this subject however i would like to suggest to both the majority and minority of the committee on ways and means whether such change can not be made in any bill that may become law if any shall this congress in respect of the basis of duty on wool as will give to the river platte country an equal opportunity with other foreign countries to enter its wool in american ports my information is that by reason of the character of the soil and climate the south american wool while of average quality with that from australia takes on and retains a much larger quantity of filth thereby increasing its weight out of proportion with the cleaner grades from other countries and making it impossible of equally favorabli entry with other wools of similar quality but carrying less of dirt this unintentional discrimination now existing against the south american wool is i am satisfied operating to retard the extent of our commerce with that country and this is my reason for calling attention to it but my most serious objection to this bill the asserted object of which is to reduce the annual revenue is that it entirely overlooks the one article on the dutiable list in dealing with which in a statesmanlike manner more money can be at once saved to the entire people of the country and not the least harm be done those now or hereafter to be engaged in the production or handling of the commlity than in dealing with any other article on that list i refer to sugar in the annual statements of receipts and expenditures of the government actual or estimated made by the secretary of the treasury from year to year the form adopted and long maintained has become a familiar one for instance the estimated revenues of the fiscal year ending june 30 1889 as stated on page 7 of the last report of the secretary of the treasury are f rom custom s 228 000 0 000 f rom internal revenue 120 000 000 from sales of public lands 30 000 00o and so on down the grade amounting in all to 383 000 000 therefore it is that a glance at such statement at once rivets the eyes on the two immense sums resulting from customs and internal revenue true the aggregate of estimates of receipts from other sources is considerable but none of them seem to be of a character to invite special attack when searching for sources of revenue to be curtailed if i am not in error no one in all this debate has made a specialty of singling out any one or more of these minor sources of revenue the war has been waged on these two the freetraders selecting the custorns duties as primarily the ones to afford the remedy sought and the extreme and most radical protectionists aiming their guns at the internal revenue for my part i do not think the latter should be the first resort in seeking a remedy but that the customs list and first that article upon that list which presents the greatest inequality in respect of the cost to the consumer as compared with the number of people and the area of country protected by the present duty at this stage of my remarks i can not in deference to my own convictions and what i firmly believe to be the convictions of a large majority of the people of iowa and also of the republicans of that state refrain from taking issue with my esteemed colleague as well as with a distinguished senator from iowa now serving in the other legislative branch of the government and whose judgment and ability i hold in high regard upon the propriety of abolishing the internalrevenue system and particularly the tax on liquors those gentlemen and myself are in accord upon the great question of state prohibition as now represented by the statutes of iowa and when in the rapid course of political events it is apparent that it will be wise to extend that question to the broader domain of national legislation as to which may god speed the dayi expect if we are all living to be in harmony with them then but sir notwithstanding the fact that many excellent men and women in iowa and elsewhere believe that in taxing men who engage in the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors the government thereby and in so doing becomes a sharer a partner in the abominable traffic i differ with them now if in the consideration of this question it is to be viewed solely from a high moral point and in relation to ethics alone i would take no issue with these gentlemen but at once coincide but i am disposed to look at it in this light here is a national government charged with the authority and responsibility under the constitution of maintaining a system of revenue that shall in its operations occasion as little burden and hardship upon the people as possible in the exercise of this power that federal government which is purely official dealswith thirtyeight states some of which are widely separated having local conditions and sentiments on many questions as widely different as their locations each one possessing a sovereignty absolute and complete on the question of the administration of its police power and therefore each alone possessing the sole authority to decide what its policy shall be whether to license or tax liquors and those who manufacture or sell them or entirely prohibit such manufacture and sale bearingthis in mind we must agree that tobacco and liquors have during much of our history been treated as proper articles of taxation particularly when large sums of money had to be raised and both these commodities being of a class not necessary as food or sustenance for the body while large and increasing sums of money must behad fornational support i cannot see as a practical question ofstatesmanship why the tax should at this time be in the least removed from liquors and dealers unless as to some grades used in the arts and sciences nor why it should be to any considerable extent removed from tobacco cigars cheroots etc it is a wellknown tact that but about five of the states in the union have passed prohibitory statutes as to such if the present national law operates to interfere with the sovereignty of the state or the enforcement of her laws passed to suppress intemperance i make bold to say that such changes in our federal laws should be made as will not so interfere with those of any state but this is one question and the right and justice of taxation as applied to these things under our federal system is another let us be sensible and practical in this holding ourselves ready to move to higher ground morally when good sense dictates it can be done and should be done as matter of statesmanship another thought briefly the expenses of government in a general sense must necessarily increase as development and expansion go on large and growing sums of money will annually be needed all of these should not be raised from customs duties perhaps it might not be going too far tomake a change in the tobacco schedule to reduce the rate on all kinds or clear chewing and plain smoking altogether but certainly other kinds should nor be touched and the taxes on liquors and dealers should be maintained unless as to such kinds of intoxicants as may be used in the arts and sciences or be made from fruits but on this i do not now declare turning now to sugar let me say the amount of duty collected on sugar last year was in round numbers 56 500 000 being an increase of the previous year of 6 000 000 sugar sugarcandy and molassesshow an increase of exactly 6 237 738 over the year before except iron steel and manulhctures it exceeds the increase of nearly all other articles combined and the increase over irou stcel and their manutactures i nearly 200 000 so that it not only in and of itself presents the most striking inequality in point of relation of annual amount of duty to home product persons and area protected but it is the one as to which the annual income is most rapidly increasing this being the case what should be done i answer unhestatingly put sugar on the freelist and give a bounty equal to present rate of duty to all persons who shall produce in this country from canes or beets 500 pounds of good marketable sugar the question may be asked do you favor a general system of bounty giving i answer no but that whenever as in this case our home industries can be protected and new ones established and developed by giving a bounty i am in favor of giving it why sir as has already been shown in this debate we can actually save 50 000 000 each year aid not in least jeopardize a single sugar plant in the land if the sugar industry of the south had exhibited during all these years the power of growth of expansion promising extensive enlargement as has and does manufacturing and in that condition needed protection i would probably regard the case on all fours with that interest the cases are wholly dissimilar there is one fact in connection with sugar manuflicturing in this country well understood by members of this body but not in so far as i am aware sufficiently emphasized in this debate as a nation we are in my opinion on the eve of a great and successful era of sugar manufacture from sorghum cane if not from sugarbeets it has not been very many years since manufacturing sugar profitably from beets was regarded impracticable but now the entire success of that method is attested by the more than 600 000 tons produce in germany over 460 000 tons in austria 400 000 tons in france over 00 000 tons in russia and over 1 25 000 tons in holland so that today onehalf of the sugar product of the world is made from beets during the past five years and particularly during 1887 under the supervision of the department of agriculture such experiments have been made as fully justify the conclusion that sugarmaking from sorghum cane as a profitable business is assured and that good article of sugar can be manufactured from cane grown in kansas and if in kansas then in iowa missouri nebraska and other states as profitably as from another quality of cane in louisiana as gentlemen present know there has recently been issued by the commissioner of agriculture a pamphlet containing in detail reports from the several chemists who during 1887 conducted experiments at sugarmaking at fort scott kans rio grande n j and lawrence la this pamphlet contains also such an interesting historical sketch of the sorghum plant and the various attempts to demonstrate its adaptability to successful sugar production that i deem it of interest to present it to be printed as a part of my remarks it was prepared by professor e b cowgill appointed by the secretary of the state board of agriculture of the state of kansas to inspect and report upon sugar manufactured under an act of the legislature of kansas of date march 5 1887 entitled an act to encourage the manufacture of sugar and appropriating 15 000 to cover a bounty authorized by the act of 2 cents per pound upon all sugar manufactured in that state from beets sorghum or other sugaryielding canes or plants grown in kansas the historical sketch is as follows the sorghum plant was introduced into the united states in 185315 by the patent office which then embraced all there was of the united states department of agriculture its juice was known to be sweet and chemists were not long in d iscovering that it contained a considerable percentage of some substance giving the reactions of canesugar the opinion that the reactions were due to canesugar received repeated confirmation in the formation of true canesugar crystals in sirups made from sorghum yet the small amounts that were crystallized compared with the amounts present in the juices as shown by the analyses led many to believe that the reactions were largely due to some other substance than canesugar"], [0.903157651424408, 0.903157651424408, 0, "i desire to make a privileged report from the committee on printing the resolution referred to the committee was read as follows resolved by the

and an investmentof 500 000 giving employment to about six hundred hands i desire simply to submit a few facts against any reduction of the tariff on cement and in favor of my amendment making the duty specific instead of ad valorem the importations of foreign cement in 1886 aggregated 645 197 barrels valued at 722 579 or an average of 1 11 per barrel against a valuation of 1 25 in 1882 in 1887 the total amount of imports was 1 070 400 barrels valued at 1 102 532 40 the average valuation being about 1 03 cents per barrel this has been occasioned by the decision of the treasury department excluding the cost of the barrel in arriving at the value and by the further fact that in order to get the lowest duty the foreign manufacturer invoices his barrel at a high figure and his cement at a low one adding his profit to the nondutiable barrel instead of to the dutiable cement the reduction in the price of foreign cement in the american market which fell from 4 in 1876 when american portland began to be manufactured to 1 85 and 2 in 1887 when american competition became stronger is evidence of the fact that foreign makers with cheap labor are selling their goods here lower than at home to hold the market and are driven even to undervaluation to maintain their hold in face of the american competition which though but a small industry is slowly becoming established no reduction of the duty can safely be made in this case without doing a great injury to a native industry representing in all its branches many millions of dollars and some ten or twelve thousand laborers the duty collected on the importations of this article in 1887 amounted to 220 506 48 the duty under the act of 1883 is 20 per cent ad valorem the proposition is now to reduce it to 10 per

under authority of previous legislation by an institution known as the war college which i believe to be one of the most useful adjuncts of our naval service the state of rhode island aslunderstand ceded coasters harbor island to the united states and a building on the island was granted for the purposes of this college the proposition is now to transfer the war college t6 what is known as goat island and on that island to erect a structure to cost 160 000 l am strongly urged by distinguished officers of the naval service including the author of this war college experiment to oppose the transfer of the war college from coasters harbor island which is well situated which has a fine site and is i believe a proper location for this building to goat island where the torpedo station is now located there is no connection necessarily between this war college and a torpedo station and the proposition to erect this large and expensive building upon this small islanda mere bowlder so to speak in newport harbor when we have authority to use coasters harbor island where there is a fine site is as one of my correspondents expresses it very much like a proposition to put the puritans turret on the deck of the yantic i am told that goat island is a narrow strip of land forming a sort of breakwater for the inner harbor being less than half a mile long with an average width of about 110 or 115 yards and that it is already overcrowded with buildings for the purposes of the torpedo station coasters harbor island on the contrary is a magnificent piece of property containing about 92 acres with two or three fine sites including the one on which there is now a building erected it seems to me that goat island is not at all such a place as should bq selected for the erection of a building so expensive as this i am told by a gentleman familiar with the subject that there is absolutely no question of choice between them and i am urged to ask this house to pause before fixing irrevocably the location of so expensive an establishment upon so inadequate a site for officers in whose ability and iudgment i repose great confidence assure me that no committee of congress if the matter were examined into would ever think of making such a location in 1885 an appropriation was made of 45 000 for a riggingloft and drillhall on this island and yet at this time as i understand they have transferred the naval training station to coasters harbor island and a clipping from a newspaper which i have here and which i commend to my friend from new jersey who referred to the officers going over to newport to take part in the german says the building recently occupied by the war college is now used for trainingstation purposes the singing classes having rooms on the first floor and the classes in boxing and fencing being accommodated bn the second floor now i believe implicitly knowing that i differ with some few of the distinguished officers in the service knowing also that i am in accord with a large number of the most distinguished officers including admirals porter and luce than whom no more accomplished sailors exist or have ever graced our record that this appropriation which has transferred the war college to goat island is a part of an enterprise which is resulting in overturning our training system as well the occupancy of the large grounds on coasters harbor island for a training school has carried with it the taking of the old schoolship new hampshire from her moorings and placing her alongside the dock where she is tied up fitted with electric lights steamheating apparatus and for all i know a bicycle track and the war college is occupied for the purpose of a singing school and for the boxing classes the tendency is to take more and more the apprentices from the trainingships and from the ocean and get them as far inland as possible away from the proper school of the seamen of this country and that is on board of the ship itself these two things go side by side as i understand it and the location of the war college upon goat island is the complement of the plan of locating the apprentices school upon coasters harbor island i deprecate that tendency i deprecate the tendency which leads to dismantling our old ships and sloops of war for use as trainingships and on which our boys were taught to be seamen i deprecate the plan which brings these ships from their moorings and ties them up to the wharves and which takes the boys from the trainingships and puts them intothese classes in schools not adapted to the requirements of the profession they are to be taught but which have a tendency gradually to teach our young men to seek any kind of service except that upon the ocean i believe the tendency is all wrong i think we are getting away further and further from the proper policy in regard to the training of our officers and naval apprentices so that we arc reaching that condition which forcibly recalls the old homely song of the girloh mother may i go out to swim yes my darling daughter hang your petticoats on the limb but dont go near the water i believe we should establish this war college on this large and sightly island where there is a fine location and ample room and where the buildings would be creditably located and then i want to see the trainingships taken away from their moorings by the wharf and put out where the boys chn go to and from the vessel only by bending to the ashen oar and exercising some of the qualities of seamanship and that is in harmony with the desires of the eminent officers of the navy to whom i have already referred and i want to see our old sloops the craft of the olden time restored to the waters as they can be by a slight expenditure
