trip which will take them on a monthlong tour of the red bloc including the soviet union poland yugoslavia bulgaria and rumania the junket gives substance to the rumor that secretary freeman is now considered a new frontier liability and is about to be kicked upstairs into a diplomatic position it is more likely househunting and a warmup for an ambassadorship than the serious study of communist agriculture predicted in department of agriculture publicity releases mr freeman is traveling halfway around the world supposedly to trade ideas with communists in five countries on how to control farms and farmers in planning the itinerary he apparently overlooked communist cuba and castros minister of agriculture che guevera he could search the world over and not find a more dedicated communist farm leader than guevera and he would have to travel only 90 miles off floridas coast to find him whether the real reason is house hunting or idea hunting it is hard to see how the unitedstates taxpayer can possibly benefit from this extensive junketing by mr freeman and his entourage what can they learn that would be useful to the united states the trip is confined to communist countries where government controls have been notably unsuccessful in solving food problems nor is any benefit to the communists in prospect mr freeman has been notably unsuccessful in his own efforts to regiment unitedstates farmers if he could go as champion of a free agriculture the communists might learn something worthwhile as it is he travels as the rejected advocate of mandatory acreage controls jail sentences for dairy farmers and other forms of regimentation one possible reason for the trip remains in the wake of his overwhelming defeat in the may 21 wheat referendum mr freeman may be searching for ways to win the next one if so he will find an expert in mr khrushchev who has not lost a referendum yet"], [0.007739628199487925, 0.007739628199487925, 0, "reserving the right to

the floor of the house the proposals for increasing the public debt limit i am in favor of the rule we have to have this matter before us because the permanent debt ceiling is still 285 billion which is completely unrealistic i had hoped that the congress the last time we had this matter up which was in may would have accepted the republican proposal to make the permanent debt ceiling a realistic ceiling so that we could use a debt ceiling as it should be to bring about an exercise of expenditure reform if it was the will of the congress that the executive exercise expenditure reform we are going to have tomorrow again a real test of those who have been talking in their communities about economy saying that they are opposed to the presidents theory of deficit financing here is an opportunity for them to demonstrate by a vote whether or not they really mean it regrettably we do not hit this thing through the appropriation bills the fact is that this years appropriation bills apply only partially to the fiscal year immediately ahead of us that is fiscal year 1964 the requests for new obligational authority of about 108 billion for this present congress are actually obligational authority that will be spent partially in fiscal 1964 in fiscal 1965 fiscal 1966 and fiscal 1967 we have to relate any new obligational authority to the carryover balances from previous authorities to spend that the congress has granted if we grant the president 108 billion which he has requested he will have in addition around 87 to 89 billion of carryover authority to spend or 195 or 197 billion it is only the president who has told the congress that his expenditure rate will be 98 8 billion congress has no control over that expenditure figure for the fiscal year 1964 we have granted this authority to spend but there certainly is some real flexibility in the hands of the president to cut that expenditure rate and the interesting thing is this in the testimony before the committee on ways and means by the secretary of the treasury i asked him have you revised downward the expenditure rate of 98 8 billion that you have projected for fiscal 1964 and the answer was no they had not touched that figure in spite of the fact that some of their requests for new obligational authority have been revised downward such as foreign aid in spite of the fact that this congress because it has not acted upon appropriation bills has put the administration in the position where the executive departments are spending at the 1963 expenditure level of 92 3 billion not 98 8 billion i want to call attention to the minority views in the committee report because we go into this business of expenditure rates and we also point out what is very clearly the fact that because we did give a tight ceiling earlier this year and last year there have been what are called expenditure reforms but as we point out that is because of the singleentry bookkeeping techniques of the administration by calling sale of capital assets expenditure reductions actually this is not true expenditure reform let us illustrate there is supposed to be a cut of about 1 billion in agriculture actually there is an increase of 1 5 billion in the current expenditure rate in agriculture then how can it show a cut of 1 billion because they anticipate selling off 2 5 billion of assets we are discussing the rule why this should be before the house i want to call attention to some of the features in it essentially the republican position is going to be as our minority views point out that that 307 billion instead of 309 billion can be lived with it will be a little tight and we may force some real expenditure reform as the result of itnot this business of just selling off capital assets and doing nothing about the expenditure rate i would like to call attention to a speech that i made on the floor of the house on monday appearing on page august 5 it is entitled us balance of payments underlying our problem in balance of payments and the gold flow is this fiscal irresponsibility of continuing to spend more money than we are taking in at the federal level it points out and i try to point out in detail why the theories of this administration are wrong when they tell the people dont worry about the debt i also point out in these remarks i made on monday the speciousness of the arguments of the administration which has been made for some time for many months to the public when they say dont worry about the size of the federal debt we owe it to ourselves or it is a lesser ratio of the gross national product than it was in 1946 and other arguments of that kind let me say this that the size of the debt of the unitedstates government makes a tremendous difference and underlies among other things our serious situation in the matter of balance of payments this follows a discipline over which we do not have control the foreign marketplace enters this picture and we are beginning to have to face up to some of the results of our expenditure policies under this administration tomorrow we are going to see a test again of whether or not this congress does believe in the puritan ethic which is that we have to move toward a balanced budget not in 1972 which the administration theory would give us but a balanced budget immediately that can only be done with expenditure reform furthermore we cannot have a tax cut that is going to help this country unless it is in context with expenditure reform"], [0.014919936656951904, 0.9850800633430481, 1, "i move the

latterboth to the donor and to the donee welfare and relief areunfortunatelyrelated to the bracero programalthough the bracero program involved neither charity nor welfare the bracero program alleviated the need for both it is still the best solution yet devised for solving the very tough socioeconomic problem of supplying adequate farm labor at peak harvest seasons to prevent tremendous spoilage of necessary food products the following editorial from the california farmer of june 6 1964 should be enlightening to congressmen consumers and taxpayersas well as tax users alameda county is lucky they have a director of their county welfare department who believes that an ablebodied man who applies for relief should work if work is available alameda county has 160 acres of strawberries the county has 1 million people the county has 26 780 welfare cases which isnt excessive as some are old and some are blind and some disabled but the shocking thing is that this country alone has a welfare bill of 50 million a year the county pays 18 percent and the rest is from state and national funds we do not want to steal all the thunder from don razee who ran down this story don will give you all the painful details but we did want to point out to the fatheads and diehards and bleeding hearts who murdered the bracero program that here is classic proof of the impossibility of forcing our unemployed to do the farm jobs but to get back to the story first of all the farm placement service made a big effort to get domestic help for the strawberry growers in spite of the use of all the news media and some big personal bills by the farmers involved they were unable to scratch anything out of the million population of their own county or for that matter out of the entire state then the alameda county welfare department got into the act remember our editorial in the may 2 issue where we mentioned the new aid for unemployed families bill that went into effect february well alameda county picked up 613 new welfare cases under this program and harold b kehoe the courageous director of alamedas welfare department tried to get some of these ablebodied people to pick strawberries the results were almost nil the crazy part of the whole yarn was the interference in the effort to put these welfare people to work by some outfit called the welfare rights committee who threw pickets around the welfare office in oakland and vigorously protested the efforts of the welfare department to send these ablebodied people out to work now isnt that about the goofiest protest you ever heard of among those leading the protest was henry anderson and this name seemed to ring a bell he is the same guy that appeared before the governors hearing on agricultural labor in sacramento on march 13 anderson was then representing the citizens for farm labor and he outlined a program for agriculture that would have put the states biggest industry right out of business boy we have come to a pretty state of affairs when the bleeding hearts protest putting people on welfare to work do they consider welfare a way of life or do they think these people have a vested interest in public funds the implications of this incident are frightening and should shake up the entire state"]]}
