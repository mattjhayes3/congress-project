purpose of this amendment is to irestore the present duty upon shinglesshingles being on the free list in this bill there are about 440 shingle millsin the state of washington that cut shingles alone a large number of shingles are also cut in the mills that cut lumber as well the 440 straight mills are mostly small and mostly situated in the cou3try the shingle mills in the state of washington employ about 15 000 men and pay them about 15 000 000 annually in wages these men are all vhite and nearly all american citizens their direct competitors separated from them cly by an imaginary line are the orientals working in the shingle mills of british columbia more than 75 per cent of the labor employed in the shingle mills of british columbia are hindus chinese and japanese this oriental labor works for far less than the white labor of washington they live differently from the white labor of washington yesterday i received an affidavit which i hold in my hand from a man who has recently inspected 16 shingle mills in british columbia these mills are typical of all the mills in this province this affidavit shows that 75 per cent of the men employed in those mills are chinese and 5 per cent are hindus or in other words 80 per cent of the labor working in the shingle mills of british columbia is oriental here are the latest figures that i have been able to obtain showing the difference in wages in british columbia and my state cents sawing per 1 000 in british columbia 12 sawing per 1 000 in washington 19 packing per 1 000 in britishcolumbla 7 packing per 1000 in

price oflogs in british columbia 8 to 9 per 1 000 price of logs in washington 11 to 14 per 1 000 owing to the character of the timber it also costs more to work it than it does the timber of british columbia mr j h bloedel who is one of the foremost millmen of the state of washington and who owns shingle mills both in british colum bia and the state of washington has testified that the labor cost in british columbia is 25 cents a thousand in the state of washington it is 55 cents a thousand is it expected that american labor shall compete with this oriental labor or shall the shingle mills of washington close one result or the other is inevitable in the state of washington the shingle mill is largely the scavenger of the forest it cuts what the sawmills leave it takes the stumps and piecesof logs generally charred and blackened by fire in british columbia the oriental labor cuts mostly clean and green timber not only does the shingle mill in the state of washington give employment to labor at high and living wages but it also conserves our forests by largely cutting timber stumps tops and parts of logs that would otherwise rot or be burned clearing the land in order that the house may understand more ful the character of the labor in british columbia that the democratic party proposes that american labor should directly compete with i will show a few pictures taken at the mills in british columbia here are ithe photographs of british columbia riills taken only a few days ago in cats photograph you see the chinaman and in this one you see the hindu i ask the democratic majority do you intend to bring american labor in the state of washington into direct competition with this oriental labor with the hindus and the chinese and that is precisely what this bill will do if you pass it if you pass this bill and compel american labor in the state of washington to compete with oriental labor just across the national border then i hope no gentleman on the democratic side wilvagain attempt to mislead the louseand the country by making speeches against oriental labor as has recently been done by the gentleman from mississippi and the gentleman from kentucky the democratic party is welcome to any glory that it can obtain by bringing american labor into contact with this oriental labor and what reply has the democratic party made to the american laborer working in the shingle mills in the state of washington what consolation has been given him the democratic party speaking through president wilson tells the american workman in the state of washington that he will have the high privilege of whetting his wits in competition with oriental labor the democratic party gives the american workingman in my state the privilege of whetting his wits until he can live as the japanese live until he can live on the pay that the japanese receives the democratic party gives him the privilege of whetting his wits until he can live as the heathen hindu lives the democratic party gives the american worklngman the high privilege of whetting his wits until he can live as cheaply as the chinaman lives there are 300 000 voters in my state that live directly upon wages earned in the forests that by this competition with oriental labor will have their wits so sharpened that they will demonstrate at the next opportunity that they are not so stupid as to vote the democratic ticket admitting shingles free into the state of washington will not lower the price to the consumer in scanada they have a shingle trust no attempt is made to conceal the fact the government does not attempt to prohibit it they permit only so many machines to be run each community is allotted its number and can not operate any more this is avowedly done for the purpose of keeping up the prices when we have free shingles the prices will only be lowered sufficiently to get into our market as soon as our mills close prices will be increased the canadian is selling his shingles in our country not for our advantage but for his own we know by experience what they will do we do not have to guess at one time canada sold to us 5 000 carloads in a single year but the american consumer did not get his shingles for any less our mills were closing six months in the year while the mills across the line were busy the work and wages were simply transferred from washington to british columbiafrom the american workman to the oriental but the american consumer still paid the same price for his shingles the history of the shingle industry is the history of every industry in america that has been protected from the destruction of cheap foreign labor every time we buy a bale of shingles from british columbia we take just that much work and that much labor from the americans and give it to the foreigners the result of this bill will be to again largely transfer the shingle industry from the state of washington to british columbia it will mean that 10 000 000 annually in work and wages will be taken from american labor in the state of washington and given to the oriental labor across the line it means that the democratic party will take the daily bread from 60 000 men women and children in he state of washington and in the name of free trade low prices and college statesmanship give it to the hindu and the chinaman and the japanese they may give us cheap prices they did once before we had a prof wilson then as we have a prof wilson now that was the high priest of democracy and the anointed prophet of free trade yes prices were lowso low that you could get a good meal in many cities ofthe united states for 5 cents that this bill may bring again those splendid days of denmocratic cheapness i admit there is no reason for placing shingles upon the free list but a sectional one and a political one if it were a little peanut industry in the south it would be protected as rice and peanuts are protected if the shingle industry was located in pennsylvania or indiana or minnesota or in any state that had a democratic member of the ways and means committee it would have been protected it is sacrificed for political purposes only because it is a pacific coast industry this bill will destroy this industry as it will many others but there is no hope of amending it so let it be enacted quickly let the tragedy be perpetrated at once in order that the people may the more quickly have the experience and the more quickly determine as they will to wipe the sectional monstrosity from the statute books"], [0.008747480809688568,

measure the farmer would have received a better price for his oats in 1913 than he did during october and november 1912 mr chairman and gentlemen i wish to call attention to the fact that the new tariff law has affected a legitimate industrythe agricultural industry statistics are available on imports and exports for the months of october and november 1913 in detail and comparing them with figures for the same months of 1912 reveal startling results i also have the total imports and exports for the month of december to which i will refer later during the months of october and november 1912 251 290 bushels of corn were imported valued at 136 363 whereas for the same months of 1913 under the underwood freetrade bill 2 105 902 bushels of corn were imported valued at 1 560 683 71 454

valued at 6 704 990 the most striking illustration of the injury inflicted upon the farmer by the enactment of this freetrade measure is the increase in the importation of oats in october and november 1912 but 4 645 bushels valued at 2 238 were imported while for the same months of the year 1913 7 657 101 bushels were imported valued at 2 608 783 breadstuffs which means wheat and flour the value of imports for the months of october and november 1912 amounted to 2 398 405 whereas during the months of october and november 1913 the value of breadstuffs imported amounted to 7 529 558 it will undoubtedly be recalled that a short time ago the secretary of the department of commerce made an announcement with much pride that our exports were increasing more rapidly than our imports in other words that our balance of trade was on the gain we now wonder whether or not the same gentleman will point with pride to the latest available figures the imports and exports for the month of december

49 755 776 96 220 30 sixtythree and ninetenths per cent of the imports for december 1913 were duty free the above table shows that our exports for december 1913 as compared with december 1912 have fallen off over 17 000 000 and at the same time our imports have increased over 29 000 000 approximately half our balance of trade has been lost our good president said that we must whet our wits this

influx of foreign butter from all parts of the world due to the reduction of the tariff from 5 to 2h cents a pound has caused a decline in the new york wholesale price of 10 cents a pound since the first of the year butter has been comingto this city from as far off as australia by way of san francisco three hundred thousand pounds from that country have been laid down here within the last two or three weeks butter has also been shipped from argentina denmark and siberia today the bestgrade butter was selling at 29 to 27 cents a pound wholesale the american demand for butter has caused a rise of 2 to 3 cents a pound in some of the foreign markets it is admitted that the price of butter in this country will be kept in the future at a lower average level than before upon inquiry at the grocers here in washington i find that the consumer has not yet received the benefit of this reduction of th price of butter and that the retail price in this city is practically the same as during the past couple of months but the producer is the man who suffers by the reduction in price the new york times of today which i have here in my possession on page 6 has the following startling headlines three hundred and twentyfive thousand men unemployec in the city of new york the most of whom have families and homes in that city do you gentlemen believe that these conditions can continue

could not have resulted xcept through your freetrade tariff law you claim that your aim was to lower the cost of living in this country the first effect of this law is to displace employment and furnish employment abroad in the production of articles offered to us for consumption you have robbed the american laboring man of his income by taking away from him employment belonging to him which you have given to foreigners in foreign countries you inust sooner or later admit the error of your ways nothing is cheap to a man who has no purchasing power nothing is dear when he can easily obtaia

still greater value is the blessing of being able to buy food by honest and respectable employment in your efforts to lower prices you have overlooked the fundamental and primary fact that the cost of

fact that the gentleman from new york has cited the thrilling and glorious story of the prosperity of our country under the republican protective tariff he characterized it as a song of woe and the gentleman from pennsylvania who took his seat a moment ago criticized his colleague because he declined to make mournful prophecy of what is likely to occur under this legislation the gentleman from pennsylvania is not properly appreciative he probably does not understand the desire on this side of the house to spare your feelings this day to do nothing to add to that stygian gloom of apprehension that is settling down over that side of the house as you realize the hour is soon to strike when you will be called upon to vote for a measure which will greatly injure or entirely paralyze the industries of your country and of your constituents this is the day of the gentleman from alabama no matter what our views may be of this legislation all of us join in our appreciation of the manly attitude of the gentleman in charge on that side we all appreciate that it is largely through his personal influences his energy his considerate ways that you are now prepared to pass on this bill but the gentleman from alabama much as i appreciate him is mortal like the rest of us he declared to us in rather stentorlan and boastful tones that in the passage of this bill his party had fulfilled all the promises of its platform and contravened none of them and yet if there is any promise in their platform that ought to be more binding than another it is that in which they assured the country and following which their presidential candidate promised that your legislation would not injure much less destroy any legitimate industry and yet it is a fact no matter what we may think of the rates of the bill generally that as regards the rates touching two great industries those of sugar and of woolthey are unquestionably destructive whatever may occur to the mills and factories of the country generally so far as the sugar industry of the nation is concerned it is doomed by your legislation and the great wool industry valuable helpful and useful to every citizen under the flag in peace a source of comfort in war a sure defense you have stricken down touchiug these industries you have not kept either the pledges of your presidential candidate or the pledges of your party platforma the gentleman from alabama i mr underwood is also a little forgetful during the course of his remarks he read to us or rather inserted in the recordand i have taken the trouble to get it from the clerksa statement of the estimated receipts and expenditures under his legislation the estimated receipts begin with customs 249 000 000 and end with revenue from the sale of public lands 5 000 000 totaling 1 026 000 000 he then estimated 1 008 000 000 as probable expenditures leaving an estimated surplus of 18 000 000 now i am surprised at that little oversight about the public lands because the gentleman from alabama was like myself a member of the committee on irrigation of arid lands away back yonder in our early days of service here when we helped to pass the national reclamation law under the provisions of which no dollar from the sale of public lands has flowed into the national treasury for the last 12 years unless you gentlemen propose to repeal that law and to cease this great work which the republican party inaugurated for the development of the westunless this is the first notice of repealno dollar of receipts from public lands can become a part of the national income therefore assuming that all the other figures of estimated income are approximately correct you must take 5 000 000 from the 18 000 000 that you have estimated as your surplus in the first year under your legislation and if your other estimates are no more accurate than this if they are based upon so little knowledge or information or recollection of the law or of the past history of national revenue then the probability is that we shall face a deficit under your legislation we have purposely largely refrained from dismal prophecy of the effect of your legislation the time for prophecy has passed we are about to enter upon an actual trial of your legislation as its repealing clauses do not and can not repeal the natural laws of cause and effect we can not believe that the country can as a whole be prosperous under this act we do know that as to the sugar industry in the west it is doomed by your legislation it may struggle along where already establisied for a time at least but it can not grow and thus the best hope of many western communities is blasted as for the wool industry the blow you give it is a staggering one it may and we devoutly hope it will be

and one of the finest men that this country ever produced in the navy or out of the navy and i make that statement after an intimate acquaintance with him of several years and after testing him on that line le says the result has been to prove to the satisfaction of the department that the theoretical penetration of armor as based on provingground data can be realized at long ranges also it has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the department that an armorpiercing shell even when it does not pass through a protective deck behind armor can do a great deal of damage by detonation and explosion behind the armor it has also demonstrated that an armorpiercing shell striking the armored deck of the vessel can seriously damage the ship even though it may not penetrate it can do a great deal of damage by blowing large holes in the deck and throwing large fragments of shell and the deck into the machinery and boilers of the khip those are the three principal things we have concluded so far now then they speak also about the gathmann shell i have here a senate document as to the result of those tests in those tests three firings were made against armor at the same distance there were 507 pounds of guncotton put in the torpedo or explosive shell there was 23 pounds of maximite which is far inferior to the high explosive that we have at the present time that was put in the armorpiercing shells and they were exploded against 1inch armors we have here the photographs showing the result of each test and each firing you will find that the effect of the explosion of the 507 pounds of guncotton was practically nil if you turn here you will see the effect of the armorpiercing shell showing that it pierced the armor tore great holes through it and on the back side tore up the building representing the ship and there is no comparison between the two here are the photographs for the inspection of the members and they show for themselves how the armorpiercing shells tore things all to pieces and the 507 pounds of guncotton had no effect yet it is proposed to put something like 100 pounds of guncotton into these 12inch shells as against the tests that were made by the gathmann gun of 507 pounds of guncotton gentlemen let me say to you that we have gone into this matter and we are developing these things as fast as we can we are spending money every year they are

pending there was a considerable addition to a forest reserve in southern montana and that there was a considerable amount of railroad land in the land so included and that it did not contain timber of any considerable value although a large part of it was mountainous broken land with some scrubby timber upon it i think that was the last of the inclusions of railroad land before the repeal of the act the act in amended form became a law march 3 1905 had i been in congress at the time the law was passed i probably would have been impressed as were others with the necessity of allowing settlers to make exchanges there being then a comparatively small amount of railroad and other grant lands in the reserves when the necessity became apparent for the modification or repeal of the law my thought in introducing the bill was to prevent any more valuable timber lauds to be taken in exchange without regard to the merits of the agreement which the secretary of the interior had made relative to lands in the san francisco mountains forest reserve the probability is that that agreement could have been enforced as a claim and having been largely executed its recognition was seemingly imperative the repeal of the act as to other lands put an end to exchanges which would have aggregated three or four million acres at least some features of this matter illustrate how men with the best intentions in the world may become unwittingly parties to transactions not in the public interest they illustrate the importance of being careful and conservative even in the advocacy of general propositions which in the main may be entirely praiseworthy so anxious were some forestreserve enthusiasts to extend the area of the forest reserves that they did not always scrutinize carefully the motives and interests of those who urged establishment and enlargement of reserves furthermore many of those who were the most earnest advocates of a very wide extension of reserves believed that extensions should be made even though in the consolidation of the reserve the government did not in the first instance make a good trade this is illustrated in a statement in a letter

the real purpose of the shell is to get it through the armor and have it explode on the inside no such result has been attained 3124 in practice at 12 000 yards it has been proven incontrovertibly to anybody with reasonable intelligence that explosive shells have come in use by foreign nations and we want the department to try out this shell here if you vote down the amendment that we got into the bill they will keep on buying these armorpiercing shells which will not pierce although we have a very large stock of them now and a sufficient surplus i append a letter to me from mr isham inventor of the shell honl ellsworth r batisrick member subcommittee on ordnance tests house of representatives sir our naval strength is vested in battleships the value of a battleship is dependent upon the projectile it employs if this is inefficient the battleship is worthless the navy department now acknowledges that armorpiercing projectiles can not penetrate even 10inch armor at 12 000 yards then why are they placing 13hinch armor on our battleships three years ago admiral twining stated before the house naval committee that the 12inch guns could penetrate 10inch armor at 19 000 yards i was accused on the floor of the house of slandering that officer because i branded it as a misstatement they are now exerting every effort to show that our armorpiercing shells are the best in the world and that the supply of them must not be restricted by compelling them to be able to penetrate a 10inch plate at 12 000 yards if these armorpiercing shells are incapable of doing this they and the battleships which carry them are useless numerous decisions having been rendered to show that the vitals of foreign battleships are protected by even thicker armor for which reason all tests of torpedo shells have been demanded by the department to be made against 12inch plates moreover 12 000 yards is less than the range at which naval battles are being decided in the present war it has also been shown by the proceedings of the naval institute and other technical journals that have been quoted on the floor of the house that the empress of india was sunk by british warships employing british shells in a test at a range between 16 000 and 18 000 yards the shells blowing holes in her like lock gates nearly 17 years ago i was sent to this government by our ambassador to mexico to demonstrate my torpedo shell which had demonstrated there as a principal advantage over armorpiercing shells that it could destroy a battleship by exploding near as by hitting it last week i had my first test in this country to establish that it could be done it was admitted for all these years that if a shell carrying 100 pounds or more of high explosive could be exploded within 15 feet of a battleship it would destroy it as a mine would do but they claimed this could not be done that the shell would ricochet the same as the armorpiercing shell did and there was no trial until last week when it was found that this result could be secured all countries recognize and the european war has demonstrated that the torpedo has com pelled a minimum battle range of at least 10 000 yards this test last week showed that at any battle range my shells bite and dive beneath the water which the armorpiercing shells will not do the test also showed that after running underneath the water from 100 to 200 feet they will explode some of them did not because of a too close fitting locking pin black powder was used in the shell at the suggestion of the board but it is obvious that any explosive may be used hence the test proved 1 that battleships may be destroyed by such shells 2 that armor plate is no protection against such underwater attack 3 that the target offered to underwater attack is at least five times as great as the armored parts forming the target for armorpiercing shell attack if any further advantages over armorpiercing shells were necessary they are supplied by a test made recently at indlanhead which showed that the same torpedo shell would destroy an 8inch plate or explode immediately if it struck even the thinnest plating employed on a torpedo boat or a submarine to attain these results has required persistent effort for more than 16 years the question then arises whether this delay has resulted from the influence of interests involved when the congress in 1901 authorized the purchase of my torpedo shellwhich purchase was never consummatedgen miles and others stated that it discounted the employment of armor plate hence it is possible that for all these years the armorplate trust may have used its specious arguments to prevent the use of torpedo shells again with the development of guns has been decided by the general board of the navy that 28 of our older battleships are outranged by late ships and are to be set aside as obsolete but since torpedo shells make all the guns on these old ships effective up to the limit of vision at sea and prevent the ships from becoming obsolete is it not possible that the shipbuilding companies ard trying to prevent the adoption of torpedo shells furthermore it is established that submarines can be discovered by air craft and also by underwater detectors and although heretofore they could not be destroyed by shell fire last weeks tests showed that this can now be done hence it is believed that an investigation will show that therein can be discovered the sourceof a growing opposition in certain quarters to torpedo shells from time to time have been uttered such statements as might be most useful to prevent the test and use of torpedo shells year after year i have called the attention of the congress to these incorrect statements and to the resulting menace to our national defenses on the 30th day of last september i made five serious charges respecting the failure to investigate these matters before the senate committee on naval affairs these charges were recently inserted in

an aggregation of individuals prepares against an aggregation of individuals with this difference if the thing went too far with individuals the government would step in and put both the individuals

will and determination disarm itself by its own action and its own volition we can not blame the nations of europe for what they think of us i have heard my good friend from alabama talk about the great japanese navy and the great german navy and our little navy by way of parenthesis i am rather of the opinion that germany would not care to dismantle her coast of her navy at any moment and bring it away across the sea to fight us at any rate they no longer hold up the german navy to scare us that has about played out since that time they have been playing japan on the other side of the pacific you will find japan playing the united states when the united states builds two battleships england builds four japan breaks her back trying to build two and germany steps into line with two and france with two and next year if the united states finally compromises on one then england has to do the same thing over again and so with the other nations so the merry march of arms ammunition epaulets officers and expenses goes on and the only people benefited are those who sell the arms and ammunition and those people who have navy yards in their districts and the merchants who sell goods to those in the army and navy and who work in the navy yards and the officers and men in the army and navy the merry dance of war goes on if two bankers if two individuals two farmers two blacksmiths

have the proper anmount of initiative to begin to reach a settlement where they may avoid this great expense i wanted to make this speech for two reasons first because i am in sympathy with the resolution and second because i have always been opposed not only to this useless naval and military expense but to the expenditure of any public funds out of the federal treasury except for a proper governmental function and if i could have my way no dollar would be expended out of the federal treasury unless a man could put his finger upon the clause of the constitution authorizing it or could put it upon a clear implicationone of the necessary things that must follow that specific grant of power if that was done government expenses would be very very much less than they are now and would be very much more satisfactory i was denounced from one end of the country to the other by that press that advocates big battleships and advocates great expenses of public money what praise i got for the position i took in the last fight on the naval appropriation bill came from the peace papers of the country the cosmopolitan press which is controlled by the great purse strings of the country undertook to denounce and did denounce me from one end of the country to the other but i thank god that that time has not yet come in my public life and i hope it never will come when i shall be deterred from the performance of what i think to be my duty irrespective of criticisms and of adverse coinments i would be unworthy to represent any constituency on this floor if the criticism of the military press of the country that press which represents those agencies which enjoy the benefits of the expenditure of public money were to deter me in my duty and in the event it ever does i ought

for its highways to carry the mails or military supplies or build railroads under the commerce clause of the constitution as the supreme court has said but whoever until this month or this year ever proclaimed the doctrine that the united states government had the right to condemn a highway across gods highway upon the seas of the world which is gods highway 3 miles from shore no man is

whom we have had in many decades in this countrya sincere true patriot i do not propose and have not proposed to indulge in any sycophantic praise of him i took my political life in my hands in the primaries in 1912 in my district in advocating his nomination and some who are now shouting his praises were fiercely attacking him i stood up for him and carried my particular section for him in the primary i thought in 1912 as i think now that he was the best man of all the candidates we could nominate for the presidency and the only man we could elect he is a manly man he has opinions of his own and when occasion arose which called upon him to do so he asserted those principles and voted them or remained quiet and did not support the candidates who represdnted the principles he could not accept i claim the same right to vote and voice those principles that i have believed in all my life whether in the democratic caucus or in the house i exercised this right in the democratic caucus the democratic caucus has formulated a rule by which aman who could not support a measure that contravenes his view of the constitution of the united states or which violates the pledge which he had made to his people could be excused from supporting a caucus measure but these small men who undertake to enlarge their proportions by standing in the glaring light that beats aroundthe white house go

done to us i do not care if theystone me like demetrius would have stoned st paul because we interfered with their business of patronage why i am ready to be stoned i am ready to be pilloried in the
