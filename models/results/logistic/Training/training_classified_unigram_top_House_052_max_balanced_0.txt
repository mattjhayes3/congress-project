teach their workmen and then sent out on our farms and among our working people and called in the young men to learn the business of making american watches the boys soon learned as yankee boys always do how to do the work and it was not long before they got ahead of their teachers but it was too slow for them to make watches by hand and their inventive genius was set in the direction of making machinery for this purpose which was soon produced watchmaking machinery was invented with nerves and fingers of steel and almost guided as it were by human intelligence so that every part of the watch produced by our machines was the counterpart of the other it made no difference how you mixed up the works of different watches if you got the watch out of it still it was a good timekeeper it was a success it reduced the cost reduced the expense of making the watches so that it not only drove foreign watches out of the market but by the aid of these machines we have sent our watches to england to germany and even to switzerland and we can produce the best watch today on the face of the earth and yet with your 15 per cent duty how many watches would have been manufactured or how much

speak afterward the chairman of the committee undertook to explain how it could be that the removal of the duty upon wool would not diminish the price of wool to the farmer while at the same time it would diminish the cost of the cloth to the consumer what was his explanation it was that there must be some foreign wool used in the manufacture of the cloth for the masses and by having cheaper foreign wool to mix with our own the lower price of the small proportion of foreign wool used would diminish the cost of the manufactured cloth without reducing the price of the domestic wool now this assumption rests upon a mistake of fact and the conclusion would not follow even if the fact existed there are woolen manufacturers in this house and they will tell you if they are willing to state the facts in this matter that we do not use foreign wool in the manufacture of goods worn by the masses the foreign wools which are imported are used either wholly or by mixing with domestic wools in the manufacture of finer goods almost entirely the woolen goods used by the masses are made of domestic wool but they can be made wholly of foreign wools and would be if foreign wools were cheaper in other words if the price of foreign wools underfree trade was lower than that of domestic wools not a yard of cloth would be made here of domestic wools either partly or wholly because the foreign wool can be imported of qualities that will exactly take the place of any wools that can be produced in this country therefore if the domestic supply is to be used at all the price of the domestic supply must under free trade go down to the price of the foreign supply it is impossible sir that you can bring in foreign woolclothing wool i am speaking ofcosting today without the duty 8 to 11 cents per pound less than the price received by our farmers under protection for a similar grade of wool without reducing the price of all the wool that is produced by the farmers of this country to the extent of this difference of price from 8 to 11 cents per pound and unless this be done you can not by your bill reduce the cost of the cloth therefore gentlemen you must take one or the other horn of this dilemma if you contend that the placing of wool on the free list will not reduce the price of the wool produced by the american farmer then you must admit that such legislation will not reduce the cost of the cloth if on the other hand you conteid that the placing of wool on the free list will reduce the price of domestic wool to the extent of the dutyfrom 8 to 11 cents per poundand thereby reduce the cost of cloth then you must admit that the price of every pound of wool grown by american farmers must go down to the foreign standard there can beno escape from this conclusion therefore when gentlemen undertake to claim that by placing wool on the free list it will not reduce the price of the farmers wool but will diminish the cost of the cloth which is made from the wool they evidently place themselves in a contradictory position the only argument that can be used in this connection with any force is that employed by the gentleman from nebraska the argument that the duty upon wool as well as the duty upon cloth is the exaction of a robber and that what is proposed to be done by this bill is to compel the robber farmer to disgorge his share of the robbery and

it carried on its operations for sixty and odd years before it discovered that anything like general geoletic work away from the coast lines was necessary the survey did triangulate along the shore that triangulation was necessary as the basis from which the hydrographic survey was to be made but up to 1874 as i have said no strictly geodetic work was entered upon geodesy means the science of measuring the shape of the earth its curvature etc by exact lines this is done by astronomical and telegraphic methods the operators frequently taking as much as three months to locate one base line

put off such scientific work as this measuring the shape and curvature of the earth and making reports about it to be sent to scientific societies abroad in order that new calculations may be made and

have stated the facts very clearly and the gentleman understands the statement as well as anybody the minority comment on the testimony of mr thompson of the metropolitan bank of this city and draw the conclusion that the reason mr thompson required an indorser before he would loan the commissioner 500 was not on account of a lack of confidence in the commissioners commercial standing but because mr raum had failed to promote mr thompsons young lady friend if i read the testimony right thompson had talked to baum about this promotion and the promotion had not been given and he did not believe raum was a truthful man to show that this construction of thompsons testimony is correct i quote from page 452 of the evidence by mr little q when mr lockwood came to speak about the matter of the discount did you say to mr lockwood that mr raum had not shown you any coartesy in the promotion of the lady a i told him i had no confidence in him q but that is not my question a i may have said to him he was unreliable i have no doubt i did say so o him to throw further light on this transaction i will quote from the testimony of gen raum page 256 of the evidence q are you able to say explicitly that there was no reference made to the girl the day the indorsement was made and the day the money was gotten from the bank a i know there was no reference made in regard to the indorsement of the note and getting the money none whatever mr lockwood who was negotiating this loan for gen baum testifies on this point on pages 434 and 435 of the evidence as follows by the chairman q was there any talk between you and mr thompson that you should ask gen raum to promote this person in consideration of the loan a i said to mr thompson that gen raum disclaimed to me that he had any feeling towards him at all and that it was a misapprehension on the part of mr thompson if he had such an idea q did you convey to mr thompson the idea that the commissioner would promote the person a i told mr thompson just what gen raum told me that he would have a large number of promotions to make and that he should be very glad to consider the case q this conversation was all had before the note was made out and before it was paid a the conversation with mr thompson was after the money had been paid to gen baum for raum had leit q that is you told thompson after raum had left a yes sir q but your talk with thompson and gen raum was before the note was executed a all going on at the same time now i submit that this statement from all three parties concerned in this transaction taken together shows that gen raum at that time in order to conciliate thompson to secure the loan was indicating to mr lockwood the mediator that he would have an opportunity soon to promote the young lady and that he would be glad to consider the case that consideration might not have operated on the mind of thompson to induce the loan but it was in the mind of the commissioner to give out this information for whatever influence it might have in facilitating the financial transaction"]]}
