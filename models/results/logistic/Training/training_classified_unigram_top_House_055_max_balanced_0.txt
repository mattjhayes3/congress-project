question last monday the majority of this house evidenced to the country that they would suffer american citizens in cuba to starve rather than permit this house to vote on a resolution recognizing the belligerency of the cuban patriots today they have shown themselves willing to trample upon the rights of the minority and to disregard the ancient and wellestablished methods of procedure rather than be brought face to face with a vote on this proposition it is well enough for the majority to execute its will but it ought to do so frankly and fairly there is not a gentleman on that side of the chamber who does not know that if this house were once permitted to vote upon the direct proposition to recognize the belligerency of cuba it would carry by an overwhelming majority and so it is that when we are denied the opportunity to bring that question before the house it is not the will of the majority which you are enforcing but it is the will of the majority which you are suppressing if you believe you can vote it down why not meet it like men and vote it down the country would have vastly more respect for you if you faced it in that way than it will have for you when you refuse to face it at all and run from it every time it is presented to you it is a singular course which the majority have determined to pursue they have resolved to take 50 000 from the public treasury to relieve the distress of american citizens in cuba they admit that the distress which they seek to relieve is due to the war which now desolates that unhappy island and yet while they recognize that great distress has been produced by this war they blindly refuse to recognize the existence of the war if war does not exist in cuba spain has no right to confine american citizens in overcrowded townsand cities thus exposing them to the horrors of pestilence and famine and her resort to such an extreme measure is a confession before all the world that war wages between her and her revolted colony if war does not exist between spain and cuba then war ought to exist between the united states and spain because the cruelties which have been practiced upon our people are defensible only upon the ground that they are the necessities of war there are two and only two manly and selfrespecting courses open to us either we ought to demand of spain an immediate and a complete reparation for the wrongs which she has inflicted upon our citizens or else it is our duty to recognize the existence of a war which alone can excuse those wrongs the attitude of the republican members of this house upon this question must greatly surprise the republican masses throughout the country but a short time ago you were eager to assist cuba and you bitterly denounced a former administration for its inactive and indifferent policy when the republican party assembled in its national convention last summer it went far beyond the resolution upon which we are asking you to vote you were not then content to let the people of cuba fight their own battles and win their own victories but pretending a zeal for liberty which you do not cherish you professed yourselves willing to help them you declared that it is the duty of the united states not merely to recognize that a war existed but you went further and declared that it was our duty to terminate that war without being asked to recognize the independence of the cuban republic you went to the extent of committing yourselves to aid in the establishment of its independence here is your platform it declares thatwe watch with deep and abiding interest the heroic battle of the cuban a~triots against cruelty and oppression and our best hopes go out for the ui success of their determined contest for liberty the government of spain having lost control of cuba and being unable to protect the property or lives of resident american citizens or to comply with its treaty obligations we believe that the government of the united states should actively use its influence and good offices to reptore peace and give independence to the island those are fine words but they are in strange contrast with your actions today then you promised more than the deliberate judgment of the country would have sanctioned now you perform less than the dictates of reason and justice demand you have haltednot because conditions have changed for the changes have simply aggravated the conditionsbut because powerful influences have been exerted to prevent your proceeding the stock gamblers have become alarmed and they would rather see their country insulted than to have their operations disturbed the immensely rich always and naturally on the side of power have appealed to you to desist and preferring as you always have the interests of wealth above the rights of humanity you are endeavoring to evade and postpone this question gentlemen you may escape it here by violating your rules and overriding the minority but you can not escape it before the american people to them you must answer and neither a demand for the previous question nor a point of order will save you from their indignant judgment they understand as well as we do the real question which we are trying to settle here today they know that we will join with you in relieving american citizens from destitution and hunger and that we only ask you to join with us in affording to the cuban people the right to relieve themselves from spanish despotism we do not ask you to declare war against spain or to do anything which will justify spain in declaring war against us our recognition of cuban belligerency can not constitute a just cause of offense to spain and if that nation should be so rash as to provoke a war with us because we had exercised a right conceded by all of the authorities on international law the responsbility sir will be upon them and not upon us and much as i should deplore a war even under such circumstances i would not shrink from it for bad as war is its calamities can not be compared with the loss of national selfrespect nor would i weigh its dreadful consequences against the performance of our duty toward a weak and struggling nation we do not call upon you now to redeem your promise to assist in the establishment of cuban independence we simply ask you to recognize the right of the cuban people to fight for their own independence and surely this government ought to be swift to recognize that sacred right wherever a brave and an oppressed people are striving to assert it i do not forget that whefi our fathers were engaged in their glorious struggle for independence men of other nations were gladly welcomed to their ranks and remlembering that i shall never vote to leave the sentence of a pirates death suspended

commodore dewey of our navy has entwined the stars and stripes around the trident of neptune to be hereafter a menace to the world fapplanse it will be a dangerous precedent if this house continues to pursue a lie to remove indiscriminate charges of desertion and the e nte upon the rolls of the pension list the undeserving and thus shut out those who must be needy close its gates to those who undoubtedly must come hereafter i have listened a great deal since 1 have been a member of the house to the constant cry of patriotism not only respecting these measures but respecting any and every measure that can be tendered upon this floor indeed i can not recall an incident where a measure has been tendered to this house however meritorious or meretricious but what there has been summoned the shibboleth of patriotism in order to give it an impetus there has never been a tariff law suggested on the floor but that patriotism has been conjured as an excuse why we should vote against the taxpayer increasing his burdens there was a law for congress to create a monetary commission and giving them 100 000 of the peoples money under the cry of patriotism for them to go out and legislate more debt and less money for the nation but up to this hour we neither have the information as to what legislation they did in our behalf or what they did with the 100 000 if some slight account could be made by these estimable gentlemen who i have no doubt far excel this humble body as to what they have done with the money which went out of the treasury there may be enough remaining to meet these different pension claims of the dependent and worthy if we can ascertain what that foreign and bimetallic commission has done with the 175 000 which they seem to have taken from the treasury to gallivant over the continents there may be something left with which we may requite some of these existing demands i have listened too often to the constant cry of patriotism as the reason for legislating measure after measure here and only the other day we heard from our honorable friends on the other side that patriotism should always drive us into the line of action which shall execute the desire of the other side irrespective of any virtue or vice of the measure on this side of the house there arises now and then as did my friend from new york the distinguished and honorable gentleman airos cuinmings who advised this assembly that he put his country above party and under that cry certain gentlemen on the floor under his leadership calling themselves democrats found it agreeable to support the measure mortgaging the generation and their children yet unborn irrespective of the fundamental justice of it i realize that my friend from new york who holds a high place on the floor and deservedly so not only from his ability but by his long service may have a right to dictate to a great many members both as to democratic fealty and patriotism but i am moved at this time to ask my friend when they say they put their country above party above which party do you put yourself it always seems highly appropriate from my distinguished friends from new yorkwho have my constant affections and my equally constant efforts whenever i can serve themwhenever stimulated by that magnificent indescribable buoyancy of putting their country above party it is always to descend it immediately to the depths of the republican party there never seems a time in the history of my friends when their country is entitled to be elevated above the republican party i rise to ask of my distinguished republican friends when is it that their party ever found it agreeable under the cry of patriotism to accept any measure which the democratic party tendered or vote for any proposition coming from this side of the house when at any hour or under any circumstances has it been that any measure tendered by my friends on the other side did not have the merit of patriotism to recommend it to give it impetus encouragement and with the aid of deluded men an undeserved success under the cry of patriotism which is ever conjured up for the purpose of putting through any measure here i discover that a set of men who are to be the beneficiaries of this patriotism under which and by which we yield up the countrys rights sacrifice the poor to the pillage of the taxgatherer and to those who plunder the treasury i discover that this set of gentlemen who are always above the law who condemn the income tax who condemn the power of taxation who cry out that every man who opposes their methods is a demagogue or an anarchist i discover this graceful set of gentlemen who are the embodiment of public virtue as the coal trust selling coal to the spaniards to load their ships to bombard our cities and blow our marines from the seas i perceive on the other hand that these eminent corporations known as railroads have combined in a trust in the west and have entered into a league to sell mules and munitions of war to spain that her cavalry may cut down our american soldiers when they land to execute the demands of the president more than that that one of the gun factories of this nation the owners of which have been in the habit of crying out repudiation and demagogy to every effort of honest men to right the wrongs of the poor is making guns for the spanish nation and when called to account for it give answer they are doing so for the money there is in it these are specimens of the people who are arraying members of this house under the cry of patriotism and branding each of us who oppose them as demagogues hypocrites and anarchists i take the liberty of making some short contrast between the two classes who are these men who were branded demagogues anarchists and repudiators who are accused of having o respect for the supreme court no regard for law nor reverence for sacred institutionswho are they behold themi i ask again who are these men who are being termed demagogues and anarchists and are ever charged with want of patriotismthat word which as walpole well said is ever summoned up when there is a desire to execute some evil thing or to play into the hands of the guilty those who rob and pillage the country in the hour of its weakness and the day of its credulity i ask who are these maligned men they are the men who are asking for relief in pensions here today they are those poor unfortunate men who in this hour have forgotten the men who cursed them have forgiven the men who defamed themwho are unconscious of the way in which they are baing robbed and pillaged here by those who should be their guardians who know no enemy but the enemy of their country they are the men who are today burnishing up the old muskets drawing the old sword out of the scabbard they are the men who are taking the last leave of an aged mother they are the men who are holding to their bosoms in perhaps a last embrace the wives of their souls and dropping a soldiers tear upon the face of their children are going to the front to die for their country these are the true patriots of this nation for myself i have grown tired of this constant prating cry of patriotism which is ever invoked on the floor of this house every time there is an attempt to commit a constitutional wrong i have watched day after day to see my friends on the other side rise to condemn this thing i have listened for some voices of condemnation from that side but have heard none save now and then a rare exception such as my distinguished friend from massachusetts who speaks so patriotically against a wrong and unhappily votes for its perpetration now i ask you do you not agree with me will not this house agree with me that the hour has arrived when we should heed the demands of these worthy pensioners likewise the worthy toiler must we meet them with the statement that their demands can not be complied with because of the present condition of the treasury the distinguished premier of this house the leader of the party on the other side the gentleman from maine informed us the other day of the decaying condition of the treasury and yesterday supplemented his remarks by telling us of the possible demands that will be made in order to keep the present army in the field that such demands will exceed the revenues and force further taxation of the people can we support that army in the field can we equip that army with a depleted treasury and at the same time pay these pensions when there are these increasing mortgages and claims upon the nation let us consider for a moment the condition in which we are placed when the nation is languishing when there are these tremendous burdens to be borne can we meet these new demands it is well worthy of consideration is it not time for us under these conditions to pause and reflect where the money is to come from to meet them they are obligations we have assumed to pay they are obligationswe are called upon toassume and howcanwepaythema under present conditions will there be money derived from anysource to pay your volunteers in the field and to pay your pensions after the war unless some man or some party shall rise superior in this country in the present conditions and stop the outrages now being perpetrated upon the taxpayers by the gilded robbersthe stealthy frauds committed against freedom and against honor it is high time that patriotism in this country shall come to the front and that mere partisanship shall be at least for the time being relegated to the rear are we to continue to sit here idling day after day and let this proceeding go on congress after congress when we see the treasury being robbed as we have been informed that it is being robbed today why what have we on the record at this very time we find that our nation has contracted for the transportation of its soldiers at 12 each when the regular fare is only 7 in order tp serve the railroads injustice we have the information that within a very short time an effort has been made to make a contract with the government at 7 for the transportation of our troops and that an effort to make the bid was refused and declined and the government accepted the higher term without consideration is this true if so it must be exposed and repudiated do you think such a condition of affairs can be continued will there not come a time when the people of this country will rise and revolt against it has not that time come now is it not well for us to begin and consider exactly where we stand that we may avoid the results which will surely follow do you not think that the hour of patriotism has arrived when the interests of the government and not the interests of speculators and individual contractors shall be considered this is an hour and a time when real patriotism should have a voice in this chamber not sham and mock pretense our plain and humble fellowcitizens are offering the devotion of their lives at the call of our country shall we not make some sacrifices in their behalf i have no animosity whatever against the pending measure i do not object to the payment of the pension if a pension is due in this case i have no opposition to the claimant in the case 1 have no doubt that it is a just and proper claim and one that has been carefully considered and should be paid i have advocated pensions in every speech that i have ever made on this floor i have a large constituency composed of valiant federal soldiers in my western home"],

cuban insurgents considered and passed by this body these resolutions had passed the senate the populists stood with us the re1 publicans prevented their consideration repeatedly was the attempt revived and repeatedly we met republican opposition and prevention we believed then and we believe now that had those resolutions been adopted the republic of cuba would be independent and we would not be involved in difficulties with spain we believe that the truthful historian will find among the causes that led to the present conditions much vacillation hesitation and doubt and many blunders failures and omissions on the part of our government none of which can be attributed to the minority of this house whether we are right in these opinions it is not proper now to determine and probably it will never matter however while such recognition was withheld and withheld to the benefit of the holders of the spanishcuban bonds and in accordance with the wishes of spanish royalty we were put to enormous expense patrolling our coasts our commerce with cuba shrank away and 300 000 human beings surrounded by spanish bayonets perished for the lack of bread while such things were steadily offering rebuke to spanish warfare the brave followers of gomez were holding aloft their banner of freedom and increasing in hope to soon drive kingly authority and misrule forever from the gem of the antilles amidst all this the sad disaster of the maine explosion occurred at once fixed the attention of the world on cuban affairs and scattered the seeds of war the cause of that explosion need not now be discussed its results filled the earth with horror days passed and the president after dealing with the situation most unsuccessfully through diplomatic means sent his message to congress on that message no comment now is appropriate the president recommended armed intervention in cuba armed intervention bears the fruit of war armed intervention meantit could only mean war obeying the presidents demand congress directed armed intervention but in order to defeat the danger of our countrys responsibility for the spanishcuban indebtedness congress attached to that direction the recognition of the independence of the people of cuba we realize that sometimes owing to the imperfections of human nature war becomes inevitable when such times come honor safety and right will not permit a nation to avoid it at the expense of duty but such nation must enter it boldly with a prayer to the god of battles for a quick and happy outcome with such sentiments the american congress when the matter was finally submitted to it answered the presidents message in the passage of the intervention resolutions war which we would have averted war undesired and terrible came war cruel and crushing exists between us and spain although we knew the political effect of this war would be in the interest of the republican partyfor if successful and it must be that party will have the prestige that always follows victory and if the war is of long duration then the general public opinion will be in favor of strengthening the party in controlyet we of the minority of this house having no power whatever to check or hinder the majority or the administration have had no intention or inclination to retard or delay a speedy settlement of the matters involved in thepresent crisis the washington post an independent newspaper with strong administration leanings in a recent issue april 12 1898 has said of the democrats in congress they have done absolutely nothing to embarrass the republican administration in its effort to reach an honorable solution of the pending difficulties and have in no case sought to make petty party capital of a delicate and critical national emergency the country will never again doubt the devotion of the democratic party to the flag the union and its institutions the republican demagogue who in any future political campaign attempts to play upon that false and foolish note will find himself repudiated as an impudent and vicious mountebank such will be the verdict of the future on our conduct the spanish army and the spanish navy with their deadly guns pointing to us destroy our divisions obliterate our prejudices and invite our broadest highest patriotism thus as americans not partisans we unite solidly against foreign danger without stopping to place the blame for the occasion as one man we rise against the war powers of spain without disposition to arouse party spirit by calling attention to the varying responsibilities for the unhappy situation that now confronts us in deference to the demands of the administration through its friends we unanimously appropriated 50 000 000 already in the treasury without emphasizing the vital differences in the doctrines purposes and tendencies of political parties thus do our actions speak for us we havedone all this but in it all we have not risen above party for however high right justice and liberty bid us go there we find democracy in its native element but sirs the highest patriotism demands the greatest justice to our own people and when the majority as they have done go beyond the limits of equity and disregard the fundamental principles of right in a tax bill and endeavor to fasten upon the already aprm 28 overburdened people the iniquitous unjust and partisan measues of the republican party our unity is broken and our differences appear the same love of country and devotion to principle that require unity in strengthening the arm of the government against spain require us to withhold that arm from placing injustice and oppression upon our own people the calling of the wrong a war measure shall not preclude the entrance of my earnest protest against it political appeals of political opponents to aid in the passage of the pending bill and their demagogic insinuations of lack of loyalty upon us who would shield our taxpayers from this oppressive measure fall in vain upon my ears under the guise of war necessity you can not deceive the intelligent voters of ourgountry nor blind their eyes to the injustice and partiality of this billwhichyou ask us to support we are as anxious and determined as men can be that the government shall be abundantly and promptly provided with the means of war and we know that if we can defeat this obnoxious measure we can and will then adopt measures which will unply and promptly support the government and which will rest equitably upon our people and demonstrate to the world that our mighty country is not dependent for its strength or its victories upon the banking houses of new york it was the boast of demosthenes in his greatest oration that when he came to power in greece he found the very wealthy citizens escaping just taxation and that he boldly reversed that condition and exacted from them their proper share for the support of the government this alone should immortalize him mr chairman we discover that condition here today we would reverse it we would write the income taxa most just taxagain on our statute books that the very wealthy may bear their just proportion of the burden of government and we would trust in the truth that nothing is settled until it is settled right for the survival of such a tax through the supreme courts fiery ordeal the personnel of that court has been changed since the last decision on this tax and three years have perhaps added wisdom to the minds and cleared the intellectual vision of the judges who held against it i will not attempt to repeat the irresistible arguments in favor of its constitutionality as such arguments have during this discussion been convincingly and unanswerably made by the gentleman from texas the gentleman from tennessee and others tomorrow when the incometax amendment is offered as a substitute for the bond feature of the pending bill we hope enough republicans will vote with us to adopt it and if the majority prevent us from striking out the bond feature we shall then hope that they will at least allow us to amend the bill by adding the income tax let us say to the trusts and great corporations of our land since under republican doctrines the government has given you privileges which have enabled you to exact gigantic and often unearned fortunes from the sweat and labor of our people now when that government needs the sinews of war under the democratic doctrine of an income tax you shall contribute to the support of that government which has so largely favored you your proper share for its necessary burdens in addition to the income tax which republicans declare hope and trust is unconstitutional there are other measures for this emergency which carry no favoritism and no injustice in them one of these measures introduced by myself will fully quickly and fairly meet the requirements of the situation this bill which has been referred to the committee on ways and means is as follows a bill to prevent increased burdens of taxation on the people and to pro vide means for the support of the government in the war with spain and for the coinage of silver be it enacted by the sen ate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assernbled that the secretary of the treasury be and ho is hereby authorized and directed as the exigencies of the public service require for the payment of the army and navy and other creditors of the government to issue on the credit of the united states the sum of 50 00o0 000 of unite states notes in such form as he may deem expedient not bearing interest payable to bearer and of such denominations not less than ii as he may prescribe which notes so issued shall be lawful money and a legal tender in payment of all debts and dues public and private within the united states and any of said notes when received by the treasury shall be reissued as the public service may require and when any o said notes may be redeemed as hereinafter provided they shall not be retired canceled or destroyed but shall be reissued paid out again and kept in circulation the said notes shall be redeemed by the secretary of the treasury in coin on their presentation at the office of the treasurer of the united states when redeemable as hereinafter provided the said notes herein authorized shall be divided into ten classes of 50 000 000 each to be known as class a b c d e f g h i and j respectively and the notes of the several classes shall be so marked or engraved as to distinctly show the class to which each note belongs and the notes in the several classes a b c d e f g h i and j shall be redeemable only in the years 1900 1g 190 190 i904 1905 1906 1907 1908 and 1909 respectively and in every tenth year thereafter respectively sac 2 that the secretary of the treasury be and he is hereby author ized and directed to cause to be coined at the several mints of the united states without delay for the government all the silver bullion or seigniorage belonging to the united states into silver dollars of the weight of 4 2 grains of standard silver as provided in the act of january 18 1837 on which shall be the devices and superseriptions provided in said act which coins together with the standard silver dollars now in circulation shall be a legal tender at their pominal value for all debts and dues public and private sec 8 that the proper officers bt the several mints of the united states are hereby authorized and directed to receive silver bullion from the holders thereof when offered for coinage and to coin the same for the benefit of said holders into such silver dollars as are provided for in section 2 of this act upon the same terms and conditions on which said officers now receive and coin gold bullion for the benefit of its holders and the silver dollars so coined shall be a legal tender at their nominal value for all debts and dues public and private the government now owns 42 000 000 of silver bullion known as seigniorage which under this bill would be at once convertible into money the third section provides for the free and unlimited coinage of silver at 16 to 1 with gold you may exclaim that there is no hope of getting such a measure through this congress since the republicans are a unit against giving silver the same privileges that gold has i know that on the teller resolutions during this session the strength of the silver sentiment was tested in this house when 180 republicans voted against them and only 1 republican in all this body voted for them and the gentleman who cast that vote my colleague from north carolina said in his remarks on those resolutions that he was not in favor of the free and unlimited coinage of silver but in times of a great national crisis it would well become the stanchest advocate and the blindest worshiper of the gold standard to reconsider his position to ignore the demands of wallstreet influences and to take position on the side of the great masses on the living issues now before the people the object of the freecoinage section of my bill is to increase the amount of standard money to cause higher prices for labor and products to give new energy and enter prise to business to destroy the financial reign of the gold dealers and to restore prosperity to the great masses of our people nothing can more encourage the brave men in front fighting their countrys battles nothing can more inspire the army and navy and nothing can fill our enemy with greater fear than to know that back ofur soldiers and sailors are a brave and determined people energeic prosperous and hopeful the first section of my bill is so drawn as to absolutely prevent any great run on the treasury hereafter with the proposed notes and in my opinion such provisions might well be made to apply to all our currency this section you observe gives the authority to issue so many of such notes up to 500 000 000 as the needs of the government require thus being limited to the necessitiesof the government but let me return to the pending bill its most prominent provision is its bond feature it authorizes the secretary of the treasury to issue 500 000 000 of 3 per cent bonds to run from ten to twenty years this is wrong and contrary to the best thought and best interests of thepeople until all other reasonable expedients fail bonds should not be considered the bill under present circumstances should never pass as long as it contains this bond provision even if in other respects it had no faults and i doubt if as many faults and as few merits have ever been so condensed in a similar measure if the credit of the government is to be used and it is to be then let it be in noninterestbearing full legaltender united states notes why at this stage of the conflict entail upon the people millions of dollars of interest expense and contract the circulation by withdrawing therefrom the money which will buy the bonds when such expense is altogether unnecessary and when the already contracted circulation can be easily and safely increased thisis ithe question that every honest taxpayer will consider thoroughly and my republican friends you had better begin now to frame an answer to it for use among your constituents bonds which are the first resort of the republican party should be the last resort of a statesman and the last burden to be placed on patriots or borne by freemen the necessity for bonds does not exist and in all probability will not arise during the wa and never should bonds be issued until our noninterestbearing paper money falls below par no one believes the present outstanding greenbacks will be worth less than 100 cents in the dollar during the war or at other times notes such as those proposed in my bill will be upon higher and firmer ground than those now outstanding the law under which the present greenbacks were issued made them legal tender for all debts and dues except interest on the public indebtedness and duties on imports but the notes under my bill woul be full legal tender for all debts and dues without any exception being full legal tender they would not go below par for the simple reason that no one would take less than 100 cents on the dollar for one when he could with it pay a dollar of taxes or debts eto the only reason the old greenbacks which are redeemable in coin ever fell below par was because of the exception clause in their legaltender provision since they were not legal tender for import duties the importer who had them was compelled with them to buy coin from its holders who put the price of it up which of course meant putting down greenbacks the importer was compelled to have coin to pay import duties but if he could have used his greenbacks to pay import duties he would not have been compelled to have coin and his greenbacks would never have fallen on the market i will not undertake to discuss the pending bill in detail it is unnecessary to increase the tobacco tax it can be avoided unnecessary taxation is unjust taxation it is troublesome and vexatious to require stamp taxes on notes mortgages bonds checks deeds and other written instruments and yet your bill does it the measures advocated by democrats would prevent the necessity for such taxation and destroy the excuse or pretext for bonds but you increase the tobacco tax to 12 cents a pound you tax the smallest leaf tobacco dealer 12 per annum and the largest 24 you tax the poor mans mortgage exceeding 100 fifty cents and increase the cost of the rich mans champagne two cents a pint no man after this measure goes into effect can safely handle tobacco in any form or handle beer mineral water chewing gum perfumes medicines etc or sign deliver or receive any written paper document contract receipt etc without first investigating this law to ascertain whether or not he is violating its provisions as a rule it is not our wealthy people who drink beer chew tobacco and give notes and mortgages go through the provisions of this bill and you at once conclude that it bears more heavily upon the poor than on the rich sir i believe that under this bill ninetenths of the taxes levied will be borne by pepie who own less than onetenth of the property of the country it is a moral wrong it is tyranny it is not patriotism it is not right to raise the money for this war by means of unequal and unjust taxation and all the sophistry all the eloquence and all the demagogy of the country can not make it right why did you not tax banks on their deposits why not tax telegraph instruments why not tax palace cars why not tax railroads on their tickets why not tax the trusts on their dividends why not tax articles which would affect the wealthy in the same proportion in which the tobacco chewer is affected by this bill unless taxation can be equalized government is a robbery congress should be fearless to equalize taxation regardless of the protestations of wealth the humblest man the most democratic bryanite is willing to pay his just share of taxation but honest men can not be satisfied and will not cease their agitation until the richest corporation is made to pay its just share of taxation overburdening one class is not more wrong and more unjust than nnderburdening another class until the republican party changes its financial position and its methods of taxation it need not expect increase of strength from the agricultural sections or the laboring masses of our country it may be and probably is true that the wealth of the land would without great resistance bear its proper share of the costs of this war yet the republican party has deemed it best not to adopt a tax measure that might perchance offend it you can not say that wealth will pay the beer and tobacco taxes for we know that the consumer pays the tax in every instance i imagine that there is at least one consolation to the other side in contemplating this bill and that is that attention will be distracted from the failure of the dingley tariff bill to produce sufficient revenue for the government just as the war prevents our considering the absence of the promised prosperity it was by some ardent and trustful republicans thought the dingley bill would help all factory wages democrats never thought it and in last december the gentleman from m aine in response to inquiries on the floor of the house by myself admitted in substance that wages in southern mills were not affected by the tariff the dingley bill has not satisfied the treasury the taxes now proposed will go into the treasury and help the tariff bill out of a most unfortunate condition as the deficit at the beginning of this month under the dingley tariff had amounted to more than 50 000 000 for its first eight months of operation which deficit had been covered by the money receive d by the government from the sale of its interests in the union pacific and kansas pacific railroads having briefly outlined my objections to this bill and having briefly referred to those measures which i think should be adopted in this emergency i shall rely upon the intelligence courage and patriotism of the good people who have honored me with their confidence for the vindication of my position believing that i have justly represented their sentiment and interests and knowing that i have in their behalf taken that position in accordance with my best judgment i say this because i know that when any member of this house takes a position contrary to the wishes of the great capitalists contrary to the views of the goldstandard advocates contrary to the interests of those who prosper most when speculating in the transfers of united states bonds he is by many looked upon as a dangerous and unsafe representative of an ignorant and unpatriotic constituency and sirs many of the metropolitan newspapers are ready at once to hurl their shafts of ridicule at such a member many of these newspapers controlled by goldstandard interests and influences whose proprietors rejoice in bond issues and condemn income taxes already denounce the men who fail to approve the plan of taxation outlined by the gentleman from maine the distinguished leader of the single gold standard element of this house blinded by selfish interests and mistaking their prejudice bigotry and conceit for conscience intelligence and patriotism such papers are ready to denounce every man who refuses to be stampeded into supporting the bond feature of the pending bill and who dares to urge as a substitute therefor a greenback issue and the income tax as an obstructor of the public business but sirs the representatives on this floor who believe in the righteous principles of the chicago platform can not be intimidated or deceived nor can they be deterred from their plain path of duty by false and furious press opinions we propose to show the same patriotism when dealing with our own people as when repelling the powers of spain we shall contend against injustice and oppression upon our people however and wherever it may originate in conclusion i trust this war will soon be over that our arms may soon be crowned with glorious victory and that the gallant men who risk their lives for our common country may joyfully return to their families i trust further that this tax law which is about to be placed on our statutes against our protest may soon be repealed the taxpayers and homebuilders have much against this congress they have failed to receive the promised prosperity they have felt the oppression of the protective tariff they have felt the tyranny of the gold standard they have noticed your defeat of the teller resolution which declared our bonds payable in silver as well as gold they will feel the annoyance vexation and burden of this tax bill the people are patient but they hold their steady course against injustice and though by money and deception often beaten and baffled they shall surely finally succeed and have all the wrongs of legislation corrected the great majority of the american people are agreed upon the bedrock principles of government and upon the policies which should control congressional action and though now divided into factions i rejoice to think that all the strategy and influence of the republican managers and all the pride prejudice and selfishness of political leaders can not always prevent united effort on the part of these great forces of right principle and patriotism will finally cast aside everything and everybody that creates or approves division and then in one great grand harmonious body the believers in equality in the government the opponents of governmental privileges to the few the lovers of liberty and the enemies of oppression will strike down the unjust tyrannous and selfish influences which have dictated so much legislation amd drive from power that party which has become the protection and the instrument of the trusts and plunderers of the people and restore the government and its laws to the simple and honest basis of right and justice as intended by our fathers"], [0.03897804021835327, 0.9610219597816467, 1, "i number myself among those whose motto is my country may she ever be right but right or wrong my country so long as the brave soldiers of my country are contending with a foreign foe i shall do what is in my power to sustain them i shall do what is in my power too as soon as i think it advisable to have them withdraw from a conflict which i think is unworthy of them one year ago we on this side of the chamber were struggling to drive the administration into a war for the liberation of enslaved humanity today many of us with the same patriotic and humanitarian purpose are seeking to drag the administration out of a war which has degenerated into a barbarous extermination of an inferior race i remember sir that after the inauguration of the present administration it took more than twelve months for this patriotic and humanitarian impulse among the people to produce an effective impression on the government the oppression the suffering and distress of the reconcentrados in cuba was the most fruitful theme for public indignation until the tide of sentiment throughout the land rose so high that the party in power here could no longer resist it and open revolt in the party ranks seemed to threaten them with lasting ruin in other words sir nothing was done for the relief or assistance of the cuban patriots although your party had declared for it in your platform until the force of public sentiment threatened to drive the party out of power and now sir having found in the pursuit of a foreign war the means for promotion of party favorites and the fulfillment of personal pledges to political friends as well as a safe and sure ground for appealing to that patriotic sentiment which though often misguided is always reliable the president after ending the war with spain declares war against the helpless victims of spains tyranny war was commenced to extend the blessings of freedom it is now waged to crush the spirit of freedom but i venture to prophesy that within another twelve months that same noble sentiment of sympathy for the oppressed that same sense of evenhanded justice which constantly rules the counsels of free men will again assert itself with such force and potency that your war of aggression and extermination of a helpless people will be brought to an end like the other war commenced with a threat of political extermination for the republican party in this country what has cbanged the policy of this war is it the land grabbers greed or is it the bloodthirsty spirit of the lions whelp after once tasting blood when war was first declared this country formally announced to the world that we were not entering upon a war of aggression that territorial aggrandizement was not our purpose but that we were setting before the nations of the world the first example in history of a great and powerful government reaching out its mighty arm for the protection and assistance of a weak and helpless neighbor who had become the victim of tyrannical and despotic power the president himself announced to the world that forcible annexation would be criminal aggression and was not to be thought of and accordingly he seemed to entertain no purpose of annexing the philippine islands until after the paris commission had met to form a treaty of peace then his mind seemed to undergo a radical change he suddenly demanded the cession of the philippine islands from spain not for the use and benefit of the natives of these islands as had been done for cuba but for territorial expansion of the united states and from that day to this the army and navy of the united states which had been put at his command for the defense of liberty and right for the protection of person and property have been used as the mighty engines of destruction for those unfortunate halfcivilized people whom the accidents of war have placed at our mercy spain was cruelly crushing the life out of cuba in a vain endeavor to uphold the majesty of the throne today the great republic of america heir of all the ages repository of freedom for all climes and countries the muchboasted final home of liberty is crushing the very spirit of liberty which has dared no raise its front in that faroff wilderness of the eastern seas in the name of liberty i in the name of god and humanity instead of trying to carry republican civilization into those islands as one gentleman on this floor has suggested with a sword in one hand and a bible in the other instead of trying to shoot christian civilization into heathendom at the mouth of the cannon instead of a bloody and heartless campaign for the glory of conquest and upholding the majesty of mckinley imperialism let us offer to those people the assistance of a great republic on the opposite side of the globe the sympathy of a great and free people beyond the seas who cherish the memory of a time when their forefathers pledged their lives their fortunes and their sacred honor for the maintenance of that sublime doctrine that all government derives its just powers from the consent of the governed let us proclaim to them that our pride in the noble achievements of our ancestors waxes warm as we see their example illustrated and the very words of their declaration of independence followed by those who in a distant part of the world are now struggling to establish and maintain the sublime principle of selfgovernment let us rejoice that the declaration of american independence has at ldst penetrated the dark recesses of heathendom and so long as they profess adherence to the doctrine of our own constitution and its bill of rights let us not dare deny to them that precious boon of civil and religious liberty which we would fight to maintain for ourselves i have heard much about the glory of our victories and in so far as those victories have been won over spanish forces i have rejoiced with others but where is the glory when a great stalwart giant kicks a helpless child into the gutter the victories of dewey at manila of schley at santiago and wheeler at san juan stimulated the pride of patriotic american hearts because they were victories for american principle and the divine right of manhood rut the recent victories over the philippine insurgents have aroused no such enthusiasm in the american breast why because they feel that they were not victories for freedom and seemed to indicate only that the filipinos have had a change of masters if president mckinley had given those people hearty assurance that we were not intending to rob them of their country and their government we would not now be compelled to shoot them down they were our friends and would have continued to be so if the president had assured them that he would not rob them of their ersonal and political rights and hence sir i believe that the lood of our soldiers and that of the philippine insurgents now being shed in those unhappy islands is justly chargeable to this wild craze of the adminstration for forcible annexation of the islands which the president himself in the beginning of the war had declared to be criminal aggression i confess sir that while i have the highest admiration for the courage and discipline of our soldiers and sailors who are braving the dangers of disease lurking in every breath of air they breathe and the bullets of treacherous foes in ambush in execution of orders of their superior officers that i deplore the fact that they must sacrifice their lives in so unworthy a cause and sir while i have always cherished a high respect for the christian religion and its representatives believing it to be the great uplifting moral agency of the world i have a most profound contempt for the sentiment of these wouldbe missionaries who would christianize the heathen by trampling upon all their rights and shooting religion into them with gatling guns if christianity has to be propagated by the sword and gain a foothold by imi{tating the followers of mohammed whose custom it was to offer conquered people only a choice between the koran and the sword then ingersoll should have a bishops miter but aside from the rights or the interests of the people of the philippine islands i am opposed to annexing them to the united states from the standpoint of our own interests i see no good to come to us but only evil we hear a new doctrine preached by these expansionists which they would not have dared to proclaim twelve months ago they tell us that the declaration of independence and the bill of rights in the constitution itself have no application to the people of conquered territory they tell us that we own the philippine islands by right of conquest that we can do with them what we wish that the right of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness the right of trial by jury the habeas corpusall those inestimable privileges which we have cherished as the inalienable rights of man were not intended for conquered subjects and can only be extended to them when in our own good time we may deem it expedient to bestow them we are told that the american flag waves over the philippine islands andwe areasked whoshallpullit down in reply i say who shall pull down the constitution the american flag is the emblem of free government may its folds never wave over enslaved subjects or conquered provinces where the constitution has no meaning may it never become the emblem of tyranny and oppression may its stars be stars of hope and not of hatred for those over whom it waves i say sir that i look at the whole question from the staidpoint of american interests and the destiny of this republic you can not maintain a constitutional government at home and an unconstitutional government abroad deny selfgovernment to any people over whom our flag floats and you have taken one long step toward denying it to all no republic in the history of the world has ever long succeeded in administering constitutional government at home and monarchical government for its colonies an empire means an emperqr as well as a territory and i believe sir that the great statesman from massachusetts was right when lie declared some weeks ago my opinion is that if the united states acquire the philippine islands to govern them as a subject or vassal state the destruction of the american rtepublic will date from tho administration of william mckinley now i wish to call attention again to the increasing expenses of the government and the condition of the treasury and ask whether or not we can afford this investment in the philippine islands from a financial standpoint and in this connection i think it would be profitable to observe the figures which tell the story of our increasing extravagance and especially the story of the reckless and riotous extravagance of this republican congress in opening the debate on the sundry civil bill the gentleman from illinois the distinguished chairman of the committee on appropriations very cautiously but significantly sounded the alarm to his party associates he tells us that the estimates of the secretary of the treasury showing a probable deficit of 112 000 000 are entirely too low that the deficit will reach 159 000 000 not counting the 20 000 000 to be paid to spain and that when thisis added in the deficiency will reach 179 000 000 and confidently asserts that this amountis rather under than above what we will actually witness it is indeed refreshing to hear a republican even in the faintest manner suggest anynecessity for economy in public expenditures but no suggestion of economy seems to find favor with the republican administration and the gentleman from illinois labors in vain when he undertakes to restrain his associates from lavish and extravagant appropriation of public funds he tells us now that the secretary of the treasury estimates the total expenditures of the government for the next fiscal year on a peace footing at 641 00 000 exclusive of all war expenses and a number of other items necessarily omitted from his estimates or that altogether the total expenditures for next year will reach the enormous sum of 700 000 000 which will be the largest sum of money ever appropriated for the government of this country or any other country in time of peace it is no answer to this to say that the business and population of the country are increasing and hence the government expenses must lie greater because the increase in government expenses has greatly exceeded the increase of population and business by all the rules of economic business a large institution should be run at proportionately less expense than a small one but republican extravagance has reversed that law of economics and our government becomes more expensive to the individual as well as to the community in proportion as it grows larger for many years before the civil war the total expenses of the government only amounted to about 3 per capita of the population and for many years after the civil war and aifter the disbanding of the armies notwithstanding the heavy appropriations for pensions and interest on the public debt still the total expenses of the government amounted to less than 5 per capita of the population until the reed congress which ran it up to nearly 6 per capita and now mckinleys administration and another reed congress have run it up to more than 7 per capita and we are deliberately informed by the members of the appropriations committee that for the next year the appropriations called for will aggregate 700 000 000 on the supposition that we are at peace with the world which amount divided among the 75 000 000 people makes 9 33 per head for every man woman and child in the country and this means remember for every man who has a wife and three children a total tax for the general government amounting to five times this sum which is 46 65 to say nothing of state county and municipal taxation then do you think it strange that the people groan under this burden i tell you there must come a time of reckoning if we refuse to call a halt now the time will come when the stubborn protest of a taxridden people will be heard in this chamber and will be respected the distinguished chairman of the appropriations committee also tells us that he sees no hope for the reduction of taxes during the next two years we must continue to lick stamps and pay high prices for sugar and coffee total apforear

proximo for purpose of comparison these figures will be still more striking and instructive if we add together the appropriations of both sessions of each congress and get the total amount appropriated by each separate congress or still greater will be the contrast if we leave out of account the amounts appropriated for payment on the public debt and standing contracts of the government and give only the appropriations which are under the control of each separate congress for instance the fortythird congress was republican and the total appropriations of both sessions amounted to 653 974 990 and the fortyfourth congress was democratic and its total appropriations of both sessions amounted to 595 597 832 showing a difference or democratic saving of 58 377 158 fortyseventh congress

congress was democratic and the total appropriations amounted to 989 239 205 and its successor the fiftyfourth congress was republican and the appropriations rose to 1 047 959 599 which shows a republican increase of 58 720 394 finally the total appropriations of the present or fiftyfifth congress also republican can not yet be stated with absolute accuracy but will nearly reach the enormous sum 1 600 000 000 which means another republican increase of nearly 600 000 000 and after taking out all money appropriated for war expenses there will remain a net increase of more than a hundred millions of dollars in the regular expenses of the government in a whole quarter of a century you will observe but one increase of expenses made by a democratic congress and that was forced upon congress and the country by the reckless and extravagant legislation of the previous republican congress now as the chairman of the committee on appropriations the distinguished gentleman from illinois tells us that we have now appropriated for next years expenses of the government 179 000 000 more than the total revenues of the government will yield or in other words that a deficit of that enormous amount will be staring us in the face i wish to ask if you think in view of these facts we can afford at this time to make this investment of 20 000 000 in philippine malays and yellow belles

any member of this house and further still would it have been from my object to awaken such a magnificent storm of indignation as has been displayed in the heroic face of the stalwart democrat from new york i speak as with the kindest feelings toward him his memorable service in this house has been a contribution to this nation he has even taken occasion to make some reference to some disparity of situation which he claims may have existed between us in the past as to advantage of education he honors me in the expression that i possess that which is not enjoyed by himself let him rest well assured that i claim no such and if there was ever any attainment which god has placed to my service however humble or great if it could be divorced and taken from me i would exchange them all for the splendid character and constant devotion to humanity that we have all observed in the gentlemans past career my remarks have not referred to the gentlemans personal course i made reference not to the gentlemans personal conduct throughout the avenues of his life it did not engage my attention and it was not my object to make any reference whatever to that but it was my purposeand i am glad i have made that plain to himto protest in the name of the real democracy against that set of distinguished but misguided intellects which rise in the hour when our opponents demand them and ask for their indorsement of meretricious measures and under the cry of patriotism become deluded by their own enthusiasm and commit that which to the nation is a crime it was to protest against that feeling on the part of some of my democratic friends however honest they may be that feeling which leads them to discharge a duty to which they are summoned by the enemy of the country to cease the senseless cry of their country above party and in the meantime bring their country to a level with the republican party in the hour of their demand my friend from new york for such i trust he may ever be has been greatly applauded by my honorable friends on the other side for the utterances which came from him in which he speaks of the service he has done in voting for these bonds i remind my friend that he led a gallant phalanx from the east in support of the placing of a mortgage upon the poor of the country and received some generous applause from my friends on the other side but i want to add a single warning that he must beware of the greeks bearing gifts my friends on the other side will applaud any apparent schism on this side of the house whenever it appears also approve any course that will procure the aid of my democratic friends that they may say to the country at large that this measure or that measure was nonpartisan i invite the attention of my distinguished friend to one thing if my honorable republican friends claim this one billion created debt was nonpartisan if sirs it was your desire to make it so in order to justify the assertions of the gentleman from new york why did they knowing that 6 500 000 voters of the country had expressed their desires on this question of silver and goldand yet when a humble member on the floor on this side of the house offered an amendment that silver should be used to give some little countenance to the views of the 6 500 000 voters what was done it was voted down unanimously by a strict party vote every opportunity being given to the other side to demonstrate that it was a nonpartisan measure and they refused it treating each one in turn contemptuously my friend says that i slander the governments officers i sir have not assumed to mention any officers i have not slandered any officer or attempted to do so all i have done on this floor was to speak the truth about those gentlemen as it has appeared in the public record i hav e said that which you all do know gentlementhat the coal trusts agents were colleaguing with the enemy of this country that these business patriots in the sight of the nation deliberately loaded a vessel with coal to take to the spanish fleet to use against our homes and countrymen and this while an american vessel stood at its door knocking for coal and when commodore schley forced recognition to his demand these patriots charged an american ship in an american port a dollar more on a ton than they did for the coal to these spanish enemies had i been the attorneygeneral of the united states i would have apprehended them as traitors for violating the laws of their country against giving aid or comfort to the enemy i would have sent them to the companionship of benedict arnold both sold their country for gold and yet a member on this side of the house who sought to denounce them a member who seeks to express his honest convictions against a bill mortgaging the resources and strength of the country to vultures is held up to the nation as a demagogue and disloyal to the countrys welfare when has it come to be a familiar truth that in order to be a democrat a man must either rise above or sink beneath his party i say that with the true democrat there can be no such cry as my country before my partv withhim the cry must be my country and my party for without my party i would not have had my country this alone can be the real position of the true party man wherever he is if he be a true democrat measured by the standard of a rejuvenated democracy one word to my distinguished friends on the other side and then i am done i speak to them without personal feeling and with a sentiment of the highest personal regardi speak confidentially and franklywhen i say it is not my purpose in any wise to demonstrate that either party of this house bore any enmity or ill feeling to those who now have charge of government affairs my friend on the other side has asked why when i voted for the 50 000 000 appropriation 1 did not then cry out against these contractors sir there has never been an hour or a moment when i have occupied the floor but that every expression from my lips if construed correctly must have been construed as a protest against the whole army of these omnivorous culprits who never lose a chance of fattening upon their country these who beat down the defenseless to serve some guilty causei could not then anticipate that these men under the cry of patriotism would seize the opportunity to impose upon the confidence of those who trusted them it was when i obtained information through the public press through the channels of the party papers of the present administration and from the very voices of the men in command of this government that i seized upon the very first moment permitted under the rules to raise my protest which if not popular in this honorable branch of the government will be recognized and approved for the honesty of its intent by those who are most interested because they are the most oppressed i rise here to denounce if it must be any measure whether advocated by men in control of our government or by men who are without that looks to the further thraldom and enslavement of those who should be rescued in an hour like this whose patriotism should be encouraged if we hope that they shall go to the front to tender their lives for a nation which should be their guardian and protector not their oppressor and destroyer this is the reason of my protest it is a protest i shall ever make and when my friend speaks about these bonds being popular when lie says that the poor people will be benefited bythem i ask how will they obtain them will they not have to buy these bonds will not that much money be taken out of their humble coffers and where will they get the money to make the purchase the insincerity of your cry of nonpartisanship which has been demonstrated in connection with the silver question is demonstrated still further by the distinguished gentleman from maine who in presenting this bill said it was the intention to have these bonds on sale at the postoffices where in the bill as now a law is there a line or a letter containing any such declaration if such an announcement was sincere and was to be executed what object was there in refusing to put such a provision into the law plainly i say to my friend from new york the object was that by means of such an announcement made here the confiding member of this house might give the measure his indorsement and then when the bill had passed that there might be allowed to the secretary of the treasury the exercise of an elastic discretion so that he may if he chooses find it agreeable to allow all these bonds to be taken in one lot by those faithful friendly cohortswhose office and headquarters happen to be in the locality where if public accounts be true the distinguished secretary of the treasury called for counsel and guidance before he framed this measure for the issue of 500 000 000 of bondsthe bankers of new york this is why i have no confidence in the professions of my distinguished friends in charge of the government that it is their desire or intent to do anything to alleviate the condition of the common masses of this country by their record i condemn them upon that they must stand or fall for before the nation all their protestations of honesty and sincerity of patriotism and nonpartisanship have been given the lie from out of their own mouths gentlemen do not forget the common people they are not always deluded there is a time when their patience ceases when a just retribution comes even to those most favored by high position such retribution must come to those who assuming the garb of genuine republicanism undertake to vilify and anathematize true patriots such as are found on both sides of the house such as is personified in the poor and by such declamation

yieldup 3 500 000 some of the leading wholesale and retail grocers of my district came here seeking a fair hearing at the hands of the ways and means committee did they receive the same consideration

of the ways and means committee as were the arbuckles the searlses and the morgans it is contended by the chairman of the ways and means committee that if the tax on tobacco and beer is unreasonably large yet the people who use these articles have it within their own power to limit their use and thus regulate the amount of tax they pay theoretically this sounds very well but that the gentleman does not believe his own theory is evidenced by the fact that in the very next breath he estimates that this increase of tax on beer will give an additional revenue of about 33 000 000 and about 25 000 000 additional revenue will be secured from tobacco cigars cigarettes and dealers on these two items alone affecting the poor and middle classes of our population the gentleman from maine proposes to raise 58 000 000 and justifies himself with the suggestion that this is a tax on habits and that therefore the consumer can regulate his own tax statesmanship does not ignore habits they are stern facts and conditions and the right to tax them out of existence is a moral question and not a war measure every nationality has its habits and peculiarities butwhen it is p eoposed to raise revenue to

so is not when we are in the midst of war but when we are in peace and dealing with moral questions only habits are almost as fixed as the bone and marrow of humanity the habits of a nationality are the growth of centuries as the poet dryden said ill habits gather by unseen degrees as brooks make rivers rivers run to seas it comes with poor grace from the gentleman from maine where prohibition does not prohibit and hard cider and speakeasy saloons pay no taxes to ash the good people of ohio and all the western and southern states to either refrain from the use of tobacco and beer or pay as a penalty the entire expense of carrying on the war with spain when the republican end of the ways and means committee went into secret sessions and took a monopoly of the countrys patriotism with them how did it happen that it never occurred to them that some of these taxes might be imposed upon the habits of the rich evidently the republican end of the ways and means committee have acquired such a i habit of imposing upon the poor that they unconsciously did the poor this injustice as a mere matter of habit after finding that they could raise so many millions by taxing the habits of the poor why did it not occur to these patriots to raise additional millions by taxing the silk and satin habits of the rich why did it not occur to them that after almost doubling the price of tobacco by tax they could at least add a dollar a bottle to champagne and other imported and fancy wines and liquors why did it not occur to them while putting a stamp tax on the poor mans mortgage or proprietary medicines to put a stamp tax on the rich mans purchase of broadcloth and the like while putting a stamp tax on the poor womans cough medicine why did it not occur to them to put a stamp tax on my ladys diamonds while putting a tax on the poor mans pleasure of smoking a pipe why did it not occur to them to put a tax on the rich mans pleasure carriages these many many millions to be collected as war taxes must necessarily come from the pockets of the people and it does not require much analysis of this bill to see that substantially all of the war revenues are expected to come from the poor and middle class families of the land and very little to come from the rich families waldron in his handbook on currency and wealth takes the census of 1890 and divides the families of the united states into those which he calls the poor and middle class families and a second class which he calls the rich families in the first class he locates over 12 000 000 families in the rich class he places something over 600 000 families in the same table waldron shows that the 12 000 000 of our middleclass families have a total annual income of 9 000 000 000 and the 600 000 rich families have a total income of 4 500 000 000 in other words the 600 000 rich families receive onehalf as much income as the 12 000 000 poor and middleclass families waldron also shows that 4 000 000 of the poor and middleclass families must each get along on an income of less than 400 a year that more than onehalf of this class of families must get along on less than 8600 a year need i say more on this subject is not it high time that the republican end of the ways and means committee explain to the 72 000 000 people of america who make up the poor and middleclass families why they have exempted the 3 000 000 who make up the rich class from the payment of war taxes it seems to me it would not require a very high sense of justice to come to the conclusion that taxes ought to be paid by property and not by men inasmuch as property is the principal object of concern not only of our police force but also of our military and naval forces if organized government is maintained for the purpose of protecting the property and lives of men and since it is only the poor and the middle class who offer up their lives in defense of a nations honor by what reason or logic can any fairminded man come to the conclusion that property or the income of property should not pay its share of the taxes particularly such taxes as are known as war revenue why should not the income o the 600 000 families contribute at least onehalf of the war revenue inasmuch as they have onehalf of the income of the country every member upon this floor has no doubt received the circular letter of the knights of labor signed by john w hayes general secretarytreasurer i commend it to the republican party for consideration alongside the statements of favored representatives of bonds and corporate interests

discussion but there is one question i would like to ask you and i have reduced it to writing and with the permission of the committee i will read it you are of course recognized as a republican sympathizing with republican principles the pdatform adopted at st louis looked toward bimetallism as a practical principle you advocate and iam glad that you do for i sympathize with you most heartily the firmer establishment of the present gold standard as stated in your first declaration yesterday i want to ask you if that does not conflict with the principles enunciated at st louis secretary gage i should answer no sir not as i look upon the question of bimetallism for bimetallism must be one of two thigseither two different kinds of money of unequal commercial value circulating en an equality with each other by reason of the lower quality being made xcha ghng e with the higher and thus of equal value or two kinds of money so absolutely equal in value as to circulate on a natural parity a bimetallic standardbi does not exist anywhere on earth a bimetallic currency as i understand bimetallism does exist in the united states now the firm establishment of our system upon the gold standard and the recognition of silver by the government in the way of such interchangeabilityas may be necessary to keep it equal to gold will better maintain bimetallism on the general principle i have just outlined this has in a manner been goin a on for eighteen or nineteen years there is nothing at all in the proposqtion to more firmly establish the gold standard to prevent us from doing all reasonable things to accomplish such an increase i the value of silver money as will bring it to a natural parity with gold and thus relieve the government from the expease of artificial maintenance and the embarrassment which has provailed for many years and which will perhaps prevail for many years to come in our financial system in other words the secretary of the treasury declares absolutely for the gold standard and he is in favor of placing the united states in a position to redeem 90 000 000 of various classes of obligations if necessary in gold this includes silver the president has been heard from to some extent as stated by the senator from mchigan at last evenings dinner he said among other things the money of the united states is and must forever be unquestioned and unassailable if doubts remain they must be removed if weak places are discovered they must be strengthened nothing should ever tempt usnothing ever will tempt usto scale down the sacred debt of the nation through a legal technicality whatever may bathe language of the contract the united states will discnarge all of its obligations in the currency recognized as the best throughout the civilized world at times of payment whether the best money be gold silver or precious stones no inquiry has yet been made then the president continues whatever effort therere is required to makte te settlement of this vital question clear and conclusive for all time we are hound in good conscience to undertake and if possible realize what is that effort which is to be made is it to accomplish the passage of the bill recommended by the secretary of the treasury what bill is before us bearing the indorsement of any committee of congress and all of the committees are composed as to their majority of republicans what committee has suggested any scheme but it is said as an excuse for this failure that the measure could not be passed the president takes no stock in that proposition he knows that the house is largely republican and that the senate is organized on republican lines he is in favor of treating the issue directly he says an honest attempt will be the best proof of sincerity of purpose let the honest attempt be made and then we will discuss the plan proffered there has been no honest attempt the president continues for us to attempt nothing in the face of the prevalent fallacies and the constant effort to spread them is to lose valuable ground already won and practically to weaken the forces of sound money for their battles of the fture mr president when the distinguished author of this phraseology was delivering his address we were assured by one of the leading new york papers thatthe presidentis great hit was made in his declaration that the gold standard must be maintained if he bad let it go at that he would have done better but as an afterthought he saw fit to admit that the free coinage of silver would be possible if international agreement would sanction it this sent a chill through the assemblage because its members read the newspapers and knew that senator wolcotrs commission had returned rebuked and discredited mr president think of it here were these gentlemen distinguished and able and patriotic no doubt men of enterprise and great intelligence and industry and high attainments who had gathered upon that festive occasion we are assured they represent an annual output of over 9 000 000 000 we are assured that sixty trusts were properly there we are advised to use the somewhat enthusiastic language of a metropolitan journal that it was a belshazzar feast here were these gentlemen sympathizing with the laboring man with the man who toils anxious not so much to add to their profits as desirous of increasing his men who are anxious to assist the poor farmer and make him rich and help to keep up the price of wheat which price even the manufacturers club does not i believe claim is due to any policy of the republican party as no one attempts to saddle the india famine and other similar foreign horrors upon that organizationhere were all these distinguished and able gentlemen convoked at a joyous table and approving the remarks of the president favoring the gold standard but when he intimated that an international agreement would be a good thing a chill mr president overcame them and tremblingly they resumed their seats fearing that silver might after all remain a subject of international negotiationa monetary possibilityuntil they were resuscitated by the practical admission of the president that the monetary commission was in fact a failure mr president it should not be necessary to define the position of the respective political organizations today with reference to this topic the republican party must make a straight fight for the gold standard and the democratic party must adhere to its lain and unequivocal declaration made in the platform of 1896 o attempt to disorganize or discredit no effort of interested parties to spread the spirit of discord in our ranks will keep apart any of those who believe in true bimetallism whether democrats populists or silver republicans devoted to the cause able and firm in its advocacy determined to succeed they will not recede one step from their position deliberately and patriotically taken they will be supported by the thousands of american voters who were deluded by the pledges of the republican party in the last campaignmade never to be performed mr president am i wrong when i attempt to state the position of the secretary of the treasury we all listened with delight to the eloquent and most interesting speech of the able senator from colorado with reference to his participancy in the work or attempted work of the late monetary commission and regarding those who interfered with the commissions work he said we were also somewhat embarrassed by the statements of representatives of new york bankers in england who solught access to english officials and assured them that any sentiment which had formerly existed in the united states in favor of bimetallism was dead that the mission was sent solely aq a sop to a few far western republicans that the country generally favored the gold standard and that the president of the unitedstates shared this view perhaps some of these intervenors may have seen the advance sheets of the presidents speech of last night the statements were untrue of coursecontinues the senator from coloradobut in support of them these people assumed to present interviews and statements of the director of the mint a hold over from the last administration the late comptroller of the currency an e ally precious legacy now out of the public service and translated to a chicago bank and pretended statements in letters and interviews from the secretary of the treasury to the effect that there was no chance f~r international or other bimetallism and favoring the permanent adoption of the gold standard nobody in europe cared a rap what the two miner prophets thought or said as nobody in this country cares but the alleged statements of the secretary of the treasury were a different matter we insisted that the letters must he forgeries and the interviews fictitious and i trust they wee for it was inconceivable that a member of the cabinet would seek to undermine the efforts of a mission appointed by the president and whose efforts he was cordia cy and zealously seconding i thought as the senator from colorado said we insisted that the letters must be forgeries that there was an element of sarcasm in his tone mr president does anybody believe that those letters were forgeries has the alleged author denounced them as such is there any proof to justify the belief that men prominent in the financial councils of the world would present letters alleged to be from the secretary of the treasury of the united states which that official had not in fact signed hence our political opponents are put in this position that while claiming to be a party of bimetallism while sending a mission abroad for the purpose of advancing bimetallism the head of the treasury of the united states the leading financier connected with the administration discredits that commission and says sub rosa that the whole matter is nonsense that international bimetallism can not be accomplished and intimations come from other similarly high republican sources that after all it is a sop thrown to western republicans mr president it is certain that in no part of this republic where the true bimetallic sentiment prevails and predominates can there be any further deception it is certain that the man who today votes against this resolution which it is admitted is but declaratory of the law can not find any excuse before those of his fellowcitizens who believed he was in truth a friend of the double standard and voted for him though he was a republican when they confront him with his record of today i do not assume to blame any person for his views upon this subject opinions varying from mine are honestly entertained no doubt by those who cherish them i do not question the entire integrity of those who differ totally from me but what i do say is that candor and fairness and honesty and our duty to the public require that we should be plain and explicit and that we should range upon the one hand those who are gold monometallists and upon the other those who are bimetallists and whatever may be the effort of some people to prevent an issue of this sort it will come it can not be avoided it can not be deferred it has been delayed too long if the present administration were not in accord with the honestly expressed sentiments of the secretary of the treasury would that secretary still remain in office would he still promulgate ex cathedra the principles of finance upon which his party must rest its claim to public approval obviously not no one can be thus deceived in fact the secretary candidly and i have no doubt truly gave out to the associated press but a short time ago the announcement that there was no difference between him and the president that their views were in substantial accord mr president to briefly summarize the general principles for which i have been contending i will put the matter thus does the pending resolution declare the law if so why should it be defeated if everybody admits it to be the law why not say so if it is voted down will it not be hereafter claimed that such vote demonstrated that in the opinion of this body the resolution fails to truly set forth the effect of the statutes of the united states the contract referred to between the bondholders and the united states can not be properly waived in any regard by congress it is our duty to conserve not to give away the peoples rights while an individual may waive his rights with reference to matters of private contract the cohgress of the united states acting under limited power and authority should not be generous in the donation of public assets and should hesitate to give away without consideration valuable privileges of the people the people of the united states are interested as well as the bondholder their welfare must be also the subject of our solicitude while it is not designed to alter the contract to the detriment of the bondholder it is obviously our duty to insist upon those features of the agreement which were made for the security of the public while the bondholder is entitled to every cut his contract calls for he has no rights as to interpretation or construction beyond those which are enjoyed by the other party the government is not bound to pay any penalty to its creditors because of legislation affecting the value of silverfirst because the contract was made in view of the possibility of the exercise of all the discretion possible by congress and secondly for the reason that the assaults made upon silver have emanated from the bondholding class who have ever been the notorious and powerful sources of all adverse silver movements those who oppose the pending resolution deny that the government has impaired the value of silver or that the course of legislation has had that tendency if this is true and such too is the claim of the bondholding class it is absurd to base a pretense that we are morally bound to give away our rights because of any breach of faith upon the part of the debtor the bondholders were of full age and discretion when they contracted they were for the most part careful men used to driving close if not hard bargains it is not pretended that they were deceived in any way or that any fraud was practiced upon them as a rule they have had the better of the contract the retention of the right to exercise the option given in the contract is important even though gold may be ultimately paid as a matter of governmental discretion because raids upon the treasury will not be made if speculators know that the united states will be protected honestly and within the lines of the contract whenever the proper occasion arises and further for the reason that under prevailing treasury practice it is the occupation of the creditor to aid in promoting the continuance of the gold standard while if the government stands upon its rights the creditors interests will be manifestly to assist in maintaining silver as well as gold values moreover the use of the metal upon an equality with gold will pave the way for the steady restoration to its former status while it is undoubtedly impolite and certainly wrong to speak with undue harshness of our creditors yet in view of their frequent descents upon the treasury in time of governmental distress and remembering their shrewdness in concluding paying contracts with the government they should not be treated as paupers or objects of charity or otherwise than as sensible men who are daily required to live up to all of their obligations and who occupy no superior p osition and are entitled to no peculiar consideration from the uovernient of the united states the frequent assertion that the democratic party is in favor of paying obligations in depreciated money is false if the policies for which we contend are enforced there will be no appreciated gold and consequently no depreciated silver it is admitted at least in this debate except by the distinguished senator from louisiana who is a candid advocate of the gold standard and does not believe in the positions with which we are told somerepublicans con cur that bimetallism would inure to the benefit of humanity and that if possible silver should be restored to its former position though it is contended that this can not be done without an international agreement but no international agreement can ever be accomplished if we continue legislation adverse to silver if we who produce so much silver manifest no faith what can we expect of those otherwise interested the failure of the monetary commission was to some extent no doubt due to the notorious circumstance that those powerful influences constituting the trusts syndicates and monopolies who ardently supported the republican party threw cold water upon the whole plan while secretary gage does not hesitate to pin his faith to gold president mckinley contents himself with the declaration that the money of the united states must be unquestioned and unassailable and that we must discharge all our obligations in the currency recognized as the best at the time of payment he does not use the word gold but the manifest purpose of the statement the circumstances under which it was made and the attendant phraseology demonstrate such to be his belief under the democratic system there is no better or best currency in this country all of it is good all of it unassailable at the great dinner already mentionedstyled sometimes a belshazzar feastjust held in the city of new york there were present nearly one thousand diners representing products of the annual value of nine billion three hundred and seventyfive millions of dollars and over sixty trusts all of these people agreed as to the gold standard which they have done so much to establish one of the leading speakers spoke scornfully of the inquisitorial corporation tax the income tax and the graded collateralinheritance tax alluded sarcastically to the crime of 1873 and also to laws regulating the hours of labor the general expression seemed to be that these gentlemen could take care of themselves without legislation and hence that others should do the same thing unanimity of sentiment prevailed would a similar number of american farmers of american producers of the soil have passed similar resolutions or made similar speeches at a rural luncheon and for which class is this government organized the democratic party claims that the benign influence of our system should be extended over all and that burdens should be fairly apportioned but the indorsers of the plans of the present administrationof which those who met at the gathering to which i have referred are fair sampleshave conceived the idea that they should be permitted to proceed in their own way and that having the power to monopolize everything no legislation can properly interfere with their designs the secretary of the treasury in his address made at boston recently in speaking of the gold standard and endeavoring to expose what he was pleased to term the fallacies of mr bryan used lnguage which i quote from the new york tribune speaking of the 16 to 1 argument and alluding to the assmned fact that wages did not show depression arising from the gold standard he continued no it is not upon wages that the injurious effect of a gold appreciation falls it is upon those who own the land the forest and the mines it upon any that the injurious effect is visited this is all so plain that one can not comprehend how the wage earner can be misled by that iridescent orator who by multitudes of words couched in anbignous and sophistical phrases seeks to obscure judgment it was said the other day by the senator from south carolina i think that there were some 30 000 000 people in this country dependent upon agriculture here is a defensive statement made by the secretary of the treasury talking for the ear of one particular class of people and erroneously i believe stating to them that the appreciation of gold did not hurt them but conceding and grounding his argument upon the fact that there is such appreciation and that the loss falls upon those who own the land the forest and the mines for years we have made this contention for years we have referred to those who produce agricultural products as the victims of the gold standard for years the advocates of the gold standard have denied that which the secretary admits we thus have a statement from that officer not only granting our contention but glorying in it and explaining to the wage earners how happy they ought to be because they are sacrificing the interests of those engaged in the other pursuits to which i have adverted the laboring people of this country who have been to some extent influenced by considerations which prevented the free exercise of their judgment are fast coming to know that there is no truth in the pretense that bimetallism and more money will injure them they are fast learning that it is impossible that those who are acquiring the principal part of the wealth of this land are more devoted to their welfare than the tillers of the soil they do not credit the pretense that their wages are upheld or maintained by other influences than their own exertions intelligently directed through their own organizations and by the demand for their skill they well understand that if occasion is ever presented they will suffer at the hands of those who untruly profess to be their disinterested friends the same evils and the same ills which have been visited upon agriculture throughout the united states a time comes occasionally as it did during the last year when the suffering the woe of many in other lands ibrnishes a source of pecuniary benefit to the producers of america but it is a poor consolation to us to know that the only prosperity which we can expect in that part of the union devoted to agriculture is to come when there is suffering and sickness and death and disaster unparalleled among other divisions of the human family mr president i will not trespass longer upon the time of the senate except to repeat that the issue between bimetallism and the single gold standard will be so clearly made from this on that it will be vain to seek to hoodwink the people it is obvious that those republicans who in the face of much local opposition despite a feeling at their homes that they were perhaps doing violence to their convietions in thus adhering to the republican party have voted against us can not continue this course unless they see fit to go down with that organization to defeat and ignominy"],

conditions and the needs of the district of columbia is a prodigal waste of the public money this bridge is in the country this proposed road is the extension of massachusetts avenue and lies out in the country there is no considerable number of people resident on the extension of the street it leads into and through a region of the district which is now in the hands of agents lot owners and speculators it will be beneficial to them and to them only it is not needed as was said by the gentleman from tennessee as a way to the university and if it was completed in my judgment it would not be used by the students of that institution they would adopt the cheaper method of transportation by means of the street railwaysthose already established no street railway will ever be located on this road i take it for the very gentleman whose letter was read here today came to me a few years ago when there was a proposition to establish a muchneeded street railway on seventeenth streethe living on the corner of seventeenth and massachusetts avenueand protested against using that street for purposes of a street railway he said he did not want a street railroad to come into that neighborhood at all that seventeenth street was a resident street and its value as such would be destroyed if the street railway was allowed to pass through it gentlemen will doubtless remember that at that time a strong contest was going on by people living in the vicinity of chevy chase and along the line leading to it to have streetrailway accommodations and connections with the city therefore i deem it to be true that this gentleman would not be willing to have a street railway located on massachusetts avenue which so far as it is improved by residences on its borders is a residence street they would not want it profaned to the uses of a street railway so there is nothing in the argument that the students and the people who will be located at the university will be benefited by the passage of this provision of the bill which has been stricken out by the committee i do not believe that there is any advantage to be derived from this large expenditure of money now when there are so many other uses to which the moneys of the district can be and ought to be appropriated this is to be an ornamental bridge it is to be an addition to a magnificent residence highwaya part of it being such while the part to be benefited and affected runs simply through an unoccupied wilderness"], [8.612871170043945e-05, 0.5000861287117004, 1, "now i offer the following amendment which i send to the
