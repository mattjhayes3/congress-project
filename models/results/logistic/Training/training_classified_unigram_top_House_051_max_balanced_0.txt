it is proposed to establish a territorial government exercising all the powers of governmentlegislative executive andj udicialover the people of oklahoma proper also over the country commonly known as no mans land and the lands acquired from the cheyenne and arapaho indians and to extend judicial authority and jurisdiction over what is known as the cherokee strip or outlet and over the country possessed and owned by the five civilized tribes of indians i can not concur in the views and reasonings expressed by the gentleman from georgia nor with those of the gentleman from mississippi urged in opposition to this measure neither can i concur with the majority of the committee on territories that the measure here presented from that committee embodies the measure of relief which the inhabitants of that country demand and which of right they should have the objections which i would urge against this measure are directly opposite to the objections which have been urged by the distinguished gentlemen to whom i have referred i believe that this bill instead of being too broad in its scope and application is too limited instead of going too far it stops short of meeting the requirements of the situation it does not go far enough sir it is urged here with great ability by my friend from georgia and by myfriend from mississippi that by express covenants and stipulations contained in solemn treaties between the government and indian tribes owning and occupying portions of this territory it was agreed that the united states would not extend nor authorize to be extended over such territory any governmental authority or control whatever that no territorial government should ever be created over or around such territory that by such treaty stipulations the government is forever precluded from establishing any government even to the extent of creating courts in said territory unless the same is assented to by such indian tribes that such treaties are of full binding force and effect and that if the measure under consideration be enacted it will be violative of supch treaties if the position of the gentleman be correct then my study of our system of government has been in vain and has profited me naught i have been led sir to believe that the constitution of the united states and the powers therein conferred upon the different departments of the government extended to and were paramount over every foot of territory within the limits of the nation and over all the people within such territory i was led to believe sir that the constitution not only conferred the power upon but made it the duty of congress and the executive when necessary or proper to create subordinate governments for the welfare of the people not only conferred the power and imposed the duty but fixed and determined the character of the governments to be created i have not yet learned that any portion of the constitution can be suspended or annulled by treaty stipulations i have yet to learn sir that the legislative and executive departments of the government can throw off abrogate or contract away any of the powers functions or duties of government imposed upon them by the constitution the bold broad proposition is presented in this debate that congress and the executive can sell barter and trade away the right to create governments for the people i deny that commissioners appointed to negotiate treaties relating to land trades or the senate of the united states by ratifying or the executive by approving such treaties can suspend or annul the constitution i deny that thereby the government can be estopped from exercising the powers and functions created and conferred by the constitution need i remind this house that within the lifetime of the youngest representative on this floor this country has been drenched in blood and billions of wealth has been expended in maintenance of the principle that this government would not abrogate or surrender any of its constitutional authority and that which it had no constitutional right to surrender it has no constitutional authority to contract away i therefore maintain that any stipulations or agreements contained in treaties or patents that the land described or referred to in such treaties or patents should never be embraced in or ineluded within or annexed to any territory or state or erected into a territory without the free and full consent of the legislative authority of the tribe owning the same or that courts should not be established therein are violative of the constitution and are null and void concede the validity of treaty provisions of this character and behold the absurdities and contradictions in our political system a constitution guarantying a republican form of government for every section of the country annulled or suspended by treaty provisions prohibiting the government from authorizing the creation of a government republican in form over a vast territory within the jurisdiction of the constitution a constitutional command to create such governments bartered and sold away by the executive and one branch of the national legislature a constitutional guaranty that all governments for all the people shall be republican in form running hand in hand with treaty covenants providing for the perpetual continuance of that system of government known only among the aboriginal tribes nor is this all for carry out these treaty provisions to their full import and intent and you prohibit the government from interfering to prevent the establishment of a moparcbical or any other form of government by the tribes inhabiting these lands and this not only for the government of indians but likewise for the government of white citizens of the united states who are more numerous in this territory than are the indians and who are there with equal lawful right another question is presented and discussed in this connection by the opponents of any territorial government for that country it is argued that by treaties and letters patent the government conveyed to the cherokee tribe of indians the lands known as the cherokee strip or outlet that the title to said lands is vested in said indian tribe and that the provisions of this bill extending the jurisdiction of courts over such lands is in violation of treaty provisions if this or any other measure pending in this house would if enacted into law in my judgment invade or take away in the slightest degree any property right or any other lawfully guarantied rights of the indian there would be no man upon this floor more ardent in opposition to such measure than myself every property right of these indians and every right which commissioners framing treaties with indian tribes had constitutional authority to concede and grant ought to be guarded with the most jealous care and every such right he sacredly protected to the full extentof the letter thereof but sir while we should del in a spirit of fairness and with exact justice in our relations with tlrindian we should not allow any mere sentimentality to influence us to concede to him rights which do not in fact or law exist in determining the claims of indians based upon treaties and written instruments we should construe such instruments by the same rules and give to the terms and provisions thereof the same construction and meaning we would if the party claiming thereunder were white men instead of indians what then are the rights of the cherokee indians to the lands known as the outlet or strip i maintain that these lands are the absolute property of the united states and that the cherokee indians have no right or title to them whatever that influenced by a desire to obtain a speedy settlement and improvement of these lands influenced by sentimentality influenced by that spirit of generosity and overfairness which induces and prompts the allowance and payment of doubtful claims especially where payment is made with other peoples money influenced by professional and interested lobbyists perhaps that is not now the proper designation of that patriotic class i believe they now style themselves promoters of legislation the fiftieth congress enacteda law authorizing the appointment of a commission to treat with these indians and purchase whatever claim they might have or any pretended claim to these lands and to pay them therefor at the rate of 1 25 per acre the commission was appointed attempted to negotiate and failed to make the purchase as i believe that the cherokees have not one scintilla of right or title to those lands either in law or in equity i believe it is the duty of the government to atonce open them to settlement and that this billshould contain provisions not only for extending the jurisdiction of courts over this country but also extend over it the jurisdiction of every department of a territorial government and further that it should provide fbr the immediate opening of the lands therein to settlement the ownership of these lands is not involved in mystery they are not claimed by prescriptive right or immemorial occupancy to determine the ownership we are not compelled to ponder over and construe an ancient chain of treaties patents and other instruments of conveyance multitudinous in number and mystifying in language the whole question is solved by the proper interpreting and construing of one plain and unequivocal instrument until the 31st day of december 1838 these lands were the undisputed property of the united states on that day president van buren executed a patent relating to these and other lands to the cherokee indians that patent recites the treaty under which and by authority of which it was issued the treaty was dated the 29th of december 1835 and the second article thereof as recited in said patent was as follows art 2 whereas by the treaty of may 6 1823 and the supplementary treaty 1 516 thereto of february 14 1833 with the cherokees west of the mississippi the united states guarantied and secured to be conveyed by patent to the cherokee nation of indians the following tract of country then follows a description of the land now owned by the cherokees east of the ninetysixth parallel of west longitude included in the lands of the five civilized tribes and amounting to 7 000 000 acres following this description of said tract of land the second article of said treaty continues and recites as follows in addition to the 7 000 000 acres of land thus provided for and bounded the united states further guaranty to the cherokee nation a perpetual outlet west and a free and unmolested use of all the country west of the western boundary of said 7 000 000 acres as far west as the sovereignty of the united states and their right of soil extend it is upon this clause of that treaty and only upon this clause that any claim of title or ownership of the strip or outlet on the part of the cherokees can be predicated it is true that the granting clause of the patent issued by president van buren uses the same words in conveying the two tracts of land it is as follows therefore in the execution of the agreements and stipulations contained in the said several treaties the united states have given and granted and by these presents do give and grant unto the said cherokee nation the two tracts of land so surveyed and hereinbefore described containing in the whole 14 374 135 14 acres to have and to hold the same together with all the rights privileges and appurtenances thereunto belonging to the said cherokee nation forever etc the president in issuing this patent was executing a special agency he was simply executing and giving effect to the treaty and his powers and authority were limited by that instrument the president has not ex officio authority to convey or make grants of the public domain he acts in such cases only under special warrant and authority of law and in this case president van buren acted only under authority of the treaty of december 29 1835 and his authority was limited by the terms of that treaty hence the estate conveyed is to be determined not by the language of the patent but by the provisions of the treaty and the patent is void in so far as it imports the conveyance of more lands or a greater estate than was authorized to be conveyed or contracted to be conveyed by the provisions of the treaty the treaty i submit in apt and proper terms authorized the conveyance to the cherokee indians of a feesimple title to the 7 000 000 acres east of the ninetysixth parallel of longitude and had it been the intention of the makeis of the treaty that a similar title to the strip should be conveyed the same words would have been used a separate clause would not have been inserted for that purpose but the fact that the distinct tracts were authorized to be conveyed if any conveyance of the strip was intended by different clauses of the treaty and that entirely different language is used in defining the rights or estate in each tract to be granted or conveyed shows conclusively that it was not intended that the same estate in each tract should be granted in addition to the 7 000 000 acres of land thus provided for and bounded the united states further guarantynot convey not authorize to be conveyedto the cherokee nation a perpetual outlet west and a free and unmolested use of all the country west of the western boundary of said 7 000 000 acres as far west as the sovereignty of the united states and their right of soil extend is there a lawyer in this house who if sitting upon the bench and required to determine from the language of the clause of that treaty i have just quoted what were the rights of the parties and who if the issue was between the united states and white citizens of the government would for a moment entertain the idea of holding that any greater estate was conveyed or intended to be conveyed than a mere easement an outlet a right of way a mere right of passage over in construing an instrument of this character it is our duty to take into consideration the situation conditions and circumstances that surrounded the paxties when the instrument was made it will be remembered documents are before the house and already in the record showing that when this treaty was made it was considered doubtful if the 7 000 000 acres would be ample for the use of the cherokee nation it will also be remembered that all the lands lying west of this disputed tract and extending to the pacific ocean belonged to the mexican government and were unoccupied and the evidentpurpose of this guaranty was that the cherokee indians might have a lawful passageway or outlet from their home reservation to the unoccupied mexican lands to the west for the purposes of hunting and fishing if i be correct in this then the cherokees can have no right or shadow of claim to these lands unless such right of way passageway or casement call it by whatever name you will still exists need i call to the attention of the learned lawyers of this house the old and familiar rules of the common law need i say to them that there is no sounder or bettersettled principle of law than that if i convey to another a feesimple title to a part of a tract of land which i own and in the same instrument of conveyance i grant him a perpetual right of way or easement over the lands which i retain for the purpose of reaching a living spring or running stream with the use of such spring or of thewaters from such stream or if i grant him such right of way that he may have egress to or ingreps from a public highway if the spring dries up if the stream ceases to run or if the highway be abandoned the right of way over my lands that estate or easement therein which i had granted to him ceases to exist when the use ceases the right terminates it is said by the gentleman from new jersey that the most obnoxious feature of this bill that which is the greatest violation of treaty rights isfound in the provisions which authorize the creation of courts in the territory of the five civilized tribes sir i have endeavored to show that the establishment of courts or the creation of any other department of government over any of the indian territory is not only the right but the duty of congress under the constitution and no treaty can be made valid which attempts to abridge that right and i hope that this bill will pass but that before it shall pass and become a law it will have been so amended as to provide for opening to settlement immediately every foot of land in which no indian title exists and that it shall be further amended so as to create a territorial government exercising all the powers and functions of government over all the country in that part of the nation not already included in states and territories i want now and here the foundation laid for another great state of this great union in which an american constitution american laws and american civilization shall govern protect and elevate all the people i say to you that the time has come when there is no longer room in the united states for the operation of two systems of government or two civilizations certainly the time has come when barbarism or semibarbarism ought not longer to be fostered encouraged or protected the time has come when the government should obey the constitution and give to every part of the nation and to all the people thereof an american republican form

not only to make but alter mark you congress must alter and not make the states alter congress must make and not allow the states to go on and make and then say the state law is my law it must alter ititself and not mix up a kind of brunswick stew as it were of the duties of state officers and federal officers in the enforcement of a state law the regulation must be clear precise and concise the federal regulations must be clearly federal independent of and apart from the state regulation and the state regulations must be distinct from the federal machinery so that there can be no danger of a collision of authority so that when the state regulation is altered by congress it is no longer a state regulation in its changed condition it at once puts on the federal character is a federal enactment for the enforcement of which the federal government and its agents is alone responsible is any other theory consistent with the independence of the state and federal systems and now if gentlemen will pardon the historical narrative in 1789 when the first congress convened there was a resolution offered for an amendment to the constitution to be submitted to the states striking out the latter part of that clause but the congress may have power at any time to make or alter etc the proposition was debated for some time but it was finally defeated by a vote of 23 to 28 and the provision was permitted to stand as it was but if gentlemen will take that discussion and read it as i have done lately they will find that the men who voted against striking that out put on record as their reason that it was a clause that could never be used and would never be used except when the states refused to act in one of the reports presented here by my friend from maryland mr mccomiias i believe i find that he says it is a remarkable fact that many of the states proposed an amendment to the constitution striking out the latter part of the section and congress declined to change it and that that fact made the argument the stronger that the people who were in that congress intended that the power should remain there that is only partly true but it remained there why because of the fact that the men who voted to retain it did so under the distinct understanding as stated by many of them that this was a power thatecould never injure the people of the country because it never was intended to be used except when the states failed to provide the necessary machinery when you come down to the act of 1842 which has been referred to you find that congress there attempted to take charge of this matter in 1842 congress passed a law directing the states to elect their representatives by districts rather than by a general ticket system as some were then doing the bill was approved june 25 1842 and president tyler sent a special message to congress giving his reasons for approving it this was so unusual a prcceeaing that the venerable mr adams who was then a member of the house asked that the message be referred to a select committee with power to send for persons and papers the states of missouri georgia mississippi and new hampshire declined to obey the law and elected their representatives by thegeneral ticket system as theretofore upon the assembling of the twentyeighth congress the question of the title to their seats was at once raised and able reports were filed by hon stephen a douglas for the majority of the committee and hon garrett davis for the minority they were elaborately and fully discussed a separate vote was asked on each member in the case of edmund burke of new hampshire the first vote taken the yeas were 128 and the nays were 68 while varying slightly in the other cases the majority was aboutthe same in each case we find among those voting in the affirmative such names as john p hale hannibal hamlin preston king george c dromgoole edniund w hubard and stephen a douglas and others see house journal first session twentyeighth congress pages 380 381 so that the power claimed by congress to command the states to lay off districts lbr members of congress was thus emphatically and quickly denied and so far as we are informed it has never been attempted since then you find that in 1870 and in 1872 congress provided that elections should be by ballot and that the time of holding them was to be uniform throughout the country why gentlemen i think nothing demonstrates more clearly than these verylaws the absolute necessity e1 leaving to the people of each state the control of its elections and election machinery suppose congress in its wisdom were to pass a lawproviding that members of congress should be elected on the 15th of january in each year would not that operate to disfranchise many states in this union how could the people get out on the snowclad hills of maine or the blizzardstricken plains of minnesota to vole on the 15th of january why it shows more clearly than anything else that the people of each state are better qualified to judge of what is proper in conducting their own elections than anybody else again take the matter of the ballot congress has acted on that and therefore it is said that it is constitutional because congress has acted on it but it is to be remembered that congress has passed a great manyunconstitutional laws i know not what others may think but i believe there is nothing about which the people of the states should be allowed to exercise their ownjudgment more than that matter of a secret ballot personally i believe in an open ballot by the man singing out before god and man in the broad light of day the name of the man he votes for you may not so believe then you ought not to be compelled to have a viva voce system i do not likea sneak oraspy that is afraid to open his mouth and tell the people how he is going to vote congress however has preferred it and enacted it into law and by that act has done more in myj udgment to disorganize and demoralize the public sentiment of the country than it will ever gain by passing such a bill as this let every man judge for himself let every man take care of his own household let every people determine for itself what is best for itself and let others do the same for themselves a man who insists on taking care of other peoples business all the time will find that his own will go to ruin i heard of a man once who made a fortune by attending to his own business and i will add to avoid mistake that his name was not lodge or t1vell what we ask for what the states ask for is that they may be left to determine for themselves what is best under the constitution for themselves now gentlemen there is another clause of the constitution to which i have referred that bears very decidedly upon this question chiefjustice chase in the case of hepburn vs griswold the old legaltender case which has become so celebrated in the land was called on to construe that clause in the constitution which provides that the congress shall have power to pass all laws necessary and proper to carry into execution the foregoing powers and gentlemen if you conclude that under the second and fourth sections of the first article of the constitution congress has the power at any time to interfere and take the elections into its own hands you have yet to construe those provisions of the constitution with the subsequent one which provides that it can only pass laws which are necesstry and proper to carry into execution the powers granted now what are necessary and proper 1 laws to carry into execution the powers granted to congress over the election of representatives chiefjustice chase says that the words necessary and proper mean bona fide appropriate to the end in view that they mean absolute good faith absolutely appropriate means not for partisan purposes but in good ftith bona fide now is it bona fide appropriate to the assumption by congress of the control of elections for congressmen to appoint supervisors whose duties shall be not to carry on any separate election machinery but to go on and stick their noses into the election machinery of the states is it bona fide appropriate to the purpose of an election law for the election of members of congress that state officers should be dragged into the federal courts and punished for a violation of a state law oris it bona fide appropriate to this object that each member of this house should be returned not by the state that sends him here but by an officer of this government appointed for life amenable to no power and with no penalty attaching to his dereliction of duty is it bcna fide appropriate to the purpose of passing an election bill that yon should put into it a clause providing that the juries of the country shall be of one political faith put your hands upon your hearts and let your hearts seek coun sel from on high and answer me whether that is bona fide appropriate to the purposes of passing an election law but observe this clause again the times places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives etc if congress has the power to pass this bill it has the power to amend it and make it applicable to the election of senators apply its provisions to the election of senators and what would we have the legislatures of the states dominated and controlled in the election of senators by federal officers in the state of virginia in the election of senator a committee of three members from each house shall compare the votes and ascertain and report the result but if this bill be censtitutional and applied to the election of senators the committee of each house of the virginia legislature could not compare the votes without the supervision of the federal supervisors they could not ascertain and count the vote for under this bill that power is given the supervisors they could not report the result to their respective houses for the supervisors would report the result to a federal canvassing board members would be challenged in their right to vote and the right of the people of a county to representation denied by afederal official confusion chaos and collision would inevitably result and the proud position of free and independent states converted into the subserviency of crouching victims to federal usurpation and power does not the analogy show that the makers of the constitution could never never have intended any such power to be given to congress over the states and their elections for senators and representatives it will not do to say such power in the election of senators will never be invoked the political exigency that could disperse the legislature of a state at the point of the bayonet would not be long in finding a pretext for the application of the club and the billet for t he enforcement of its wicked designs but gentlemen we come now to the discussion of some of the provisions of this bill this bill has a provisionwhich so long as i am a member of this house i shall resist with all the power that i have because i believe it is against the true interests of the american people it was john marshall of old virginia somebody has said she never tires and some wag has added that it is because she never did anything to make her tired but in spite of that gentlemen i love every foot of her sacred soil with all my heart not only for what she is now doing but for what she has done in the past if her history were blotted out today from that of the sisterhood of states and the declaration of her great jurist to which i ate about to refer were alone preserved to let posterity know that she once had existed virginias life would not have been in vain it was that great jurist john marshall sitting as a member of the greatest convention that ever assembled on this continent in 182930 as a member of the virginia convention to revise the constitution of that state who used these words in speaking of thejudiciary i have always thought front my earliest youth till now that the greatest scourge that an angry heaven ever inflicted upon an ungrateful and a sinning people was an ignorant a corrupt ora dependent judiciary do gentlemen propose by this bill when the country is full of corruption in high places throughout the land when it crawls with its slimy trail even into the highest offices of the governmentare gentlemen willing to drag down the last bulwark of american liberty into the slums of partisan politics are gertlemels for party purposes willing to forego the preservation in its purity of the chief bulwark of american liberty i speak sir not as a partisan on this subject whatever else may be done in this bill however much some of its features may commend themselves to you for gods sake strike out that provision that puts it into the hands of te judiciary of the country to run the elections of the country one gentleman who preceded me said that it was absolutely essential for the good of the country that the people should have confidence in the purity of he electioms is it not more essential that the people should have confidence in the judiciary those who hold the scales of justice or ought to hold them impartially between man and man i agree with honorable gentlemen to this extent at least that the merest suspicion of fraud attaching to the judiciary is as bad as fraud itself the judge of the circuit court of the united states appoints the supervisors section 5 if oneof them is tobe triedfor misconduct thejudge who appointed him tries him a jury selected by a clerk of the same political faith is impaneled for him there could be but one result in nine cases out of ten the conduct of thesupervisor is not alone on trial but the judgment of the judge in selecting him as such supervisor is also on trial and before whom before the judge who selected him one other point i desire especially to bring to the attention of the house so far as i rememberand i am borne out in this statement by gentlemen who have examined the particular section perhaps more closely than i havethere is not only a life tenure for the chief supervisor who conducts these elections but there is absolutely no penal statute in regard to him duty pnd responsibility should go hand in hand here we have a duty imposed with responsibility to no one for its proper discharge if i am mistaken on this point no one will more frankly than myself admit it but i have been unable to find in the bill any penal provision with regard to the chief supervisor but i object to another provision here i object to that provision in this bill which proposes to apply the power of punishment undar the penal clauses to state officers and i beg that you remember that there is one section in this bill providing a punishment for thp officers it creates and eight sections providing punishment for state officers whom it has never created is that right is it in the interest of preventing collisions throughout the country beginning at section 42 and going on through the bill you will find various provisions for punishing the state officers of elections and then there is one little section providing for the punishment of the supervisors and i say further that congress has no power under the constitution to punish the officer of the state for the violation of state law i am perfectly aware that it has been stated otherwise in certainly a very respectable tribunal but that decision was only reached by the learned judge assuming that in the election of members of congress the election machinery was operated under state laws that congress in effect adopted such laws as its own not by enactment but by implication but if my view of the constitution is correct congress has power only under condition to make or alter these provisionn in regard to elections and in order to make anybody liable under its law it must be clearly a federal law and not a state law converted into federal law by implication it can not say to the state we will let you go on we will let you have your judges of election and other officers of election and we will have ours we will have supervisors and marshals when our officers disobey our law we will punish them when your officers who have never taken an oath to support the constitution of the united states but are sworn to support the state constitution violatetheir state laws we will punish them too i say it is not right"], [0.017049551010131836, 0.9829504489898682, 1, "i have this to say mr chairman and gentlemen of the house

intend doing and should not have done without at least seeing the honorable secretary again of stating that he told me three days ago that if there was anything in this report that indicated that the indians had a title to this land it had not met his approval i now desire to call the attention of the house to this language and again i read from the treaty by article 3 of the choctaw and chickasaw treaty of april 28 1866 14 statutes 769 it is providedthat the choctaws and chickasaws in consideration of the sum of 300 000 hereby cedeto the united states the territory west of the ninetyeighth degree of west longitude known as the leased district i have taken the ground that that meant an absolute cession to the united states mr belt in this report page 8 uses this language it will be seen that in the treaties with the cherokees creeks and seminolesplease keep these three in mindthe purposes for which the ceded lands were to be used are specifically set out while the cession made by the choctaws and chickasaws was without res ervation or condition expressed so faras the words of the treaty are concerned as to the purposes to which the united states intended to devote the country so ceded then he uses this language on page 10 theprovisions of article3 of the choctawand chickasaw treatyofimg iftaken alone and according to their legal meaning and effect can only be considered as conveying to the united states all the right title and interest owned or possessed by the choctaw and chickasaw indians to the lands ceded thereby without condition or reservation then on page 12 he says in viewof these facts it would seem that the basis of claim of the choctaws and chickasaws for further compensation for the lands if valid the claim itself is prematurely presented then at the bottom of the same page mr belt uses this very remarkable language while there are clearly no words of limitation in the treaty of 1859 as to the useremember no words of limitation as to the use to which the ceded lands should be put by the united states the history of the negotiation preceding and resulting in that treaty and the subsequent treatment of the subject quite clearly indicate that the choctaws and chickasaws have good ground for claiming that they understood that the lands were to be used for thelocation of other indians and freedmen thereon ifthey have as seems to be the ease an equitable claim it is for congress to determine what shall be the mesure of allowance to be made for its adjustment in order to clear the lands of the incunbrane now mr belt goes on two theories the argument is so long that i trust i will not do him any injustice by trying to digest the two points after the war nearly all of these tribes having been more or less rebellious the government made a change as to its treatment of them and for the purpose of bringing them all into new relations with it and settling all matters of dispute a commission was appointed with authority to treat with all of the five socalled civilized tribes it seems their instructions were general and were intended to apply to negotiations with all of the five tribes but eac i being an independent tribe a treaty had
