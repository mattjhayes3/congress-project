house in the record because i propose on monday next if i can got the floor to ask a twothird vote upon the measure and i desire it should be open to examination before the house shall be called to vote upon it i do not believe in passing bills affecting great interests by a twothird vote without discussion and the measure i present will not be a bill i propose a resolution which i will read and then explain the reason for it lcovleed that the committee on banking and currency be instructed to report to this house forthwith a proer bill or billsfirst to provide for the reissue of the fractional currency of the denomination of fifty and twentyfive conts for the withdrawal of subsidiary silver coins of the same denomination now in eireulation as fast as they may be received into the treasury and prevent further issue thereo so to rovido for the priuting and issue of twenty millions of legaltender notes of the donominations of one two and five dollars in equal proportions to be paid from the treasury for the current expenses of the government for circulation among the people you will remember sir we withdrew the fifty and twentyfive cent fractional currency front circulation and substituted therefor the silver half and quarter dollar now i think the general opinion of the people of the country is that was the most convenient currency we ever had there are many uses for which it is convenient which the silver half and quarter dollar do not have for instance all small sums to be transmitted by mail practically cannot he transmitted now a silver half dollar breaks the envelope of its own weight if it does not break it of its own weight it tells everybody it is there and somebody else breaks it and it does not reach its destination my attention was called to this by a very practical man in massachusetts a large seed producer who paid a very large postal revenue in his business which requires to be transmitted to him fifty and twentyfive cents for packages of seed all over the country he found in a few months a loss as high as 4 000 a month for the want of some means of sending the money to him in these small sums and so small subscriptions for various publications and periodicals cannot be sent it may be said why not get a postal order that postal order to send fifty or twentyfive cents would cost ten cents therefore we cannot transmit by mail and any one who tries to transmit en uneven sum by mail will find if he does not get a postal order it will give him great trouble now there would be no objection it seems to me to the remonetization of this most convenient of all convenient currexcy which nothing but extreme folly approaching in my judgment to idiocy ever caused to be taken out of circulation i have not provided in the instructions to the committee there shall he any extension of what is called i believeit ought not to be so calledan increase of currency but i have simply provided the silver half and quarter dollar shall be withdrawn but i am not partiemlar about that you get the others out and these will go in of their owni motion then you observe there is another provision here and that is that one two and three dollar greenbacks shall be issued to the amount of 20 000 000 i do not care for inflation to that amountalthough is is folly to talk about inflation for 20 000 000 currency is the money of retail to do retail business and onehundred and fivehundred and onethousand dollar bills are not money at all they are simply large convenient checks it is supposed and believed by those who have examined the subject that 95 per cent of alithe business of the country is done by the checkbook the ledger the bill of lading and other forms of mercantile security and that currency only does the business of reta i of about 5 per cent and it needs to be small for that purpose banks under the old system used to be very fond of putting out their small bills ones twos threes and fives why because they went into circulation were worn out and lost there was a great profit on them and there being agreat profit on them the circulatioil being for a long time they were a favorite issue for all banks but now no matter what the size of the bill if it once gets out into circulation it never comes home to the bank and it takes from three to live years to get in the bills of a national bank when it is wound up ard the banks have to pay for printing the bills and it costs just as much to print a onedollar bill as to ptint a thousanddollar bill therefoe the banks are withdrawing all their small bills and only issue large bills of teno twenty fifty and five hundred dollars and the consequence is that all over the country there is a great dearth of small bills especially all over the agricultural portion of the country aid the design of this resolution is to have the government provide those small bills as the banks do not issue them and do not care to issue them and then the devil entered into somebody a year ago and there was an attempt to contract the currency by taking in all thesmallbills and there havebeenaboutsixteen millionsof them taken in it was said that was the best way to begin to contract the currencyto contract the simall bills now i want those set afloat again because i say again currency is the money of retail and when inca talk about an overflowing currency they have not in my judgment very much idea about what they are talking of we are tolw we have a great deal too much currency because we have a great many large bills and we have got money we have got currencymeaning thereby bankbills and greenbacksto the amount of about six hundred and fifty millions and it is said we do not need so much that before the war we had only about two huiidred and fifty millions and we have not had any such increase of population as corresponds to the increase of currency but did it ever occur to gentlemen that with this money of retail we are doing fen five six seven eight times as much business retail business now as before the war let us take some examples before the war we had but twentyseven thousand miles of railroad now we have seventyseven thousand miles and all railroad business as far as the carrying of passengers is concerned is done by currency and largely the freight business also the receipts of the postoffice before the war were only about eight or nine millions now they are forty millions all done by currency the telegraph bad hardly got started before the war now its receipts are sixty and seventy millions a year all done by currency the express companies had hardly got from large city to large city before the war now the express goes into every hamlet all over the country and its business is all done by currency and small currency at that as i have said i do not reckon fivehundreddollar and onethousanddollar bills as currency they are only large checks therefore i have introduced this resolution and i put it in the recoan so that anybody who cares to do so may examine it and i suppose everybody that cares anything about the convenience of the people will examine it but those who have the convenience of bankers and brokers in their minds and that only will not or if they do it will not make any impression on their heads i put it on the recoad that all gentlemen may see it before they are called to

twothird vote to move an amendment to the appropriation bill in rogardto this matter of paying pensions with great pains aided by such instruction as i could get i prepared the bill which i hold in my hand it provides in the first place that the payment of pensions shall be bimonthly this was to meet a great evil which is that pensioners in spite of all we can do pledge their pensions to sharks at usury and the more you legislate against the sharks the more usury they take so that it is no use to legislate in that direction the bill further provides that the several postmasters in each county or parish where parish is the proper designation shall be exoffiio pension agents and shall be required to attend to the business of examining vouchers and that the amount of pensions to be paid in each county shall be transmitted to the postmaster the bill then goes on to provide a mode of working out this system it requires the postmaster to know personally who the pensioner is as he may do it allows the chief clerk to assist him in this business and authorizes both the postmaster and chief clerk to examine the pensioner and his witnesses under oath it also provides that where aperson is under guardianship the pension shall be paid to the guardian in addition to this the bill makes provision for appropriate penalties it then abolishes all of the present system in conflict with these provisionsthe whole of the existing system is to my mind exceedingly vicious it has safeguards where they are not needed and has none where they are needed under the system i propose the payment of these pensions will bea neighborhood matter every postmaster can know when it is made his business to know the pensioners in his county the bonds given hy these postmasters can be regulated in accordance with the additional duties thus imposed under this bill it will be the duty of the commissioner of pensions to send to each postmaster as early as the third day of every second month a draft on the treasury for the amount which the pension roll as brought up to date shows to be due by this means bimonthly payments of pensions could be made without any expense and with better safeguards than you now have under this system there would be hardly any human possibility of the united states being defrauded after i had introduced this bill and had it referred to the commit tee on the judiciary the committee on invalid pensions as i remember goaded me a little for taking their business out of their hands as they wanted to deal with the question i wanted to be goodnatured as i sometimes do and allowed the measure to go into theie hands but it slept the sleep that knows no waking and for this reason as soon as the bill was published and distributed over the country a pension agent on duty i believe in philadelphia who thought it would be a great wrong to everybody if this bill should pass called a convention of pension agents to meet in this city thereupon all the pension agents came here and buttonholed their momhers and as they were in many cases nephews or cousins or some other relatives of members they succeeded in persuading them that these pension agencies must not be abolished thus they beat me the only revenge i had if it can be so called was that the man who called the convention a philadelphia man if i remember rightly defaulted soon afterward and ran away so my bill has slept from that day to this now in my judgment there is no more need of this great expense in the payment of pensions than there is of throwing money into the fire if i were carrying on a mill in massachusetts i could hire a man in civillife to make out the roll of twentyfive hundred employds keep the accounts handle all the money and pay them every monthi could hire without difficulty a perfectly competent man to do this for 1 500 a year and he would pay those twentyfive hundred men in three hours with perfect ease of course he would make all his preparations during the month he makes out the roll putting every mans name on it subject to change up to the last hour then he sends it round for them all to sign he puts each mans money in an envelope and as they pass out on a saturday afternoon work being stopped an hour earlier for that purpose he passes to each man the envelope containing his money there is not the least difficulty about the matter i do not want to bid for a contract but i will make a pretty public bid i will agrd to undertake the payment of these pensions giving bonds to be responsible for all losses of money over j of 1 per cent and i will agree that it shall not cost the government onequarter of what it costs now i do not know that i would not resign my seat in congress to take the matter in hand under the present system vouchers are sworn to before justices of the peace and within the last five years more than twenty of these justices i speak within bounds have been convicted formaking false vouchers they themselves getting up the vouchers these men charge the pepsioner fifty cents or a dollar or 1 50anything they dare to chargefor making and signing these vouchers i know of one case in which a justice of the peace required a pensioner and every one of his witnesses who swore to a voucher to pay fifty cents apiece for the oath this is one way in which pensioners are defrauded as other gentlemen i have no doubt can testify from their own experience ow i am speaking of this merely as a business proposition i would have this business done as i would any other business i have not sufficiently examined the plan of the committee on appropriations to give an opinion upon it but in framing the measure which i have described i labored with a good deal of assiduity simply in the interest of the pensioners in order to prevent them from being preyed upon by those who will take them and board them for a month furnishing them with all the liquor they want and then after drawing their pension money kick them out somebody else picking them up and dealing with them in the same wty for the next month all those things ought to be remedied by the government and i know no way of remedying abuses under the government except to bring the whole matter as near the people as possible and i know of no way of bringing this near the meople better than to bring it to the postmasters of the county seat generally men of respectabilityalmost alwaysvery few defalcationsall bonded officers all men with ample time to do this business and who for ten cents a pensioner will do the business and be glad to do it and whenever any postmaster of a county seat refuses to do the business for this i can find a good disabled soldier who will do both the postmasters business and this business to be appointed in his place if the president will listen to it i have simply sought the floor to bring this matter to the attention of the house and to the attention of the pension committee and to ask them to take a day or two to consider this bill which has very many faults i have no doubt if they do not like this i will introduce another i will introduce another bill upon the same subject so as to have it done through the moneyorder office precisely as money orders are now sent so as to insure the safety of its transmission checks cannot always be safe that would make trouble i submit to the honorable and learned gentleman who has charge of this bill whether all this instead of being done by checks cannot be done by money ordersmnoueyorder offices are so numerous over the countryto reach the pensioner in perfect safety there is one difficulty about the check system which i beg leave to call attention to if the check is lost by transmission through the mail then before the pensioner can get another he has to give bonds and various matters to get it again and to be paid whereas a money order can always be taken care ofnever can be got away so it cannot be paid i have no doubt if the committee on pensions or the committee on appropriations will call upon the very able and learned gentleman who is at the head of the moneyorder office in the postoffice department he will devise a scheme for them by which it can be done while i think he will be reluctant to add to his present labors yet i believe lie has enough of right feeling for the soldier to undertake it it is a shame it is a disgrace to the administration of the countryi do not mean party administration but to the administration of the lawsthat we cannot have a sum of money devoted to high charity paid out and disbursed without a toll of nearly all told threequarters of a million of dollars more than 2j per cent m i powers will the gentleman let me ask him a question"], [0.07892075926065445,

little paper called the internalrevenue record this bill proposes all these shall be cut off and this publication shall take their place it is to be issued weekly to contain all public advertisements of all coutracts and there is an amendment reported by the committee to the bill to have a copy of this paper not only in every public library in every district in every clerks office of the united states but two copies in every countycourt office so it shall be open to the people and everybody will know where to go see the laws orders and advertisements of the government and learn exactly what they call for they will have them there in an official form let me give you an idea of how tricks are played in regard to advertisements ordered by law i was not long a go of counsel in a patent case and it turned out that the patent had been extended we produced the letter of the one who got the extension lie said he had gone to a newspaper in this city and paid so much money for havinlg tie official advertisement of extension here in washington put in and then he had three copies struck o11 and then had another advertisement put in place of it and the rest of the edition struck off ile said further i now send you one copy and i want yoi to put that in the county paper which the law requires and then have three copies struk off one for the fil es of the patent office one for the files of the newspapr oflico and one for me anil then have another advertisement of the samosizo put in and have struckoff the rest of tire edition i want to meet that possibility of such frands in the future in addition it is proposed to meet a great want known to the country and that is to get in soe reasonable time anlt at some reasonable price the laws and the decisions of the supreme court therefore there is an amendment which will be read in a moment by which the decisions of the supreme court are to be published with a brief abstract of each case as they come out as matters now are the supreme court judges before they deliver an opinion have it printed ond corrected under their own eye and when they deliver it we propose to put it in the official advertiser instead of waiting the slower process of the bound volumes of the reports every mail will not want the whole of this advertiser the patent attorney and inventors will want the patent offlie portion of it the navy officers will want the naval orders the military man the army orders the contractor will want advertisements for contracts the agriculturist will want the agricultural bureau part of it and so on therefore this bill provides each department shall have itsorders and advertisements anti circulars printed by themselves so each part can be used byeach department while thewhole will go into every library thon the bill permits anybody to subscribe for exactly such a part as he wants or the whole a patent man subscribes for the patent part the navy officer subscribes for the navy part the army officer subscribes for the army part the man interested in public lands subscribes for the public lands part and all this can be had for onethird if not onefourth of the present cost of advertising by the government now some gentlemen will ask me in his own mind can you tell us what the public advertising costs no sir i cannot and i do not think it can be found out without an expenditure of many thousands of dollars it dribbles through every office and department why sir it is everywhere and is not to be found and it is an awful leak too this is the way in which the money goes out congress appropriates money for a public work the public work is advertised for the iron the stone the glass the paint the various kinds of work in a dozen different advertisements it may be and the cost of such advertising is charged in the cost of the building or work and so with forts so with any other thing bought or used by the government therefore to find out what the cost of public advertisements is yeau must overhaul the accounts of every public building and every public work and every expenditure for property or labor of the united states in the given year so with land sales so with a great many other things the search for the cost of this expenditure for advertising would simply be endless i have had an estimate made by the public printer and he thinks that 5 000 copies of this may be got up weekly per 1 000 copies the cost would be 1 060 40 a week the whole costof 5 000 copies ought to be not beyond 50 000 or 70 000 a year and i have no doubt the present printing costs more than half a millioni mean outside the public printer now there is another thing in this hill all these copies of the laws all these copies of all these orders are made prila feels evidence in every court officially and a great deal of money will be saved to the people in that way this bill has been before the judiciary committee some three times we have carefully examined it it has been examined by the pulblic printer and while i do not claim for it perfection i do claim that there is a very great deal of merit in the scheme and it will save more money than has been done in any one matter that has come under my observation there is another provision every department of the government now orders what printling and binding it pleases and you find nicely bound books distributed from the departments by their officers that congress never appropriated for this says you must have it done by the public printer and the public printer cannot print anything that is not authorized by law i have one other thing tosay about this this country is the only civilized country in the world that has not got an official gazette where everything that pertains to the operationsof the government all the acts and orders of the government can ie found the official gazette in england is a source of revenue to the hovernment of l15 000 a year frons subscriptions i have nodoubt that innno year or two years at most this will become a paying concern to the united states everybody wants it every contractor vill want it every army officer will want it every navy officer will want it every officebolder

case which is now before the house in pursuance of that duty i examined all the precedents in the case of the first admission of states and the first elections and i gave to the house the result of that examination i am now to call to the attention of the house that in the speeches able as they have been on the other side there has been no attempt to overturn that unbroken line of precedents or to distinguish this case from those in this the vital point that the enabling act by which the state is admitted always may fix and always has fixed the lay for the first election or when none has been fixed then the member who was elected by the people at the first general election under the constitution has always been seated now all this turns upon the question of law whether the enabling act did fix a day or permit colorado to fix a day if it did it overthrew repealed liro lato the general act fixing a day for all the states and territories and that it should do so is exactly what we should expect when making new legislation for a new state not adopting old legislation for old states this is a question upon which there may be somc doubt if you stand by the strict letter of the law there may be doubt but that doubt has always been resolved in favor of the man that has been elected but gentlemen look upon this thing differently and i accord to my opponents opposite the same right of judgment that i claim for myself and i could easily conceive how men can be brought to believe a proposition of law that i cannot and i have a very strong example before in the learned and able gentleman from virginia in his speech undertook to say to the house that the attorneygeneral had given his opinion in this case substantially that the 7th day of november was the day for the election of representatives i think if the attorneygeneral had given that opinion it was a very strong point although i had not the pleasure of hearing the speech of the gentleman from virginia i did him the honor as i always do of reading his speech very carefully and i find how easily a man of his ability can be misled the letter of the attorneygeneral was to this effect the marshal of the state asked in one of the last days of september to have leave of absence for thirty days the attorneygengral writes him i am in receipt of your letter of the 19th instant in which yon ask for leave of absence for thirty days froi and after october next this will include the day of the general clection and the tiles intervening between the present date and that which it is presumed will be a priod of conesder ble exciteament in all parts of the country at such a time i think tha ellicord of the united states especially united states marshals should be at their pests was there not a general clectioi held on that day was there anything said about a member of congress he says there is to be a general election and the marshal had better be at home is that the authority of my friend from virgiuia and yet in groping around for authorities this is the best he can do and if he could do nothing better i do not know anybody else who could that is the only authority lie finds and yet so strong is the disposition to sustain our own cause that we lawyers get our minds very much led away therefore i say this is a matter on which we can all differ but there are some things we do not differ about and that is that the people of colorado meant to have elected mr belford on that day and the people of colorado did not mean to elect mr patterson on that or any other day now i agree to the authority cited that where an election is held ac2ording to law and men have had a fair chance to vote that that election is controlling against those who stay away but the fair chance to vote is the condition as laid down by mt mccrary in his law of elections at the second election the parties had not a fair chance to vote for the great republican party and a great portion of the democratic party staid away upon the ground that there was no time to vote and that they ought not to vote they may have been mistaken if you please but it was not a fair vote now what is our duty dur duty is to do that which all this election machinery of ballot committees counts supervisors tends to it all tends to one use and to answer one purpose and that is to get at a fair expression of the will of the people and whenever any election machinery or retirning boards electoral commissions or anything under heaven stands between the will of the people and the fair count of thevote of the people the fair yielding to the expression of that vote it ought to be swept away and made no account of whatever party is to be benefited or whatever partyis to be destroyed no machinery of returning boards no machinery of counting no machinery of election ever ought to put a man in any office who is not elected by the fair vote of the people and both of my friends on the other side however much they may be committed to the opposite i pray you hold your peace forever after if you put a man who had nob that fair vote and that fair expression of the will of the people in his favor into a seat in this house

a majority an absolute majority of the entire voting population of colorado elected mr belford other men few ia number went through the form of an election on the 7th of november you now decide by a majority of your committee of elections which i expect you will follow that mr belford ought not to have been elected osi that day when he was elected very good then it was our duty i speak not now of the partisan it makes little difference to us whether you have a majority of one less or more that is of no consequence but the principle is of the greatest consequence what is our duty send this

to live on the land the gentleman must be aware that a bill is now pending to permit those who have settled on unsurveyed lands and on lands incorrectly surveyed where surveys have afterward been made and approved to count the time the settler has lived upon the land as a part of the five years they have to live on the land in order to secure a good title and let me say to the gentleman from colorado that instead of this excluding settlement it expedites it it gives the settler a better opportunity than he ever had under the present system with this cumbersome office of surveyorgeneralin the way when you attack a mans homestead application in nine cases out of ten he will go off and leave it because it is so troublesome for him to secure his title the system is so cumbersome so tied up particularly by surveyorgenerals offices that if you attack a homesteaders title for any reason it is cheaper and better for him to abgndon his homestead than to fight it out with you the gentleman from colorado as a practicing lawyer of that new country must know this to be the fact the system of survey and disposition of the public lands was very good as i have said in its day so was the old muzzleloading flintlock muskets with which our forefathers gained their independence but progress is the order with us in all things and the old flintlock bears the same relationship to the approved breechloader that our old and present publicland system does to such a system as we ought to establish we are apt to become wedded to old customs and usages even yet we occasionally see the one silver shoebuckles and kneebreeches and their wearers are as disgusted with what they term our new fagled ridiculous notions of dress as is the getleman from colorado or the gentleman from california in the proposed change in our publicland system and with all due respect to those gentlemen with about as much reason for the proposed change of the method of surveying the public lands and transferring the management of those surveys into the hands of men who understand surveying there is even greater reason than there is for consolidating the land offices without reflecting upon gentlemen occupying the offices of the surveyorsgeneral of the united states i venture to say not one in ten who has in the past twenty years or does now hold that office is a surveyor can go into the field and do the work or knows whether it is well done or not when returned to his office indeed my experience as a lawyer of some considerable practice in a new country for seventeen years has led me to conclude that sometimes a man is appointed a surveyorgeneral because be does not know anything about surveying and men have been much more often appointed to that position because they were efficient politicians than from any peculiar qualifications to properly perform the duties of the office i do not mean to say that this is always the case there are now and no doubt always have been some efficient surveyorsgeneral but such has not been the rule every one familiar with the western country knows hat men who never studied surveying and know nothing about it have received the appointment of surveyorgeneral perhaps the appointee had been serviceable in securing the election of some candidate for the presidency or other high office le feels that he is entitled to gome government appointment he seeks a foreign mission consulate governor or judge of a territory almost anything and finally a place is found in which to put him he is imposed upon the people of a new state or a territory and is made their surveyorgeneral under a proper system there is no use for him or rather for his office he has no firstinstance powers no original jurisdiction he is an obstruction to the securing of title by the settler a hinderance a delay and sometimes a very vexatious and expensive one he must always act under the instructions of the commissioner of the general land office and all he does must be approved by that officer before it is of any value either abolish the office or make it more independent i believe i am acquainted with but one of the present surveyors eneral of the

hadin her twentyseven or twentyeight years of existence as a state and i think there has been a score or more of them i presume the same rule has obtained in other states and the territories the

am in exact accord with mr cernuschi with whom i have been in frequent contact for the last six weeks and with whom i have discussed this subject in every point of view and we do not differ in figures at all the amount of specie in france was generally estimates at 1 200 000 000 or 6 000 000 000 francs of that sum 500 000 000 are now in the bank of france and not in circulation at all for all practical purposes it is dead capital merely lying there in deposit there is an amount of 700 000 000 of coin in circulation which with the bank paper makes 1 200 000 000 in all of which fivetwelfths is in paper and seventwelfths in coin now that is not the ordinary condition of affairs in france for twenty years before they never considered it prudent to issue so large a proportion of paper to the aggregate of money in circulation in england they ran their bank machinery more closely than in france and of 500 000 000 in gold and silver coin generally estimated to be in that country 22 000 000 sterling is in the bank of england and therefore there is in circulation about 400 000 000 of coin against a paper circulation of 28 000 000 sterling and thus there is a eircnlation in england leaving out of the count that locked up in the bank of england 400 000 000 of coin to 140 000 000 in paper which is nearly as 3 to 1 now i think the experience and practice of these two leading nations afford a very clear guide to the amount of paper money that can circulate in this country on an equality with coin and give a sufficient basis for our calculations our present issues of paper money inclnding silver subsidiary coin and fractional currency amounts in ther total to 727 000 000 of which 200 000 000 are lying at rest in the banks which leaves 527 000 000 in actual circulation now if you take the proportion of paper money in circulation in france we could circulate 0225 000 000 in paper and the remainder about 300 000 000 must be in coin now sir our present condition is that we have 500 000 000 and over of paper in circulation and there is no possibility of maintaining a circulation of 500 000 000 redeemable in coin that is to say it has nevdr bleen done in the experience of man or in the experience of any country except france and no matter how the balance of trade may be we cannot get np to specie payments because we cannot absorb coin enough to oat 500 000 000 of paper money for in the proportion of 5 to 7 it would require 700 000 000 of coin to float 500 000 000 of paper therefore nomatterhow the balaice of trade may be we could not get such ai amount in gold but we would have to take it in other commodities if we have the balance in our favor i now i say in all frankness that it is impossible without upsetting tiomoney market of the whole world to resume specie payments except we reduce the paper currency i say to the gentleman from missouri that we cannot resume without legislation of some kind because in the absence of legislation there will be no reduction in the amount of paper currency and no possibility of securing gold enough to fieat thepaper currency wehavo at par with gold if the experience of other speciepaying countries is to be taken as a guide and subject to some local peculiarities the same laws must govern us which govern them the first thing we have to do therefore is to contract the paper circulation to a limit which can exist at par with such specie as we possess and can get without disturbing the money markets of the world and to bring about such contraction we musthave legislation as the greenbacks will not retire themselves and the national banks will not retire their bills so long as it is profitable to keep them in circulation the two processes of contracting the currency and the accumulation of gold must go on simultaneously and for this my amendment provides and therefore as we have now 175 000 000 of coin and bullion and we need 300 000 000 in order to float 225 000 000 of paper we must still get 125 000 000 of coin and that is the reason why doing nothing will end in nothing now i can tell you where we can get the 300 000 000 of coin which we want for resumption without trouble we have 175 000 000 and that leaves 125 000 000 to be g ot now the annual product of our mines in gold and silver is about 184 000 000 per year if the balance of trade is in our favor and this shows the significance of the remarks i made at the outset we thus get 84 000 000 a year and 170 000 000 in two years and that amount alone would be sufficient to enable us with what we have to resume specie payments during the year 1879 but in addition we can draw specie from abroad because small shipments of gold from ten to twenty million dollars per annum make no disturbance in the financial market but the bank of france will resume speole payments on january 1 and cau part with 100 000 000 which it has in excess of the amount required for maintaining them they have accumulated this vast sum because the people of france preferring notes have brought in and deposited for safe keeping an enormous amount of bullion the largest amount ever gathered in one place in the history of the world of this 100 000 000 thus released by the bank of france about 50 000 000 can come into this country within the next fifteen months provided the balance of trade warrant it and that sum with the bullion which we have on hand and will produce would give us the necessary amount provided we contract the currency to the proper proportion here i am brought face to face with the difficulty which no doubt the gentleman from illinois who desired to ask me a question anticipated how can the currency be contracted without utter rain to every interest in the country my answer is that at the present time all kinds of values are as much depressed as they can be and are reduced to a gold basis and they cannot go any lower the evidences axe that we can no longer consume our own products at home and this balance of trade in our favor is simply due to the exportationof the surplus which we ought to use but which we cannot consume because now constructions have ceased when the market price of grain is permanently down to a gold basis then the prices of everything else correspondto it the inflation of currency if it should put the prices up would unavoidably leadto another period of speculation and inevitable collapse resulting in a panic over the whole country our own history is recorded for our instruction and there is enough and more than enough in our recent experience and present condition to warn us against repeating the errors of the past"], [0.8176984190940857, 0.8176984190940857, 0, "during the debate on the pending bill such diversity of opinion has been expressed

persistent vigilance on the part of internalreovenue officers and these appropriations are absolutely needed for that purpose very respectfully"], [0.000275343656539917, 0.4997246563434601, 1, "i regret exceedingly to be obliged to oppose a report of a majority of the military committee who have recommended the passage of this bill i only do so because i think upon a question of principle this bill ought not to pass irrespective of the question of the merit or demerit of the officer whom this bill seeks to restore there is a question of public policy underlying all which controls my judgment in my vote in opposition to the passage of this bill and that is this it has already been announeed semiofficially to this house that in the opinion of the military committee there are already in the neighborhood of eight hundred supernumerary officers in the military service of the united states and while the military committee are endeavoring to induce this house to indorse their views and to devise means to relieve the service from those supernumeraries and to relieve the treasury from the expense of supporting and maintaining them it seems to me a very grave inconsistency on the part of that committee to make a report to restore an officer who has been out of the service nearly nine years and who was discharged as the result of a courtmartial held in 186 or 1870 dismissing him from the service if we have too many officers against whom no charge as yet has been made and all of whom have fair records both for bravery and good conduct if the necessities of the service require that they shall be discharged from the service it seems to me improper for us to start a military machine by which herein this house we will be manufacturing additional officers to place upon that list who will also within a short time require to be discharged if this officer shall be restored why not restore all of those officers who were discharged upon the consolidation of the regiments when they were reduced from fortyfive to the number that now exists those men were discharged they had fine records they were equally meritorious with this officer no charge was brought against them but the needs of the service were urged as the reason why they should be mustered out and they were mustered out a large proportion of them are knocking at the doors of congress and asking to be restored if we are to restore one why ought we not to restore all there is no more objection to any one of them than there is to this officer and i am not aware that there is perhaps any greater objection to this officer than there is to any one of them but i put my opposition to this bill upon the score of public policy that it is improper for this house to be making officers today when we have pending before the house a bill which provides for the muster out of a great number of officers of the same rank as this one because the service no longer needs them and we require to be relieved of the expense of longer maintaining them that is one ground opon which i put my opposition to this bill another ground of opposition is this i am one of those who do not believe that it is proper for a committee of congress to sit here and review the proceedings of a courtmartial the code of military law provides for the trial of officers of the army they are tried by military court they are tried by courts that hear the witnesses that know the surroundings of the case that see the appearance of the witnesses and the appearance of the officers on trial those courts are much better able to determine than we are whetherthe testimony of the witnesses is credible or otherwise it is true the witnesses may be attacked afterward ex parte and it may be shown that their character is not entirely credible they may be by their personal character entirely disreputable yet it will not be contended that even such witnesses may not tell the truth the court that knows all the surrounding circumstances that sees the witnesses as they testify that sees all the little incidents which support their testimony may determine that in some given ease those witnesses tell the truth although their general reputation for truth and veracity may be bad now when such a court has heard all the witnesses has seen them face to face has listened to all the corroborating circumstauces knows all the surroundings of the case and then passes upon that case and when the case is sent up to the reviewing officer and he has passed upon it and is then sent up to the judge advocate general arid he has passed upon it when all the higher officers who review the case have passed upon it it seems to me that it is not proper for us eight or nine years subsequent to that time to sit here as a court of review and pass upon the action of that military court and summarily restore an officer who has been so long out of the service i have still another objection to the passage of this bill by reference to volume 18 page 564 of the statutes at large it will be found that in 1874 an act was passed by congress relieving this officer from all stain or stigma upon his character by reason of the proceedings of this courtmartial the secretary of war was required by the act of congress to grant this officer an honorable discharge that relieved him from all stain on his character by reason of the judgmuent of the court so that he no longer stands as a disgraced officer by reason of the finding of that court in addition to all that there was a provision in that act granting to this officer by reason of this honorable discharge one years pay and allowances of a captain of cavalry which amounted to over 3 000 and that money was received by him therefore even if the finding of the court was improper in the first instance even if it cast a reflection upon the character of this officer in the first instance that stigmahas now been removed and he stands upon the record just precisely the same as the other officers who were mustered out of the service because they were supernumeraries arad in addition to that congress provided that be should be paid one years pay and allowances over 000 which he accepted and drew now shall it be said that at this time when we are endeavoringto reduce the number of our supernumerary officers we shall by action of the same congress which is seeking to reduce that force increase it by putting this officer again on the rolls so that lfe may be again mustered out of the service and receive another additional years pay and allowances provided for officers so mustered out i wish to pass no reflection at all upon this officer it is not the basis of my opposition that any reflection is cast or should be cast upon this officer it is beneath me as a legislator to attempt to cast any reflection upon him he stands with an honorable discharge acquitted from anything that would cast reflection upon him by the action of the court and that discharge has been granted by the highest legislative body in the country the congress of the united states he has received that honorable discharge he has received in addition a years pay and allowances it seems to me that upon policy and upon principle this house ought not to extend any further relief to him or if it does extend it to him then similar relief should be extended in justice to every other officer who was also mustered out but who never was tried by a courtmartial"], [0.00030106306076049805, 0.4996989369392395, 0, "i ask unanimous consentto have taken from the speakers

is of some importance in the decision of the question before us much has been said on one side and the other side of the house in regard to this strait in which the officers of the army have been placed by the failure of the army appropriation bill last session i do not vish to raise the question of responsibility for that failure but only to press upon the attention of the house the necessity for immediate relief it is within my own knowledge that officers oi the army have suffered very great inconvenience and loss and certainly many members of congress will know what embarrassment if not distress would be imposed upon them if their pay was suddenly withheld for nearly a year and situated as the officrs of the army now art they have an indisputable title to immediate relief but it is necessary to consider the condition of the rank and file of the army as well as that of the staff and with the distress of both officers and men the disability of the army on the frontier to protect

part of the amendment of the gentleman from illinois is concerned recognizing as officers the class of persons named we have had occasion to look somewhat carefully over the numerous sections of the revised statu les relative to this matter we find that these persons in their official capacity are recognized by the statutes and although they may not be called officers they are recognized as pilots ani eugineers and their duties are prescribed and their liabilities are fixet under the law so that it seems to me that that part of the amendment is tinnecessary for any practical purpose as to that part of the amendment which relates to excluding from these two branches of the american service those whoare not citizens of the united states and to prevent them from being pilots and engineers it raises a question upon which the judgment of the house may be taken my remembrance is that when a bill similar to this passed the house during the last congress it contained a clause that this class of officers should be citizens of the united states and in that form went to the senate but the senate committee on commerce passed upon it and one of the few amendments made to the house bill was to strike that part out it was a question of doubt to the committee whether it ought to have remained in the bill as it finally passed indeed it was not reported by the committee but it was adopted on motion of the gentleman from illinois who makes the motion now the committee acting on the former view and upon the view of the senate committee on commerce omitted it from the bill it is perhaps at least questionable whether we should go to the extent asked by this amendment there are interests affected by it and we have hardly time to consider it now and it seems to me that the amendment ought not to be adopted"], [0.00035390257835388184, 0.4996460974216461, 1, "will the gentleman pardon me for calling his attention to the fact that the statement published in the record
