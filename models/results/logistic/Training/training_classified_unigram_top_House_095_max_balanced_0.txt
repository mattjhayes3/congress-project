r 10528 which would provide 100percent parity to farmers for all agricultural commodities on that occasion i congratulated the chairman and the members of the committee for recognizing the plight of the farmers and for scheduling early hearings to look into possible solutions to their problems that committee has consistently reported sound legislation providing valuable assistance to the farmers of this nation this is true of the farm bill which was reported and the congress passed last year that bill is a step in the right direction it does not go far enough and i know it is not easy to go as far as many of us would like in order to help the farmer i am convinced this is the time we in government must do more many bills have been introduced by concerned members who recognize a requirement to help alleviate farm problems there is merit in many of them there are a number of approaches which could be helpful a greatly expanded crop insurance program would help to alleviate the problem of crop failure due to weather definitely there is room for expansion of our activity to sell farm products abroad there remains a major untapped market for american farm products in foreign nations american agriculture exports have been the major export commodity that has held down the deficit in the balance of payments this also is one of the keys to increased farm income and improved standards of living for farm families an increase in farm exports will help offset the costs of the oil we are importing and will continue to import for a long time one proposal that has considerable appeal has been advanced by our good friend and highly respected colleague jamie whittein his skill in getting difficult bills through the congress is well known he has recommended indexing of the target prices or loan rates for wheat wheat grains cotton rice peanuts soybeans and sugar and that they be tied to the costofliving increases granted to wage earners in the public or private sectors if labor gets a 5percent costofliving raise the farmer would get the same another possibility would be to increase government loan rates or target prices to reflect any boosts the government grants in minimum wage this would place agriculture on a parity with labor and industry i fully realize the problem we have in attempting to find a solution that will be satisfactory to everyone therefore i believe all possible alternatives should be explored i hope that bills having at least some of the specific objectives i have outlined will speedily be enacted into law the farmers are looking to congress for help my major purpose here today is to express my support for 100 percent of parity to farmers for all agricultural products that one step will provide an immediate and permanent solution i recognize the reluctance of the administration to embark such a major change in agricultural programs our government seems to feel that the farmers are rich fat and should be happy all that says to me is that not enough of the government experts have spent time on a working farm gross income for the farmer on which the government seems to rely does not tell the true story it is like saying every business firm that has an increase in sales volume should be making plenty of money few businesses are required to make capital investments as great as the farmer must make none of them are required to buy at retail and sell at wholesale as the farmer does i would not undertake to tell you what this program would cost this appears to be the principal area of concern i question that the cost would be of greater magnitude than administrationendorsed proposals such as the humphreyhawkins bill undoubtedly 100 percent of parity would result in additional costs to the consumer one figure that is used is 22 percent additional i am sure that means 22 percent increase to the farmer only for his work and i do not consider this a frightening increase many of the labor unions get increases of that magnitude each time they go out on strike the farmer is asking for a onetime increase only if the farmer gets the benefit without having transportation processing packaging etc etc add ons for a big unnecessary boost in final cost to the consumer it would not be ruinous in any sense to the economy it should fuel the economy by giving the farmer for the first time a positive income for his products the actual cost figures are largely guesswork i have heard the figure of 50 billion annually used that does not frighten me in comparison with the cost of many of the government agencies now the minimum national health insurance program which has been proposed would cost about 50 billion a year the maximum for the health program could be 250 billion we are paying more than 50 billion a year for interest on the national debt the actual figure is 58 billion for fiscal year 1978 there is now a nationwide threat of a strike by farmers who seek to focus attention upon their problems there may be no other way they can get the attention of the consumer public and the lawmakers and they must have attention now since the makeup of the congress is predominately urban few members have basic knowledge of the difficulties which beset the american farmer these difficulties have grown worse each year during that time washington has appropriated billions upon billions of tax dollars for urban areas that is where the votes are significantly heavy federal spending with no serious attempt to balance the budget has promoted the inflation which now hits the farmer harder than anyone else the urban congressman listens to the complaints of the consumers about high prices of food and textiles automatically they assume the farmer is getting rich it is not the farmer who gets the prices charged to the consumer as this committee well knows his percentage is only a small portion of that cost the far greater portion goes to transportation and to merchandising costs meanwhile the farmer looks across the spectrum and he sees the federal government trying to guarantee almost everybody else an increased income federal employees receive an automatic salary increase the increased minimum wage will further increase the farmers operating costs social security taxes are increased federal spending and the federal debt are soaring into the stratosphere many of the commodities produced on the farm today are selling at less than the cost of production yet costs to the farmer continue to grow by leaps and bounds farm operations and equipment require substantial financing his products generally have little protection by way of subsidies or loan guarantees from the government consequently he is going deeper in debt year by year few understand that the farmer sells at the mercy of the buyer it is time for the congress and the american people to listen to the farmers they produce the food and fabric which america requires and the world wants and needs they cannot continue indefinitely to produce without a meaningful measure of the protection which is already provided to labor and most segments of the industrial world now let us get down to specifics the farmer is asking 100 percent parity for his crops and i think he should receive it prices received by farmers for farm products are at historically low levels compared to prices paid by farmers the parity ratio was at 64 in september this is the lowest the parity ratio has been since 1933 when it also reached 64 not since 1932 has the purchasing power of farm products been as weak as it is now parity as defined by webster is the state of being equal or equivalent a simple definition of parity is essentially a ratio that compares the prices farmers receive for their commodities with the prices they must pay for production and living expenses the farmer feels that the middleman should absorb the increase in costs for parity if the farmer receives 100 percent parity for his commodities and no other costs are tacked on by the middleman the increase in price to the retail market would only be 3 1 percent this is a modest amount which the farmers fully deserve 100 percent parity could be accomplished without seriously affecting anyone provided there is no price pyramiding for years the farmer has received parity based on 70 to 85 percent of the cost of past production no one seems to be concerned about the fact this is a sugar tit which gives him the incentive to continue producing but in its operation pushes him further in debt year after year the farmer is bedeviled by form filling and regulations just like any other segment of american business he has few options he can continue to produce or he can go out of business corporate farms have taken over where many individual farm families have been forced to the wall more americans need to realize that our american farm efficiency is one of the few advantages that we have left the american consumer is the direct beneficiary the worker who is protected by the minimum wage does not receive 70 to 85 percent of what is considered a proper national wage base he gets 100 percent why should not the farmers labor receive the same guarantee the total net income from farming is estimated at 19 8 billion for 1977 this is lower than the previous year and continues a decline that has taken place every year since 1973 in fact the 1977 net income level was only 59 percent of what it was in 1973 total net income was equal to 33 3 billion in 1973 net income appears even worse when calculated in constant 1967 dollars using 1967 as the base year total net income from farming will be about 10 5 billion for 1977 this is lower than any year since 1935 it was in the early 1930s when the purchasing power of net farm income previously reached such a low level even though the number of farms has been declining the drop in total net farm income has been even greater since 1973 in 1973 there were 2 844 million farms with net income per farm equal to 11 727 by 1976 the number of farms was down to 2 778 million but net income per farm was down to 7 203 another important factor to be considered isin 1976 the personal income of the farm population derived from farm sources was equal to 17 786 billion this was exceeded by personal income derived from nonfarm sources which equaled 24 166 billion continued low earning from agricultural sales could force even more farm household members to seek offfarm employment as a means of boosting the otherwise inadequate household income in 1976 the per capita personal disposable income of the farm population was 4 518 this was only 81 4 percent of that accruing to the nonfarm population the per capita personal disposable income of the nonfarm population was 5 552 the farmers who are presently protesting the low prices for their products are only asking the federal government to furnish what has been repeatedly confirmed in legislation since 1933full parity at the present time the parity concept and policy of congress with respect to the purchasing power of farm commodity prices and of farmers incomes rests upon three major acts first the agricultural adjustment act of 1933 as amended by the agricultural act of 1935 the agricultural marketing agreement act of 1937 and the agricultural act of 1948 this legislation states it is declared to be the policy of congress 1 through the exercise of the powers conferred upon the secretary of agriculture under this chapter to establish and maintain such orderly marketing conditions for agricultural commodities in interstate commerce as will establish as the prices to farmers parity prices second the soil conservation and domestic allotment act of 1936 this legislation specifies as policythe reestablishment at as rapid a rate as the secretary of agriculture determines to be practicable and in the general public interest of the ratio between the purchasing power of the net income per person on farms and that of the income per person not on farms that prevailed during the fiveyear period august 1909july 1914 inclusive as determined from statistics available in the united states department of agriculture and the maintenance of such a ratio third the agricultural adjustment act of 1938 as amended by the agricultural act of 1948 and the agricultural act of 1949 this legislation declares it to be the policy of congressto regulate interstate and foreign commerce in cotton wheat corn tobacco and rice to the extent necessary to provide an orderly adequate and balanced flow of such commodities in interstate and foreign commerce through storage of reserve supplies loans marketing quotas assisting farmers to obtain insofar as practicable parity of income this legislation also specifies the method by which parity prices are to be calculated these laws are already on the statute books and could be implemented now administratively to bring immediate relief to the farmers unfortunately there is little prospect that this will be done the congress and the administration should accept its responsibility toward the farmer before the proposed nationwide strike becomes a reality his complaints are real and they are legitimate the farmer needs our help now i am hopeful this committee will favorably report a bill to the house at an early date if the average farmer should stop working and go on welfare he would probably be better off than he is today this is not what we want for america it is not what america wants"], [5.9932470321655273e-05,
