entirely within or on the fringes of our cities inadequate urban planning in the past has left us with a residue of problems ranging from slums to outdated masstransportation facilities many of us are deeply concerned with the lack of coordinated guidance to what is actually a national problem some of us including myself have introduced bills to establish a department of housing and urban affairs in the federal government which could provide leadership to all levels of government in a total attack on the problems of urbanization on june 12 our distinguished junior senator from new york senator keatnqg delivered an excellent thoughtprovoking address on this subject in boston before the national society of professional engineers senator keatings bill to create such a department was i am pleased to say recently reported out by the senate banking and currency commlttee s 3292 because this is a national problemthe senator statedit calls for a national solution the attack cannot be sporadic on the regional state or local level it must be total it must be a grand design it must be given the stature and direction of a cabinet responsibility the department of agriculturehe saidwas founded at a time when 80 percent of the nations population lived on farms today with that situation literally reversed in terms of urban population it seems to me that the time has come for the establishment in our executive branch of a new cabinetlevel department especially created and empowered to deal with the problems of expanding population such a department he pointed out could be viewed as a means of assuring that the cities get a fair share of the substantial funds now being spent on housing highway and similar problems in close cooperation with state and local government it could develop national programs for combating smog slums and traffic snarls just as the department of agriculture has developed programs to combat drought soil erosion and depressed farm income it is time that the house bestirred itself on the need to meet this direct challenge to the orderly development of our cities a department of housing and urban affairs is more than just a subject for contemplation it is a necessity i appeal for consideration of the problem by the house and for the enactment of legislation which would provide for the responsible representation of urban matters in the cabinet in this connection under unanimous consent i include at the conclusion of my remarks the outstanding address on this subject by senator keating as follows members of the national society of professional engineers it is a heartfelt pleasure for me to be here with you tonight and to participate in this important meeting tonight i should like to discuss with you the implication of one of the great social phenomena of this centurythe unparalleled trend towards urbanization in america we are all aware of an accelerated population movement from rural to urban areas but the extent of the migration is not fully appreciated until we are confronted by the cold statistics of this mass displacement today 85 percent of americans are citydwellers living either in cities or in the sprawling urban peripheries that have given rise to such a new designation as greater new york greater boston or greater philadelphia what has happened is simple to state but it is born of a host of social and economic complexities in our grandfathers day the farmer hitched up and went to town on market day in our day he drives to townand stays there mechanization of farms consolidation of acreage and big business marketing methodshave resulted in a massive reduction in farm population concurrently the pressures economic social psychological that urge men from the field to the city have been intensified as the industrial age increases its opportunities and its lures i think it is fair to state that the shifting of the population balance from farm to city has caught us all by surprise certainly it is a phenomenon we continue to stare at mesmerized by its magnitude rather than to accept its implications and act vigorously upon them in a sense one might say that the city is the little boy that suddenly grew up his suit no longer fits him its bursting at every seam he has put on weight he has put on muscle and he needs to be completely retailored readjusted to the new and different world in which he lives i submit to you that the time for such retailoring is now the problem grows as we continue to stare at it and its time we begin to cut our cloth and study our designs for a blueprint of the cities of tomorrow not of yesterday it is of course true that those closest to the problem have often appeared to ignore it as though it were something that might go away if left alone in far too many metropolitan areas there have been sins of omission and commission which have speeded the onset of urban decay and selfstrangulation this log jam of neglect and outdated thinking must be broken we need to develop a fresh creative attitude about the kind of city planning that responds to the needs of the times there is much talk of the modern design for living but the designers seem more concerned with the fragments than with the whole sometimes i think we are plagued by a splitlevel mentality our homes are geared for the present our cities are geared for the past our vocabulary is full of new wordsurbanite suburbanite exurbanite but our planning is tethered to the hitching post of horseandbuggy days what we need is to initiate a bold and imaginative change in our whole concept of the demands of this new urban age only in this way will we be able to cope with the task of making our cities more liveable and of insuring their social and economic viability last january in his state of the union message president eisenhower drew attention to the explosive growth of our metropolitan areas he cited the fact that by 1975 those areas will occupy twice the territory they do today in my opinion the fact of the presidents underscoring of this vital problem augurs well for the prospect of his executive approval of the idea of a department of urbiculture clearly the crises which face all major cities today are of vast dimensions they range from slums to juvenile delinquency from crime problems to financing problems from water and air pollution to the need for additional parking and recreation areas as you are aware the federal government has already come to the assistance of our municipalities by means of a variety of important programs this help is provided notably in the field of housing but grants are being made also for urban and metropolitan planning and public works projects are an integral part of federal aid to communities because this is a national problem it calls for a national solution the attack cannot be sporadic on the regional state or local level it must be total it must be a grand design it must be given the stature and the direction of a cabinet responsibility the department of agriculture was founded at a time when 80 percent of the nations population lived on farms today with that situation literally reversed in terms of urban population it seems to me that the time has come for the establishment in our executive branch of a new cabinetlevel department especially created and empowered to deal with the problems of expanding urbanization to that end i have formally placed before the senate a bill authorizing the creation of a department of urbiculture in the executive branch of our government i intend to push it as strongly as i possibly can this projected department could center attention on the many unique city and suburban problems of national scope and importance it would allow the coordination of numerous existing federal programs directed at the metropolitan areas of the country it would promote consideration of the interests of the nations city dwellers at the highest levels of government i look to a department of urbiculture as a means of assuring that the cities get a fair share of the substantial federal funds now being spent on housing highway and similar programs in close cooperation with state and local governments it could develop national programs for combating smog slums and traffic snarls just as the department of agriculture has developed programs to combat drought soil erosion and depressed farm income i should like to emphasize that this department would not seek out new means for federal interference in urban affairs its prime and constant function would be the task of providing guidelines advice programing and planning assistance and overall cooperation and coordination intended to assist our cities and localities in solving their own problems in a word the proposed department of urbiculture would subscribe fully to the philosophy that the best answers to the problems of the people lie as close as possible to the people themselves already a first beginning has been made by official recognition of the need for action on september 10 of last year the proposal for a study commission on metropolitan problems passed the senate it is presently under consideration in the house wherever americans live the city is the very heartbeat of their social and economic lives to the extent that any city is made a better healthier more productive place in which to live and raise ones family the whole of our nation is the benefactor conversely inadequate urban planning or no planning at all robs the present of its opportunities and robs the future of its rightful heritage surely no one group is more aware than you engineers are of the extent to which physical conditions constitute either the shaping forces of growth or the eroding forces of decay in our urban communities a healthy vigorous urban climate is the atmosphere of dynamism and prosperity a climate choked by the weeds of neglect of backwardness of civic apathy is not the garden where progress grows its all dressed up to be a graveyardfor opportunities that die a premature death the time is past when we can stand by in bemused fashion and watch the malady of our cities spread this is not a remote challenge it is a challenge of todaya challenge that confronts us wherever we turn let us meet it in the only way it can be metwith courage and let us beat it in the only way it can be beatenwith action the entire problem is a challenge to all of us as americans but it represents a special and provocative challenge to you and to the members of your profession throughout the nation the modernization of our city agglomerations is not a mere matter of spending money it is above all an exercise in imagination in visiona projection of trained minds beyond the doorway of the present into the vistas of the future only the gifted and dynamic forces of your intellects and talents can create the physical americatobe can untether us from the past and build the setting proper to a new expanding and evolving national life in this exploding new era we must look to men equipped to handle the kind of urban explosions that challenge usthat cry for attention and solution as engineers you are in the truest sense shapers of history no one group of professional men has changed the economic and social fabric of our nation to the extent that you have the creative work of your minds is the yeast of ferment that has transformed remolded revolutionized the daily lives of millions of people you have brought the gifts of work of achievement of opportunity of happiness to an entire population this tremendous influence of your imagination your discoveries your amelioration of conditions of life must be more than a source of gratification to you it must carry with it as well a sense of the responsibility that develops upon you precisely because of the magnitude of your influence in this connection i am referring to the added responsibility of your role in the directionthe political direction of the nation whose pattern of life you have been so instrumental in creating and developing government must not be conceived as incidental in your careersas a kind of fringe interest that commands your attention periodically good governmenteffective government the best possible government must be a constant preoccupation of men like yourselves it must be conceived by younot as an automatic democratic process that will run forever with the occasional oiling of new ideas and new approaches but as a living democratic process that has to be nurtured enriched improved if its full benefits and blessings are to be assured to the people for this reason i would urge an intensification of your personal interest in the political life of your community and of your nation do not isolate yourself from the forces that determine the course of history be it local history or natural history cultivate an interest in the issues in the candidates in the platforms that are placed before your minds that compete for your favor accord them the personal commitment of time and analysis that they deserve remain immersed in rather than isolated from the stream of history that must affect so many lives not the least of all your own to the extent that we americans consider pplitics as a kind of occult science with participation of a limited number of practioners we miss the

today all of which i want to concur in and to congratulate my colleagues who have gone before me this afternoon for the very complete presentation that has been made however there are other aspects of this particular program that i would like to speak to you concerning one in particular i for one have been very much interested in the history of the trade agreements program and also in the escape clause what has been said on the floor this afternoon has i am sure been an eye opener to those who were not aware of this history i am also sure that it will come as a surprise to many good people on the outside who had no idea of the strong commitment made by the executive branch to the congress that the trade agreements program would be so carried out that it would not seriously hurt any of our industries or producers the wide discrepancy that has been uncovered between assurance and performance will also go far toward explaining the bitterness of these who have in good faith applied to the tariff commission for relief only to find that a likely presidential veto awaited them if the commission found serious injury as someone has already pointed out the president has set aside seven unanimous commission decisions and of a total of some thirty recommendations including the seven just mentioned the president has acted affirmatively in only eleven cases this means a fatality of about two to one when the tariff commismissions own rejections are taken into account running a little over 50 percent it is obvious that the chances of obtaining a remedy under the escape clause are something less than one in four now i ask you to listen to a few more words from the mouths of those who went before congressional committees as official spokesmen of the state department in support of the trade agreements program read against the record of escape clause action just cited these words from mr william clayton under secretary of state for economic affairs to the senate finance committee in 1948 are in sharp contrast we also have the escape clause which permits the withdrawal of any concession which endangers a domestic industry designed to be operated by the tariff commission reporting directly to the president it offers a prompt and sure remedy always available when needed i join with other members who have spoken in calling attention to the flatfootedness of the assurances given to congress and therefore to the american people little doubt could be left in the minds of the committee members the preceding statement was made to the senate finance committee as already said but that was not the end of it committee members were skeptical and put many questions the chairman asked whether the president mr truman and the state department had not given affirmative assurances in hearings that no american industry would be injured mr clayton said that is right and we put in the escape clause to make sure that was carried out asked by the chairman whythe state departmentafter promising that no industry would be injured they speculated with this promise mr clayton replied very firmly we dont speculate we put in an absolute condition which will

people his secret weapon which enabled him to win the governorship against heavy odds and which helped him write an excellent record of service during his year in office was friendliness it was not the type of friendliness which was dispensed only to friends or to those who conceivably might become friends it was equally generously bestowed on avowed foes because of this the word foes is really

joint economic committee when the survey was taken i do not mean that the press release was published by the joint economic committee i have notified congressman patmans office that i was going to take the floor because i wanted to discuss to some degree his press release before discussing it i want to say that i have been endeavoring for many years with some degree of success but largely lacking in success to bring onto the floor of the house public debate where it should be this business of issuing press releases that are not subject to the rebuttal of those who may disagree with them is no way in my judgment of moving forward the publics business i believe that if congressmen want to comment on things of a public nature they should take the well of the house or the senate and subject themselves to rebuttal in view of the characteristic bias of many of our good academic economists in favor of maximum employment at any cost it is really remarkable that this survey turned up as conservative an overall response as it did in fact it was quite conservative i point out what i think are the salient findings first sixty percent of the economists said they thought it feasible to have high employment and price stability over short periods 73 percent said this was feasible in the long run second exactly 36 percent said they would accept an unemployment ratioand this was a surprising thingan unemployment ratio between 5 and 7 percent as a condition for achieving a high degree of price stability thirty percent would insist on a lower ratio the remainder would allow the ratio to go even above 7 percent third seventyfive percent said they thought tight money had helped dampen inflation in 19551957 and 70 percentcontrary to congressman patmans viewpointsaid they did not think tight money had contributed to rising prices fourth despite a very inept wording of the question 50 percent of the economists said they thought that wage increases in excess of productivity improvement had contributed significantly to rising prices in recent years fifth fifty percent or better said they thought federal reserve policy had been used appropriately in the recent recession i want to call attention to a very serious mistake in the press release of the gentleman from texas he says that twothirds of the economists believe that our banking facilities have important inadequacies actually only about 25 percent took this viewpoint i shall not attempt to explain why the gentleman from texas made the statement that he did in his press release but in fairness i think his full press release on this subject should be put in the record the gentleman from texas pointed out that the bankers of the country might well find cause for some thoughtful selfexamination in the fact that nearly twothirds of these economists all trained as objective observers of economic institutions and practices indicated that they felt there were important inadequacies in the banking facilities of the country growing out of the tendency of bankers to content themselves with holding riskless assets in the form of government and governmentguaranteed bonds and loans at ever higher interest rates rather than to function as vigorous and enterprising suppliers of funds to business by meeting local banking needs it is possible that the gentleman from texas simply made an error because he took part b of this question which appears on page 8 of the committee report where it said if your answer is yes that there are important inadequacies of banking facilities what is the cause and several causes are listed of those who did answer yes 61 6 percent did say there was a tendency of bankers to hold riskless assets government and governmentguaranteed bonds and loans rather than to function as enterprises meeting local banking needs the rest of the comments in the press release of the gentleman from texas are not on the question but as to the 61 percent this was only 61 percent of the 20 percent who said that there were important inadequacies of banking facilities so far from twothirds of these trained objective observers of economic institutions and practices as the gentleman from texas calls them saying this it is less than twothirds of about onefifth or twofifteenths which is a very small group as a matter of fact in answer to the basic question whether important inadequacies of banking facilities existed with respect to three items on the national level first business needsthe answer was yes 20 25 percent thought there were inadequacies but 57 percent thought there were not second were there inadequacies in the broad public interest 26 percent thought there were but 50 percent said no on assuring adequate competition 26 percent thought there were inadequacies but 48 6 percent thought there were none so just the reverse was true as a result of this question as sent outjust the reverse of what the gentleman from texas said in his press release further in his press release he makes this statement it should moreover prove of interest to the congress in evaluating the recent proposals of the president for amendment of the employment act of 1946 to know that more than half of the economists responding would give greater emphasis to maximum employment than to price stability as an objective if the two objectives were not wholly compatible only 18 4 percent would give greater emphasis to price stability this is an unfair comment on the presidents suggestion for amendment to the employment act the president had suggested merely that the employment act be amended to include price stability as one of the goals in our employment procedures and practices i personally i might say do not agree with the president in this area simply because i think the employment act implies that price stability of course is one of the goals but in light of the confusion that certain people including congressman patman in this press releasethe confusion that some people are trying to create in the minds of the people about the need and the value of price stability perhaps it might be better if it was expressed explicitly in the act the real point i am making is that the majority and the overwhelming majority of the economists who answered that question thought that we could maintain maximum employment and maintain stability and a general price level at the same time i think it was 73 percent of them felt that that could be done those economists i daresay are agreeing thereby that price stability is a very basic objective in the employment act whether it should be a stated objective in the act is to a large degree a matter of semantics certainly though congressman patmans press release stressing the relative importance of maximum employment in respect to price stability in the opinion of the economic experts is beside one point of the presidents recommended change to add price stability as one of the objectives of the employment act in closing i would like to observe that i question one value of questionnaires such as the one sent out by the joint economic committee i think it is a technique the joint economic committee should not have used in this instance and i trust it will not be used again what are economic facts cannot be determined by selecting a group of experts however expert and obtaining their majority vote by letter ballot what is true is not changed one jot or tittle by the proclamations of thunderous majorities if this were not so the sea xerxes whipped would have

month of washington and lincoln and every humanitarian who deplores the human sacrifices offered on the altar of ruthless aggression will recall that today marks the 42d anniversary of lithuanian independence which was brutally terminated in 1940 by the soviet union in violation of her most solemn pledges to the credit of the united states let it be said that we have never recognized this attempt to annex and enslave the baltic states and please god we never shall that however is little more than a passive recognition of the status quo and it remains to our everlasting discredit that we failed miserably at teheran at yalta and at potsdam to make lithuanian independence a prime demand at a time when we were dealing with a socalled ally and had the means to enforce our will in this day and age when nationalism is on the move and suppressed people are reaching for that same freedom for which our gallant forebears died let us with every means at our command lend these infant democracies every possible aid toward the attainment of their proper place in the commonwealth of nations but especially let us foster and encourage the free spirit of the great lithuanian people who have never wavered in their determination to throw off the shackles of the oppressors and who remain unbowed in the face of overwhelming odds"]]}
