opinion the most dangerous current threat to our democratic form of government in the united states is the presence of selfishly organized groups of radical specialinterest minorities and their efforts through political intimidation to coerce the congress of the united states into passing legislation which is contrary to the basic principles upon which this government was founded chief among these are radical negro communist and offcolor mongrel organizations which conceived in hate whelped in treason and deceit and nurtured on the breast of communism are attempting to bring about in this great country moral disintegration and mongrelization through a forced amalgamation of the races hiding the rotten stench of their insidious aims under an outward cloak of purity these professional purveyors of hate and indecencythese enemies of the american way of lifehave succeeded in injecting their venom into the unsuspecting in such numbers that they have managed to attain the position in many states of holding the balance of political power separating the two major political parties through the conscienceless racketeers who head these parasitic groups they are today asserting their strength as never before in an attempt to bring about a forced amalgamation of the white and black races eventucnlly reducing us to a state of mongrels ruled over by mulattoes with every vestige of human rights destroyed in his civilrights message to this congress the president of the united states lent aid and comfort to these enemies of the american way of life this infamous message with its accompanying preposterous recommendations constitutes the most flagrant attack ever perpetrated by any president in the history of our country upon the american constitution not only did he show his utter contempt for the timehonored principles on which his party was founded but at the same time he repudiated the friendship and loyalty of those who were directly responsible for his becoming president we of the south will never forget those trying days during the 1944 democratic convention when southern democrats banded together as a bloc to prevent the nomination of henry wallace au a vice presidential candidate on the democratic ticket the people of the south are directly responsible for mr trumans ascendancy to the presidency yet despite this he has seen fit to run a political dagger into our backs and now he is trying to drink our blood never since the shameful and disastrous years of reconstruction following the war for southern independence have the valiant people of the south faced a crisis of such severity as that which has been brough down upon our heads by the president we of the south must and will face the impending battle in the same courageous manner with which our forebears faced the carpetbaggers and scalawags of reconstruction in those the darkest days of american history when the people of the southern states both white and black were being exploited by unscrupulous moneymad and powerhungry scavengers when the governments of the southern states had been wrested from the hands cf their chosen leaders and had been taken over by organized enemies of law and order the great democratic party of thomas jefferson rallied its forces to the aid of these stricken people we have never since forgotten nor have we failed to give evidence at every opportunity of our unwavering gratitude as well as devotion to the principles of this great party through its leanest as well as its more prosperous years the democratic party has enjoyed and relied upon the determined spirit of its southern friends for its continued existence president truman today holds the highest office within the gift of his people by virtue of southern loyalty to the demccratic party as well as their activities in his behalf in the 1944 convention and i say that his message on civil rights constitutes mighty poor evidence of any gratitude on his part for these concessions president truman knows that if these outrageous recommendations were adopted and became law that they would eventually destroy not only our democratic form of government and our democratic

sections of our country to point the finger of scorn at the white people of the south this has become such a politically profitable pastime in other sections that both major political parties have been persuaded to write into their party platforms antisouthern planks and to dedicate themselves to the complete destruction of southern economic and social institutions we say to them thou hypocrite first cast out the beam out of thine own eyes and then shalt thou see clearly to cast the mote out of thy brothers eye matthew 7 3 it is a sad commentary on american politics when the democratic partysaved from oblivion more than once by the south and led by a man who owes his position to the white people of the southplaces its best friends on the altar of political expediency the south will notit cannotgo along with the vicious platform adopted by the national democratic convention at philadelphia we have been betrayed in the house of our fathers we who have been most faithful of all to the democratic party felt the indignities of the present partys ingratitude when our interests were subordinated to permit the adoption of a resolution offered by men from states in which not even the justices of the peace are democrats the national democratic party leadership has joined the dewey and wallace crowds and is playing cheap politics with public welfare both major parties have unconditionally surrendered to selfish negro and alien minority groups of the socalled doubtful states and are both screaming for passage of legislation which they know to be unconstitutional per se and contrary to the best interests of the united states i of course have reference to the socalled civilrights legislation the enactment of any or all of these vicious proposalswith which we are all familiarcould have no effect other than to again fan into flames the expiring embers of racial hatred and to create sectional divisions among our people at a time when national unity is synonymous with national selfpreservation passage of these measures would cut the heart from our constitution yet they are advocated by many good and patriotic americans this is not difficult to understand because those who would force this crown of thorns down upon the heads of the white people of the south have resorted to trickery deceit and misrepresentation in their efforts to destroy the meaning of the constitution they have so colored the barbs that they would thrust into the flesh of constitutional government that all who dare take issue with their vicarious arguments are promptly labeled as demagogues bigots and race baiters nothing of course could be more alien to fact these arguments were answered for all time by the immortal georgian henry w grady who said the future holds a problem in solving which the south must stand alone in dealing with which she must come closer together than ambition and despair have driven her and on the outcome of which her very existence depends this probler is to carry within her body politic two separate races and nearly equal in number and further this burden no other people bears todayon none has it ever rested without precedent or companionship the south must bear this problem the awful responsibility of which should win the sympathy of all mankind and the protecting watchfulness of god alone even unto the end these are not merely the beautiful words of an idle dreamer they carry with them the awful significance of the burden which has been that of the south since the shameful days of reconstruction and will continue to be the problem of the south alone we neither need seek nor desire assistance nor do we welcome interference which we know will only revive old hatreds and will set us back a hundred years in our progress the greatest of all negroes booker t washington pointed out that brains property and character for the negro will settle the question of civil rights the best course to pursue in regards to the civilrights bill in the south is to let it alone let it alone and it will settle itself it cannot be denied that the negro has made great progress in the southperhaps more than any other people in a like period of time anywhere we of the south are proud of these great strides which our negro friends have made but they have accomplished this solely with the aid and understanding of the southern white man permit me to point out that none of their progress has been due in any way or to any extent to any help or contributions from the crowd that today is posing as friends of the negro by advocating this unamerican legislation none of this progress was due to the naacp the civil rights congress the national negro congress or any other of these selfstyled crusaders their only love for the negro is based upon his political value at the moment apart from the disastrous effects upon the south and her people as well as upon the nation as a whole the legislative monstrosities which make up the socalled civilrights program are of much more and furtherreaching consequence those who agitate for the passage of this program speak in glowing platitudes of human rights individual dignity and civil liberties it seems that they never get around to paying tribute to the document which has through the years preserved the dignity of the individual and guaranteed human rights and civil liberties to all of our citizensthe constitution of the united states for its preservation the blood of thousandseven millionsof patriotic american citizens has been spilled yet by these acts those agitators would deny that democratic heritage to our people the founding fathers of our great nation embodied in their constitution a system of checks and balancesa division of governmental powerbetween the individual states and the federal government which they thought would preclude for all time to come the consequences of nationalization to avoid the possibilities of power concentration and usurpation they very wisely and deliberately delegated certain specified powers to the federal government and reserved the balance of authority to the individual states nowhere in the federal constitution did its framers provide for federal intervention into private or social affairs nor did they ever intend that the states be divested of their sovereignty it is provided by the constitution thatthe powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people yet in utter disregard of this clearcut statement of intent on the part of the framers of our constitution the president of the united states and both major political parties today demand the destruction of individual state sovereignty and the invasion of private lives by governmental order chief justice marshall once said no political dreamer was ever wild enough to think of breaking down the lines which separate the states and of compounding the american people into one common class in his farewell address george washington the first president of the united states stated the case against federal intervention into state affairs the necessity of reciprocal checks in the exercise of political power by dividing and distributing it into different depositories and constituting each the guardian of the public weal against invasions of the others has been evinced by experiments ancient and modern some of them in our country and under our own eyes to preserve them must be as necessary as to institute them if in the opinion of the people the distribution or modification of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong let it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the constitution designates but let there be no change by usurpation for though this in one instance may be the instrument of good it is the customary weapon by which free governments are destroyed the precedent must always greatly overbalance in permanent evil any partial or transient benefit which the use can at any time yield step by step organized minorities with selfish interests are striving to break down the lines which separate the states no representative government since the birth of civilization has existed successfully for so long a time as has the democratic constitutional government of the united states though we are still young in the sisterhood of nations the system under which we livethe division of powers under our constitution between the states and federal governmenthas been the chief contributor to the continuation of our democratic form of government and our constitution is the pillar on which that system rests in 1922 the german government was built upon a constitution patterned largely after that of the united states her people enjoyed a democratic representative form of government and she had begun to bid for her proper place in world society but gradually minority groups began to infiltrate into the organisms of her government continually working to undermine the local selfgovernment of her people and to centralize all authority in berlin we are of course familiar with the manner by which hitler seized control of the federal police system and set up a totalitarian state there the sequel to that story has been written in the blood of 40 nations thomas jcfferson in his first inaugural address stated the creed of the democratic party to which it has adhered consistently until this very day in these words the support of the state governments in all their rights as the most competent administrations for our domestic concerns and the surest bulwarks against antirepublican tendencies abraham lincoln the great emancipator and father of the present day republican party held to maintain inviolate the rights of the states to order and control under the constitution their own affairs by their own judgment exclusively is essential to the preservation of the balance of power on which our institutions rest and again no man who has sworn to support the constitution can conscientiously vote for what he understands to be an unconstitutional measure however expedient he may think it no the democratic party headed by president truman is not the party of thomas jefferson nor is the republican party of thomas dewey the same party that was founded by abraham lincoln their parties are now in the hands of powerhungry usurpers and pretenders it has been argued that truman is carrying out the policies of the late franklin d roosevelt but i challenge anyone to show that roosevelt or any other american president ever sent to the congress any such message as the socalled civilrights proposals of president truman franklin roosevelt on the contrary joined his illustrious predecessors in warning his people against over centralization of government he said we are safe from the danger of departure from the principles on which this country was founded just so long as the individual home rule of the states is scrupulously preserved and fought for whenever it seems in danger how different are the views of the little man who succeeded him no the democratic party of harry truman is not even the democratic party of franklin roosevelt we of the south who refuse to follow these political backsliders are not party bolters or rebels we who balk at being continually trampled underfoot by the socalled leadership of the democratic party are not bolting the democratic party we have waited too long for that we were read out of that party at philadelphia by powercrazed demagogs grappling for the support of selfish minorities for the first time since the war for southern independence the south is asserting her full political selfdetermination be not deceived the south will not support harry truman tom dewey henry wallace or any other candidate for president who has deserted the principles of orderly local selfgovernment guaranteed by the constitution of our forefathers there is but one ticket for those who wish to see the continuation of constitutional states rights governmentand the birmingham convention gave us that ticket the south will vote democratic she will vote for the only democratic ticket offered which has endorsed and advocated the principles of the democratic party governors thurmond and wright are real democrats who recognize the constitutional rights of local selfgovernment free from bureaucratic interference they and they alone among the candidates advocate a return of state capitols and county courthouses to the states and away from the banks of the potomac they and they alone advocate the continuance of the kind of democratic government which has made this nation the worlds citadel of freedom and guardian of liberty the states rights convention in birmingham offered a challenge to all lovers of freedom and selfdetermination it offered a challenge to all who have the courage to place principle above expediency and to democrats and republicans alike who wish to support the structure of constitutional government i am confident that the people of the south as well as those who live in other sections still have the courage of their forefathers and will fight to the end for the preservations of the fundamentals in which they believe in closing i would like to recite to you the words of a distinguished american and defender of constitutional liberties daniel webster who stated other misfortunes may be borne or their effects overcome if disastrous war should sweep our commerce from the ocean another generation may renew it if it exhaust our treasury future industry may replenish it if it desolate and lay waste our fields still under a new cultivation they will grow grain again and ripen to future harvests it will be but a trifle even if the walls of yonder capitol crumble if its lofty pillars should fall and its gorgeous decorations be all covered by the dust of the valley all these might be rebuilt but who shall reconstruct the fabric of demolished government who shall rear again the wellproportioned columns of constitutional liberty who shall frame together the skillful architecture which unites national sovereignty with states rights individual security and public prosperity no if these columns fall they will be raised not again like the colosseum and the parthenon they will be destined to a mournful a melancholy immortality bitterer tears however will flow over them than were ever shed over the monuments of roman or grecian art for they will be the remnants of

states and one of which the american people your constituents have every reason to be ashamed it is the old story of neros fiddling while rome burned seldom in the history of this country has there been a greater need for the exercise of statesmanship in this house we are confronted with problems of grave importance to the people of the nation and of the world and yet this congress or the house of representatives is wasting its time on a vicious stupid measure that everybody knows will never become a law is that statesmanship is it the part of wise men to thus disregard the welfare of the nation only to stir up strife and discontent you members who are pushing this vicious measure are doing your country the greatest injury of which you are capable on yesterday i listened to the address of the distinguished gentleman from new york in which he pointed out the fallacy of this measure and the impossibility of its enforcement he and i do not agree on the great fundamental questions that separate the two national parties but i want to pay my tribute to him as the outstanding member of the republican party in public life today he is the best friend the negroes have on the republican side because he is willing to tell them the unvarnished truth and to openly oppose a measure that he knows would do them more harm than good he is by far the ablest member of the republican party in the house he is honest courageous and patriotic and if the republican party is really interested in the welfare of the country they can find no abler no more worthy leader among the regular republicans of the nation as their candidate for president in 1940 than the distinguished gentleman from new york this bill that you have dragged out here by petition andthat a selfrespecting committee of the house refused to report should never be referred to as an antilynching bill it should be called a bill to encourage rape and to reelect gavagan to congress it is nothing but a vicious attack upon the white people of the southern states and is fostered by a communistic element that has brought sufficient pressure to bear to force it to the floor of the house through the signatures of men who did not have the courage to resist that pressure i am going to speak plainly to you today and especially to you members on the democratic side who are indulging in this nauseating spectacle you are not only offending the white people of the southern states but you are proving yourselves to be the worst enemies the negroes of this country have in public life you are stirring up trouble for them and deeply offending members from the south upon whose good will you must depend not only for your committee assignments in the house but for the success of any legislation you may sponsor remember that southern democrats now have the balance of power in both houses of congress by your conduct you may make it impossible for us to support many of you for important committee assignments and other positions to which you may aspire the people you represent did not send you here to become the willing tools of a few negro agitators and to engage in these offensive and useless attacks upon us they may call you to account in the primary they may want to know why you disregard their interests in order to serve a few negro politicians the same thing applies to the republicans the chances are that they will take care of you alleged democrats in the primaries and then take care of the republicans in the general election and in that way send us a majority of good democrats with a healthy minority of good republicans who have the interest of all the country at heart you democrats who are pushing this vicious measure are destroying your usefulness here some of you ought to announce now that you will not be candidates for renomination so that the real democrats in your districts can nominate candidates who can regain for your districts the influences you have lost without the south there would be no democratic party and without the help of the southern democrats you could not accomplish a thing by reason of their long services in the house the southern democrats now wield an influence all out of proportion to their numerical strength and as a rule they occupy committee positions that give them added power and influence and they will be here when many of you are gone these false tirades against the south must stop if they are to be made at all let them come from some irresponsible members on the republican side but if you who sit on our side are going to assault your own ranks then do it in the open and do not be playing the roll of judas iscariot toward the southern democrats this bill would not prevent a single lynching and you know it it is not intended for that purpose you are being dominated by a few negro politicians who are in league with the communists who in turn are attempting to destroy this republic and are turning heaven and earth to stir up trouble between the two races in the southern states you are not only giving them aid and comfort but by your conduct you are doing president roosevelt and his administration the greatest possible injury the republicans wouldbe delighted to see you cut president roosevelts throat politically and are therefore voting with you on this vicious measure they want to see it laid in his lap they know that if he signs it it will ruin him in the southern states and that if he vetoes it they can get the benefit of the negro votes this vicious measure would influence in the north it is time to stop this silly asinine stupid performance and get down to the business of the nation this stuff is beneath the dignity of men who are worthy to be representatives in the congress of the united states besides the country is getting tired of the vicious false insinuations against the white people of the south inspired as i said by the communists who are gloating over the damage such measures as this do to the peace and wellbeing of the people of both races throughout the country and especially in the south the gentleman from new york mr fish has been running for president on the republican ticket on this issue for 20 years and up to date he has only been able to get one vote one time in one convention in all those years and that was a vote for vice president and came from a state that does not have enough negroes in it to do the cookingand i am told that the delegate who cast that vote was a very old man who probably thought he was voting for the gentlemans grandfather he does not stand any more chance to be nominated for president even on the republican ticket on this silly issue than gov bob taylors guttapercha dog did to catch the asbestos cat in hades ilaughter and applause in fact if the white people in his district ever understand the stupidity of this measure he will never even come back to congress he will not even be nominated the white people of the district will want somebody down here who will represent them and the negroes in the district will certainly want somebody who will not be stirring up trouble for them all the time you are creating trouble here in the district of columbia coaxing negroes in here by the thousands to fill the relief rolls until they have become almost intolerable inspired by a bunch of communists in baltimore negroes have been picketing the peoples drug stores here in washington for the past 2 years trying to force them to fill their stores with negro clerks i wish the people you are sent down here to represent could go down here and witness the disgusting spectacle of big burly negroes picketing white drug stores day after day for 2 years in order to try to force themselves in there as clerks where decent white women have to trade they now have a plan worked out to move at least one negro family into every white residential block in the city that is not only laying the groundwork for serious trouble between the races but it will ruin realestate values in the district of columbia look how the white people are moving out into maryland and virginia where they can live in decent surroundings and where their women and children arc protected these communists are doing their best to force the negro back into politics in the southern states one of their plans is to repeal the poll taxes in order to drag every ignorant negro to the polls and bring back all the horrors of reconstruction from which our people suffered in the years gone by these things are going to fail you could not force negro equality or negro rule on the people of the south in a thousand years as henry w grady once said we wrested the south from the negro rule when federal drumbeats rolled nearer and federal bayonets hedged closer about the ballot boxes of the south than it ever will again in this republic the more you stir this trouble the more negroes you coax into the northern states to fill your relief rolls and add to the already perplexing problems with which you and your children will have to deal a very distinguished gentleman from ohio told me a day or two ago that in his city 90 percent of the negroes were on a public pay rollmostly on relief or wpa look at the relief rolls in the district of columbia and note the thousands of negroes that have crowded in here and become wards of the federal government i am told that they are even inviting them to new york city in order to put them on the relief roll or the wpa roll and vote them in the next election who is going to pay for all this who is going to bear this burden if you repeal the poll taxes in the southern states in addition to all the other demoralizing results it will take millions of dollars away from our school funds then who will pay our teachers are we going to be called upon to further tax the already overburdened white people of these states in order to furnish free education to these negroes and to bring back a condition against which our people fought bled and died during the dark days of reconstruction are you going to continue to agitate this question until you break the taxpayers of your states and your cities or until theflames of race hatred burst into riots with all their devastating consequences the negro is a tenant at sufferance wherever he comes in contact with the white man his very existence depends upon that friendly relationship which has so long existed between the whites and blacks in the south and which you are now attempting to destroy when you disturb that peaceful relationship the negro must move on look at the thousands of them in arkansas and in southern missouri that have been stirred up by these communists and now cannot find employ ment because white people do not want them on their lands what is to become of them would you keep a negro on your place if your wife and children were afraid of him certainly not you voted down the amendment offered by the gentleman from mississippi to make this bill apply to gang murders why did you do that why were you not honest enough to vote it in and protect the innocent people in your own states who are being murdered by thugs every year by voting down that amendment you refused to protect the innocent white man or the innocent negro he must be charged with a crime before this law will protect him in other words you can lynch all the innocent negroes and all the innocent white people you want to and the law does not apply but you would protect the negro rapist and even remunerate his family at the expense of the family of his victim and their neighbors it has been brought out here that lynching is on the wane and has almost disappeared in the southern states the reason of that is that improved communication facilities the vigilance of the white people of the south and that of the better element of the black race together with the swiftness and certainty of punishment have largely put a stop to the perpetration of those crimes for which negroes have been put to death in the north you mob them en masse there were more negroes killed in one race riot in springfield ill the home town of abraham lincoln a few years ago than have been lynched in mississippi in all its history there were more negroes mobbed in one race riot in chicago ill than have been lynched in all the southern states since the civil war the same thing occurred in east st louis and the same thing will occur in cleveland ohio detroit mich new york city pittsburgh pa and all the other large cities of the north if this agitation continues instead of helping to do away with lynching you are agitating race hatred and stirring up trouble for yourselves and your children but this law does not protect the innocent negroes who are mobbed and whose houses are burned and whose children are killed by mobs in these riots in cities like springfield ill chicago or east st louis it is designed to protect only the negroes who outrage or murder innocent white women and children you try to leave the impression that the few negroes who were put to death in the south were innocent let us take a few instgnces and see what actually occurred a few years ago in the suburbs of one of the leading towns in mississippi a little woman was standing before the mirror dressing to go to a wctu meetingi see the gentler man from new york mr gavagan laughs at that i am not surprised a negro brute approached the house eased up onto the veranda and crawled through a window she saw him reached in the bureau drawer and picked up her husbands pistol and pointed it at him he saw from her terrorstricken face and trembling hand that she was unable to pull the trigger he walked up took the pistol from her hand stuck it in hispocket choked her into insensibility raped her several times then took her husbands razor from the bureau drawer and cut her throat from ear to ear and left her weltering in her own blood in the parlor of her own home there was no question about his identity when they caught him he confessed told how it happened and told them where to find both the pistol and the razor i wonder what would have happened if that had been your sister or your wife or your daughter probably the next one will be but you would have the country believe that this was a poor innocent victim of the lawless white people of the community and under this bill you would send the sheriff of the county to the penitentiary and then tax the county 10 000 to pay to the family of this vicious brute this encourages others to perpetrate the same offense i remember some years ago there was a negro in jail in a little town in north central mississippi the jailer got sorry for him and made a trusty of him he sent him out to his house on an errand and while there he attempted to rape the daughter of his benefactor a beautiful girl about 16 years old the girls mother rushed between him and his intended victim when he produced a razor and slashed the mothers throat with her lifeblood gushing between her fingers she held her throat with one hand and fought that negro with the other until her daughter could escape and help could arrive when she fainted and expired i wonder what would have happened if that had occurred in your town what would you have done if that had been your daughter these are the things you are encouraging by your agitation of this measure when you had this measure up before during a republican administration after certain members had delivered themselves of their usual tirade against the south the telephone operator down at the driscoll hotel right at the foot of capitol hill was waylaid on her way home and raped by a brutal negro on the capitol groundsright in front of the library of congress just the other day in one of the leading restaurants in washingtonless than four blocks from the white housea young white woman the wife of a prominent man from pennsylvania went into the washroom to wash her hands when a brutal negro followed her slipped in and locked the door choked her into insensibility and raped her and escaped that is the kind of stuff you are encouraging by slobbering on these negroes it is not safe for a white woman to walk the streets of washington at night without an escort the negroes are driving the white women and especially the white children from the parks of this city all this is building up trouble that is likely to burst into a race riot the like of which the country has never seen you had better stop this foolishness before it is too late and pay some attention to people who know something about the subject the negro is not a sunburnt yankee he is of a different race and must be dealt with as such i remember some years ago down near memphis tenn a little girl of 12 or 13 years of age had to walk to school something like a half mile there was only one point along the~road where she was out of sight of either her home or the schoolhouse her fond mother would stand in the door and watch her until she reached that point knowing that when she had gone 50 or 75 yards farther she would be in sight of the schoolhouse a negro man concealed himself at this point waylaid this little girl seized her raped her then took his ax and chopped her head off and buried her head and her body at different places in an old slough what would have happened if that had been your child i am sorry to relate these horrible things but somebody must tell the congress and the american people the truth about this proposition and you have not done it these are just a few of the bestial outrages that have brought summary punishment to the prepetrators of these crimes i have not related some of the worst ones now we are going to protect the white women and children of the south at all costs and we are going to protect the innocent negroes if you will let us this law would hamper our state and county governments in their attempts to protect either of them about 3 years ago a white man living in one of the counties i represent had a negro living on his place one night this negro came to his house called him out knocked him in the head went into the house locked the door and outraged his wife for 2 or 3 days in a manner too horrible to relate he then killed her wrapped the bodies in two sacks buried them got in the mans car and drove away this home was somewhat isolated and it was several days before these people were missed and then people just thought they had gone away on a visit they finally found this negro driving this car in alabama and when pinned down he confessed and told where to find the bodies it was with the utmost difficulty and at great expense that the strong arm of the constituted authorities in both alabama and mississippi protected this wretch from the hands of an infuriated mob but these negropandering demagogues never give us credit for the sacrifices we make to prevent mob violence and which probably would not be prevented in other sections of the country at this very moment the national guard in my own state is protecting a negro criminal an outlaw a murderer until the court can try him and it is costing the taxpayers of mississippi thousands of dollars to do so you do not give us credit for all the effort we have put forth all the money we have spent and all the peace officers of the south who have been killed or injured in trying to prevent lynching but as compensation for our efforts and our troubles you drag this stupid measure in here and malign and misrepresent the white people of the south and stir these vicious negroes to renewed attacks endanger the lives of our women and children and make it impossible for negroes to continue to live peacefully in many communities where they have been for generations the white people of the south are not enemies of the negro they are the best friends he ever had we were not responsible for negro slavery nor would we have it returned those negroes were sold to us by the people in the northern states largely in massachusetts and it has been a problem ever since what to do with them had it ever occurred to you that slavery never became immoral in some northern states and especially in massachusetts until they had sold all their negroes and got the money for them we in the south did not reduce the negro to slavery as some people would have you believe we elevated him from the position of savage to that of servant started him on the road toward civilization and showed him for the first time the light of a christianity through the unfortunate instrumentality of slavery for tens of thousands of years the negro had roamed at will over the continent of africa the richest country in all the world feasting upon his fellowman and had never even developed the art of agriculture to the extent of making his living out of the ground for countless ages he had trod the sands of his native soil with cliamonds beneath his feet and never even dreamed of the theory of values he saw the dawn of civilization and watched the pageant of the centuries pass without so much as manifesting a desire to participate in progress he bowed beneath his masters whip at the building of the pyramids and watched succeeding civilizations rise and fall and all he ever learned was to construct a rude shelter of bark and grass with which to shield his head from the beating rays of a tropical sun until he was brought to america and taught the rudiments of civilization and shown the sunlight of christianity by the white people of the southern states for 300 years he has enjoyed the richest blessings his race has ever known as a result of the care and training given him by his white friends in the south this has been brought about by the only peaceful relationship that can ever exist between the whites and blacks living side by side and that is a complete segregation of the two races yet

provides for the procurement of each class or type of any such surplus agricultural commodity in the approximate proportion that the secretary of agriculture determines such classes or types bear to the total amount of excess of such surplus agricultural commodity over domestic requirements in the administration of this subsection the administrator will be guided by four considerations as follows first is procurement for a participating country on this basis practicable and applicable if not the section would not apply to procurements for such country second is such commodity in excess of domestic requirements this information is readily available from the department of agriculture third have producers of any such surplus agricultural commodity relied in the past upon markets for such commodity in participating countries this information is readily available from the department of agriculture fourth can the approximate proportion that each class or type bears to the total surplus of such commodity be readily determined yes the department of agriculture can supply this information the administration of subsection 2 should therefore cause no great difficulty as the basic information required would be readily available to the administrator this subsection in its relation to other provisions of section 112 has the approval of the state department and the department of agriculture mr charles e gage director of tobacco branch p m a department of agriculture stated on march 19 1948 that he thought the section provides a guiding principle that can be applied effectively with respect to the utilization of private trade channels and the procurement of surplus agricultural commodities this subsection applies to the procurement of any surplus agricultural commodity for supply to participating countries there are however few such commodities tobacco and certain dried fruits are in surplus supply in the case of tobacco the major portion of surplus stocks are held by cornmodity credit corporation for farmers under nonrecourse loans under its pricesupport program the surplus stocks of tobacco include fluecured firecured burley dark aircured and wisconsin since funds for the supply of commodities to participating countries will come from taxes the burden of aid to european countries will fall on all taxpayers the supply of commodities to european countries will be neither on a historical basis or as a commercial transaction there is no historic basis for such aid and it is not intended to be commercial this being so all producers of agricultural commodities should share proportionately to their surplus in the supply of products to participating countries the latiuage of this subsection is intended to give effect to this condition it would enable the administrator insofar as the different types of tobacco are suitable for the requirements of participating countries to liquidate surplus stocks of each type and class of tobacco in the supply of this product to participating countries this would give each producing area equal consideratica and at the same time probably save loss to the commodity credit corporation in its

holy land in the throes of violence and civil war arab is killing jew and jew is killing arab this intense situation was precipitated by the action of the united nations assembly when it voted to partition palestine the crisis is not a local affair but it concerns the whole world from it may flow the causes for world war iii it is of particular concern to the united states as it involves the integrity and good faith of our government and the delegates that represent us in the assembly of the united nations as yet the american people do not understand the full implications of the critical situation to which i have referred it is my purpose to bring it to their attention and to the congress and hereafter they shall be on notice of the danger that confronts our nation in this matter on november 29 the assembly of the united nations voted to recommend the partition of palestine if approved and implemented by the security council it means the creation of a new jewish state the full import of this decision and its impact on world affairs cannot be judged at this time one writer says that it is one of the most momentous decisions that has ever been made in modern times that is a strong statement but it is fully justified by the facts the united nations organization has been a glimmering hope of a warweary world which has looked to it to establish a just and lasting peace the people of the united states and of the world must now realize that it has failed to meet their expectations russia by the use of the veto has sabotaged its effectiveness we now know that it has become the tool of special interests of groups and individuals who seek to advance their own selfish objectives as of november 29 1947 the united nations is as dead as prohibition even major surgery cannot revive it lets take a look at the record and see what happened in the united nations assembly meeting prior to the vote on partition a twothirds vote was required to pass the resolution on two occasions the assembly was to vote and twice it was postponed it was obvious that the delay was necessary because the proponents did not have the necessary votes in the meantime it is reliably reported that intense pressure was applied to the delegates of three small nations by the united states members and also by officials at the highest levels in washington now that is a serious charge when the matter was finally considered on the 29th what happened the decisive votes for partition were cast by haiti liberia and the philippines these votes were sufficient to make the twothirds majority previously these countries opposed the move do not forget that they are considered satellites of our own country the pressure by our delegates by our officials and by private citizens of the united states constitutes reprehensible conduct against them and against us ten nations abstained from voting and russia saw to it that yugoslavia its satellite did not join the supporters of partition haiti liberia and the philippines opposed partition prior to november 29 and the 64 question is what kind of coercion was used to force a change in their positions and by whom time will tell and this congress should authorize a fulldress investigation so that the people of this country may know that the united nations has been used in this instance as a vehicle of torture and not as an instrumentality of international justice the enforcement of partition at this time can only be achieved by the imposition of force it is reported by christian missionaries in jerusalem and christian educators who know the near east that the attempt to impose partition will plunge palestine and that entire area into endless civil war it has been suggested in reply however that the united nations assembly action is ineffectual unless aplfroved and implemented by the security council it is true that no actual authority has been taken yet to enforce the recommendations but already those who seek partition are now insisting that the security council take action it is a fact that the assembly has requested the security council to take the necessary measures as are provided for in the plan for
