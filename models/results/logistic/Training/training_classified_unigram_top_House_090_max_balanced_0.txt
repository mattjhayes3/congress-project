moments ago about the 200 different categories of forms involved in the census of business now in progress some of us remember the complaints we received at the time of the last census i can easily remember the bitterness of some of the complaints that came in at that time i am sure that unless we pass this bill there will be a repetition during the next census there was an article i think in the nations business or one of the other business publications recently on this very subject i commend this article to the membership because it was along the lines of the thoughts expressed by the gentleman from new york concerning the cost placed on small business because of all the forms that have to be completed today we hear a lot about each individual being computerized that means big brother must look over the shoulders of each of us to get the data to feed into these computers it seems to me we have a means here to put the harness on big brother and to restrain him through the enactment of a bill such as the one which has been offered by the gentleman from ohio or some similar bill it is time to limit the number and kinds of census questions unless this congress moves to bring some reason to the function of the 1970 census americans will be required to answer more than 120 questions or risk fines and jail terms i see no justification for demanding in a population census that all citizens be forced to provide such information as first income dollar by dollar from all sources including alimony public assistance pensions investments and so on second the value of property or the amount of rent paid third educational marital employment and military history in detail fourth the names of people with whom bathroom and kitchen facilities are shared fifth a listing of television and radio sets dishwashers and other household items and sixth the place of birth of the parents of the citizens the constitutional purpose of the census is to count people and to provide a basis for congressional redistricting in what manner do the above questions or answers thereto assist in congressional districting or determining how many people are within our environs the 1970 census form should be limited to seven questions as follows first name and address second relationship to head of household third sex fourth date of birth fifth race or color six marital status and seventh visitors in home at time of census it might even be possible to take one or two of these questions off but the addition of any further inquiries would in my opinion constitute an unwarranted invasion of the peoples privacy and would most certainly violate the purpose for which the decennial census is prescribed it is encouraging to observe there has been participation in this special order on the limitation of census questions by both sides of the aisle this should prove that while the effort to reform the census to avoid the invasion of privacy is not a controversy between the legislative branch and the executive branch neither is it a partisan matter i compliment the distinguished gentleman from ohio for his studious and forceful efforts in this field"],

comprehensive discussion of the questions which the proposal has raised in your mind in return i would like to comment on the points which appear to be of major concern to you as follows 1 the act would not result in training for those who need it most it is true that the legislation is not designed specifically and exclusively for the hardcore unemployed worker and for good reason it does little good to train the least skilled workers for higherskill jobs unless those jobs are open by encouraging the training of workers all along the line there is a continual process of upgrading the labor force in a sound and practical way the alternative is to train unskilled persons for nonexistent vacancies making unemployed janitors into unemployed welders or to leapfrog the hardcore unemployed over those already working who in fairness deserve the first opportunity to acquire the skills needed to move up to a better job you admit this skill ladder theory is excellent but claim there is nothing in practice to assure such a happy outcome however to my knowledge you do not propose any solution to this purported uncertainty which many would suggest is more fictitious than real obviously much remains to be done to equip todays hardcore unemployed to be productive members of society also the basic responsibility for meeting their employability needs lies with the public and private educational system but once educated to the point of being able to profit from job training the hardcore unemployed will have to begin at the bottom of the skill ladder and work their way upas others did before thema process the human investment act would seek to accelerate 2 the act would assist the employers in providing quickie training which would do little to equip the worker with the skills needed by a changing economy one of the major virtues of the human investment act approach is that it would encourage training of workers for jobs that are open and for which the economy has an immediate need it is hard to see how workers would prefer to be trained according to some theoretical plan unless there is some assurance that the additional skills would have an immediate market value the important point to the workertrainee is not whether he qualifies for a hypothetical diploma but whether he qualifies for a job with higher pay more security and enhanced responsibility the important point to the employertrainer is not whether he is serving the economy in general but whether his investment in a trainee will produce a qualified man for a job that needs filling in the last analysis the fact that the employer is paying for much of the training costs even allowing for the human investment credit entitles him to train workers to fill jobs that need workers it is suggested that training workers in any other way raises serious questions of economics as well as good sense 3 individual employers cannot be expected to know what the economys skill needs are or are likely to be this contention raises the question of who knows best what skills are needed in the economy private employers or government officials the philosophy of the act is that those who know best are those who sign the checks and take the risk of profit and loss the sponsors of the act are satisfied that this choice meets the test of experience and common sense 4 the act provides no role for labor in the development and administration o1 training programs other than apprenticeship programs actually the act provides for a tax credit to a taxpayer who has contributed to an organized job training program conducted by a joint labormanagement apprenticeship committee or any other similar nonprofit association group trust fund foundation or institution paragraph 52 a 8 this language was recommended by certain union representatives and is expressly designed to cover training jointly or wholly developed and administered by a union when paid for in whole or part by a taxpayer while under paragraphs 27 of section 52 a there is no requirement of union participation in the development and administration of training programs there is no language precluding it certainly it would seem to make good sense for an employer to consult with labor representatives in the course of designing and administering training programs but it was not felt wise in view of the essential management responsibility for paying the costs of training and in view of widely varying local conditions across the nation to require the participation or approval of labor organizations for every kind of training covered by the act presumably such participation in a unionized plant could be a subject for discussion in the course of negotiating a union contract paragraph 52 a 1 dealing with registered apprenticeship programs would of course directly involve union participation and approval as in these programs the union must agree with the training standards and qualifications one advantage of the act it is felt is that it would strongly encourage the upgrading of presently lowquality training into registered apprenticeship programs complying with nationally prescribed quality standards 5 the human investment act is essentially different from the proposals of the national commission on technology automation and economic progress and the british industrial training act you point out that although there is an obvious similarity among these measures inasmuch as each involves the use of the tax system to promote job training and retraining the purpose and effect of the act make it entirely different the proposal advanced for consideration by the national commission suggested that part of the 7 investment tax credit for equipment and machinery be diverted into a special fund this fund would then finance the retraining of workers displaced by automation and provide them with supplemental unemployment benefits relocation payments and other aid the human investment act particularly paragraph 52 a 8 would differ from this proposal only in these ways 1 it would divert into a joint fund not dart of the 7 investment tax credit but a separate 10 tax credit 2 it would permit a credit only for organized job training conducted by such a fund and not for relocation supplemental benefits etc 3 it would be far broader in scope than the commission proposal with respect to training conducted unilaterally by taxpayers not participating in such a fund the british industrial training act of 1964 permits industrywide labormanagementpublic boards to assess the training needs of the industry and to levy a payroll tax on employers firms conducting training programs certified by the board as meeting the industrys needs are reimbursed from these proceeds thus as you point out the firms that train are paid for their efforts and those that do not are penalized by having to pay for training conducted by others adaptation of the bita to the united states would pose severe constitutional problems inasmuch as entities other than congress would have the power to levy taxes in addition there is wide agreement that little additional burden may be imposed on the payroll in view of the recent increases in social security and medicare payroll taxes thus while an interesting example of the use of the tax system to encourage job training the bita would seem to be inapplicable to the united states 6 the purpose of the act is to reduce or dismantle existing federal lobtraining pro grams for the disadvantaged first it should be pointed out that among the 140 representatives and 29 senators sponsoring this legislation there is bound to be a wide divergence of viewpoint on the value of existing federal programs some human investment sponsors can be found who believe that the act should entirely replace federal programs others including both of the acts principal sponsors have consistently supported sound federal training programs as drafted by senator winston prouty and representative thomas b curtis the human investment act is complementary with such federal programs as the vocational education act of 1963 which senator prouty as ranking republican member of the senate education subcommittee strongly supported and the manpower development and training act of 1961 which representative curtis was instrumental in drafting the provisions of see 52 a 2 allow a tax credit toward the wages of employees participating in an onthejob training program under mdta which clearly indicates that the human investment act is intended to supplement and not replace that program paragraph 52 a 3 relating to the wages of trainees participating in cooperative education programs explicitly refers to the vocational education act and is likewise intended to supplement its provisions whether the job corps and the neighborhood youth corps and many of the oeo programs are in fact training programs is open to question many training experts feel that whatever their general educational and social value these programs do not produce trained workers measuring up to any standard acceptable to either management or union training specialists many sponsors of the act thus raise the question as to whether these programs should not be justified on some basis other than their job training value and if such justification cannot be adequately made whether funds currently devoted to them might not be more profitably spent on onthejob training by employers who offer gainful employment to the trainees it is recognized by the sponsors of the act that the act by itself cannot meet the needs of those prospective workers who lack sufficient educational background and work habits for taking advantage of regular job training other programs both public and private at the national state and local levels must be designed to help these people find a productive place in the economy but at the same time the sponsors argue that the taxpayer deserves an assurance that the tax dollar spent in training actually leads to effective training and thence to actual employment through which the taxpayers investment may eventually be repaid through additional taxes paid and reduced unemployment and welfare costs in conclusion several points come to mind on which i would appreciate having your comments a to what extent is organized labor supporting or sponsoring programs to train the disadvantaged and unemployed to acquire the job skills with which to compete with present union members in the job market b is the uaw more concerned with expanding the opportunities for training and thus better jobs and higher economic rewards for present uaw members who have jobs or for persons who are not uaw members and do not have jobs c why is it that the uaw feels that the federal government best knows the labor skill needs of the economy but resists the proposition that the federal government best knows the needs of the economy when serious strikes curtail production and transportation and thus endanger the national welfare d does common ground remain for a limited proposal for a tax credit for taxpayers who pay the wages of apprentices in registered programs and who contribute to a training or retraining fund jointly administered by representatives of management and labor as you have requested i will insert your letter and also my response in the congressional record next week and will send you a copy of the issue i will also forward a copy of my letter to you to secretary of labor wirtz i appreciate your taking the time to set forth your views and look forward to a meeting of the minds on the important question of how best to meet the problem of the hardcore unemployed and of increasing the skills of the labor

labor as a matter of fact i introduced a bill in the 89th congress on this very subject h r 10179 it would have authorized the secretary of labor to conduct investigations into labor conditions in

get peace negotiations started i am more convinced than ever today that such a step offers the only chance of bringing the vietnam conflict to an end in the near future i have also been among those who have urged that the administration make renewed efforts to get action from the u n security council that might contribute to a peaceful solution of the conflict i rise today however in part to express alarm at some of the proposals which arecurrently being discussed with respect to a possible bombing pause as contrasted to an indefinite cessation and with respect to a u s effort to lay the vietnam issue before the coming u n general assembly without making any change in our current policies with regard to the conflict if we are prepared to stop unitedstates bombing of the north then there would be great value in making use of the general assembly session to maximize the effect of such a move if we are not prepared to stop the bombing inthe north then i believe that submit ting the vietnam issue to the u n general assembly would be a mistake i see nothing to be gained by another bombing pause which implies the early resumption of bombing if nothing happens in my judgment such a pause would not bring hanoi to the negotiating table i say this because i am in agreement with the administrations view that at present hanoi believes it is on the winning side and has no desire to negotiate hanoi would therefore in all likelihood again reject negotiation during a bombing pauseas it has in the pastas being inconsistent with its announced position that it will not even consider negotiations until and unless the bombing has stopped permanently not only would a bombing pause thus serve no good purpose but wouldin my view actually do harm first of all it would no doubt be used by hanoi to expe dite the flow of men equipment and supplies to the south as was done during the tet pauie last winter second i am afraid that the failure of another pause to produce negotiations would be used by those who favor further escalation of the war in the north as an excuse for such escalation i am therefore opposed to another bombing pause i also see nothing to be gained and considerable risk of harm in the united states submitting the vietnam issue to the u n general assembly at its forthcoming session if this submission is unaccompanied by any change in our conduct of hostilities it is clear that the great majority of the members of the united nations are opposed to our policy of bombing north vietnam believing that it is an obstacle to peace the point of view of most nonalined nations has been repeatedly expressed by secretary general u thant when he has said that halting the bombing of the north is a necessary prerequisite to any negotiations accordingly it is wholly unrealistic to expect that any resolution adopted by the general assembly would support our present posture the possibility of useful action in the security council is also slim as reported yesterday in the washington post the soviet unions attitude would be the key and the soviet union has consistently maintained that negotiations are impossible so long as unitedstates bombing of the north continues i was greatly impressed by secretary mcnamaras courageous statement of august 25 before the senate preparedness subcommittee on what he called the conduct of the air war in north vietnam reprinted at 24533 and following this statement demonstrated with abundant facts and figures that expansion and intensification of the bombing in north vietnam as advocated by some generals and admirals and their congressional supporters cannot be expected to bring a quick end to the struggle in the south further the secretary made clear that while the bombing can make infiltration and supply from the north more costly and more difficult it cannot reduce such infiltration and supply below the meager levels needed to continue the active communist operations in the south this conclusion is consistent with the fact that since the united states started its bombing of the north the numbers of north vietnamese units fighting in the south have greatly increased and the enemy forces in the south have been able greatly to increase the quality and quantity of their weaponry to be sure secretary mcnamara does not advocate stopping the bombing in the north indeed he concludes the present objectives of our bombing in the north were soundly conceived and are being effectively pursued but he is addressing himself to the military aspect of the matter and he does not even attempt to discuss the great political and psychological advantages that would flow from a cessation of the bombing it is my deeply held conviction that the shortrange military advantages of the bombing in the north are more than offset by the longrun political and psychological advantagesenhancing the chances of a peaceful settlementthat would accrue from stopping the bombing on the military side secretary mcnamaras analysis makes clear that the advantages of the bombings are not overwhelming the implication of his statement is that the number of men and the amount and types of equipment that are sent to the south from the north are determined by hanois decision and not by the intensity or by the extent of our bombing this again is consistent with the record of the last 2 years it has been argued that if we had not been bombing hanoi would have dispatched many more men and munitions to the south and that the united states would consequently have had to send 800 000 more troops to south vietnam but this is just a guess one can equally well argue the contrary that without the psychological stimulus and unity in north vietnam created by our bombing the flow of supplies and men might have been less than it wasthat it might have continued at the prefebruary 1965 level the same arguments can be madewithout certainty on either sideas to whether if we were to stop the bombing the future flow of men and supplies would increase or lessen on this score it does seem clear that a bombing pause announced as such would be more damaging to us from a military point of view than an announced cessation of the bombing during a pause the other side will naturally tend to make use of the lull to speed the flow of men and supplies if a cessation were announced on the contrary hanoi would not have the same incentive to do this instead they would then have to reconsider their policies in the light of the new total situation while the military considerations in favor of the bombing are thus marginal if not dubious the psychological and political factors militate strongly against continued bombing of the north psychologically our direct attacks on the north seem to have solidified the people of north vietnam in opposition to the attacker and to increase their motivation to undertake sacrifices in support of the conflict throughout vietnam the latest to report this from hanoi was the experienced radio commentator david schonbrunn and we should have expected this result based on our own experience following pearl harbor and more particularly on the british reaction to the blitz of 1940 by bombing the north we have made the total struggle in vietnam one in which the north vietnamese people were fully identified because they and their homeland were under direct attack if we had not been bombing in the north many of these same people might have regarded the fighting in the south as remote from their immediate interests in this connection the question is pertinent if hanoi had been able to bomb the san francisco docks what effect would that attack have had on american attitudes toward the war in vietnam would such an attack not have tended to unify americans in support of the war it is when one considers how possibly to get peace negotiations underway that the advantages of stopping our bombing of the north seem overwhelming if we were to accept the risks involved in such a step and to announce and put in effect a cessation of the bombing the whole political picture would change the pressures from the rest of the world instead of being focused largely on us would be focused on hanoi and the national liberation front to enter into meaningful negotiations if the administration is right as i believe it is about hanoi being reluctant to negotiate we must use every means available to us to bring political pressure on hanoi to negotiate and if we make full use of a decision to stop the bombing in the north we should be able to mobilize not only the nonalined world but also the soviet union and eastern european communist states to bring such pressure to bear on hanoi the coming session of the u n general assembly which starts september 19 presents the president with an opportune occasion for announcing an allout drive to achieve an honorable peace in vietnam with the help of the member states of the u n based on our willingness to stop the bombing of north vietnam without trying to exact a prior commitment from hanoi that it will enter into negotiations one way of doing this would be to invite a group of nonalined nationspossibly the 17 who urged negotiations in 1965to set up a press conference at a time and place of their own choosing and to invite to that conference such governments and parties as they see fit in making public such an invitation we would announce our intention to attend such a conference and to stop the bombing of north vietnam 3 weeks or a month before the conference was set to open under these circumstances it would be difficult if not impossible for hanoi to refuse to attend the conference the pressures on it to do so would be tremendous and should offset the counterpressures to be expected from peking at the very least if hanoi remained obdurate and stayed away from the conference the attitude of the rest of the world toward the conflict would inevitably shift the same result would occur if hanoi and the national liberation front were to come to the conference but were to filibuster instead of negotiating in good faith if either of these contingencies did occur the united states would obviously have to reconsider its strategy all options would be open to us at that time and we would be in a position to move in a far more favorable worldwide political atmosphere some thoughtful members of congress have suggested that instead of stopping the bombing we should reduce or limit it in some way in my view such a halfmeasure would not serve the purpose of putting hanoi under worldwide pressure to negotiate hanoi could and presumably would reiterate its often expressed insistence that no negotiations can take place until the bombing of the north is stopped the result might be different if hanoi were eager to find a way to negotiate but as i have said before i am in agreement with the administration that this is not the case obviously whatever the united states decides to do either at the coming general assembly or otherwise must be done august 31 196 7 co in consultation with the government of south vietnam that emerges from next weeks elections but i believe the course of action that i have suggested would be the right course of action whether the thieuky ticket is successful as anticipated or whether a civilian president and vice president are elected in conclusion i want to say only that any course of action in vietnam involves risks and my proposal is no exception but it is clear that present policies in vietnam offer no prospect of an early end to the conflict and have been far less successful than their advocates within the administration earlier predicted is it not time that something new was tried i have today
