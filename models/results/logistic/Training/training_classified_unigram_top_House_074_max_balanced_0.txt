co network saturday evening march 2 1935 as follows monday the 4th of march will mark the second anniversary of the rule of franklin d roosevelt who was elected by an unprecedented majority and came into office backed by the good will the hopes and aspirations of the american people the administration honeymoon has cracked up as was inevitable on a series of broken promises and pledges and on unsound unworkable and socialistic experiments what a difference a few years makel acclaimed by all the people for delaring a bank holiday for salvaging the deposits and assets of the banks for attempting to reduce governmental expenditures and balancing the budget the restoration of business confidence the employment of labor and return to prosperous times appeared to be assured for the first 6 months following president roosevelts inauguration most of the people regarded him as a moses sent to lead us out of the economic wilderness all of a sudden the sound promises and pledges contained in the democratic platform were repudiated and trampled under foot and a host of socialistically inclined brain trusters were ushered into key positions in the government service who delighted in making a laughingstock out of jeffersonian principles and party promises economy a balanced budget sound money to be preserved at all hazards 25percent reduction in government expenditures consolidation of departments and abolition of useless commissions and promises to stop borrowing to meet deficits were all cast aside as if contagious and thrown into the limbo of forgotten things the brain trust composed of radicals and visionaries without political training or economic experience became the sponsors with the presidents blessings of a mass of impractical unworkable unsound and socialistic legislation that has destroyed business confidence increased unemployment impoverished the people and retarded recovery it has taken the american people 2 years to find out the extent of the failure of the newdeal administration first because the first 6 months of the roosevelt regime was admirable and the bad effects of the unsound legislation was not felt immediately and secondly because we are in the midst of a government by propaganda and ballyhoo emanating from hundreds of political publicity agents paid out of the treasury of the united states to uphold and defend the newdeal policies and build up the myth of roosevelt and recovery in the press and over the radio the people back home were literally swamped with mass propaganda and the facts only after 2 years are beginning to seep through that roosevelt and recovery are not synonymous but that roosevelt and ruin are rapidly endangering the welfare of the american people to sin by silence when we should protest makes cowards of us all it is the duty of the republican members of congress representing the minority or opposition party to expose and criticize the blunders of the administration without fear or favor for 2 years we have been softpedaling our criticisms and indulging in mere shadow boxing at the expense of the brain trust the time has come to place the blame for the breakdown of the administration policies and pledges squarely where it actually belongs upon the shoulders of president roosevelt it is mere evasion and cowardice to attempt to hold professor tugwell miss perkins donald richberg honest harold ickes and james aloyslus farley responsible for the accumulation of ills and failures of the administration when they are but appointed agents of the president now that the administration has reached the halfway mark thoughtful americans are beginning to realize that the president is steadily grasping for more and more control and rapidly accumulating vast autocratic powers until the whole structure of our government is menaced the most astounding example of this policy is his insistent demands that 4 000 000 000 be turned over to him without limitation or restriction for the first time the people back home are beginning to see through the now apparent scheme of an autocratic dictatorship and oneman rule in the united states in place of our constitutional and representative form of government our american system is hanging in the balance as we march serenely on into government ownership and operation state socialism collectivism a tyrannical and crushing bureaucracy and an autocratic dictatorship at washington the most critical period of american history since the civil war is in the making at this moment in an undisguised attempt to set up a virtual dictatorship at washington no longer temporary but permanent and autocratic the abdication and surrender of legislative powers at the arrogant demands of the president by a partisan supine and subservient congress is a gross betrayal of the constitutional rights and liberties of the american people and will be one of the main issues in the next presidential campaign along with the destruction of business confidence the increase in unemployment and the high cost of living to 125 000 000 americans on the necessities of life the control of the purse strings is the main reason for the existence of congress and when a cowardly congress at the insistence of the autocrat in the white house strips itself naked of its legislative powers and leaves its members mere rubber stamps without any more clothes than gandhi it amounts to actually changing our form of government without the consent of the governed the president of the united states the democrats admit was the author of this disgraceful bill which took away from congress its very lifeblood the control of appropriations i call on all jeffersonian democrats and republicans to oppose every attempt to weaken and destroy representative and constitutional government by establishing a superman in the executive mansion and a dictatorial government patterned after fascism hitlerism communism and every other alien lsm except americanism this administration while advocating freetrade policies with european nations has for the first time in history set up economic barriers within the united states by imposing various processing taxes on the necessities of life the increased cost of which must be borne by the consumer secretary wallace predicted a few days ago that the price of food will increase another 11 percent in the next 6 months and in particular that the price of meat would rise 22 percent in the same period this is typical of what is happening to the american wage earners consumers and the 12 000 000 unemployed under the present administration which has destroyed their buying power depreciated their dollar increased unemployment and retarded recovery how long will the american wage earners and consumers support an administration that was elected by their votes and in return impoverishes them and destroys the american standard of living and of wages the inevitable consequence of the freetrade policies of president roosevelt and secretary hull is to reduce the standard of living of our wage earners at a time when the cost of living on necessities of life are increasing rapidly by governmental manipulations the ruinous policy of president roosevelt and his confirmed freetrader secretary of state hull to bring the cheap labor of europe asia and south america in competition with american labor can only result in further unemployment and reduction in bur wage scale and standard of living it already threatens to ruin the textile cement glass manganese and beetsugar industries the democratic party is showing its true colors as a low wagescale party but contrary to its past policies it has turned upon the consumers by making frantic efforts to increase the cost on necessities of life the price of pork the poor mans food is skyrocketing there are 20 000 000 less pigs in the united states than 1 year ago and a smaller number than at any time in the last 50 years during this period our population has increased from 50 000 000 to 125 000 000 the tragedy of the newdeal folly and birth control of pigs is that of the 6 000 000 slaughtered 4 000 000 were destroyed and served no useful purpose today the increasing price of pork is rapidly putting it beyond the reach of the wage earners budget the killing of the pigs and particularly the sows with little pigs was not only a blunder but a crime against nature and those responsible should be impeached or at least kicked out of the government service but there again the old axiom holds goodthat the principal is responsible for the acts of his agents the republican party believes in establishing an equilibrium or parity between the products of agriculture the factories and the mines which is impossible under the n r a which raises the price of everything the farmers buy but as a general proposition the republican party is opposed to any program of scarcity and wanton destruction in a nation that has abundant resources especially when there are 12 000 000 americans unemployed the destruction of surplus crops does not answer the unemployment problem as it does away with jobs neither does it help to distribute farm products to the millions of needy and hungry americans nor solve the distribution problem there can be no prosperity for the farmer or wage earner until sound principles and common sense prevail in government as a member of the national grange and the farm bureau federation i contend that the farmers problem has not yet been solved and will not be until it is solved fairly honestly and on a sound basis all the farmer is asking is the cost of production plus a reasonable profit on what he produces i am opposed to the extension of the n r a for 2 years as requested by the president without drastic modifications the n r a has all but strangled the small business man and has hampered and harrassed business generally it has helped to destroy business confidence so that there is a dark cloud of fear and uncertainty hanging over the country today business men go to sleep at night with a headache and awake in the morning with a hangover what is needed more than anything else is the restoration of business confidence and a cessation of drastic regulations ukases and executive orders and various complicated codes such as for the curledhair manufacturing horse hair dressing dog food feather and the cosmetic container industries if i had my way i would scrap most of the n r a codes leave one general code for fair competition and several subordinate ones dealing with natural resources such as coal and oil and so forth and retain the childlabor provisions and restrictions against sweatshop hours and wages i voted for the n r a on a voluntary and temporary basis in a great emergency hoping it would help in putting american labor to work we now find according to the american federation of labor that there are between one and a half and two millions more unemployed than a year ago moreover the blue eagle has become a soviet vulture backed by force and coercion enforcement agents spies and jail sentences and nests on smokeless factory chimneys the president is now claiming that the senate is wrecking the relief program by adding the prevailingwagescale amendment the only person responsible for wrecking relief is the president himself when he coupled the emergencyrelief measure of 880 000 000 with the 4 000 000 000 blank check for public works that he demands in defiance of the constitution and that the separation of the powers of government be turned over to him without qualifications even patriotic democrats in the senate refuse to vote to destroy our representative system of government or create a huge election fund out of the treasury of the united states there is no republican member who will not vote to pass the 880 000 000 emergency relief bill any time it is brought up in congress which the democratic leaders should have done a month ago and can still bring up and pass within 24 hours in conclusion i indict the democratic administration on its record for the past year as the greatest failure in american history i challenge it with having destroyed business confidence squandered american resources wrecked commercial air transportation and with impairment of the national credit i accuse it of having imposed unsound unworkable and socialistic measures upon the nation that have increased the cost of living impoverished the american people and increased unemployment i denounce it for undermining our free institutions turning the constitution into a scrap of paper and changing our representative form of government without the approval or consent of the american people into an autocratic and dictatorial form of government i condemn it as having no economic policy except to pile debt upon debt by borrowing more borrowing and still more borrowing without any thought of balancing the budget or of the inevitable day of reckoning and collapse of credit and bankruptcy of the government i charge it with having honeycombed the various departments of the new deal with radicals socialists and near communists and contributors to communism and for having done more to promote class hatred and class antagonism than all previous administrations since the founding of the republic unfortunately recovery is a myth and a mirage shown by the tragic increase in unemployment the american people have now had a taste of the incapacity and incompetency of the new dealers i will not say democrats to govern within the bounds of reason and moderation what have they done they have examined and interfered in everybodys affairs they have threatened every corporation and endowment they have criticized every profession and vexed every trade no one is certain of his property and no one knows what new regulatioh or restriction will be forthcoming the next day the american people have had almost 2 years of it and i am convinced that the tide is rapidly turning against such a policy of regimentation and confiscation and that the american people have already made up their minds that they have had enough i predict that the very people who elected president roosevelt after 2 more years of unsound policies high cost of living and walking the streets looking for a job will turn to the sound policies of the republican party and help elect a republican president in 1936 as the only means of bringing about recovery and a return to prosperous times"],

advocated its management and distribution through state agencies rather than through regimentation and bureaucracy here in washington i stand on that principle now i think the bill before us continuing the bungling bureaucratic boondoggling methods in the present distribution of aid is entirely wrong it is wrong from the standpoint of waste extravagance and graft and from the standpoint of results if anyone can claim that the hopkins method of relief expenditure and waste of large sums of money is anything but a dismal failure i should like to hear it why continue it according to the treasurys own figures congress has already appropriated nearly eighteen billions for recovery and relief yet we still have 11 000 000 unemployed and 20 000 000 on relief the necessity for relief continues unabated which proves conclusively that the administration has failed to solve the problem or even make any improvement we have nothing to show for the billions that have been squandered except the size of the national debt which will have been piled up to the unprecedented total of thirtyfour billions by next july this colossal debt will have to be paid by present and future generations including the present beneficiaries of the relief program after the additional billion and a half dollars provided by this bill have been spent we will still have the unemployment and relief problem with us the worst feature of the present relief setup is that nearly half the funds are used up in overhead and waste and never get to those in need the only thing it has done is to set up a fine political machine and i am opposed to using either public funds for this purpose or telling those in need that they must apply to the political machinery of the present administration in order to get relief that is entirely wrong in principle as well as being a waste and extravagance so far as the money of the people is concerned i cannot see why as great a committee as we know the appropriations committee is should bring in a bill here involving 2 364 000 000 without giving the house an opportunity to see it inside of 24 hours before it is brought up on the floor and then brag in the report as they do that it is 23 859 000 less than the budget estimate it seems to me that 23 000 000 in savings is really worth while but on the other hand when you figure it is only 1 percent of the tremendous aggregate involved in this bill it is a very minor matter to call to the attention of the members of the house and the country i am absolutely opposed to the conditions under which the democratic party today is offering this bill to the country as i have said i am in favor of relief for the needy and always have been but i wish it were possible to vote on this matter on the basis of federal and state cooperation with the distribution of funds through state agencies let us do away with this bureaucratic form of government this waste and extravagance and set up commonsense business principles in connection with the use of the taxpayers money the only real solution of the unemployment problem will come through increased private employment but the policies of the present administration have all tended to harrass business and prevent or discourage expansion and reemployment at the same time the reckless spending that is going on and the loose fiscal policy that is being pursued each generate fear and create uncertainty as to the future some day the treasurys ability to borrow money with which to carry on the administrations reckless and wasteful expenditures will cease there will not be any chance of obtaining further loans and when that time comes chaos will follow if the administration would put recovery ahead of reform and would adopt definite and sound monetary and fiscal policies business would undoubtedly take great strides forward and the necessity for relief would largely disappear in the meantime however if the administration of relief expenditures were transferred to the states with the federal government contributing thereto there is no doubt but that e great saving in the cost could be effected and that those in need would be better and more adequately cared for the proforma amendment was withdrawn"], [0.004770846106112003, 0.004770846106112003, 0, "i thank the gentleman for the great honor of representing tammany hall i have never been so flattered as being endorsed by tammany hall let us be fair the democrats came into power upon that platform they were elected by the american people upon a sound platform the american people in the depression wanted a change they voted for president roosevelt by an overwhelming majority they wished him to succeed for the first 3 months of his administration adhering to the sound principles of his platform he gave an admirable administration he tried to balance the budget he tried to put into effect the sound policies of his platform he had at least 90 percent of the american people with him after the first 2 or 3 months and they believed that president roosevelt was a moses almost divinely sent to lead them out of the economic wilderness and back to prosperity and the reemployment of 10 000 000 loyal and industrious american wage earners that was the hope of all of our people then all of a sudden something happened that is what the gentleman from virginia was talking about the new dealers changed all their policies they repudiated practically every important plank in their party platform and every principle of jeffersonian democracy president roosevelt appointed to office often to key positions a lot of radicals socialists and new dealers to experiment upon the american people and to produce a new social and economic order that is what the gentleman from virginia was talking abouta new social and economic order they said that everything was wrong and rotten and corrupt in the past all the experience and wisdom of the past must be scrapped for what for some form of socialism or communism of the left or hitlerism or fascism of the right something imported from abroad some foreign policies for a new economic and social order where they have all failed were to be substituted for our american system our economic and industrial system based upon private initiative and reasonable profit and free labor is to be scrapped by this newdeal administration and you ask us to remain silent on our side and see those institutions of ours political and economic see our american system destroyed by the new dealers many of whom have never voted the democratic ticket in their lives and a new economic and social order substituted based on government ownership regimentation collectivism a crushing bureaucracy and state socialism let me ask you jeffersonian democrats especially the jeffersonian democrats of virginia what it is the jeffersonian democrats have fought for all these years for more than 135 years fearlessly without fear or favor win or lose but the rights and liberties of the individual under the constitution for state rights for national economy against the concentration of power in the federal government and against the use of this centralized power to interfere with the rights and liberties of individuals and of business this was the democratic creed until the new dealers came in and as an illustration i am reminded of a story said to have been told by abraham lincoln of two men with their overcoats on who got into a fight and fought so hard they fought into each others overcoat that is what has happened between the republican and democratic parties the democratic party has fought so hard that it has fought itself into the republican overcoat of centralized government but not stopping there it has gone way way way beyond into collectivism regimentation bureaucracy and finally state socialism getting as far away as they possibly could from the fundamental principles of thomas jefferson only this morning i appeared before a committee of this house in behalf of a bill i introduced to erect an equestrian statue to gen robert e lee in arlington the bill was reported out unanimously as i spoke before that committee i was reminded of the fact that gen robert e lee and the rest of the southerners fought in that war for a certain principle which they believed to be right under the constitution that principle was nothing more nor less than state sovereignty the rights of the states and let me say to you that this newdealnot democraticadministration has done more not only to trample upon the principles of thomas jefferson but to destroy state rights and the respect for state rights than all the republican administrations since the civil war i wish to god there could be some revival among the jeffersonian democrats who still in their hearts must have a lingering faith in state rights whether it be through governor talmadge of georgia or some other democrat there is more need today for a revival of jeffersonian democracy than there was 75 years ago more need for someone to speak for the rights and the interests of the states than ever before if it is not done soon the newdeal administration will have burned state rights so deep that there can be no hope of resurrecting them from the new dealers today we can expect just one thing repudiation of platform repudiation of the principles of thomas jefferson and above all a trampling in the mud of any reference of any kind to the sovereignty of the states i rose today to join the chorus in regard to the deplorable textile and cotton situation i find my time rapidly going so i shall just touch upon the main points and i shall begin by reversing my speech in order to follow up another peculiar inconsistency of the democratic party it is so inconsistent that it almost becomes consistent with the policies that are now being practiced by the democratic party for many years the democratic party has claimed to be the lowtariff party or the freetrade party to be the party of the consumer the party that stood for the protection of the consumer what has happened for the first time in history a newdeal democratic administration comes into power and with its advent it levies processing taxes on the necessities of life on cotton and foodstuffs against the consumer a tax which is nothing more than a tariff directed against the consumers within the 48 states up to now as between the states we have been a freetrade country of 48 free states with no economic barriers between them along comes the newdeal democratic freetrade administration and erects tariff barriers within our states and above all against the american consumers on foodstuffs and the necessities of life if this be not inconsistent with lowtariff principles there is no such thing as inconsistency"], [0.006916269194334745, 0.006916269194334745, 0, "not in my time i am offering the challenge now to any democrat to take the floor and

before congress in recent years that has claimed more attention provoked more discussion brought forth more promises produced more proposals and with respect to which less has been accomplished than that of relief for agriculture all sorts of fantastic schemes have been brought forward as a cureall some have been tried with disastrous results some so inherently weak were discarded without trial some were abandoned because of an aroused resentment upon the part of both the consumer and producer some were outlawed by the supreme court and yet unabashed unafraid and with assurance new theories and policies are continually advanced with the thought that at last has been found the longsought solution of all agricultural ills it is needless to say that as a result of all this confusion of ideas and variety of remedies with consequent failure there has been growing an everincreasing sense of discouragement and hopelessness among our american farmers it is not strange that they should begin to lose confidence the very policies that are inaugurated are frequently sufficient in themselves to create this condition for instance at this present session of congress the administration pushed through over republican opposition an authorization of seven gigantic irrigation projects in seven different states with an ultimate cost to the taxpayers of this country of approximately one and a half billion dollars the effect of this new deal policy will be to add about 5 000 000 acres of new irrigated land in the arid states of the west to the already overabundant supply of tillable farm lands now available for productive cultivation it is estimated that the 5 000 000 acres of irrigated land which is hereby created will produce the equivalent of 15 000 000 acres of good nonirrigated land thereby displacing such lands now in use or creating a surplus of production why does the new deal under the direction and leadership of secretary of agriculture henry wallace dr rexford tugwell and mordecai ezekiel claim that our farmers are producing too much in the agricultural field and thereupon inaugurate a reductionofproduction program that takes approximately 40 000 000 acres out of use at a cost of millions of dollars in benefits paid and at the same time press forward irrigation projects to bring new land into production at an additional cost of one and onehalf billion dollars there can be no satisfactory answer given to this question the fact is that the two policies are diametrically opposed there is no way to justify the existence of both at the same time either one or the other is wrong and should be discarded the tax burden is increased and the farmer further depressed by the use of these two conflicting policies at the same time it is time for common sense to find expression another instance of the detrimental effect upon our farmers resulting from conflicting new deal policies both in effect at the same time is that of permitting importation of agricultural products from abroad when farm acreage is reduced at home to prevent surplus create scarcity and increase prices it is perfectly apparent that if there is need to import then there is no need to restrict this is likewise a case where both policies cannot be right either one or the other is wrong and should be discarded it is almost unbelievable that when our american farmers in accordance with a governmental policy produce less cattle corn hogs wheat rye barley butter and other farm crops in order to cut down the surplus the present administration literally invited foreign farmers to increase their cheap foreign production of the same products and to ship them to the united states and sell them in the american market in direct competition with domestic production the amazing increase of importations of agricultural products from foreign countries as a result of new deal policies has reached such alarming proportions as to cause serious concern to thoughtful persons who realize the disastrous effect on american agriculture that will result if the policies are not changed or the importations checked the following table taken from official government figures showing a comparison of imports of farm products for the year 1935 as compared with the year of 1932 before the present administration adopted the policy of scarcity of farm products presents a condition that justifies the fear of the future that now exists 1932 imports 1935 imports corn bushels 347 627 43 242 296 oats do 5 8 786 10 106 903 wheat do 10 026 320 27 438 870

indicate that the american market is being flooded with cheaply produced foreign farm commodities which have taken just that much of the home market from our own farmers the value of imported competitive farm products in 1935 was approximately 750 000 000 all of those products could have been produced in this country by american farmers and laborers therefore it was a loss to that extent to our farmers that should not have occurred it could have been avoided had not the administration been so intent under the leadership of secretary of state hull and secretary of agriculture henry s wallace in encouraging the spirit of internationalism at the expense of our own people furthermore in addition to the loss of 750 000 000 representing the value of products actually displaced by foreign commodities it has been estimated by reliable authorities that the farmers in this country were compelled to suffer a further loss of 2 000 000 000 by way of lower prices for their products as a result of the large competitive foreign imports for 1935 explanations and excuses have been offered by administration officers for this unfortunate state of affairs the fact however remains that 40 000 000 acres of american farm land were taken out of production by a new deal policy and the food that could and would have been produced and sold in america was in fact produced on foreign soil and permitted to be imported into this country by another new deal policy in competition with our own farm products if our farmers are to cut their acreage and reduce production on the theory that we are producing too much then they should at least have the benefit of the home market without the competition of foreigngrown foodstuffs the strange results attained under the new deal policies are still further emphasized when we consider the effect of the farm policy which reduces american production and substitutes foreign with respect to the question of employment this has been the great problem that has blocked recovery the seriousness of the situation can be seen when it is realized that notwithstanding the present administration has expended more than 24 000 000 000 in the last 3 yearsmore money than it cost to run the entire government of the united states from the presidency of george washington to that of woodrow wilsonyet there are between five and six million families on relief representing an aggregate in excess of 20 000 000 persons and according to the estimate of the american federation of labor approximately 12 500 000 unemployed one of the main reasons for this condition is the fact that jobs and work which should have been performed by american labor were given to the cheap labor of other countries and the goods there produced shipped into america under new deal policies that permitted the same to come into competition with americanmade goods an analysis of the agricultural products imported into this country in 1935 from foreign countries will disclose that from 2 500 000 to 3 000 000 persons could have been employed in the united states in the production and processing of the imported commodities if the same had been produced here thus pay checks from the consumers of america went into foreign lands to pay foreign workers and unemployed farm hands in this country were driven in many cases to join the relief rolls prominent labor leaders have stated that if it were not for the importation of cheaply produced competitive manufactured products now coming into this country from abroad there could be gainfully employed in private industry nearly 3 000 000 persons who are now out of work and on relief thus new deal polidies upon the basis of these estimates are directly responsible for a total of 6 000 000 americans who would have work if the new deal would save the home market for american farmers and laboring men in conclusion i wish to give some figures taken from official records that will show a most interesting situation and still further emphasize the inconsistencies of new deal policies i have frequently said that when the administration speaks in terms of agricultural relief in most cases in practical application it relates to western and southern states and seldom if ever contemplates our eastern states nothing can more surely and quickly demonstrate this fact than the following table which shows the amount paid by the states that are named for processing taxes during the fiscal year ending june 30 1935 the amount received in return and the amount received for each dollar contributed amount re state amount

to stand out as clear as the noonday sun i do not want my stand on this question to be left to surmise and conjecture subject to doubt or question in the future and it is my purpose to state my position so plain clear and unequivocal that nothing will remain for intendment i realize that each member of congress must solve this problem and take his position on this issue each from his own viewpoint his viewpoint of natural rights his viewpoint of the object and purpose of corporations and the service for which created to perform together with the proper province of government and its relation to our industrial system i believe that the world was created for all people and not for a certain special few i believe that every child born into the world inherits a part and portion of itenough upon which to live move and have being and which it takes by a natural and higher superior title over manmade laws and rules with the right to labor upon the earth to live and the rights to enjoy the fruits of that labor i believe that the natural resources the forces and powers of nature the rivers streams and falling waters to furnish provide and carry light heat power and water are a part of this inheritance and have become as vital and necessary today as the air we breathe in our everyday life and which the people are entitled to take use and enjoy free without restrictions without burden for profits and at the lowest cost of production and i believe that the proper province of government is to guarantee safeguard and defend this inheritance title and birthright for every man woman and child in such equitable share and portion as may be necessary for their interests and welfare the great natural resources of the world the power and forces of the elements to produce light heat and power and the vital necessaries required to live have been and are being usurped and seized upon to hold for ransom and tribute to take and exact from the people and now the power and forces of the resistless tides of the sea following in the course of the moon and the revolutions of the earth are to be harnessed and used to produce light heat and power for the use and service of men but already the certain crafty few the great powerholding corporations are organizing a lunar monopoly to corner the moon and the forces of attraction of gravitation to take and exact even further tribute from the people industry is a system grown up under which the earth and its fruits and the necessaries and comforts of life are apportioned out among the people according as they may be willing to toil and labor to live to better provide for the conduct of industry and to aid the people in their labors to live the state has created artificial persons which under the law are known as corporations and given great and multiplied powers over individual men or natural persons in creating these artificial persons or corporations it was the purpose under the law that the states the power creating them should always hold and maintain full and complete power to regulate and control the operations of the corporations created to safeguard the rights of natural persons and during the early development of our system of specialized industry this power to regulate and control corporations was maintained full and supreme by the states and the rights of natural persons were safeguarded against imposition and encroachment from corporations and their greater force and power corporations have been made or have become a part of our economic and industrial system and through which the people conduct many of their important business affairs and upon which they have come to rely for organized and concerted effort in commerce industry and trade but under new and changed conditions such as the invention of the automatic machine the concentration of great wealth in the hands of the few these corporations exercising superpowers have come to challenge the state creating them and to defy the federal government itself while the people are left helpless powerless to resist and at their mercy under the law creating corporations corporations have been organized for purposes never contemplated or intended and instead of being in aid of legitimate industry commerce and trade are being used to prey upon industry and through them to exact from the people and following the growth of corporations a new form of corporations has been developed the holding corporations to usurp and take from the state its powers to control and regulate the course and operations of corporations and to combine and organize such corporations for its own domination and control through the organization of holding companies the power of control and direction has been taken away from the state and the purposes of the law defeated and annulled by confusing and mystifying corporate operations until evils and abuses of holding companies have perverted the purpose for which corporations were originally created to serve the system of holding corporations organized over the operating corporations in effect creates a supergovernment usurping and taking from the state its power to control corporations and under which the state creating them is left helpless and at their dictation but these great superpowered corporations asserting their power in defiance of the state are not only claiming the right to control their corporations and others but they are assuming the sovereign power to exact charges and levy tribute and compel their underservient corporations to make and enforce collection from the people this is the industrial condition with which we are confronted today and these are the corporation evils and abuses which brought on a great nationwide investigation of publicutility holding companies in 1928 and which has prompted this legislation to recover state control of corporations operating publicutility corporations are corporations producing furnishing distributing light heat power gas and water for the use of the people of the country they are a part of our local business affairs and of the different communities served or where they are operated and are carried on holdingutility corporations produce nothing furnish and distribute nothing they are organized to manipulate and control the operating and producing companies and to lay levy and exact tribute upon the operating and producing companies and compel its collection from the people a man who was caring for a turtle and feeding it for some of his friends was asked if the turtle required much food yes he says more than you would think and i can show you why this is then he pulled the turtle out of the barrel and holding it up with the tail he pointed to several leeches which were clinging to the turtles legs saying the turtle must also eat for these then taking out a glass and holding it over a leech he pointed to some parasites upon the leech saying the turtle must eat and digest not only for himself but for these leeches and parasites and this is why it takes more food than you would think when this publicutility bill came up for consideration before the house i recalled the man feeding the turtle and it occurred to me at once that the turtle was a fair illustration of the publicutility industry the man feeding the turtle would correspond to the people and patrons paying for light heat power and water his friends owning the turtle would correspond to the little stockholders who had been induced to become the owner the turtle being cared for and fed would correspond to the operating companies the leeches sucking its blood would correspond to the holding companies all pyramided upon the operating or producing companies then i must find a place for the parasites feeding off the blood of the leeches and i placed them as the manipulating bankers using the holding companies for speculative investments and with which to gamble on the stock exchange then looking still further for the solution of the publicutility problem i pondered considered and soliloquized if these leeches on the turtle could speak like the holding companies speak through their lobby tools and puppets and their organized stockbuying victims are instructed and led to speak if these leeches on the turtle could only subsidize the press with 28 000 000 a year which has been shown by the federal trade commission to have been paid out for publicity if these leeches could finance and pay college professors and economic students for addressing the people in every state and to teach leech necessities in the schools they could persuade the supporting turtle that leeches are a necessary evil and persuade them to raise the hue and cry against taking them off the turtle as a cold cruel death sentence and a plea for regulat on which they have ignored and defied the trouble with industry today under great and powerful corporations grown up in violation of the intent of the laws is there are too many leeches there are too many blood suckers there are too many parasites there are too many hangerson who are performing no duty or service but which the people must support and pay the pyramiding of holding corporations piling up corporations one after another sometimes as many as 10 deep over and upon operating companies with as many intermediate layers and strata creates an intricate confusing structure a complex bewildering legal entanglement through the meshes of such a maze and mass no responsibility can be fixed for control no power can be exerted or directed for regulation earnings and income from the operating companies below cannot be traced up through the overlapping intricacies nor can the benefits claimed furnished from above be followed down through the confusing strata holding companies pyramiding above upon servient companies below have become a confusing legal monstrosity a profiteering camouflage or smoke screen for the exploitation of helpless consumers of gas and electricity for light and power and through which stockholders cannot pierce the veil to claim dividends or make assets available to them the one and ofily hope of regulation and control is the simplification of the corporate structure confining them to one system or organization and making them directly subject and responsible to the regulatory powers of the state all forms of supercorporations which exist only to exercise and usurp the sovereign powers of the state for the control and regulation of other corporations to safeguard the rights of natural persons against corporate imposition and encroachment should be outlawed and dissolved here are a few items or examples taken from the hearings and reports showing how the holding companies milk the operating companies and through the operating companies profiteer upon the bona fide stockholders impair and impoverish the service to the people and exploit the consumers of gas and electricity i first call attention to some of the salaries which have been paid and are still being paid to the presidents and high officers of these holding companies during the trying years of the depression by compelling the underoperating companies to raise their rates and charges to the consumers in 1925 a mr foshay as president of his holding company received a salary concealed as a bonus of 306 000 these huge salaries were taken annually from the operating and producing companies secretly under holdingcompany manipulation and without any service performed to the consumers in the electric bond share co a holding company performing no service to the operating company or consumers c e groesbeck president and director received in 1929 228 000 and in 1930 251 260 as salary s c mitchell chairman of the board of directors received in 1929 251 910 and in 1930 276 560 in 1929 h c couch as director of the electric bond share a holding company received 59 060 and in 1931 received 67 413 as salary and this same director in the year of 1932 during the crisis of the panic and depression claimed and took as his salary 67 883 in 1929 p g gossler as president of the columbia gas electric co a holding company received 251 335 and in 1930 received 233 383 salary f w crawford vice president of this company took 112 315 and in 1930 106 903 as salary in 1931 b c cobb chairman of the board of directors of the commonwealth southern a holding company received 97 700 and in 1932 110 200 salary this was in the lowest depth and crisis of the panic in 1931 p w martin president of the commonwealth southern a publicutility holding company received 72 600 and in 1932 130 140 as salary the northern american utility co is a holding company performing no service to the consumers or is afraid to make such showing in 1930 this company paid f l dame as president 110 440 and in 1931 the sum of 106 506 as salary this same company paid edwin gruhl vice president at the same time paid to dame in 1930 91 468 and in 1931 87 624 as salary in 1931 the associated gas electric co a holding company paid its president j i mange 60 156 and in 1932 58 140 as salary during these same years these same presidents and directors were acting as presidents and directors of other companies and from which other holding companies were drawing like salaries and pay these huge salaries were forced upon the bona fide operating and distributing companies which companies were compelled to withhold from stockholders their full dividends due them and to raise the rates of service to the consumers in 1929 the commonwealth southern co a publicutility holding company was organized in the southern states the salary of the president was fixed at 43 000 from this time the panic beginning and continuing lowered all values prices and wages decreased all earnings and income of the people and their ability to pay for light and electric service yet in the face of this depression and the crisis of reduced earnings and income and the ability of the people to pay this company steadily increased salaries until in 1932 the low crisis of the panic the presidents salary was raised to 139 000 with other salaries raised in proportion the central public utility group has collected socalled management fees from the operating and producing companies and for which they can show no service of more than a million dollars and all of which came off stockholders and consumers committee hearings p 213 the associated gas electric co has been shown to have charged the operating and producing companies under it interest at the rate of 8 percent per annum compounded monthly in advance which the operating and producing companies were compelled to charge up against the consumers committee hearings pp 150151 the byllesby engineering management corporation for the standard gas electric co a holding company collected socalled legal fees from 1919 to 1929 of 3 359 884 which after paying the lawyers their fees netted that company in profits 2 078 872 these fees were collected from the operating companies and came off the stockholders and consumers committee hearings pp 380381 another means of the holding companies perched upon the operating and producing companies used to take huge profits from the people is by compelling the underoperating companies to buy from them all their material and equipment and for which they charge double and extortionate prices the hearings and report upon this measure show that in 1926 the appalachian electric power co took over the american gas electric co at the book value of 72 000 000 and which was immediately revalued at 159 000 000 under this double revaluation stock was issued and sold out to the unsuspecting public at a profit over the purchasing value of 66 000 000 and under which the new stockholders were exploited exactly to that amount these are the publicutility holding companies who are sending their representatives to washington objecting and making protest to congress against the provisions of the senate bill giving them 7 years time in which to show that they are performing some necessary service and that this requirement will mean a death sentence to them many good people of the country will be unable to understand why if these corporations are performing such necessary service they cannot show it to the securities commission in 7 years and why if they are performing such service this provision of the senate bill would mean a death sentence the tacoma electric power co of washington state is purely an operating and distributing company free from the leech holding companies and where the operating company cannot be forced to increase rates upon the people to make them pay dividends and high salaries for holding companies comparing the tacoma service rates or charges where the charges are 10 60 for 1 000kilowatt hours with the publicutility companies now operating in indiana and carrying the pyramid of holding companies the people of indiana are being overcharged every year by the sum of 19 189 000 the people of the state of ohio are being overcharged over 47 000 000 the people of illinois are being overcharged over 50 000 000 the people of michigan are being overcharged over 33 000 000 all to pay salaries and dividends to useless holding companies the people of the united states to support the holdingcompany octopus riding on the backs of the operating companies are paying an overcharge of almost a billion dollars which is being taken from them annually but a more important and significant part of this great propagandapublicity program is explained beginning at page 278 of the federal trade commission report showing the organization for a purpose of a great army of utility employees looking ahead for the last 25 years to the developments of electricity seen coming the publicutility holding company interests have been organizing to monopolize and control the production and distribution of electric power and have been building up their defense behind unsuspecting individual stockholders under this investigation it was found the policy carried out through an army of utility employees to sell and scatter a certain amount of their stock among single individual stock investors and then have their employees frequently contact or keep in touch with these small stockholders to urge the importance of upholding their companies to maintain the value of their shares of stock classified lists have been made and kept of all persons to whom stock was sold not only for the purpose of frequent contracts and to receive holdingcompany literature but for the purpose of prompting and calling them to aid in their defense against any unfavorable legislation this system of creating scattered stockholders to be held ready and in waiting in every legislative and congressional district was known as the illinois plan and was first perfected and sponsored by the insull publicutility corporations as before explained this plan was later adopted as the model plan and system by the national utility association which completed its organization in 1927 to oppose unfriendly legislation in congress at that time for a trial of public ownership this policy of publicutility corporations using the employees to sell stock and to scatter shares among individual men is all set forth in the summary report of the federal trade commission under senate resolution no 83 and explains by whom and the system under which congress is being bombarded on this bill at this time it was from behind the breastworks of these small publicutility stockholders that samuel and martin j insull joined the electricpower monopoly in its fight in congress in 1927 against the development of muscle shoals as a step to try out public ownership but the small stockholders of the insull public utility corporation must be exonerated from opposition to this bill they have been busy keeping trace of samuel insull in his wanderings in europe and over the seven seas trying to escape trial in america and only to be extradited and returned to trial and found guilty but not proven under the technicalities of corporate law realizing the swiftcoming developments in the production and distribution of electricity for use as light heat and power and its universal use coming as a vital necessity and its control as a power and vantage ground from which to take and exact from the people as a power greater than the taxing power these powerful publicutility corporations have organized and carried on since 1919 a great nationwide propaganda campaign employing every form of publicity and secret aid to oppose single and independent power plants as well as all forms of public ownership the policy observed and carried out has been to prevent and forestall the organization and construction of local power plants and to buy out all independent plants looking to one unified system of ownership and to complete an absolute monopoly of the production and distribution of electricity i call the attention of every member of congress and of report of the federal trade commission under senate resolution 83 for a better and more complete understanding of the means and methods employed to create and control public opinion in favor of publicutility holding companies and i earnestly urge every member of congress to call for and read this summary report and i likewise call upon the readcommission directed to washington d c and request a copy of this summary report no 71a the dollings co a corporation organized under the laws of ohio and operating largely in ohio and indiana was not an operating or producing company like the insull holding companies it owned no property or tangible assets it produced nothing and distributed nothing its sole and only purpose was to sell and manipulate the stock issued by other corporations like the utilityholding company it was a leech and parasite upon industry without serving any real useful purpose but through which thousands of people have lost their entire life savings and yet the day before its fall the company was defended and upheld as a necessary agency of industry the insull publicutility holding companies were not operating or distributing companies they were great holding companies they produced nothing and performed no service they only held and manipulated the stocks of other companies the same as the dollings co held and sold other stocks these insull nonservice manipulating companies have brought loss to millions of people millions of innocent unsuspecting people as investors but such a hold did the insull companies have upon the people of the country under its propagandapublicity programs that any suggestion for restraint upon them upon their operations and stockselling manipulations would have been resented by the very people deluded and now suffering great loss from them and there are many holding companies remaining now holding and selling stock for manipulation or for the control of operating companies which are following in the same course of the defunct dollings and insull companies but before these companies can be restrained or controlled and the people protected from their abuses millions more will have suffered loss and deprived of their life savings and earnings it is estimated that an average of 5 000 has been taken from the confiding and unsuspecting people of every county in the state of indiana by the sale of dollings insull and like stocks all operating in gross violation of the purpose and intent of corporation laws but this is not all of the loss which has been suffered from these companies by the people of the state of indiana it has been shown that by reason of these holding companies all claiming incomes from the earnings of the operating companies the people of indiana are and have been overcharged for gas and electric service 20 000 000 annually with the shadows of the dollings and insull companies and their movements manipulations and final failures hanging low in the investment horizon the duty of this congress is plain if the common people are to be protected from exploitation there is only one hope remaining for the small individual stock investor holding shares in great corporations there must be intervention by the state and nation to stay the hands of speculation and high finance and to compel open operations and administration and observance of honesty among corporations gambling and stock manipulation watered and dilutedstock issues thrown upon the market without supporting assets confiscatory salaries and fees are incompatible with security and a stable basis for investments it is a most remarkable and very extraordinary coincidence that coming simultaneously the newspapers from coast to coast and from the lakes of the north to the gulf on the south began a great hue and cry all using the exact identical words or phrase without variation the death sentence and then at the same identical time in concert with this newspaperpropaganda campaign many thousands or millions of small stockholders widely separated and from every part of the country began writing letters to their congressman all following the exact phrase of the newspapers and all alike protesting against the death sentence this most mysterious and remarkable coincidence of the use of the phrase the death sentence and at the same time by thousands of newspapers and coming from millions of small stockholders shows a centrally organized campaign prompting the newspaper articles and editorials and the letters from the small stockholders the use of the phrase the death sentence in thousands of newspaper editorials and in millions of letters from small stockholders coming all at one and the same time shows something more than a mere coincidence it shows a carefully prepared plan and system carefully completed in advance held in readiness to be used to meet an emergency apprehended to be met this is all the more significant when we read from the hearings of the federal trade report showing that these same utilityholding companies were paying newspaper editors over twentyeight millions of dollars annually for prepared articles and editorials to be carried as their own editorials and further showing the sale of publicutility stock to millions of unsuspecting individual investors and deliberately scattered throughout the country through and in whose name to make their appeal and behind whom to shield themselves to make their defense this measure does not eliminate or take away a single necessary or useful utility company whether holding or separate operating company it does not retire or take away a single laboring man clerk or oficer necessary or required to carry on efficient service nor retire a single dollar of investment nor reduce the corporations actually engaged this measure does not require a single holding company to retire and get off the backs of the operating company or stop drawing upon or taking from the operating and producing companies its earnings and income from the people if the holding company can show in 7 years time that it is performing any necessary service in producing or distributing gas or electricity orany necessary or useful purpose to the people in exchange for the money that it is taking from the earnings of the operating companies paid in by the people using the service this is not destruction nor disorganization this is in fact a house cleaning in the interest of bona fide stockholders in the interest of the patrons paying for the service this is to strike off the leeches this is to sterilize the parasites and to relieve the people of their burden this is only to take the evils and abuses out of the publicutility business this is only to take the gambling operations out of the publicutility business this is only to take the manipulation and high finance out of the publicutility business this is to conserve the earnings and income of the legitimate publicutility business for the use and benefit of the bona fide stockholders and to maintain the value of their stock and to exempt the patrons from excessive charges for high excess salaries without benefit or service performed it is found that the investigation leading up to the preparation of this bill began back under the coolidge administration on the 15th day of february 1928 when the senate passed senate resolution no 83 this resolution was prompted by the evergrowing evils and abuses of publicutility and holding companies but more immediately and directly by the publicutility companies lobby appearing in washington in 1927 to oppose the enactment of legislation looking to a trial of public ownership under this senate resolution no 83 the federal trade commission was authorized and directed to make inquiry regarding the service performed by holding companies and the value and prices for such service and the activities of holding companies to control public opinion and legislation the federal trade commission promptly entered upon this investigation under the powers and authorities of the resolution and continued its hearings and inquiry until sonietime during 1934 in all a period of over 6 years the report of this commission was filed december 12 1934 and on the convening of congress in 1935 the matters were called before congress by a special message of the president recommending that action be taken to remedy the evils and abuses of holding companies as shown to exist by this report it was this inquiry and investigation of the federal trade commistion authorized under senate resolution no 83 in 1928 that brought out the evils and abuses of publicutility holding companies and their evil practices and made this legislation imperative to safeguard bona fide stockholders and the consuming public from their impositions but holding companies do not only use their confusing and bewildering strata to take from unsuspecting stockholders and to exact and take from the people but to cover and conceal their property from taxation with other evils and abuses early in 1933 when congress was called in special session the vacant condition of the treasury prompted a senate inquiry of the causes and it was foundthat the great financial interests had not been and were not paying taxes on their earnings and incomes for more than 3 years and it was further found and disclosed under the inquiry of the senate committee that incomes of many corporations were being hidden covered and concealed and taxes due upon these incomes evaded by manipulation and jugglery through the means of holding companies but at that time the senate investigation under resolution no 83 was not complete and no report was made and the matter was postponed and further continued awaiting the completion of the hearing and the report of the facts found the summary report of the federal trade commission among other matters brought to light shows that a publicityutility association was organized prior to 1927 following after the insull plan and referred to in the hearings as the illinois plan for the control of public opinion and legislation in the interests of holding companies up to 1927 over 28 000 000 had been spent by this association annually paid for expenses in obtaining personal contacts with thousands of editors of the country another means of publicity shown followed was by financing a great army of local state and national speakers to present their facts to the public favorable to public holding companies and this extended to great public meetings to churches school and college audiences the following from page 391 of the federal trade commission report referred to is included to show the general character of the investigation conducted and reported upon by the commission the record in this investigation establishes conclusively that the electric and gas utilities since about 1919 have carried on an aggressive countrywide propaganda campaign in it they have made use not only of their own agencies but have enlisted outside organizations in active and often secret aid in it they have literally employed all forms of publicity except skywriting and frequently engaged in efforts to block full expression of opposing views the record shows that this propaganda had for its objective the disparagement of all forms of public ownership and operation of utilities and the preachment of the economy sufficiency and general excellence of the privately owned utilities the record establishes that measured by quantity extent and cost this was probably the greatest peacetime propaganda campaign ever conducted by private interests in this country the record establishes that the activities were carefully considered and planned by responsible heads of the industries numerous declarations and excerpts from minutes and committee reports show clearly that the character and objective of these activities were fully recognized by the sponsors and planners and the director of national electric light association the leading propaganda organization boasted that the public pays the expense often methods of indirect approach were employed and injunctions of secrecy given all of these facts are established by the records of the utilities themselves they are drawn not from adverse or conflicting testimony but from their own documents and declarations"], [0.00875252578407526, 0.00875252578407526, 0, "i am reluctant to inflict myself on the committee at this late hour in the afternoon i am sorry that at least onehalf of the members of the house have not been present to hear the felicitous admixture of politics pinchot and potatoes it was enlightening and interesting to say the least i presume it is proper for me to remain in character and also speak of the humble potato i had no idea when as a barefooted boy i chased the sprightly potato bugs in a potato field and carried cans of paris green that the lowly spud would ever become a national issue but apparently that is the case i want to address myself to that celebrated article of diet for only a moment not so much from the standpoint of the potato bill as from the reciprocal trade agreement between the united states and the netherlands that comes into being on the 15th of february of this year for your information i want to say that the reciprocaltrade agreement with the netherlands contains provisions that will reduce the tariff on 41 itemsthat will bind on the free list some 22 items and retain the existing duty on 1 item it seems rather singular to me that we should reduce the duty on potato dextrine and potato starch and potato flour when a majority of this congress has sanctioned an act to control the production of potatoes by legislation which is penal in character i opposed that measure and can find considerable comfort in the efforts of some of the brethren on the majority side to escape the burdens of that act now however a reciprocaltrade agreement will permit the importation of larger quantities of potato dextrine and potato flour when no one has contended that we do not have manufacturing facilities sufficient for converting our own surplus of potatoes into flour starches and dextrines which can be converted into glue adhesives and sizing so much used in the textile mills instead of regimenting the production of the toothsome spud on the one hand and permitting the derivatives of potatoes such as flour starch and dextrines to come in at reduced rates from foreign countries on the other why not a consistent program of keeping out competitive potato products and expanding the domestic use of our own potato crops still another item in the netherlands treaty is tapioca and cassava starch for years an effort has been made to secure the imposition of a duty of 2 cents per pound on these starches because they are in direct competition with the starches that are or can be derived from americangrown corn that effort failed but to make matters infinitely worse tapioca and cassava starch have been bound on the free list so that it is impossible to secure relief from these competitive products the administration by this treaty provision has in effect stated to the corn processors and corn farmers of this nation not only will we permit these starches to come in free of duty but we will by this treaty give the netherlands our solemn promises to bind them on the free list so that there will be no possibility of congress imposing a protective duty on these items so long as this treaty is in effect in other words we prevail upon our farmers to curtail and adjust their corn acreage for the benefit of the coolie farmers in the netherland west indies how truly the poet spoke when he said consistency thou are a jewel approximately 160 000 000 pounds of tapioca flour come into this country annually and since it is in competition with products of corn that is grown in the corn belt over which we have expressed so much solicitude that we made it a basic commodity in the agricultural adjustment act is it not rather strange is it not rather shortsighted rather visionary that we take all these fertile acres of illinois indiana and nebraska corn land out of cultivation and then open the back door and let these competitive starches hurdle into the country and thereby diminish the industrial outlet for corn grown in this country the same thing is true of other items the same thing is true of gin this treaty will permit holland gin to come into this country at half of the previous duty and what intrigues me most about gin coming from the netherlands is the naive comment made by some gentleman in the state department you will find it on page 32 of the mimeographed copy of the netherlands treaty which was sent to every one of us that gentleman comments in this fashion he says it is not improbable that revenues will increase rather than decrease as a result of a larger importation from the netherlands in competition with gin manufactured in this country and then he says it is not improbable that sales of gin will be attracted away from illegal sources attracted away mind you from those who are illicitly engaged in the bootlegging of gin if you follow that theory out to its logical conclusion then the gentleman might as well say let us pull all the bars down let us invite gin and distilled spirits to come in from every country in the world because the more that comes in the merrier because we will cure the bootlegging evil by following that gentlemans philosophy to its logical conclusion we cannot only put the bootleggers out of business but we will put the legitimate distillers out of business and the farmers out of business and then we can give the country back to the indians and i do not know what the devil they will d3 with it that is the way that theory works out then in connection with wheat and wheat flour that is to be exported from the united states to the netherlands go back and look at the very sanguinary comment in that treaty they say that the netherlands will buy from the united states an amount of wheat flour equal to 5 percent of its consumption provided they can buy our wheat at a price delivered in the netherlands that is world competitive for a grade and quality of wheat that is comparable to our own on a price delivered in the netherlands you have to analyze lxxx56 that finespun joker a little to see how little it means to agriculture if we have to deliver wheat in the netherlands at that price how are we going to do justice to the american farmer and keep the domestic price of wheat up without paying a cash subsidy of 30 cents a bushel in order to take advantage of the treaty provision look at the figures that are available in the various reports from the department of agriculture and you will see that liverpool prices or world prices have been 30 cents per bushel lower than the average price on the six major wheat markets in the united states if the netherlands can buy wheat at 30 cents a bushel cheaper than the price that obtains here on the major wheat markets do you think those folks over there who are motivated by dutch thrift are going to pay us 30 cents more a bushel for our wheat or pay us more for our flour on the basis of wheat that cost them 30 cents a bushel less indeed not that is one of those jokers in the treaty if you please and that is the thing that is given to the country at large to show the beautiful benefits that redound to the country from reciprocal trade agreements it will be interesting to examine the figures of the department of commerce that will disclose in the near future with respect to our trade with cuba under the reciprocal trade agreement they have been holding up cuba as exhibit a we shall find these two points of interest in connection with that treaty in the first place a treaty with cuba is not on the same foundation as any other treaty it is not on an unconditional mostfavorednation basis canada the netherlands switzerland and all other countries cannot have the benefits that may accrue to cuba or conversely because we do not have that status with cuba that we have with other nations that is one thing the second is that while our exports to cuba will probably show an increase of about 15 000 000 the imports from cuba to the united states will probably show an increase of about 37 000 000 there is exhibit a in this great program of reciprocal trade treaties and you can take it for what it is worth i submit to you that the reciprocaltrade agreements are not going to do anything for the american farmer but they are going to do plenty to him before they get through it is always a fair question as to what is to be done about foreign trade and its rehabilitation if reciprocal trade agreements are wrong in principle and in practice it is a fair question as to how the export markets for agriculture are to be regained the answer of course is a program of selective imports together with tariff reductions only where they are specific advantages it offers the only method of expanding our foreign trade in basic agricultural commodities and at the same time preserving our american markets it is the old system of barter on an international scale we can say to any and all nations with whom we seek to build up foreign trade you buy certain specific items from us to a given amount and we will in return buy certain specific items from you to a like amount such a system has the advantage of protecting our markets against an influx of foreign goods which tend to deprive the american farmer and american industry of its own needed markets and also protects the american worker against the dumping of goods made in countries where a low standard of living and a lowwage scale prevails it is if you please the philosophy that has been expounded by mr george peek the first administrator of the a a a and whether it is feasible and practical or not can best be judged from the fact that great britain has rebuilt her foreign trade to a higher level than any other nation on the face of the earth in the last 2 years by simply following that principle since the provisions of the netherlands treaty the swiss treaty the canadian treaty and all other trade treaties are available alike to every nation with whom we have an unconditional mostfavorednation status it will be but a little while until this country may become a veritable dumping grcund for cheap goods since

15 years and am a member of the farm bureau federation and the national grange i believe in placing my countrys welfare above that of my party and i recognize that the welfare of the southland and the

people and the stability of our country recovery under the new deal is a myth and a mirage backed by propaganda over the radio and billions of dollars out of the treasury the failure of the newdeal measures was inevitable because they were economically unsound unworkable and a form of imported state socialism that does not thrive in america the southern cotton states received a temporary benefit through the federal governments attempts to peg cotton prices at 12 cents by use of loans but the temporary benefits from the unsound newdeal measures have emanated from the brain trust pied pipers secretary of agriculture henry a wallace and under secretary rexford guy tugwell who are leading the cotton planters on to their financial and economic destruction and the south along with them the 25percent reduction of cotton crops under the dlctation of the a a a has increased unemployment in the south and has already brought ruin and misery to the tenant farmers and sharecroppers the rapidly vanishing foreign markets for our cotton surplus is a direct menace to the wellbeing and economic interests of all southern cotton states the situation is far too serious to ignore any longer and is attributable to the socialistic newdeal policies which bring havoc and ruin wherever these brain trust experiments are tried out what does it profit the cotton states to have temporary artificial increases in the price of cotton by the manipulations of the a a a and wake up to find that our foreign markets have been lost last year our cotton exports declined over 2 000 000 bales and it is much worse this season already our cotton exports have fallen off under 2 years of the newdeal experiments by 50 percent the lord only knows what will happen in the next 2 years if these mirages are still pursued encouraged by the 25percent reduction of cotton and the 12cent price in the united states egypt brazil soviet russia india china and north africa have increased their production by 3 000 000 bales and are rapidly taking away the world markets from us which once lost will be difficult to regain no wonder thoughtful business men in the south are beginning to turn against the new deal when they see ruin staring them in the face increased unemployment impoverished tenant farmers more on the relief rolls and a huge financial and economic loss annually is what the south is facing as the cotton export trade steadily decreases the united states exported in normal years approximately 8 000 000 bales of cotton these exports have declined by more than half and the tragedy of the situation is that they are dwindling away while the new dealers fiddle and zig zag from right to left but never in any sound direction the tugwells and the ezekiels and the other brain trusters are engaged in a dance of death with the cotton planters to the detriment of the south there is less cotton being exported than at any time since the civil war and as a result of the loss of our cotton exports hundreds of thousands of clerks and other employees engaged in ginning compressing transporting shipping and in warehouses and mills have lost their jobs whereas the a a a program of reduction of the cotton crops may help some cotton farmers there are millions of people in the south directly and indirectly adversely affected as are all consumers the southern shipping ports of charleston savannah norfolk mobile new orleans memphis and galveston are all suffering from the rapid decline in our cotton exports thanks to the plowing under of crops by the a a a the economy of scarcity and restriction is reaping its own whirlwind of disastrous consequences and evil fruits through importation of shiploads of grain and meat from south america butter from new zealand and cheese from denmark i was advised by the department of agriculture this morning that since last july 10 000 000 bushels of oats have been imported to compete with the oats produced in the south and southwest 8 000 000 bushels of barley and 7 000 000 bushels of corn and 6 000 000 bushels of rye in addition 16 000 000 bushels of wheat have been imported whereas we have only exported 3 000 000 bushels and the equivalent of 12 000 000 in flour leaving the united states unbelievable as it may sound a net importer of wheat with the duty at 42 centsa crop like cotton which has been reduced by government regulations i am opposed to the governmental policy of restriction and scarcity when there are 12 000 000 unemployed americans and 23 000 000 on the relief rolls if the government is right that a policy of producing less makes for wealth and prosperity then it must follow that producing next to nothing would make us fabulously wealthy the wand wavers and magic performers at washington in addition to undermining and destroying the principles of jeffersonian democracy will by their costly blunders and crazyquilt experiments if continued for 2 more years ruin and wreck the economic

reasonable profit and to the preservation of both the domestic and foreign markets through sound and fair policies and not through lowering or destroying the standards of living and wages of the american people in the limited time at my disposal let me discuss briefly another phase of the cotton situation the textile mills of north and south carolina virginia tennessee georgia and alabama are all being seriously handicapped from the competition of japanese cotton goods in the philippines colombia cuba haiti and central america the actual japanese importations of cotton goods into the united states is taking on alarming proportions and will force the cotton mills of both the north and south to shut down and thereby increase the ranks of the unemployed i charge the administration through the visionary freetrade policies of secretary of state hull with being responsible for helping to wreck and destroy the textile industry of the south one of its greatest sources of wealth and employment already the gross stupidities and blunders of the state department in a visionary and totally impractical attempt to break down economic barriers throughout the world has sacrificed the textile industry americas second largest industry on the altar of free trade to the japanese the time has come to tell the truth and place the responsibility where it belongson the shoulders of president roosevelt and his freetrade secretary of state cordell hull it must be selfevident that american labor cannot compete with skilled japanese labor paid 20 cents a day and operating modern textile plants equipped for mass production however secretary hull true to his freetrade principles and longdistance policies which will take effect after the southern mills have been destroyed and its labor ruined is deaf dumb and blind to the welfare and interests of the american textile industry which employs 400 000 industrious and loyal american citizens the south is vitally interested and its welfare is at stake how long will its people continue to remain silent in face of the economic insanity of the administration to illustrate how far this administration will carry its freetrade policy without regard to the interests of american labor it turned down 6 months ago an offer of the philippine congress to grant adequate protection to american textiles as against japanese because it would interfere with the visionary principles and longdistance policies of the administration thus we have practically lost through the inexcusable and almost traitorous action of the state department our single greatest export market for our textiles last december japan controlled 75 percent of the textile imports into the philippines and we controlled less than 25 percent whereas 2 years ago it was just the reverse another 6 months of state department blunders and our philippine textile trade will be wiped out what has happened in the philippines has also taken place in cuba colombia the dominican republic haiti and the rest of central and south america where we exported previously most of our textile products however that is not the entire story because japanese cotton

1934 unless the shipment of japanese goods into the united states is stopped one textile mill after another in both the north and south will be compelled to shut down throwing american labor into the

"under the leave to extend my remarks in the record i include the following radio address delivered by me on january 15 over the national broadcasting system nothing could more accurately define the

second year of the roosevelt administration facing serious economic difficulties nor can there be any denial of the equally obvious fact that these difficulties have constantly become more serious during the past 18 months eleven and onehalf million industrial wage earners are in the ranks of the unemployed onehalf million more than a year ago the true and final test of recovery is the number of men put back to work judged by this test the experiments of the present administration are condemned approximately 19 000 000 individuals are dependent in whole or in part upon public relief an increase of 5 000 000 over a year ago the cost of relief borne by the federal government has been constantly increasing a year ago according to the latest report of the federal relief administration it was expending 70 000 000 a month for public relief this has increased to 170 000 000more than double in addition during the last 6 months we have expended 200 000 000 on the c c c camps an increase of 47 000 000 over last year the department of agriculture has expended strictly for relief purposes wholly apart from its agricultural adjustment benefits 70 000 000 this increase in unemployment and the number dependent upon public relief has taken place in face of the fact that during the last 18 months this administration has expended 11 000 000 000 on its socalled recovery program in making this lavish expenditure it has been expending 2 15 for every 1 it collected has run our government 6 000 000 000 in the hole and increased our interestbearing public debt by 7 000 000 000 until today it is higher than it was at the close of the world war in addition to having unlimited funds at its disposal the administration has had equally unlimited power by reason of the last congress making the office of the chief executive a dictatorship under the plea of emergency and at the request of the president the failure of the socalled recovery program cannot therefore be charged to lack of money or lack of authority it has failed because it ran counter to every economic law to every tradition of the american people to common sense and human nature the administration has preached recovery but practiced destruction it urged private industry to go ahead and take up the slack of unemployment it then made such revival impossible first by putting the federal government in competition with private industry and second by taking from private industry all voice in the management of its affairs through various instruments of federal regimentation it deliberately and without cause abandoned the gold standard debased our currency and started tinkering with our monetary system making it impossible to tell what the value of the dollar will be next month or in 6 months it has persisted in a program of wild expenditures uncontrolled and nonaudited until according to president roosevelts own definition prior to election the credit of our nation is threatened and economic recovery made impossible by reason of these expenditures plus its flirtation with fiatmoney advocates in order to gain votes the administration has pushed the government to the very door of wild inflationwhich would wreck our entire economic structure and render all investments valueless under such circumstances prudent men do not make longtime investments or plan new expenditures industry dares not expand it dares not tie up too much money in raw material business dares not carry large inventories it must live from hand to mouth capital goes into hiding those with savings must husband their every resource in other words our entire economic system has been paralyzed by the experimental policies of the new deal the thing which more vitally concerns business and industry today is the refusal of the roosevelt administration to profit by its mistakesindeed its refusal to admit it has made mistakes or that its 2year experimental program is a near failure another shock to business is that the administration has even abandoned the hope it entertained a year ago of eventually balancing our budget apparently it has also abandoned any real desire to do so for it possesses both the power and the machinery to accomplish that purpose if it so willed yet in the face of this record the administration is asking congress for the additional colossal sum of 4 000 000 000 purely for further experiments without any known definite plan insofar as the public or congress is aware for its expenditure the administration is asking that the president be permitted this sum of money without any restrictions being imposed upon the purposes or methods of its expenditure such a request is contrary not only to all precedents regardless of whether the republicans or democrats control congress but it is contrary to the entire theory of our government which places the control of the raising and expenditure of public funds in the hands of the legislative branch of the government before congress appropriates any such sum it should be furnished a fairly definite program as to the objects upon which the money is to be spent surely the administration must have such a program to have arrived at that sum certainly the congress and the people are entitled to be informed of that program if on the other hand the administration has no definite plans for the expenditure of an additional 4 000 000 000 for socalled emergency purposes after nearly 2 years of planning then it should not be granted such a sum of money the logical conclusion is that notwithstanding the presidents statement at the opening of congress of his desire to cooperate with the congress he is not willing to cooperate he is not willing to trust the members of his own party for they are in absolute control of both branches of congress and by this same action he indicates he is not willing to trust the taxpayers with advance information as to how he intends to expend another 4 000 000 000 of their money is this money to be expended this year or next is it to be expended putting the government still further in competitive private business if so in what lines is the government going to compete does anyone believe this threat held over american business is going to put any more men back on private pay rolls i for one certainly do not think so we should also remember that next year there is a presidential campaign and election and there is always the possibility that the expenditure of immense federal funds in close congressional districts and states might easily play an even more important part in the decision of that election than it played in the decision in the congressional elections of last november the administration still refuses to attempt to stabilize the value of the american dollar it announces its purpose of making permanent the multitude of alphabetical bureaus brought into being by executive order and which have existed only to harass private enterprise it persists in its policy of using public works as a political weapon to reward its friends and punish its enbmies as witness the recent refusal of the public works administrator mr ickes to allocate funds to a 43 000 000 project for new york city until and unless robert moses recently republican candidate for governor of new york resigns from his position in the new york city administration this demand has been made in order to satisfy a personal and political grudge upon the part of the roosevelt administration the administration announces its determination to continue its policy of

asking for an investigation regarding the farmers who have come to washington to voice their approval of what this administration has done for them in relieving in a measure the plight into which the previous administration had placed them criticism was also voiced in this house against our great president and against the a a a program by the eminent and distinguished gentleman from new york the honorable hamilton fish jr whose name has been mentioned as a potential republican candidate for the presidency in 1936 it is in regard to these two incidents that i wish to direct my remarks at this time i do this for the reason that i deem it an insult a disgrace and a shame to question the motives of and reasons why these farmers have come to washington at this time both the resolution in the senate and the remarks of the gentleman from new york carry the insinuation that these farmers are a bunch of hayseeds and hicks from out in the sticks who do not know what they want and who can be led as a rabble in the name of our american farmers i resent this insinuation i come from an agricultural state i know these farmers i have lived among them all my life i am one of them i understand their language their needs and their difficulties which i believe the gentleman from new york does not for if he did he would not have made the speech he delivered in my state on may 7 1935 and which was so ably answered by my colleague here this afternoon our farmers of the great agricultural section come from fine sturdy pioneer stock they have inherited that sense of honesty integrity and industry that has contributed so much to the winning and upbuilding of the great middle west these farmers represent a splendid class of our american citizenship they are well educated keen and intelligent they know what they want you find in these middle western states of illinois iowa missouri kansas nebraska wisconsin minnesota and other neighboring states some of the finest agricultural colleges and universities in the country our university of nebraska has 10 000 students not to mention those thousands of students throughout the state who are enrolled in our normal schools and denominational colleges these farmers who have come to washington are the flower of our people it is true that they cannot dress in the elegant style of those who come from the capitalistic plutocratic class of the favored east but their worth and value lies beneath their outward attire i am glad that the distinguished gentleman from new york mentioned the ananias clubs i recall that last fall in the campaign the republican spellbinders in the east told the voters there that the consumer was paying the processing tax but out in my state the western spellbinders told the farmers that the farmer was paying the processing tax i wonder which of these two groups would be more eligible to membership in mr fishs ananias club repeatedly misstatements have been made on the floor of this house and by the press in regard to imports of farm products these statements were either made in ignorance of the real facts or they were deliberately designed to discredit the administrations farm program i called attention to this fact in a statement i made on the floor of the house april 16 1935 i am glad that the president called a spade a spade years ago when i was in new york city i was greatly impressed by the very evident and prevailing opinion among some new yorkers that there was nothing worth while west of the hudson river some of the representatives of the capitalistic and reactionary groups in the east do not understand the west this was plainly manifested when the eminent gentleman from new york by the use of the g 0 p pulmotor tried to inject life into the cold corpse of the grand old party when he spoke at omaha nebr our farmersare too wise to fall for such bunk they remember the time when they got 10 cents per bushel for their corn and 25 cents for their wheat investigate these farmers by a senatorial resolution nonsense it would be laughable were it not so pathetic did the gentlemen from the east ask for an investigation when the united states chamber of commerce the steel industries the farmmachinery manufacturing interests or the shipping interests lobbied no never did you hear a chirp from them then but now when the american farmer for the first time is coming into his own they howl wolf these farmers did not come to criticize or ask for anything they came to express their gratitude for what this administration has done for them they paid their own expenses out of their own pockets city and country alike were interested in this expression of good will they came here to see their government in action and to voice their approval what will these farmers think of the speech of the gentleman from new york and the resolution introduced in the senate these farmers stated in no unmistakable terms last fail where they stood and they will make their position clear again they are wise to the tricks of the reactionaries they know how they were fooled by the special interests how they were drained all these years by the eastern protected industrialists how they were compelled to sell the products of their labor in the open world market they know how big business and the big banks exploited them until their backs broke under the unequal load they know how by the premeditated and designed curtailment of credit our small country banks were forced to the wall so that from 1920 to 1932 we had over 10 800 bank failures in the united states while in canada there were only 3 and in england there were none no these farmers are not so dumb they know who is who in the political world we should rejoice with them that they are again hopeful and are ambitious to carry on even though it be under great odds the country should have learned by this time that empty farmers pocketbooks will not turn the wheels of
