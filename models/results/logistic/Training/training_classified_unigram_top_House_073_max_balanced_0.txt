important economic measure to be introduced here for many years indeed it is said by more than a few authorities and in the press that it is the most important monetary legislation since the civil war i am for this bill i am for it because it is an administration measure and i am pledged to my constituents to support all administration legislation and thus give force and meaning to the new deal insofar as that is within my power but there is another reason this measure is one which goes to the very fundamentals of monetary theory it is not a subject which can be or indeed should be debated indefinitely within this chamber the technicalities involved make it impossible for those of us who have not spent a lifetime in the study of money and its allied problems to pass final judgment upon its provisions that is work for experts it is their duty and not the prerogative of the layman this bill which so deeply affects the economic life of our nation has been submitted to congress for its approval by the president or upon his recommendation it has behind it the studied judgment of experts men who have for years given their close attention to the problems involved out of that experience have come the conclusions which are embodied in this measure upon the experience of these men the president has drawn adding i am sure recommendations and advice of his own he has no doubt tempered their academic suggestions witl less rigid opinions in the interests of the whole people and so the bill has come to us from the administration as its best judgment on the disease which it seeks to cure farreaching beneficial results are predicted for this bill this is the opinion of the president and his advisors and i am sure that the same opinion of it is held by many of my colleagues on this floor on both sides of the aisle it is difficult for me to understand how any member of this body can attempt with any degree of certainty as i regret to say some have to flatly contradict the predictions and expectations set forth by the president and his advisors true men may differ but in the end there can be no one who can i feel conscientiously say that this measure attempts anything but the greatest good for the greatest number of people this measure is a very definite and very courageous attempt as i see it to break away from the cold and insensible control of the money changers it appears and appears with some clarity that the principal opposition to this measure arises from that quarter this measure upsets the dogmas the inflexible beliefs and precepts of that very nearly discredited section of our population in their anger at what they consider an unwarranted intrusion upon their preserves they condemn this measure as direct inflation wild inflation burglarizing the vaults of the federal reserve banks and as a long step toward the printing of greenbacks all of which they point out must be accompanied by financial chaos the only prediction assertion or allegation they make in connection with this bill that i consider bears any semblance of accuracy is their prediction of the dire results that would follow wild inflation by which is meant starting the printing presses when they point out the disaster that follows the indiscriminate printing of money they are right but that is the only point they make that seems to me worthy of recognition they confuse the issue they seem to be attempting to obscure the merits and mislead the public with their assertions of impending disaster if this bill is passed they have it would appear neither read the bill nor turned an intelligent ear to editorial and expert opinion which has appeared in print since this bill was made public by its introduction here nor i might add have they interpreted with any intention of understanding the presidents message to this congress when he requested that such legislation be passed had they read the bill or the adequate explanations of it that have been available for days they would not make the regrettable mistake of talking about wild inflation in connection with this legislation if there is any man in or out of this chamber who after conscientiously studying this measure can point to any section of it which can be construed as authority for starting the printing presses on an orgy of paper and ink i should like to hear him speak as to the dangerous inflationary tendencies of this bill i should like to call the attention of this house to the remarks of the man who is perhaps closer to the president in matters of monetary policy than all others this man is prof george f warren of cornell university professor warren is admittedly one of the presidents principal advisors on money matters perhaps you have noticed that professor warren has in the opposition press been referred to consistently as a dairy expert from cornell that characterization of professor warren is meant to belittle him as a monetary adviser to the administration it is an attempt gentlemen to make it appear that professor warren is not qualified to advise the president and the treasury of the united states on the highly technical and difficult problems involved in money and the management of the national currency the attempt to discredit professor warren by implication and innuendo by leaving unmentioned those marks in his career which would indicate his qualification to advise the president and the treasury in this matter has i am sure created an unfortunate impression in the minds of many persons who must depend upon the opposition press for their knowledge of current affairs i do not wish to digress but i feel that i should set forth at this time a clearer picture of professor warren for the benefit of those members of this body who may have been misled by repeated reference to this man as a dairy expert who is advising the president on monetary affairs professor warren has made a study of commodity prices and gold their effect upon each other and consequently upon the living and working conditions of every man woman and child in the country this is not to say that professor warren is an infallible authority on the subjects upon which he has spent years of study no man can point a definite an absolute path out of the economic forest into which the money changers have led us but i assert that a man who has devoted 15 or 17 years of intensive study research and thought to certain prob lems is surely qualified to speak to advise with authority upon the opinions which he has derived from his labors that as i see it is the position of professor warren and if the press generally had been more conscientious and less indifferent to the background from which professor warren speaks there would not be any feeling of uncertainty or doubt as to the qualifications of this perhaps chief of the presidents monetary advisers there is nothing secretive or mysterious about professor warrens theories i shall not take the time of the house to discuss them now but i would suggest that any man who wishes to inform himself as to the basis for professor warrens thought on monetary subjects purchase a copy of prices written by professor warren there he will find the whole thing explained now then i return to the money changers and their opposition to this bill and their talk of wild inflation professor warren appeared before the senate banking and currency committee to testify as to his opinion of the roosevelt monetary policy as outlined by the president in his message to congress last january 15 and as given concrete form in the measure now before this body to anyone who had any doubts as to professor warrens attitude toward direct or wild inflation his testimony before the senators must have erased any questions they had in mind as well as comforted them no end professor warren is upon his own word an opponent of wild inflation to the senators he presented a scholarly and factual account of his theory and its effects to date as reflected in its adoption by the administration but first let me quote professor warrens reply to inferences that certain monetary policies would lead to wild inflation he had gone far back in history to trace monetary conditions practices and results professor warren said occasions of extreme inflation have been preceded by government bankruptcy and revolution or war if we drifted into wild inflation it would be an unusual historical event unless we had a revolutioni mean a violent revolution those gentlemen are the words of the presidents monetary expert they are plain words plainly spoken it would indeed be difficult i am sure for any member of this body to believe that professor warren is a champion of wild inflation after reading this testimony and now i turn to the socalled 60cent dollar which is to become an actuality under this measure when it is finally passed by the congress i say 60cent dollar more accurately i should say a 50 to 60cent dollar i might also say and not be indulging my fancy an honest dollar the attempt has been made by opponents of this plan to frighten the citizens into believing that cutting the dollar in half will double prices and so increase 100 percent their cost of living it is almost ludicrous to consider such propaganda it seems to me that a man any man facing the issue honestly and intelligently would see at first glance that it is impossible that this administration or any other for that matter could possibly recommend legislation that would bankrupt every wage and salary earner in the land that is what would happen if prices doubled if the expenses of home of farm and of factory doubled over night with the revaluation of the dollar downward by 50 percent the money changers gentlemen were never smart they were never intelligent they were merely traders upon the credulity of the american people their currency was deceit they raised themselves to a position which by its very height seemed to necessitate our looking up to them their fine phrases and graceful gestures financial did i regret to say deceive us tragically we believed that these men who stood upon an economic and financial eminence deserved our respect and admiration then gentlemen we discovered to our sorrow and to their disgrace that their feet were in the mire and the eminence upon which they seemed to stand was no more than a flimsy frame disguised with gilt and cheaper trappings there is no man who rises to eminence in his chosen field by honor and the cemmon virtues but for whom i have the highest respect there are many bankers no doubt many business men and financiers who have at least tried to abide by a code of common decency but gentlemen the greatest of them have been found unfortunately to be no better in their business relations than the most brazen thug these men are now seeking to regain their former illusory reputations they are seeking once more a hold upon us such as they enjoyed with immunity before therefore it behooves us and it is the duty of every member of this congress regardless of the side of the aisle upon which he finds himself to examine closely scrupulously and patiently the statements that these men are now making in an attempt to discredit the efforts of the president and his administration in the present issue as i see it this bill seeks to wrest from wall street and the practitioners therein the rights of the citizens of this country that wall street preempted in the days of our questionable prosperitythe right of the people to control through the president his advisors and the congress the money which is the blood of their edonomic existence the 50 to 60cent dollar is i believe designed to return to the people a currency which is within their reach it is an attempt to give them a currency with which to pay their bills and buy their bread that is the currency in which they contracted their debts is their any justice in the position of a debtor who contracted a debt perhaps for a home by pledging dollars worth 100 cents and finding when the debt becomes due that he must pay in a dollar worth 150 cents i dare say that none here will support such injustice such inequality i referred a moment ago to the fact that it appears to be the desire of the opponents of this measure particularly those who have found 150cent dollars so profitable to convey the impression that prices will double under this bill here again a very superficial examination of the facts existing today effectively answers these purveyors of misconception the day upon which the president sent his monetary message to congress the dollar was quoted at approximately 60 cents in the foreignexchange markets sixty cents gentlemen is the upper limit at which the president would set the value of the dollar the recent months of application of the warren theories may be said generally to have brought the dollar to the 60cent level what does that mean to the objectors who talk about doubled prices it means simply this that the dollar already is within easy walking distance you might say of the point at which the president will devalue it in other words it is not now a 100cent or 150cent dollar that is to be devalued it is a 60cent a 61 or 62cent dollar that is to get the presidents attention under this measure that in turn means that devaluation cannot proceed more than another 10 cents and that i contend will not cannot by any stretch of the imagination double prices to the consumer or even approach such a condition the dollar has been devalued already to nearly the limit asked in this bill and i think that that point should be emphasized prices have risen since the warren theories were put to the test that was necessary it is necessary that they increase further for it is upon an increase in prices prices to the farmer in particular that the success of the new deal depends make no mistake gentlemen about this price business prices must go up but they must go up honestly it is the profiteers price the price exacted of us by the greedy merchant financier and business man that we must guard against and it is the intention indeed it is in many instances the accomplished fact of this administration that the greedy have been abruptly checked in pursuing their greedy ends by unjustly raising prices from june to december of last year under the roosevelt administrations gold and money policy the cost of living index rose 5 percent however all you have to do is look about you to see that the improvement in unemployment conditions in business and our economic condition generally has greatly exceeded 5 percent in other words gentlemen if you were earning 20 per week would you not be willing to spend an additional dollar on your living expenses to help restore to this country the conditions which president roosevelt and his administration seek to give us i think you would i think you could make no better investment nor one about which you should complain less in connection with this point i quote the words of professor warren in the matter of current prices and their reflection in wages and salaries he says for instance any person working on a salary and not given extreme cuts would be faring better under revaluation than before the depression any person who is getting his 1929 salary has much more now than then but not so much as last february now then i come to the business of seizing the gold in the vaults of the federal reserve banks on this point we hear the opponents shouting about stealing somebodys gold when the treasury takes over this gold the united states government is not going to run away with it and in that it will be somewhat different than some of our money changers the gold will be placed in safekeeping in the vaults of the united states treasury where it is to remain as the solid sound backing of the paper money that passes through our hands this gold will not by some mysterious trick of the hand or some strange chemical reaction be changed into dust or worthless substance it will still be gold it will still exist in fact and it will be in the honest hands of your government the word seizure in connection with the process of transferring title of this gold from the federal reserve banks to the united states treasury is perhaps misleading by seizure we are prone to believe that the property is being summarily taken without payment or compensation of any kind this is not what is proposed under this measure what the treasury takes it will pay for it will pay the federal reserve banks with gold certificates yellow backs as we knew them when we used to see them in circulation or when those fortunate enough to earn them possessed a few these gold certificates will be used by the federal reserve banks as backing for their currency issues providing the treasury authorizes such issuance by transferring title to this goldand i can think of no place it will be safer or more judiciously employed than by the federal governmentby transferring title a certain profit will accrue to the federal government a profit of several billions of dollars this is due to the fact that the treasury will pay the federal reserve banks the statutory price of 20 67 per ounce for the banks gold and will value it for its own purposes at the current market price set by the treasury which is considerably higher than the statutory figure this proceeding is attacked as unfair the opponents contending that the holder of the gold should be paid the higher price it seems to me that the value of a commodity is largely determined by what it will bring in the market place there can hardly be any other adequate measure the only person who may purchase this vast gold reserve is the federal treasury the treasury offers 20 67 per ounce which is the price set by the law it is a price long established it is the price upon which the holders of that gold based their purchases though they may have paid more for it but they have used this gold many years now they have that is the money changers have played with the nations gold too long they have taken profits vast profits with their gold policies the government proposes to pay the base price for this commodity perhaps the government would like to pay more the government is not out to hurt peoples feelings or crush their pocketbooks but there is not an unlimited choice here gentlemen and the government is doing what it thinks best for all the people and not what the golden few would like the president proposes to set up out of the profits of this title transfer what will be known as an equalization fund this fund is to be used in the support of our position in the hard mart of international exchange but that is not all it is apparent and it is also the opinion of the president that the money changers have sought by crude and obstructionist tactics to force down the price of government fecurities such as government bonds they have done this by dumping them on the market and so depressing the price they have not done this through any honest conviction that the value of these bonds is endangered or that they have actually lost value they have done it gentlemen in a directand brazen attempt to frustrate the administrations monetary policies because those policies did not suit their selfish purposes these traders realize that the safest obligation in the country is an obligation of the united states treasury they know that this is the general belief all right they say then we will drive down the prices of these bonds and people will become frightened and think there is really cause to be alarmed at the credit or security of the government by this means these financial buzzards seek to bring pressure indirectly upon the administration pressure that they cannot exert openly or directly and they cannot assert it openly or directly gentlemen because the administration has no sympathy or confidence in such discredited traders so part of this equalization fund the strength of which will be the strength of 2 000 000 000 will be used for the purchase of our own government obligations at any time that these men ee fit to play their dumping game two billion dollars is pressure that they cannot meet the treasury will take any and all the pressure these men can applyand gentlemen the treasury can take it the purchase of these securities when and if offered in this wall street manner will keep their price up where that price belongs as a true measure of the treasurys credit and so the administration plans once more to defeat the tactics of the street in its international application the equalization fund will be used to control the price of our dollar in foreign markets england has an equalization fund for this purpose that is for the purpose of controlling the price of the pound sterling france is generally believed to work through the bank 6f france for the same control of the franc up to now we have not had adequate instruments to meet the challenges of france and england in the international exchange market under this bill we have our fund is larger than britains i hope that it will not be necessary to use it ruthlessly and it is the presidents hope and i see no reason why it should not be realized that armed with this fund he will be able to exert such a powerful influence in the exchange market that world stabilization of currencies will become a fact that is the goal endless fighting back and forth in the money market will do no country good and will engender much hard feeling the president proposes to put an end to this bickering this fencing with money but he has not been in a position to do so but this bill is intended to equip this country to step into the market and bring order out of chaos by stabilizing the currencies of the world world trade will be promoted world economy strengthened and world peace promoted the president has repeatedly asserted that it is his ambition that we may be brought to a position where we may enjoy a more abundant life it is my belief that this bill will further that ambition it

introduced and passed in the house a bill imposing a small income tax here but this bill also died in the senate the mapes committee showed that for the past 10 years the tax on gasoline in the district of columbia was only 2 cents per gallon while in virginia the tax is 5 cents on the gallon and in tennessee the tax is 7 cents on the gallon so it introduced and passed in the house a bill to impose an additional 1 cent per gallon tax on gasoline and this bill died in the senate the mapes committee showed that in the district of columbia there is a flat rate of 1 registration fee on all

bill to impose a registration fee on automobiles here in washington comparable to the lowest fee charged in any of the 48 states but this bill also died in the senate the mapes committee showed that the tax rate in the district of columbia was only 1 70 on the 100 on real and personal property with an exemption of 1 000 allowed on household furniture and a rate on intangible property of only 50 cents on the 1 000 while in the city of boston mass the tax rate was 2 92 on the 100 and that the citizens of milwaukee a city comparable in size to washington pay 70 percent more taxes than do the

this statement whenever we make it possible to nego tiate trade agreements then countries that are not producing oil will be able to sell or trade us something for our oil and we will be able to carry

the world that we expect to ask for our citizens the same consideration that is given to others we cannot hope to produce and sell surplus of many of the products of this land in the future at present there are a great many articles on the free list if i am correctly advised there is no method other than by legislation to levy a duty on such items in taking into consideration the various proceedings that enter into a trade i have always been of the opinion that the more freedom an agency could have the better the result that could be obtained and for this reason i raised the question in the committee as to whether or not this legislation could directly deal with those articles that are now coming in free of duty the answer was given that the establishment of quotas would solve the situation thus making it possible if the president so desired to refuse to enter into an agreement which would allow any article to come into the united states which in my opinion is a distinct advantage to all the people and especially the cotton farmers as the time may come when other countries will levy high duties on export cotton and unless we have some way to meet the situation this

that before concluding the president shall seek advice and information from certain activities of the government and further from such other sources as he may deem proper when the distinguished

regardless of party affiliations regardless of profession is intensely interested namely the future of american agriculture i know that my esteemed colleague from ohio who just addressed you is vitally interested in that subject because for years he has owned and operated one of the large dairy farms in northern ohio a year ago or approximately a year ago this congress enacted a law that we thought would solve this ageold riddle of agricultural pauperism as a matter of fact since 1926 the congress of the united states has shown itself at all times ready and willing to pass measures that the majority of farm leaders decided was in their best interests i say 1926 because it was in that year that the first mcnaryhaugen bill was passed by both branches of the congress and again in 1927 as we are debating the department of agriculture appropriation bill which carries the largest appropriations ever budgeted for this department and as we observe this mammoth agricultural edifice known as the department of agriculture which is not yet completed and then as we go to our respective districts throughout the united states and observe the great devastation that has been wrought on american farms buildings with roofs rusting and falling in fences going down the inability of farmers to pay their taxes the number of foreclosures that are still in evidence amounting to nearly 500 a month in my state of ohio as we observe these two propositions these two organizations we might well in wonderment ask the question are these huge appropriations year after year justified by the results and the needs that are attained may we now draw a comparison to use a homely oldfashioned illustration there are men within the sound of my voice whom i know in the past have been breeders of beef cattle and some of them are breeders today they will all tell you that to raise a bull calf that can compete successfully in the show ring the calf must not only nurse his own mother but he must have a dairy cow usually in addition which is known as a nurse cow in the end the bull calf comes out fat and sleek and is a good show animal but his own mother and the nurse cow are very thin and emaciated may not that comparison apply to american agriculture while the real farm plant a profitable plant until 1921 has been going down year by year steadily depreciating in value the bureaucracy in washington and which permeates every state in this union from washington has been steadily building up its own selfish plant that plant my friends is not manned by actual farmers i know of no other institution department or branch of government that is not manned by men who have had the benefit of years of actual experience in their own particular line of business or work therefore i should like to say today that in my own mind there exists a very grave question of doubt as to the ultimate success of the legislation that we have enacted here as to its pulling the farmer out of the slough of bankruptcy and depression in which he has wallowed for the past 12 or 13 years as prima facie evidence of the justification of that doubt i want to give to you the basic schedule of price levels that we were told 1 year ago would be restored by the enactment of the farm relief bill the basic price levels that were given then for seven commodities are as follows cotton 12 9 cents wheat 91 9 cents corn 66 8 cents hogs 7 53 cents cattle 5 41 cents butter fat 26 7 almost 27 cents a pound lambs 6 14 cents now you members of this house of representatives can use your own minds your own impressions and observations to detemine whether or not those price levels have become an actuality"], [0.0001036524772644043, 0.5001036524772644, 1, "i was rather interested and amused at the efforts to make the promise of the democratic party platform to do away with the saloon a logical promise to my mind it is the one statement in the democratic platform that cannot be made a logical reasonable statement because in the first place as has been suggested there is no definition of a saloon and in the second place from our knowledge of the history of human nature i do not believe it would be possible to do away with either a saloon or something to take the place of a saloon as long as we are going to have drinking of alcoholic beverages there are three classes of people who drink one is the man who takes liquor for medicine another is the psychopathic who takes a bottle of liquor and goes off to himself somewhere and drinks to intoxication and the other class comprises the great bulk of people who drink for sociability purposes this class includes those people who realize or feel that they have in themselves an inhibiting wall about themselvesa product of civilized development that they want temporarily to remove they wish temporarily to retrograde a littleto let go to go on the loose these people gather together in order to know each other better in order to inculcate a higher degree of sociability they drink not to excess but just for social purposes they must have some place to do this it is far better to have it in some place that is under reasonable control than it is to compel them as was done during the prohibition era to go to a hotel and there drink to excess under conditions that the people participating did not really desire we can call such a place a saloon or a grocery or a barber shop or anything else but as long as men drink to promote sociability you will never do away with sociability you will never do away with some gathering place to drink you might just as well talk about removing the rear end of a train in order to do away with rearend collisions the social gathering place psychologically and from the history of the human race is so much wrapped up in the whole problem of drinking that to do away with one you have to do away with the other and we have already found out that you cannot do away with the drinking"]]}
