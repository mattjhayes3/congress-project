interest to this roundtable discussion or running tariff debate this afternoon in a consideration of tariff rates that affect business and commerce of this country at the ports of entry and i have been wondering whether the gentlemen who have talked so readily and ably upon the question of the tariff on imports from foreign countries have awakened to a realization that they are talking about a bear in the woods while there is a snake at their feet ready to bite them i want to talk this afternoon for just a little while on a tariff at home that is even more destructive of the commerce of this country than either the smoothawley bill or the hoovergrundy tariff act or both of them combined notwithstanding their wellknown iniquities i have reference to the freight rates upon the railroads of this country in my district the principal industry is coal and being interested in the subject of coal and the transportation of it to the markets of the middle west and the northwest where it is consumed by the constituents of my friend from wisconsin and by my friend from michigan and others in the northwestern states as well as my ohio colleagues i asked the interstate commerce commission to furnish to me a statement showing the freight rates on coal from the kentucky fields and the west virginia fields to the lake ports before i put in the record that certificate showing the table of rates i call attention to the fact that some of the best highclass steam coal in the world is selling now on the markets at the mine in northeastern kentucky and west virginia at 20 cents per ton of 2 000 pounds i call attention to the fact that a 50ton car of coal sold at the mine at 20 cents per ton amounts to the huge sum of 10 per car and in that price are included the wages of the men who produce it and load it onto the cars taxes insurance mine supplies and every other charge connected with the production of coal while the freight rate on that same car of coal from points in eastern kentucky to the city of louisville in northern kentucky is 1 69 a ton of 2 000 pounds which would make the freight on the 10 carload of coal cost 84 50 for its delivery into the city of louisville the freight rate on the same carload of coal from the kentucky fields to toledo ohio is 2 64 per ton which on this 10 carload of coal costs 132 to deliver at toledo ohio or 122 more than it brings the producer at the mines the same 50ton car of coal delivered at erie pa with a freight rate of 3 06 per ton costs the producer 153 or 143 more than it brings the producer at the mines and the same 50ton car of coal delivered at buffalo n y on a freight rate of 3 48 costs the producer 174 which is 164 more than it brings the producer at the mines yet members in the house of representatives have not yet realized that that is just as much a tariff on the consumer of this country as the smoothawley or the hoovergrundy tariffs are upon the imports into the country it must ultimately be paid by the man in the northwest and in the middle west and at the lake ports who consumes the coal and in addition to that he pays a transfer charge of 1 81 for transferring it from the railroad to the boat that takes it across the lakes to the lake ports in michigan and other northwestern points i undertake to say that whoever controls the commerce and the finances of the country controls the

destitution provision often referred to in veterans welfare legislation as the paupers oath clause the words paupers oath are not used in the bill it is dressed up and sugarcoated so it does not look so bad and does not taste so bitter it merely denies compensation pension hospitalization rehabilitation and insurance benefits regardless of how their disabilities may have been received to disabled veterans who are required to file incometax returns the gentleman from arizona says that section 901 does not deny benefits to any disabled veteran who needs them that is the very objection to it it puts the payment of veterans welfare benefits on the basis of necessity or destitution it changes thewhole legislative policy of the united states in regard to veterans welfare and makes such payments a matter of charity instead of a matter of compensation for disabilities incurred and services rendered i shall vote to strike out the entire title ix because i believe it is poorly considered we have legislative committees who have devoted years to the consideration of veterans welfare legislation this proposed legislation did not arise in any such committee if i am correctly informed no member of the veterans welfare committee or of either of the pension committees or of the military affairs committee or of the naval affairs committee was invited to participate in the consideration of this bill no open hearings were had if reports are true the measure so far as it affects veterans was handed to the committee by a gentleman who was not a member of the committee and who was not even a member of congress and with only an ex parte hearing it was favorably reported by the committee on economy with only minor changes this is not the way to legislate properly the socalled paupers oath provision will save comparatively little to the government and in a financial way it would not greatly affect those war veterans their widows and orphans to whom it denies benefits the ones who would be adversely and most cruelly affected by it are the disabled veterans their widows and orphans who actually need these benefits because the destitution provision would brand them as paupers beggars wards of the government and objects of charity if destitution is fixed as the basis of our countrys gratitude and generosity to those who fought for it in time of war then our disabled war veterans will no longer be our nations heroes but will be looked upon as our nations failures and mendicants such a policy would be especially brutal and unjust to the women and children of disabled war veterans the pernicious paupers oath provision would upset the longestablished policy of our government with regard to disabled veterans welfare it should not be done in this improper and illconsidered way a few years ago a president vetoed the spanish war veterans pension bill on the expressed ground that it did not have a necessity provision in it and congress promptly overrode the presidents veto by a vote of 298 to 14 at the proper time if i am recognized by the chairman for that purpose i shall introduce an amendment to strike section 901 from this bill my colleagues i plead
