leaped up to a new high expenditures for that month reached 9 5 billion the highest level of monthly spending in the nations history except for june 1964 which resulted from endoffiscalyear spending pressure spending since september has continued at high monthly levels levels higher than average monthly expenditures since 1961 in october 1965 spending was 8 8 billion in november 9 1 billion in december 9 4 billion in january 1966 8 8 billion and in february 8 2 billion in previous years average monthly expenditures were about 7 5 billion these high levels of government expenditures have been in part due to spending tn pay for guns for the war in vietnam in combination with new expenditures for domestic butter they have resulted in widely noted increases in the cost of living increases most evidenced in rising prices for basic consumer items if the johnson administration continues its high spending the pressures now generating price increases and shortages in skilled manpower essential raw materials and plant capacity will surely continue republicans rightly argue that the proper measures to control these inflationary pressures are not specific price control measures justified on the hazy concept of wageprice guideposts but cuts in redundant and nonessential spending the nation we argue can afford both guns and butter but it cannot afford rancid butter redundancy poorly planned and poorly administered programs and unnecessary frills in programs republicans have made many concrete suggestions for areas in which to withhold or cut spending one area republicans have not recommended it is important to note is in the wages and salaries of federal employees here increases are necessary to compensate for the loss of purchasing power already experienced through inflation so long as the administration fails to perform its major and historical economic function namely to preserve the integrity of the dollar we must permit our people to preserve their standard of living by costofliving increases in their earnings or retirement benefits the theory that the vietnam war has played a major part in influencing the domestic economy has been disputed one factor i would point out to those who do not agree that war spending has had a deep impact is the difficulty businessmen are having in meeting increasing government defense orders cotton textiles is a specific area where defense demand for certain staple fabrics has overstrained capacity to produce unknown to many of us businessmen face a great complex of procedures when they supply federal orders and these procedures are confusing businessmen newly entering the defense supply field in response to demands from business the commerce department has scheduled 14 meetings across the nation at which defense contractors will be briefed on the operation of the defense materials system and priorities the commerce departments defense materials system and priorities regulate the flow of materials and products to military atomic energy and space programs and assist defense contractors and suppliers to complete their contract schedules on time these meetings were arranged at the request of businessmen throughout the country who hold or expect to get defense contracts the department of commerce said when scheduling the meetings businessmen are seeking answers to problems created in their operations by increased military procurement industrys questions reports the commerce department involve the use of priority rated orders under which contractors subcontractors and suppliers obtain materials supplies and components for department of defense atomic energy commission and national space and aeronautics agency programs this activity is a concrete example that vietnam spending is having a deep structural effect on the national economy it is not only generating much new demand but creating shifts in essential material uses which will have much longer term effects in promoting use of new and alternative materials i urge that economists and the administration pay much closer attention to these basic economic changes it is directly

our economy the proposal does not take into proper consideration that there is a wide difference in rental structures across the country what may rent for 80 per month in one section of the country may cost twice that much to rent in another part the mere fact that the government has such a program will cause property owners to increase their rental rates when this happens the next step will undoubtedly be a promotion of a method of federal rent controls by the administration already the administration is asking the american taxpayer to cut unnecessary spending in order to curb inflation

proposal is a principal reason why a sine die adjournment is being delayed i feel that to accept such a plan at the present time is to set a very dangerous precedent my opposition to the passage of this proposal is threefold first the idea of funding presidential elections through a tax checkoff is completely unrelated to the principal purpose of the bill under consideration which is the foreign investors tax act there can be no justification whatsoever for the inclusion of this tax amendment in the bill by the senate call it an ornament on the legislative christmas tree or simply a grab bag proposal such an addition to the bill before us is an emasculation of the legislative process if we are to do justice to the foreign investors bill and an election proposal it is our duty to consider each on its individual merits second a tax plan to fund presidential elections is serious business there have been no hearings in reference to all the ramifications and implications of such a proposal no one could possibly argue that this measure has been well thought out and in the waning hours of the session we have not had time to debate the issue on the floor since only 1 hour was allotted for its consideration while having full confidence in the chairman of the ways and means committee the time set aside for deliberation of this proposal was under the control of its proponents and the

political parties could lead to outright manipulation of elections after all there is no real safeguard in this measure that would preclude the misappropriation of the taxpayers dollars all of us are aware of the adage he who pays the fiddler will call the tune taken to its logical conclusion under such a plan the government could select candidates for us after all the possible expenditures brought about by this measure could result in about 200 million every 4 years this is a heavy investment even for our spendthrift government we do appreciate the fact that campaigns are more and more costly and virtually prohibitive so far as a person of limited means is concerned and we appreciate the necessity for broadening the base of financial responsibility in campaigns however there can be no escaping the fact that this will result in forcing a taxpayer to give to a party not of his choosing while the initial checking of the block designating a dollar of your tax return for the

resulted in so many instances of inequity within the same wage areas that there is an urgent need for reform to bring this about i have introduced a bill which would if enacted accomplish uniformity of method and ultimately uniformity of rates of compensation for similar positions determination of federal wageboard pay rates by departments and agencies employing these bluecollar workers was originally based on legislation first enacted in 1862 the act passed in that year authorized the navy department to fix pay rates for the socalled wageboard employees in the navy yards that law is still in effect other military agencies established rates for their positions administratively but it is done by an armyair force wage board for those two departments the exact method differs to some extent from that followed by navy and as a result some specific rates vary between these two systems within the same wagesurvey area more than 75 percent of all these skilled semiskilled and unskilled manual jobs are subject to the authority of these two systems there are about a dozen other agencies that establish wage rates for their bluecollar employees their methods to some extent parallel but still to some extent vary from the systems in the military agencies as a result their wage rates are different within any given wagesurvey area for the same type of work since duties and responsibilities of the same type of work are identical this similarity should be compensated by the same rates of pay for any similar position to bring this about my bill would establish a uniform system which should result in equal pay for equal work within any one wage area the first step in the direction of achieving this uniformity would be the establishment of a federal departmental wage board this board would develop and maintain a uniform system of determining wage rates for jobs which match those in private industry the board of five members would be appointed by the secretary of labor two of the members would represent recognized employee organizations which have a sizable membership in the federal service wage survey committees subject to the authority of the wage board would adjudicate appeals from disputes referred to the board these committees also would make the final determination of wage rates an employee advisory committee designated by the secretary of labor would include members chosen from nonsupervisory bluecollar employees and from unions representive of these employees wage surveys conducted by the departmental wage board and by the bureau of labor statistics would provide the wage data needed to determine changes in existing wageboard rates of pay these surveys would ordinarily be made by a single wage survey team in each survey district there has in the past been considerable dissatisfaction among these bluecollar employees with wage surveys on which their rates have been based they have believed at times that the establishments surveyed have not been sufficiently representative my bill provides that each wagesurvey district would include an area which is large enough to obtain wage data which would properly reflect the wages in large industries as well as conditions which more nearly resemble those in the federal civil service upon the completion of each survey the wage data collected would be reviewed for its accuracy and sent on to washington for final analysis and determination of the extent to which the data substantiate changes in existing wage rates thus at each step in the wagefixing procedure there would be uniformity

highway funding and highway construction money leaving only a small sum for funding other projects for example one of the projects which the proponents of this amendment claim would be a duplication is that feature which provides for the construction in the appalachia region of sewage treatment plants as the gentleman and all members of the committee well know during the water pollution control hearings of the public works committee there was a great volume of evidence as to the tremendous need for sewage treatment plants all over the nation in addition to the appalachia area there was only 6 million put in the appalachia bill for sewage treatment plants there are over 340 counties involved in the appalachia bill six million dollars will hardly build one adequate sewage treatment plant

for the taxpayers of this country it will not do the slightest injury to those who want oneprice cotton and i want it as much as you do now what is this about back before the days of this amendment to which the gentleman from mississippi referred the amendment to the 1956 act back before that period cotton was stacking up in warehouses just as it is today the reason why it was stacking up was because those who had charge of that stored cotton were refusing to sell it at competitive prices in the world market the longer they refused the larger the stocks became along came the 1956 amendment and immediately those who had control of the cotton in government stocks moved into the foreign markets and started selling cotton competitively and we got out of the hole we were in not completely but substantially and we began to see daylight again in a few years we lapsed again to the old policy of not selling competitively and this is why we are in this hole this is the reason for 14 million bales of cotton being in the warehouses of this country today this is the reason we have this big surplus of cotton and which could and should be sold uncle sam just continues to keep it in the warehouses leaving much of our share of the foreign export market to our competitors you know there is a warehouse lobby in this country too believe you me they do not want that cotton taken out of
