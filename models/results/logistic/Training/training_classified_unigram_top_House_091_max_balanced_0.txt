wanted a plane that will give them speed that is true but not entirely the airlines want most of all a plane that will make money for them the 747 the 1011 and the dc10 will be much more profitable than the sst is likely to be this is from the report of the general accounting office on the feasibility of the plane which compares the proposed sst with the 747 it says this at page 223 of the

base the decision to go ahead with the project on any generalized concept of enhancement of unitedstates prestige or the like that is from the department of state the department of the treasury said

advice and counsel of a man who can provide continuity during this most vital phase of operations and negotiations affecting southeast asia i know of no situation created by legislative act which is not subject to exceptionthat is why our laws are being constantly amended or repealed or otherwise modified for example i think the congress was very wise when it proposed the limitation that it did with respect to a military man occupying the office of secretary of defense but circumstances dictated that this limitation should be relaxed in order that general marshall could occupy the position of secretary of defense this resolution is in the same tradition of exception to fit circumstances after all laws can be made only for the long run for the usual situation for the normal set of events here we have an exception to the normal situation and one which requires remedial legislation the basic law is not affected by this resolution it represents merely an interpolated exception the basic law is the law of the land it is my hope that this joint resolution will be unanimously adopted by the congress today the senate joint resolution was ordered to be read a third time was read the third time and passed and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table a similar house joint resolution h j res 677 was laid on the table"], [0.00019669532775878906, 0.5001966953277588, 0, "i thank the gentleman for yielding today we salute ernie petinaud on the occasion of his commissioning as an admiral in the great navy of the state of nebraska i am happy to join in this tribute to ernie i simply cannot imagine the members dining room in the house restaurant functioning without him ernie is a kind gracious polished warm human being and an excellent maitre d in the bargain i must confess i thought dave martin was joshing a bit when he talked about the great navy of the state of nebraska but then i recalled that the missouri river forms the eastern boundary of nebraska and that it was the missouri that the french fur traders used to reach nebraska territory in the early 18th century as for ernie petinauds new rank it is most fitting and proper that he should be given a title reminiscent of the french who first sailed the missouri in intrepid fashion his commissioning as an admiral in the navy of nebraska is most fitting too because omaha annually distributes more than 1 billion worth of foodstuffs to the world and so to ernie petinaud the finest of maitre ds a salute the members of this house of representatives are lucky to have him"]]}
