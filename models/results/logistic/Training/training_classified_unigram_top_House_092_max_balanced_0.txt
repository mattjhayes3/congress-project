nation is battling rising unemployment illegally entered aliens are taking the jobs of taxpaying americans at a time when congress and stricken cities and states are struggling for survival against mushrooming welfare rolls illegal aliens are going on welfare adding to our tax burden and bleeding the nations economy at a time when the american dollar is fighting for stability and our dollar outflow exceeds the inflow illegal aliens are taking american jobs and sending their earnings out of the country at a time when americans are deploring wages below the poverty level illegal aliens are undercutting americans and forcing them onto welfare rolls some subversives of various nationalities have unimpeded access to our interior this is not a border problem it is a nation problem in dallas 9 500 illegal aliens were apprehended last year in chicago the apprehensions grew from 1 500 in 1965 to 6 500 last year in new york city border patrol officials estimated they could pick up 30 000 known illegal aliens at once if they had the manpower and funds there are over 100 000 illegal aliens estimated in new york city alone these conditions exist principally because the directors of the immigration and nautralization service and border patrol have by dereliction of duty or by incredible ignorance of the facts failed to ask for sufficient funds from congress and congress has not appropriated sufficient money to enable the men in the field to do their duty in protecting america morale in the immigration and naturalization service and the border patrol among the dedicated men in the ranks is about the lowest in the history of their services no one knows accurately how many illegally entered aliens are in this country figures presented to the immigration subcommittee house judiciary committee range from 1 million to 10 million when you consider the number who have been captured and deported or released for voluntary departure a figure of 2 to 3 million seems a reasonable estimate in the southwest region of the united states in fiscal 1968 151 705 aliens were apprehended for violation of the immigration laws in 1969 the figure rose to 201 636 in 1970 it was 220 000 realistic estimates for the number of apprehensions for 1971 are around 350 000 how many are still in the united states a high immigration service official estimated to me that there are 30 000 illegally entered aliens in new york city that are known to the service they could be arrested quickly if the manpower were available to do the job and the transportation available to return the aliens to their home country beyond this enough employees could go on and on arresting and deporting thousands and thousands in dallas a detail of 10 officers in 12 working days rounded up 1 728 illegal aliens apparently they had only scratched the surface because more aliens were captured on the last day than on the first unfortunatley funds did not permit this sustained effort but the dallas office picked up 9 500 persons for violating the immigration laws last year because he so often enters the united states by wading or swimming the rio grande the illegal alien is popularly known as a wetback but the day has passed when the wetback is content to work on a southwestern farm or ranch like many of our own farm and ranch workers he has heard the lure of the big cities the promise of more money he has quickly learned the value of american social security and is working himself into jobs where he can get a social security number the word spreads fast john holland district director of the immigration and naturalization service in san antonio was quoted in the christian science monitor as saying nearly every one we get is headed for chicago mrs l w herney head of the chicago immigration service says 1 500 aliens were arrested in that area in 1965 and 3 years later the number had grown to more than 6 500 there were reports of these illegally entered aliens headed by the thousands for steel mills and meatpacking industries wherever they go they take away jobs that should be held by american citizens how many jobs let us accept for example the low estimate of 1million jobs a million jobs at a mere 40 a week would be 40 million every week or more than 2 billion a year a great portion of this 2 billion is sent back home to the families of these unfortunate workers lured into this country by promises of far higher pay than they could command in their own country it seems a conservative estimate that 1 billion a year of our balanceofpayments problem is attributable to the illegal alien sending his money back home the illegal alien contributes to our welfare problem in two ways he himself becomes a public welfare charge when the rosy dreams of an easy life in this country do not pan out we are a humanitarian nation we cannot let him starve or suffer and we do not have the enforcement personnel or the funds to apprehend him and send him back home the other contribution he makes to our welefare roles is in depriving our own citizens of employment and forcing them to accept public welfare by reliable estimates at least a million of our unemployedall over the nationare victims of a lax law enforcement system that permits illegally entered aliens to replace them a pertinent example of the welfare demands attributable to illegally entered aliens is found in a recent report by r e thomason general hospital in el paso tex on its bad debt accounts for a 10month period in 1970 and 1971 services provided to patients giving an address in mexico totaled 115 339 40 it is undoubtedly true that a great many others unable to pay their hospital bills had given addresses in el paso although they were actually illegal aliens these examples from my home city i am sure could be multiplied many times over and would be concentrated in those cities where welfare problems are the greatest aliens will accept substandard wages and working conditions and those who exploit them are confident that a threat to turn them over to immigration authorities would effectively curb any desire to protest these aliens whether employed or unemployed are among the neediest members of our society they have been ruled eligible to receive food stamps they are given public health cards entitling them to treatment at our public hospitals they enjoy the benefits of unemployment compensation as well as public welfare and surely comprise a weighty part of the burden on welfare agencies of most of our states in dealing with such unfortunates there are inevitably those who would prey upon their condition widespread reports thtoughout the jmmigration service tell of large scale smuggling operations bringing in aliens who are willing to commit as much as 300 of their future pay to the agent who smuggled them into the country with the criminal element involved in alien smuggling it can be anticipated that the smuggling of illegal goods including narcotics and dangerous drugs may go along with the smuggling of human cargo the lax enforcement of our immigration laws becomes still another cause of crime when destitute aliens are apprehended taken from their jobs and simply ordered to leave the country because the border patrol lacks the funds to deport them they become desperate men and even if they had not previously been criminally inclined they are often driven to lawbreaking in order to make a living rising unemployment burgeoning relief rolls a rising tide of crimethese are among the major problems of america today and every one of them is being aggravated by the silent invasion of millions of illegal aliens one would expect that the immigration and naturalization service charged with guarding the security of our borders would have beefed up its efforts to curb this rising tide of illegal entrants instead it has curtailed almost every phase of its operations despite the indisputable evidence of a greater need for law enforcement by our border patrolmen the immigration and naturalization service is trying to get along on 1 000 less personnel than it had 5 years ago there are only 1 400 border patrol agents in the entire nation 1 200 immigration inspectors and 780 criminal investigators not only is this tiny force called upon to do an impossible job of law enforcement they are curtailed at almost every step in their operations a few months ago the border patrol grounded the last of its planes used for transporting illegal aliens back to the borderafter having allowed two other planes to become inoperable through lack of maintenance the border patrol tried to replace this transport system with a grossly inadequate system of bus transportation quoting as 1971 justification a gao study dated 1968 the inadequacy of transportation for illegally entered aliens is illustrated by events in san antonio this week according to the associated press san antonio policcmen have been ordered to stop arresting illegal aliens because of the expense of handling the large numbers they have apprehended in recent weeks police inspector marion talbcrt said the unitedstates immigration office advised police officials it will not pay the bill for housing aliens in the county jail as in the past if any illegal aliens are picked up inspector talbert said they will be released by immigration officials and given a paper telling them to return to mexico this situation is duplicated in many other cities in new york the immigration subcommittee was informed there are only two investigators to work all information received from all over the united states and other points concerning illegal aliens in the nations largest city many who have sent information there in the past now do not bother simply because the information is seldom worked due to the fantastic overload in my district some weeks ago i began to get reports that not only had the planes been grounded but border patrol cars were out of gasoline because the funds had run out i immediately contacted the white house and was informed that the office of management and budget had released additional funds the previous night inquiry by the press brought forth the statement that the funds had never been impounded nevertheless funds were made available and the cars were running again such reports of penury on the part of the immigration service have come to me from all over the country here are a few examples in yuma ariz where normal usage of gasoline for patrol cars has been 225 to 250 gallons per day the service was rationed to 105 gallons a day at 35 gallons per 8hours shift sunday and holiday time was cut to the point that only three men were left to work 65 miles of border normally worked by 30 to 33 border patrolmen patrolmen were reduced to siphoning gasoline from abandoned and confiscated cars to continue operation orders went out to stations in the pacific northwest to discontinue farm and ranch surveillance and other search details for which alien travel and detention funds were not already on hand el paso tex agents reported that farm and ranch surveillance had been discontinued tracking of illegal aliens in the sandhills has been discontinued patroling back roads to apprehend smugglers evading the traffic check point has been discontinued spotter planes have been grounded and city patrols in the city of el paso have been discontinued service officers in el paso received a call from parker tex from a citizen who reported he has previously called both the dallas and san antonio offices to report the presence of 168 illegal aliens and that nothing had been done about it the caller said two officers had gone to the location and verified the fact that the aliens were therebut with no transportation to take them to the border and no funds to detain them they were not apprehended in del rio tex officers were instructed to cut their vehicle mileage by 50 percent and were limited to 21 miles per shift per vehicle on the river units this limit put two well established alien crossing points well beyond the 21 mile limit aliens crossing at these two points are unrestricted in their movements these restrictions have been imposed under conditions where the rising tide of illegal immigrants is everywhere present and the need of effective enforcement is greater than ever before for the first 8 months of calendar 1971 the el paso sector of the unitedstates border patrol apprehended 43 732 aliens compared with 34 692 in the same period last year in july the total was 6 228 and in august it was 7 942 this is no time to reduce forces and let the cars run out of gas for lack of funds in july there were 28 arrests for smuggling and in august there were 52 in the 2 months these smugglers were caught bringing 427 aliens into the country in the same period seizures of marihuana lsd and pills totaled 172 145 in value our border patrolmen belong to an organization long respected for its high morale and devotion to duty obviously such morale suffers when our government seems to take a deliberately penurious attitude and fails to give them the support they need i call upon this congress because every part of our nation is affected to do two things firstcall upon the immigration and naturalization service to request more funds for its border patrol operations and second to appropriate all the funds requested it has not been congress which has reduced border patrol funds the administration has simply failed to request the funds that are needed to do an adequate job the information i have given you here today is in the possession of the immigration service it is no secret and it is no secret that the presence of millions of illegal aliens in this country is costing us billions of dollars sufficient appropriations for curbing this menace would be a wise investment in the economic welfare and the security of this nation we should either have immigration laws and enforce them and give our government agencies the means to enforce them or we should let down the barriers"], [0.02490788698196411, 0.9750921130180359, 1, "committee

effluent cleanup to be a policy or a goal for there is probably not a single member in either body who is not firmly committed to the elimination of water pollution as both a policy and a goal it seems that this amendment seeks to strengthen the resolve behind the policy by eliminating the provision for a comprehensive study by the national academy of sciences to determine the estimated costs and alternatives available to achieve the eradication of water pollution by the next decade for several reasons which to me seem perfectly clear i think that congress and the nation could benefit from such a study conducted at a high level and with adequate financial support we have seen in the literature that has been sent to our offices regarding the costs of cleaning up our waterways by the 1980s that authoritative cost estimates for completing the task range everywhere from 55 billion to close to half a trillion dollars without agreement on more precise cost estimates how can the appropriations committees of congress and the budgeting agencies of the administration possibly come up with realistic and effective tax dollar allocations to fund the antipollution effort the nas study could well determine that the amounts authorized in both the house and senate bills for the federal share of these programs is woefully inadequate to assure that the job of cleaning up our waters can and will be done should we not seek and have this information at a time soon enough to intelligently plan and commit the proper resources to doing the job the prime sponsor and supporter of
