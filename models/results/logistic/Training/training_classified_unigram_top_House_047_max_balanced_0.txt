trespass upon the indulgence of the house by participating in this debate but for the fact that i feel it incumbent upon me to support and defend the amendment which i have submitted to the bill now under consideration the bill substantially reenacts the nation 1bank act of 1864 the banks now in existence numbering 2 148 are authorized to reorganize at the expiration of their charters for an additional period of twenty years and foll authority is given for the organization of new banks with a like period of duration by reference to the amendment which i have submitted it will be observed that i propose to put the present national banking systeni into a process of gradual destruction as it provides that after the passage of the act no franchise or charter shall be granted or extended to any association for the purpose of banking and that no banking association now in existence shall be revived or reorganized the amendment farther provides that as each bank now chartered shall expire by limitation or by voluntary surrender of its circulation the secretary of the treasury shall prepare treasury notes in the usual form of like denominations and of like amouits of the notes of such bank and shall pay them out to the creditors of the govdirnment who may elect to receive them at par in payment and satisfaction of their claims the notes which are provided for are to be pure and simple treasury notes receivable by the government for all dues whatsoever i do not propose to repeal the bank act as since the adoption of the revised statutes it is doubtful whether congress has authority to terminate the charter of a bank lawfully pursuing its avocation and business within the terms of its charter i therefore propose to leave the law as it is to cover the operations of all existing banks and control their conduct until they shall expire by limitation i do not think that a more just and proper method to close up and discontinue the present system of banking could be suggested by it all fndividual or vested rights are recognized and protected andthe business interests of the countrysedulouslygnarded and shielded from any harm or disturbance whatever by reason of a reduction in the volume of currency no stockholder in a bank can justly complain of any violence or injustice to any right acquired by his investment as the measure which i advocate permits each association to pursue its business unmolested for the frll period of time fixed by its charter in respect to the public aspect of the subject i submit that lio possible detriment or disturbance of the business of the country will follow the adoption of my amendment because every bank note which may be canceled under the operation of it will be substituted by a treasury note having all the attributes and functions of money which appertain to bank notes there will beno reduction of the volume of the currency as the bank notes will pass out of circulation treasury notes will pass into circulation readily and will perform all the offices of money which nationalbank notes now perform bank notes are equivalent in value to coin not because of the intrinsic merit of the bank which puts them into circulation but for the reason that their ultimate payment and redemption are guaranteed by the government a treasury note with a like guarantee will not be less esteemed as a circulating medium i do not intend by anything i have said or may say in this debate to assent to the proposition that congress has authority to create a bank and invest it with the power to issue notes designed to circulate as and clothed with the functions of money the currency of this country is its life and the framers of the constitution wisely vested the lawmaking power with authority to coin money prescribe its volume and regulate its value national banks exercise governmental functions in respect to the currency instead of the lawmaking power issuing the entire currency of the country it has relegated to banking associations the authority to issue it without limit they are invested with full power to dwarf or inflate the volume of currency at their pleasure there is now absolutely no restraint or limitation upon the power of the banks to decrease or increase the volume of currency i believe that the act in this respect is in conflict with the constitution but it was passed twenty years ago private rights and vast business interests both public and private have been acquired and grown up under this system of banking and the practical question is how best to discontinue the system without injustice to individuals without wrong to vested rights and without serious derangement of the interests of the public i submit that my amendment is a fall and complete answer to the question i believe that a large majority of the people of the united states are in favor of the discontinuance of the national banking system they are prepared to see it pass away as speedily as practicable not because the continuance of the system implies a perpetuation of the national debt as is alleged by some for such result would not necessarily follow there are bonds enough already issued and which do not mature until 1907 to support the system upon a far more extensive scale than now exists there are to my mind graver and stronger reasons why the system should be abolished it has outlived the object and purpose of its establishment and there is no necessity of a public character for its longer continuance if the advantages and benefits of the system outweighed its injustice and disadvantages to the public or if they were equal we might be pardoned for giving now life to the banks and extending their succession for twenty years as proposed by the bill but if on the other hand there are no benefits or advantages derived by the people from this system and if it can be shown as i believe it can that it is a vast monopoly and opposed to the best interests of the people how are we to escape the just indignation of those whom we represent if we fail now and here to put an end to its existence what was the object and purpose of the act which authorized national banking i it was passed in 1863 the governient of the united states at that time was engaged in war it was struggling to maintain its credit and to provide means necessary to prosecute the war it became necessary for the government to utilize all its resources and exercise all its powers doubtful and unquestioned to maintain its credit and provide the means to support its armies in the field it was believed by those who conducted the affairs of the governmeat at that time that the system of banking authorized by the act of 1863 would aid the government to sell its bonds and also aid in maintaining the credit of the currency the history of that eventful period and the debates in congress show that the national banking system would never have been instituted or authorized but for such prevailing sentiment and belief therefore to state the case as strongly as it should be stated this banking system was adopted first to induce the purchase of the bonds of the government and thereby enhance the credit of the government and second to niaintai and enhance the value of the legaltender greeubacks in which bank notes were made redeemable i am not ere to question either the motives or the soundness of the judgment of thosewho inaugurated this system and fastened it i fear for all time upon the country i believe that the motives which inspired the president and his secretary of the treasury mr chase to approve the plan were pure and laudable but subsequent events have demonstrated that patriotism has exerted but little influence over the management of these institutions the government was vastly deceived when it set up these fiscal agencies so called to enhance the value of its bonds and the credit and solvency of its currency corporations consult their own interests unlike individuals sentiment does not temper their de tlings their interests pointed toward cheap bonds and depreciatedlegal tenders they needed the bonds to bank upon and when they were called upon to redeem their notes the cheaper the greenbacks the less gold it would take of the interest on their bonds to supply them accordingly we find that the bonds decreased in value more rapidly after the bank act was passed than before such would seem to have been the natural and sure result the banks supplied themselves with all the bonds they needed to bank upon at froni fifty to sixty cents on the dollar and notwithstanding bank notes were redeemable in legaltender greenbacks legal tenders depreciated over 70 per cent if however i am mistaken in all this there can be no question about the present united states bonds are selling at a high premium legaltender greenbacks are at par with gold and silver we do not need these fiscal agencies to enhance the value of our bonds or greenbacks and therefore we cannot reenact the bank law and extend this system for twentyyears or longer for the reasons anti purposes which influenced congress twenty years ago to pass the original act we must look up some other excuse some other reason and purpose to justify a prastical reenactment of the bank act as is proposed by this bill in consideration of the aid which it was supposed these fiscal agencies would give the government in maintaining its credit the government conferred upon them privileges inmunities and favors of immense value in a government like that of the united states where every citizen is supposed to be equal before the law and each alike entitled to its protection such a system of class legislation of governmental favoritism as the national banking system discloses is an enormity of the most frightful magnitude all other monopolies in this country are dwarfed into insignificance when compared with it i propose to show what some of these privileges immunities and favors are and how they have been used and enjoyed by the banks every ass6ciatioa of five or more persons who may own and deposit in the treasury of the united states 8100 000 in bonds of the government are entitled to receive 90 000 in unsigned bank notes the bonds remain in the treasury and the interest thereon is paid quarterly bythegovernmenttothebank the notes are signed by the officers of the bank and are used as capital for banking each bank is authorized to operate for twenty years practically the capitalof every five men thus associated together in a banking association is nearly doubled almost free of cost to them onehalf of it remains at the treasury and earns interest the other half is loaned to the customers of the banks at from 6 to 24 per cent perannum in order that thesepetsof the government should have an open fieldin which to ply their vocation all state banks we re taxed out of existence besides they are permitted to bring all their suits in the united states courts without regard to the amount in controversy and without respect to the costor inconvenience of unfortunate debtors again no tax can be laid upon their bonds and all the legaltender greenbacks held in reserve or placed to the credit of the surplus fund are likewise nontaxable while these are valuable privileges and favors there are others far more valuable the national banks constitute a huge monopoly my friend from pennsylvania who has just delivered a very able speech in favor of the bill affirms that the national banking system is nota monopoly because every man in the united states who has the means to invest in bonds may become a national banker and that banking being free to all it can in no just sense be deemed a monopoly now i submit that the gentleman does not state the proposition quite accurately i affirm that the system is a monopoly for the reason that banks alone can issue and put into circulation bank notes they enjoy a monopoly in that respect if a farmer owns united states bonds why may lie not deposit them at washington and have the privilege of taking home with him 90 per cent of the amount in notes guaranteed by the government to loan to his neighbor at the rate of interest allowed by the laws of the state in which he resides simply because under the law such a privilege is restricted solely to national banks i repeat that the currency of this country is its lifeblood and congress has put it in the keeping of soulless corporations who may increase or lessen its flow as their interest dictates or their caprice may suggest they can niake money cheap today and tomorrow dear the property of the country and its entire business are at the mercy of the system we have now seven hundred and sixteen millions of paper currency consisting of three hundred and fortysix millions of legaltender greenbacks and threehundred and seventymillions of nationalbank notes the amount of greenbacks is fixed bylaw and cannot be decreased or increased except by law the representatives of the people in congress must he consulted before the volume of greenback currency can be changed but the banks alone control the volume of bank notes they are not responsible to the people the exercise of their power over the currency of the country is nowiso regulated or limited by law who can doubter who will assume to say that such associations with no legal restraints or limitations in this respect united by connon interests inspired is all business corporations are by the greed of gain do not constitute a dangeios anil power ful enemy to every opposing intercet iu the land the comptrollers report for last year shows that in the last twelve years the national banks have distributed among their stockholders 517 825 392 of net profits and have on hand besides 130 000 000 surplus funds all eained upon in average capital of less than 500 000 000 and we are today importuned on all sides to give a new lease of power to such an overshadowing monopoly the toiling millions of the country are anin called upon not as before in a time of war and widespread a~lril vint in a season of general depression when government securities and credit were at a fearful discount not in a moment of extreme peril when patriots seized every plausible expedient to restore the credit of the government but in the silence of a profound peace in the midst of comparative prosperity with government securities and credit far above par to support this vast unfeeling grasping monopoly for another period of twenty years such is the proposition sir no more no less judging the fittare by the past these institutions will gather into their coffers over a billion of dollars profit and three hundred millions of surplus capita upon an investment of 500 000 000 in the next twenty years the period proposed by this bill the brains and muscle of the country are proposed to be mortgaged for twenty years to earn such princely fortunes for the banks an all for what absolutely for no consideration whatever the people do not need their currency because the government can furnish them currency direct without cost and if as vas supposed they aided at any time the government in maintaining its credit such aid is no longer needed nor desired we are under no obligation to the national banks if their friends will continue to claim that they have rendered the government in times past valuable services i answer that long since all such serviceshave been fully paid for and the obligations discharged if they are to retire now and forego for the future the exclusive rights and favors which they have enjoyed for twenty years under the legis ation of congress they will have the satisfaction of knowing that they have gathered princely fortunes from the toil and labor of those whose interests they assume and pretend tohavepromoted weare told sir that the national banking system is friendly to the best interests of the people i deny that proposition and i affirm that from the very day of its organization to the present time it has warred incessantly upon the rights and upon the best interests of the people that it has been ungrateful and selfish and has used its power and exclusive privileges to increase the burden of taxation and embarrass the government in every laudable effort it has made to lighten the weight of the public debt in other words sir this creature of congress early became its master and for twenty years has dictated in the main the financial laws and operations of the government to its own advantage the proof is abundant to establish this proposition but in the limits of my time only the most prominent facts can be presented i pass the period of the war for obvious reasons nor will i weary the house to recapitulate the efforts of the banks between tlie close of the war and the first administration after its close to contract and destroy the greenback currency among the first if not the very first act of congress approved by president grant was the act of 1869 entitled an act to strengthen the public credit it will be remembered that about one billion and a half of the bonds were payable in lawful money it was so stipulated in the contract greenbacks were lawful money made so by law and the supreme court affirmed the validity of the statute but unfortunately they were at a serious discount and far below par value in coin by the act referred to all the securities outstanding bonds and currency of the government were declared payable in coin and the faith of the government was pledged to discharge them in gold and silver this was in plain violation of the contract the terms of the contract did not admit of any dispute the history of that period records the fact that when the measure was before congress the corridors around this hall the committeerooms above and below ns and the cityitself swarmed with the agents and attorneys of the banks who were here to influence the judgment of congress and aid in the passage of that infamous act the work was accomplished it required great labor for the work was infamous the public debt was increased 600 000 000 by the legal effect of the act and the bonds held by the national banks alone were enhanced 25 000 000 the banks owned about 356 000 000 of bonds they had purchased thei at a discount ranging from forty to sixty cents in the dollar they were payable in lawful money and ihight have been discharged in legaltender greenbacks which were then at a serious discount but these patriotic liscal agencies the banks united by a common ibterest and influenced by a conmmon greed deliberately combined their power which far exceeded all olher influences and secured the passage of this law which created an additional burden of 600 000 000 upon the people for which there was absolutely io consideration and which was an unmixed fraud npon the taxpayers in 1870 congress undertook to refund the public debt at a less rate of interest the bill originated in the senate and i beg to call attention to the eighth section of that measure as it passed the senate it is as follows ste 8 and be itfurthet enacted that on and after the lt day of

the bill came to the house the combined power of the nti tionial baniks again appeared around this hll and was everywhere visible the section was stricken out and the senate was forced to accept the bill is amended and thus amended it became the law i do not propose to animadvert upon this action of the baniks language which i control is too sterile to characterize it properly i content myself with reproducing an extract froni the speech of senator shei itro who had charge of the bill and who i believe was tian as he is now the ablest fiancier of this country ho said mr president the three rmaining sections of this bill apply to the national banks that is much too great a theme for maio enter upon at this stage of the dnaten but i will explain in a very few words the theory of those

was the author of the original bank act of 1863 and the su plemental act of 18 4 those acts as passed contained a reservation of the right to congress to alter amend or repeal them this reservation was adopped out by the adoption of the revised statutes i call attention to this fact to show that notwithstanding the banks were in the power of congress and subject at any tiie to be destroyed by a repeal of the law yet they boldly defied the power of congress and defeated the laudable efaorts of the government to avail itself of their influence in lessening the interest on the public debt in this connection i desire to call attention to the conduct of the banks at the close of the last session of cougress in the opinion of a large majority of that congress it was practicable to refund a portion of the public debt in 3 per cent bonds and a bill for that purpose passed both houses that measure contained the following provision from and after the lt day of july 1na2 the 3 per cent onds

at their mercy and rather than aid the government to reduce the interest upon the bonds they would deposit lawful money in the treasury and surrender their circulation and thus contract the currency to the disturbance of business and the panic of capital congress for one time boldly opposed the unreasonable exactions and demands of the banks and disregarded their threats the bill was passed eighteen millions of dollars were deposited by the banks in fifteen days pending the controversy and the volume of currency to that extent was reduced business felt the blow and but fortheresources of the government applied on the instant a panic would have occurred as soon as the bill reached the president all the combined power and influence of the banks were concentrated and brought to bear upon the executive branch of the government to secure a veto they triumphed and the bill fell in the muscular language of my friend from missouri they bulldozed the president we are now paying 3j per cent upon what are known as the windom bonds because of the defeat of the 3 per cent funding act which was brought about by the influence of national banks the act was in all respects reasonable and the experience of the country since that time will attest the fact that our bonds drawing 3 per cent interest could have been sold at par"], [0.03362959623336792, 0.9663704037666321, 1, "no the amendment

gentlemen will remember should be subject to a duty of 55 per cent ad valorem that is to say the taxiff commission included that class of ware in the class now beginning on line 508 which will be admitted at that rate the committee on ways and means struck out this classification from that clause and inserted it in the clause just read thereby increasing the proposed rate of duty from 40 per cent the present statute rate to 65 per cent as it appears now on the face of this proposition on last saturday i exhibited two or three specimens of this ware and if gentlemen gave the matter any attention they noticed that it is the cheapest and most common class of goods used by the poorer classes of the people the laborers and working people of the country and yet it is proposed by this

upon this article than is imposed by the bill upon the finest grades of silk or upon champagnes or the most costly wines and liquors the gentleman from new jersey who is himself a manuiheturer of

least to the gentleman from ohio and by another gentleman from boston whose names i can give if required that this article is kept for sale in all the crockery and pottery stores in the country and that it is in common use among our people but if it is not used here i ask the gentlemen why they desire to make this enormous increase in the rates of duty upon it an increase amounting to over 30 per cent why take it out of the classification to which it properly belongs and where the tariff commission placed it and insert it here among the very finest and most costly class of china parian and porcelain ware not only does this clause propose to make an enormous increase on this common ware but it proposes to increase the duties on the chinaware embraced in it from 50 per cent to 65 per cent ad valorem if gentlemen will look at the importations during the last fiscal year they will find thatthe duties derived from these articles were over a million dollars it is a direct blow at the trade

pennsylvania said the other day in a discussion here that more windowglass is now imported than is made in this country i find the figures are as follows the imports of common windowglass in 1881 amounted to 2 617 000 the manufitcture of windowglass in this country in 1880 according to the census was 5 047 000 when i spoke on this question the other day i submitted a calculation which i had made ahowing that the consumers in the united states are paying to this single industry for the production dl this single article a bonus of 2 095 000 the revenue on this article today is 1 114 163 certainly if gentlemen on the other side of the house intendto give any relief anywhere in this bill to the people they will at least vote for this proposition i would myself favor a still greater reduction but i have no idea that any proposition going further than this can be carried i do not believe you will allow even this niggardly reduction"], [0.042866051197052, 0.957133948802948, 1, "it is impossible for one of my limited experience as a member of this house not to feel a degree of embarrassment entering as i do the discussion at this stage when the questions involved have been presented with so much ability by the distinguished gentlemten who have preceded me and this embarrassment is increased because of the fact that in presenting the reasons which influence me in my opposition to the bill 1 must necessarily pass over ground which has already been occupied and much better than i can hope to do but there are some considerations weighty with me which have not been elaborated and to which i shall refer before i close so that i trust the time i shall detain the committee by its indulgence will not be altogether in vain the bill before us proposes ostensibly a revision of the tariff the mode of procedure to accomplish this result namely the appointmednt of a commission of citizens by the president to be confirmed by the senate so that in its selection and makeup the house will have absol utely no voice and such commission when organized is to take into consideration to investigate and to report upon the amount of tariff and the method of levying it duties imposed by the constitution specially upon this housethis mode of procedure i say seems to me to be an unwarranted delegation of our powers and a cowardly refusal on our part to meet our constitutional obligations this bill if it means anything but delay presents an important question an issue upon which our people and their interests are divided upon the one hand and greatly to be affected if there shall be a revision of the tariff that will materially reduce duties are the protected classes of the country who constitute with those they represent more than onefifth of our population they represent a vast aggregate of capital in a memorial which they transmitted to this house i think they put the sum at more than a thousand millions of dollars they are active vigilant wide awake to their peculiar interests organized and capable of ready and easy combinations and actions and are consequently of great inlluence and power as respects their numbers they are interested in high duties laid upon the protective principle under the operation of these duties their industries have grown up and acconimodated themselves to this condition of affairs and they look with great concern upon the prospect of any reduction of duties upon the other side are the unprotected classes of the country embracing mainly the nations great body of workers the agriculturists tradesmen mechanics and laborers as well as the professioual men in the very ntature of things they cannot be benefited by a high tarifl high dities are a tax on them they do not ask the interference of the government in their business concerns all they do ask is an even chance in the race of life with only a fair and jrst proportion of the burdens of public expenses to be placed upon their shoulders and special favors ant bounties to none neither of these classes assuch constitutes a political organization but the former vigilant and active as i have said keenly watches for such political combinations as may be advantageous to it and for such exigencies in public affairs as it may turn to its ovn account when the republican party was first struggling for supremacy in this country it sought and obtained an alliance not universal but very general with the protected classes of the country by adopting as part of its political creed the doctrine of protection and during its continuance in power it has loaded them with extraordinary marks of favor in return it has received their unwavering and loyal support in many a doubtful and bitter political contest in 1861 when just seated in power it bestowed its first mark of reward in passing the morrill tariff and although this act for the first time in the history of this country imposed double duties upon the same article specific and ad valorem it was followed live months later august 1861 by a further increase of duties in the same year december 1861 further duties were laid this time on tea sugar and coffee which is one of the few instances where under republican rule duties were imposed solely or chiefly for revenue this was followed by a general increase in july 1862 on the 30th of june 1864 there was another increase followed by a still greater one in 1865166 from this time till 1874 several modifications of the tariff followed in which duties laid purely for revenue were repealed and others on the principle of protection were increased these various changes and extraordinary increases of the tariff raised the average rates of duty from 19 per cent what it was in 1860 to more than 45 per cent it is a remarkable fact worthy of notice in this connection that though a depleted treasury furnished the pretext for these repeated and extraordinary increases of the tariff the schedule of duties was adjusted mainly for purposes of protection rather than revenue these extraordinary and oppressive duties continue in force to this day and gentlemen tell its with all the appearance of sincerity that the election in november 1880 was a solemn verdict of the people in favor of the principle upon which they were laid and is to be taken as instructions to this house to continue them indefinitely but iapprehend no gentleman seriously believes this proposition that the classes benefited by protection were remarkably active in the late canvass and as a general thing very loyal to the party that has given them so many substantial marks of gratitude is undoubtedly true but no man i take it seriously believes that the mass of republican voters outside of the protected classes intended by their votes to decide this issue unfortunately the sectional feellags engendered by the war and the party alignments resulting therefrom still remained in sufficient force to overshadow so important a auestion of iolitical economy as this and had a very potent influence in determining the result of that election as may be plainly seen from the vote of the states in the different sections of the union besides corrupt influences in pivotal states as new york and indiana and the immense power and patronage of the administration with its army of officeholders and the free use of a great campaign fund levied by assessments and contributed by the classes interested in protection under the skillful manipulations of the secretary of the republican executive committee mr dorseya man not overscrupuions about honest and fair methods a man who is now under indictment for frauds against the government these causes doubtless bad more to do with republican success than the determination of any principle bat if gentlemen are right in assuming that this was the great issue which determined the preference of voters in that election it is at best a verdict that is entitled to little consideration at our hands being practically a drawn battle not even a majority only a plurality of a few hundred in a mass of more than nine millions of votes if the votes of the army of officeholders whom everybody shrewdly supposes to vote not upon principle but to retain position were not to be reckoned the verdict would be for the democratic doctrine of tariff for revenue by more than one hundred thousand majority if the battle of protection has been fought and won by that verdict why is this bill before ust why this activity and concern among the protected classes why these conventions in chicago and new york why this great effort to get this whole subject out of the hands of congress no our people have not decided to retain these extraordinary and oppressive duties levied professedly for a temporary purpose the exigency which made their imposition possible has long since passed away the receipts of revenue are greatly in excess of the needful expenditures of government our people will not to please protectionists continue to pay these extraordinary rates of taxation filling anoverflowing treasury to be squandered in extravagant and corrupt appropriations there must be a revision of the tariff and the protected classes would as well set their houses in order for it and agree to a gradual and moderate reduction of duties else the rising tide of public indignation under these more than useless burdens will soon sweep suddenly away the whole tariff allowing them no opportunity of adjusting their industries to the changed order of affairs and upon what principle shall the revision be made is a question of far greater importance eyen than the mode of procedure is it consistent with justice or a wise public policy to lay or to continue heavy duties on our imports thereby restricting trade and commerce and abridging the liberty of the citizen in his right to dispose of or exchange the products of his labor to the best advantage not for revenue nor to distribute the burdens of government among alitho citizens in proportion to their ability to bear them but to foster and promote the business interests and enterprises of a portion of the citizens and corporations of the country and shall the contemplated revision be made upon the principles of such a system these sir are the real questions at issue and as economic questions they are neither no nor novel ever since the time now more than a hundred years ago when dr adam smith laid the foundations of the science of political economy in his great work the wealth of nations these very questions practically have received the attention of the profoundest thinkers of all civilized countries no question ever submitted to philosophical investigation has attracted the attention of a greater number of learned inquirers than the comparatively new science of political economy and no question in the range of its investigation has received greater unanimity in the conclusions reached than the chief question in this discussion john stuart mill one of the more recent as well as one of the ablest and most learned authors in this field in his work on political economy book 5 page 566 says there is no writerof any reputation as a political economist who now adheres to the doctrine of protection except h c carey who gentlemen all remember was an american the distinguished author of careys social science a protectionist ofreputation in the state of iowa recently wrote to the editor of a newspaper to ascertain if there was not some institution of learning in the country where political economy was taught without the heresy of free trade the fact is the weight of authority among writersof reputation as political economists and the books used and the systemtaught in our institutions of learning are almost universally against restrictions of trade and commerce science so far as it can settle any question may be fairly said to have determined this that the doctrine of protection to native industries by the imposition of heavy duties in restraint of trade and commerce is false in theory and hurtful in practice it would seem sir that in the field of philosophic research in the domain of science away from party bias from the contentions of selfinterests and from the influence of existing prejudice we might look for an impartial tribunal to determine questions of pure political economy but neither prejudice nor selfinterest will ever submit either to the deductions of reason or the conclusions of science if adverse to them so long as ingenuity can fuirnish a show of resistance by plausible pretexts or deceptive sophisms hence protectionists profess a great contempt for philosophical deductions theories books he teachings of political economists and college professors like the colored parson rev jasper of richmond virginia who finding the conclusions of a science opposedto his view boldly declared what do i care for books and theories the sun do move dont i see it so they say what do we care or abstract theories and the speculative deductions of books have we not had protection laws for twenty years and dont we see evidences of prosperity all around us therefore protection is a blessing and may i not reply with equal propriety have we not bad a public debt of great magnitude hanging over the country during these twenty years and dont we see evidences of prosperity all around its i therefore a public debt is a blessing sir it is as much a matter of careful inquiry philosophicalinvestigation ifyonplease whether the prosperity of the country results from protections laws or from the blessings of heaven in bountiful crops the greatly increased facilities for transportation and trade the peace and goodwill that prevail among the nations of the earth and other like causes as whether the rising and setting of the sun is to be attributed to its own or the earths motion it is no wonder that protectionists do not like to encounter the deductions of political economists they are so reasonable and logical that they have to admit them and are then at the trouble to explain them away in the lawyers parlance they confess and avoid mr garfield during the discussion when these very ditties were under consideration declared on this floor against the abstract doctrine of free trade little can be said so perfect and desirable indeed did the system appear to him that he fnrther declared he was for that protection which led ultimately to free trade the gentleman from pennsylvania the chairman of the committee on ways and means the learned and eloquent champion of protection on this floor in the fortysixth congress when controvertina a proposition of the gentleman from ohio then a men ter of this house which was in these words protection builds up one citizen at the expense of another for the additional price which protection enables the manufacturer to charge must be paid by another citizen said i doubt not the gentleman really believes this proposition i pause a moment to remark it is the most natural thing that lie should believe it to an unprejudiced mind it must seem a selfevident proposition its simple statement is its own proof but the gentleman continning said he was so taught in college the text books he then used affirm the proposition as confidently as he does now since the gelntleman seems to think the proposition well disposed of when he as referred it to books and college professors we naturally wonder whence he draws the inspiration of the doctrine which he professes of course not from such unworthy sources as he imputes to the gentleman from ohio in a speech which he delivered in this house may 1 1872 he gives us the clue he then said if gentlemen would go with me to my district the leading district in the country in machineshops c now i doubt not that the gentleman is perfectly sincere in his advocacy of the doctrine of protection but i submit whether he representing the leading district in the country in machineshops and one therefore greatly interested in the direct benefits of protection laws and having these interests committed to his hands to guardi submit whether he is more likely to come to an unbiased conclusion on this question of political economy than even those college professors or the learned authors of the books they use or political economists generally whose only reward could be the ascertainment of truth i believe the gentleman himself and also the gentleman from michigan who addressed the house the other day who as i understand him represents a district containing a great protected industry the salt works of his statei believe these gentlemen are sincere i know they arehumnan and when they put the benefits of protection in the scale to weigh them as between the interests they directly represent and those of the whole country they are practically weighing their own interests for they would guard the trust committed to them at least with equal fidelity and we well know that when self the wavering balance holds tis rarely right adjusted i for one cannot understand how it is a reproach to its who oppose the doctrine of protection as applied in our fiscal system that the deductions of profound inquirers seeking only the ascertainment of truth or the weight of authority among the ablest writers on political economy or the great body of professors in our institutions of learning should concur in our views i welcome such reproach as this and i frankly confess in the investigation i have been able to giye this subject i have been careful not to neglect this source of information sir the right of government to levy and collect taxes and impose duties under the provisions of the constitution is undisputed it is nevertheless a dangerous power because so often and so easily abused the power to tax says chiefjustice marshall is the power to destroy and we have often seen it so usednotably in taxing the state banks out of existence it is a power that must necessarily be confided to the discretion of the legislators and however heavy and oppressive the burden may be laid the citizen has no redress but his unavailing protest hoping for a future repeal which cannot affect however the levy already made to frame laws therefore which are intended to and which do abstract from x ii 168 the citizen independent of his personal consent or choice a part of his daily earnings or capital to constitute a public revenue is one of the most delicate and responsible ditties a legislator is ever called upon to perform and this bill proposes to take out of this house and from our consideration this important duty and confer it upon a commission of citizens in whose selection we have no more voice than the man in the moon taxes are never a blessing to those who pay them every citizen is entitled to the fruit of his labor to his whole property not only as against every other citizen but as against the government itself except his fair and ratable share needed for its legitimate public uses which lie is bound to give in return for its guarantee of life liberty and property that the government therefore in the exercise of its taxing power should take from the citizen only a fair and ratable share of his earnings or property assessed in proportion to his ability to pay that it should take the least sum requisite for legitimate public uses and in the manner least burdensome with useless cost and which interferes least with the undoubted right of the citizen to do with his own as he chooses so long as he violates no right of any other citizen and that the revenue thus collected should be applied only to legitimate public tses are propositions so just as it would seem that they ought to have the assent of every fairminded man and yet sir in our fiscal system shey are ignored the larger portion of our revenue to wit 193 800 879 67 for the last fiscal year is raised by imposition of doties ou imports but these duties are laid not with the view primarily of distributing the burdens of government among all the citizens in proportion to their abilities to bear them nor with a view to the greatest amount of revenue with the least restrictions to trade and commerce and the least abridgment of the rights and libertr of the citizen but to foster and promote the business interests and enterprises of a portion of the citizens and corporations of the country if anyproof were needed to sustain this assertion an analysis of the schedule of duties will furnish it as will also a reference to the debates when the duties were laid but i need scarcely detain the conunittee on this proposition protectionists eulogize our present tariff laws and confidently attribute the prosperity of the country to their protective features but i beg indulgence while i present a few illustrations out of many that might be adduced showing how protection god save the mark as illustrated in our fiscal system disregards a fair distribution of the burdens of government and discriminates against the humble citizen and grinds the poor by imposing upon them an undue proportion of the public expense for instance plain bleached cotton worth less than twenty cents per yard pays an ad valorem duty a tax of 45 per cent while the same article worth more than twenty cents pays atax of 35 per cent a discrinination of 10 per cent in favor of the more costly goods suited to the rank and condition of the rich and against the cheaper and coarser goods with which the poor must content themselves the cheapest shirts and drawers woolen pay 86 per cent the dearest 60 per cent a discrimination of 26 per cent the cheapest wool hat pays 92 per cent while the dearest pays 63 per cent a discrimination of 29 per cent carpets valued at 2 42 per yard suitable for the rich mans drawingroom pay 50 per cent brussels worth 1 31 per yard to which an humble citizen might sometimes aspire for the nice room pays 68 per cent a discrimination of 18 per cent a cheaper still and certainly within the reach of many humble citizens worth 68 cents per yard pays 75 92 per cent a discrimination of 25 92 per cent while druggets bookings c valued at 36 cents par yard pay 96 30 per cent or a discrimination of 46 30 per cent in favor of the rich the cheapest blanket the poor mans blanket pays the enormous tariff of 104 per cent more than half the price is tax while the soft and downy ones suitable as sonic one said for the bridal conch or the chambers of wealth that rpst gentle as the snowflakes fall on the tender forms of the children of fortune pay 75 per cent a discrimination of29per cent in favor of the rich and against thopoor sir these are a few of the many viciouseffects from the application of the principle of protection as found in our tariff laws these inequalities this shameful injustice are not mere accidents but are a part of the system and will always be found when duties are laid not to distribute the burdens of government equably and justly nor for purposes of revenue but to protect setmte mans factory or sonic mans furnace protection has favors to bestow plenty of them but rot for the great mass of the people and especially not for the humble citizen or the poor it follows themistwith re uorseless greed when you abn don a fair distribution of the burdens of government or revenue as the basis of laying duties what principle is left to guide you in the performance of the delicate task none sir but the selfish demands of this protected class and of that each clamorous for the highest duties on the products in which they are interested and that industry or combination of industries which can command the most influence in legislation gets the highest dutics regardless of equality and of justice each manufacturer of course desires high duties on the products in which he is iiterested regardless of what class of citizens the burden may fall upon i was greatly interested in the graphic description the gentleman from iowa gave the other day of the troubles that environed the ways and means committee the pertinacious demands of rich and powerful industries 26 73 urging vehemently their interests while unorganized or weaker ones were not represented at all or their claims feebly pressed the confusion resulting from such a state of affairs the inability to fix a schedule satisfactory to all interests was urged as a reason for sendlg the whole matter to a commission this of course relieves the ways and means committee but toes not cure the evil the representatives of these powerful industries willbe as pertinacious before the commission the whole system is a travesty on just and fair legislaton thinl of congress asking a lot of monopolists how much tax in the wal of duties upon the people of the country will be satisfactory to them and because an agreement as to the division of the plander cannot be amicably arranged among them the whole thing is to be sent to a commission of experts but to return from this digression our manufacturers of course usually or largely engage in the manufacture of articles of general use and consumption and s manufacturers generally desire high duties upon their products and during republican rule have obtained what they want vou will find the duties high on the utensils and implemen is of industry on articles of prime necessity and especially the coarse goods and wares of the poor while articles of luxury and taste come in free of duty or at low rates except in the case of some of them where a manufacturer is concerned thus the farmer upon his tracechains pays a tax of 58j per cent while the sport can have his dianonds and cameos at 10 per cent tis seamnstress on the needles in her sewing machine pays a tariff of 45 per cent the carpenter on his saws from 42 to 63 per cent while the elegant gentleman of leisure gets his rubies pearls and precious stones at 10 per cent if it is board nails or wood screws the farmer wants if it is tacks or brads to do his mending or a steel pen to keep his account he maust pay 58 per cent but the dainty little gentleman with his derby hat sports his ratan cane taxed 20 per cent his jewelry 25 per cent on his plows spades picks and shovels he pays 45 per cent while the resthetic citizen who despises the useful wlt studies music and fills the air with melody can have his instruments at 30 per cent if it is castor oil or epsom salts needed for the sick in the family for the former he pays 152 per cent for the latter 78 per cent but his hospitable neighbor to treat his friends may have his champaign for 47 per cent on the bagging to wrap his cotton bales he pays 69 per cent on his window glass 59 to 73 per cent but he may have if he chooses silver plate and wares of gold at 45 per cent his good wife en her spool thread pays 74 to 78 per cent on lier halmoral 80 per cent on her hosiery 60 per cent on her coarse shawl 60 per cent her worsted dress goods 67 per cent being 7 per cent more than the tax on silk but if she would adorn her some with statuary and paintings from foreign masters

before the house and the speaker it was a bill prepared by a gentleman from illinois providing for the revision of certain sections of the law by numbers giving no intimation of the subjectmatter of those sections or any one of them it was found on examination that it involved the whole question of the revenue from imposts with all its complications and dispuised as it was not intentionally but in fact the speaker had on tre gentlemans motion referred it not to the 6ommittoo on ways and means which was specially charged with the subject involved but to the committee on the revision of the laws the house at once vindicated its prerogative and changed the destination of the bill withdrawing it from the committee on the revision of the laws and sending it to the committee on ways and means in accordance with the rule now sir the present short session has givei an illustration of what would frequently occur if gentlemen might originate billsthrough the petitionbox and give them special reierence we had a tariff bill proposed to be referred to the committee on agriculture the chair at first not comprehending the scope of the bill gave that destinatioi or was about to do it

on ways and means and that to send any one of them to the committee on agriculture would be an impropriety marked by a distinct violation of a rule of the house i therefore hope that the chair will rule as expressly as it is possible for him to do that other than bills relating to postroutes and for the improvement of rivers and harbors must have their first and second reading in the house and
