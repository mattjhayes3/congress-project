he favored free trade between the united states and canada why undoubtedly because it would in his opinion help his state again from the far south comes a strong protest against the reduction of the duty on sugar why because that section produces sugar again from the manufacturers from the north comes a plea for free hides why because they use hides to make shoes and they wish to make shoes as cheaply as possible and so it seems that general hancock was not so far from right after all when he said the tariff was a local question in one sense it undoubtedly is but in the larger view it is not now let us see if there is not common ground upon which we can all stand it is a matter of common knowledge that ours is a trustridden monopolycursed country prosperous as we are this is the unvarnished truth great corporations have grown up under our system of raising revenue at first they claimed that they were infants and could not stand alone so we built a high wall which largely shut out competition now they have become so powerful that they openly defy the law and without hindrance violate the law every day in the year the american people are the prey of these powerful giants the american consumer has made them largely what they are and now in return for his beneficence they punish him for every day they are shipping their goods abroad and are selling those goods cheaper to the foreigner than they are to us the man never was born smart enough to defend such a practice successfully logic can not make right out of wrong every good man in this republic from the president down would be glad to find a way to put an end to the iniquitous practces of the american trust how to reach the criminal trust is a question which has so far puzzled the best intellect of the land but in the dilemma in which we are i humbly submit that the very first tariff schedule which should be reduced is that schedule which shuts out competition with the products of the monopoly who will deny that the united states steel corporation has a practical monopoly of the steel industry of this country who will deny that this monopoly is selling its manufactured product cheaper to the foreigner than the american then why not reduce the import duty upon such articles to that point which will if possible force this trust to sell at least as cheaply to americans as to foreigners let me say this i am not a free trader i favor a moderate but just revision of the tariff if the farmer and wealth producer receives any benefit from our system of taxation then the last duty which i will vote to reduce is that which helps these men we do know that we can make goods cheaper to the consumer by removing part of the duty on trustmade articles then why not take those schedules in hand ah why that 1 900 000 which the republican national chairman had in the last campaign did the business that 2 800 000 which he had in 1900 did the business and the almighty dollar will always do the business as long as political parties are willing to elect their presidents and their congresses with money contributed by corporations and individuals made rich by laws passed by these very men four years ago i attempted to sound a note of warning it was a feeble attempt indeed i sound it again here today the use of money in our elections is a damnable curse the wretched creature who sells his vote should be put in stripes and the still more dangerous creature who buys that vote should be put in stripes also and sent along to the penitentiary for a term twice as long never has our country and congress been more bossridden than they are today it is true that there is a healthy indication here and there of an attempt on the part of good men to break up ring rule but so far as i can see there is absolutely no hope of the passage of any act which will tend to remove the consumer from the clutches of the trust all agree that something should be doneyes all from the president down all agree that we are in the power of monopoly all admit that they are making us pay more for their goods than foreigners pay no one will deny that a reduction of the import duty wil make goods cheaper to the consumer not a solitary member on this floor will i venture insist that the steel trust for example needs any protection at all then why not reduce the duty upon articles which come in competition with the steel trust i would like to know just how much this corporation contributed to the campaign fund of the republican party in 1900 and 1904 now i will not be misunderstood i do not pretend that my own party is free from blame as i have stated before on this floor the guilt of either party is probably limited by the amount of money its agents can raise each party can say to the other et tu quoque but that reply never justified wrongdoing since the world began but it is time the practice were stopped by law and good men of both political parties should join hands to make our elections clean and pure in the future for one i honestly believe that a majority of this chamber favors a reduction of the duty on trustmanufactured articles but the will of the majority no longer rules in this body why because you have tied yourselves hand and foot and delivered yourselves into the hands of three men this is true will anyone dispute it the constitution contemplates as i understand it that every member of this body should be the peer of every other member and enjoy the same rights and privileges and this would be true had we not voted ourselves in slavery more than once we have seen petitions circulating around this chamber asking permission of the speaker to be allowed to vote on some bill which a majority desired brought before the house just think of that if you please honorable gentlemen members of the american house of representatives elected and sent here by the sovereign people actually forced to beg for the privilege of voting do you wonder that your president pays little or no attention to your recommendations do you not feel humiliated this is bossism run to seed gentlemen let us put an end to it if we must have a committee on rules let each side of this chamber elect its members let us put back into the hands of each member that power which the constitution intended he should exercise your speaker should be your servant not your master just as you are the servants of your constituents when the ridiculous and arbitrary rules of this house are changed there will be a chance to vote on measures which ought to become laws then and not till then will this body properly represent those who sent us here and intrusted great interests in our hands no no legislation which strikes at the trust vill be passed by this congress i know there are gentlemen on both sides of this chamber who ardently desire to see some measure enacted into law which will strike at the criminal trust i have never believed that my political party had a monopoly of civic virtue and i am glad to hear testimony of the patriotic purposes of gentlemen on the other side of the isle but unfortunately as i believe the party in power is under obligations to the very corporations the people expect us to deal with while i believe the rules of this house are abominable and arbitrary it is hardly fair to blame the speaker for exercising the power which has been placed in his hands but with all my heart and soul i contend that the time has come for the members of this house to abolish this oligarchy and to teach the three or four men who monopolize most of the time of the house and wield all its power that they are the servants and not the masters of the american house of representatives right here i will venture to repeat a prediction i made during the last congress on this floor it is this any legislation which affects railroad rates will result in no practical benefit to the shipper the republican party can not legislate against the railroad it can not legislate against the trust for it would by so doing legislate against itself colonel roosevelt has been president for nearly six years every day during that period his party has had control of both houses of congress you can pass any bill you desire to pass again and again the president has denounced the vicious and criminal practices of the trust again and again he has called attention to the need of railroadrate legislation why dont you do something the beetsugar farmer says you are about to strike at him the tobacco farmer says you are about to strike at him why dont you strike at the trust why dont you repeal the duty on refined 6ugarthat little differential which was put there to help the trust oh no the big corporation is safe it can be relied on when money is needed to run your campaign now there is much in the president which a political foe can admire he is honest courageous intensely american for one i am glad to support him in many of his recommendations i am in full sympathy with his spirit of independence i have never subscribed to the doctrine that the party is greater than the man violent partisanism is not a healthy condition political parties become a curse when they obstruct the passage of beneficent laws i am a democrat because before god i believe the principles of my party as i understand them are right it is of but little concern to the millions of american people who are affected by the laws we pass whether they are initiated by the one party or the other i confess there is but little in the pending measure to commend it i will not pledge myself to do so yet i expect to vote for it because it is a very short step in the right direction in conclusion there is one other matter to which i will allude today at the white house myself and wife were looking at the portraits of the great men who have occupied the presidential chair of the grandest of all the nations of the earth at one of these long and reverently we gazed in silence for upon his countenance there was a look of heaven which limners give to the beloved disciple it was the portrait of the greatest soul ever elevated to the presidential officeabraham lincoln the martyr just as we were about to leave the building again we stopped to look in reverent silence upon the kindly features of yet another president who did not live in such a trying hour in the life of the republic but who left behind a memory so gentle and sweet that every american will always speak his name with pride it is the portrait of mckinley the martyr and then as the car approached the capitol we passed the statue of still another presidenta statue built by his comrades in arms to honor the memory of the soldier statesman and patriot it was the statue of garfield the martyr and then i was reminded that one out of every eight presidents who held the office before colonel roosevelt died at the hands of a miserable assassin the president is compelled to see thousands of people let us not be too hasty or too harsh in our criticisms of those of the presidents household whose duty it is to be always on guard"], [0.04125887155532837, 0.9587411284446716, 1, "a year ago when the eschtownsend bill designed to confer enlarged powers upon the interstate commerce commission to fix railroad rates and regulate trusts was under consideration ill this chamber i made a speech in favor of that measure and voted for it on its passage quoting from that speech i now find i used this language sir william wallace of scotland declared lhe strikes home when right points his sword the contest in which we are now engaged is the peoples fight against monopolistic greed faith in a just cause and unceasing labor to attain a righteous end have never failed in the long run to accomplish desired results i tried at that time to make plain how a republican oligarchy so long intrusted with the control of governmental affairs have made themselves veritable egyptian taskmasters and piled upon the bowed shoulders of the common people burdens too grievous to be borne i endeavored to demonstrate how this long lease of power had been systematically abused and prostituted to baneful ends enabling the few to amass fabulous riches at the expense of the many i warned the country then and i sound the alarum now that this shameless orgy of spoliation if unchecked will result in national disaster and ruin i cited instance after instance in both ancient and modern history to confirm this contention and to prove impending peril to any land where wealth accumulates and men decay i showed certainly to my own satisfaction the ominous conditions consequent upon the concentration of gigantic capital in certain of the great corporations of the country wherever managed for their own selfish aggrandizement by a limited number of unscrupulous men holding the dangerous power conferred by illgotten riches i did not then and do not now condemn legitimate wealth but rather instead the existence of those oppressive and iniquitous laws which have enabled favored classes to gather together in a few years fortunes of such unprecedented and menacing magnitude in its democracy as taught by the fathers that speech i know was sound to the core i stand by it unwaveringly to this good hour and abate nothing from the force and truth of the position then taken the bill we are now considering is in entire harmony with the provisions of the former bill it is wiser and better in the summing up of the situation it is more comprehensive in its grasp of a vital issue in which the masses in contradistinction to the classes are interested it is more masterly and unassailable and verily it is as manifest as the golden rays of the midday sun that the distressing cry of the people for deliverance from extortion discrimination and monopolistic greed has frightened the republican leaders upon the floor of this house into the advocacy of a measure which only two years ago they were denouncing with bitterest invective as communistic and revolutionary a year ago i said then and repeat now in this chamber the state or county or city or community which secures the largest number of railroads will enjoy the fullest measure of the substantial blessings of lifea condition of wellbeing commercial consequence abundance affluence and earthly happiness the tranquillity and contentment which peace and comfort bring notwithstanding the many advantages which come to the people from wellconducted railway lines some thoughtless persons have the idea that the description of the beast in the bible is a peculiarly accurate definition of every railroad corporation dreadful and terrible and strong exceedingly and it had great iron teeth it devoured and brake in pieces and stamped the residue with the feet of it tames mill in his essay on government says the end of government is to increase to the utmost the pleasures and to diminish to the utmost the pain which men derive from each other while this is true the ustinian rule of conduct so use thine own as not to injure another applies to artificial as well as natural persons of railroads mr justice caruthers said the policy of our decisions has been so far as consistent with the safety of life and property to encourage and protect this most grand and useful improvement of the age every reasonable precaution must be used to avoid injury to others at the peril of strict and ample accountability they enjoy almost a monopoly in the business of common carriers wherever they exist both as to persons and property a necessity to patronize them is im osed upon all by the circumstances of the time all other modes op travel and transportation having been superseded by this on account of its greater ease and astonishing speed while on one hand the courts should protect them with a strong arm against unjust demands and injuries to their property rights which popular prejudice may favor or afflict on the other the security of life and property requires that they should be held to a strict and skillful performance of all the duties imposed on them by law but all rightthinking men i take it will agree that the duty and obligation above outlined like all other human duties have correlative rights and immunities a railroad has a dual existence it is both a private and public corporation it enjoys some of the attributes of sovereignty it possesses the right of eminent domain upon the payment of just compensation to the owner it can take any mans property for its own uses and purposes without his consent and against his protest the law there ore wisely imposes and ought to impose upon common carriers of passengers and freights for hire and reward an instrumentality so powerful for mischief as well as gooda large measure of responsibility in the performance of the important duties they have contracted to discharge to the general public by virtue of their corporate franchises and i do not hesitate to declare that rebates in all their protean shapes and forms whatever the guise they wear must cease on this subject the public have a fixed opinion the people will no longer tolerate the evil whenever a railroad company no matter where it does business is proven to be guilty of the pernicious habit of granting rebates by which one customer or patron is given special rates and better facilities in his business transactions than some other customer or patronan unjust unlawful and offensive discrimination by which the one enjoys an advantage or obtains a profit at the expense or to the pecuniary injury of the otherit is my deliberate conviction that the franchise of that corporation ought to be forfeited its privileges withdrawn its corporate life destroyed its tracks pulled up and its properties sold at public outcry it deserves and should receive the death penalty it is an evil that once existed to an alarming extent in certain sections of the countryone of which the public complained grievously and where they had just cause to complain it is a thorn in the flesh the railroads themselves admit the wrong and are really anxious to have the nuisance abated but while condemning in unmeasured terms this baneful practice it is also true and but fair to state that many railway lines have ceased to give rebates in any form but the bill under consideration in my humble judgment is inadequate to eradicate another and peculiar type of the rebate vice the one more hurtful than all others to shipper buyer and consumer the remedies proposed are merely partial the overshadowing evil is the special terminals owned by individuals and the private car system the measure we are now considering lacks the power to prevent the rebates afforded by these private facilities or to stop cut rates or to regulate private cars and private car lines or private terminals when the republican majority passed the elkins bill known as the antirebate law they expressly provided it should not apply to private cars or terminals and it is manifest that the interstate commerce commission will have no authority to prevent these private car owners from getting rebates unless we enact legislation here extending the jurisdiction of the commission over them on this subject the president speaks in resounding tones in his message he uses this language above all else we must strive to keep the highways of commerce open to all on equal terms and to do this it is necessary to put a complete stop to all rebates whether the shipper or the railroad is to blame makes no difference the rebate must be stopped the abuse of the private car and private terminaltrack and sidetrack systems must be stopped and the legislation which declares it to be unlawful for any person or corporation to offer grant give solicit accept or receive any rebate concession or discrimination in respect of the transportation of any property in interstate or foreign commerce whereby such property shall by any device whatever be transported at a less rate than that named in the tariffs published by the carrier must be enforced the owners of these private cars possess an iniquitous advantage over all competitors the evidence taken down in the hearings before the committee discloses that practically all private refrigerator car lines have been absorbed by the armour car lii company they charge the railways a fixed mileage under exclusive contractsagreements not to use any other cars than the armour brand it is no wonder then that they enjoy a monopoly not only in the shipment of dressed meats and packinghouse products but also in the transportation of fruits and vegetables and in handling poultry and eggs and the output of the dairy business these private car companies make enormous profits without rhyme or reason by moving their cars to meet the demands of trade and as business exigencies require from place to placefrom the cold latitude where apples potatoes and celery grow in michigan southward where the red cherries and berries ripen in virginia thence to georgia where the peach and melon are produced in luxuriant profusion thence to the truckgrowing regions of alabama florida and mississippi thence westward to california and the golden shores of the pacific hauling every year fruits and vegetables from all these states as well as large quantities of the best oranges on the round globe from florida and california the evidences further show that these private car lines have advanced their charges thrice over within the past six years say from 20 per car for a given distance to 55 per car for the same distance there can be no doubt that this car trust is a great and growing evil and some legislation should be speedily enacted to break down the monopoly the shipper has no alternative except to patronize the private car system he is like the young irishman who enlisted in the army he said lie was forced to volunteer for instance it is claimed and not denied that the beef trust shippers in chicago and other great cities get a much lower rate than the ordinary shipper who has to rely on railroad companies for the transportation of his goods it is an open secret that men like rockefeller and carnegie by means of their side tracks and private terminal facilities have been able to secure such low rates for the carriage of their stupendous volume of freights as not only to undersell all competitors but to destroy all competition as well as a consequence they are ranked today amongst the richest men in the world the bil under consideration i respectfully insist does not even touch upon these gigantic evils these twin monsters of vice which figure sb conspicuously in the transportation problem permit me right here to state that the hearst bill contained provisions which did seek to restrain and regulate these mischievous violations of justice and right but that measure so far as it related to these propositions does not appear to have received favorable consideration by the committee on interstate and foreign commerce my criticism therefore is that we are now playing hamlet with hamlet left out of the play the owners of these private cars contdnd that they do not come within the provisions of the interstatecommerce act as it now exists any measure i care not from what quarter it may emanate which does not extend the authority of the commission over these lines as mediums of interstate commerce so as to regulate their charges is lamentably inadequate there are numerous business concerns in all sections of the country having several miles of private side tracks switching privileges and terminal facilities i have not time to enumerate them these accommodations by whatever name called enable the owners to secure special rates which are but a subterfuge device or scheme to cover up and hide from the eyeg of the publli unjust rebates they obtain a division of freight on all cars delivered to connecting roads by means of their private terminals and receive compensationfor services rendered which is unfair and excessive these abuses can not he rectified until these terminal companies are placed under the control of the interstate commei~ce commission in their last report the commission say the terminal road is in our judgment one of the most dangerous means for the preferring of favored shippers at the present time and we earnestly call the attention of congress to this situation the important thing to which we call attention is the growth of these ractices until recently it is our impression that they have been argeiy confilend to a few instances today they are extending in ill directions and unless checked must soon become general a crisis evidently is at hand great economic problens confront us the democratic party ii the party of the masses the republican party is the party of the classes talk to me if you please of a third partyof a peoples party the democratic party is the peoples party and there can never be any other peoples party so long as the people themselves love liberty and respect popular rights the democratic party has not yet accomplished its mission nor lost its power to do good the bill now under consideration does embrace within its provisions and seeks to regulate them the privatecar and sidetrack evils and in that respect if in none other it is a far better measure more remedial and beneficial than the eschtownsend bill which passed the house twelve months ago just in time to receive its deathblow in the senate but the people are concerned about other matters beside the railroadrate question and the regulation of commerce between the states and territories their solicitude takes a wider range it goes out to the family altar the rooftree the fireside it is the domestic hearthstone that throws around us its benign christian and cheering influence however humble it is alike a shrine of our affectionsa school of our hearts it is the duty of congress therefore to safeguard that most hallowed of all earthly habitudesthe american home which should be a place of peace a shelter from doubt an abode of love watched over by household gods upon whose altars burn the incense of heaven a hive where all beautiful feelings cluster like bees and their honey dew bring a temple of holy revealings not merely four square walls though hung with pictures and gilded but a domicile in which our attachments have sway and where the heart has builded the hand of this powerful government ought not to lift the door latch to admit within the sacred precincts of the home where wife mother and loved ones abide the distilled damnation poured out from the dramshops of contraband liquor traders i take advantage of this occasion while this body is in committee of the whole house on the stateof the union to invite attention to the lamentable fact that for the sake of filthy lucrealone unredeemed by a single palliating circumstance congress has become the aider and abettor of crime by authorizing the treasury department of the goveirnment to grant legal permits to persons to engage in tie liquor traffic in communities where such business is prohibited by local laws to cure this evil i introduced at this session the following bill a bill to prevent the united states from issuing a license to any person to sell spirituous vinous or malt liquors or other intoxicating beverages in any community where the sale thereof is prohibited by state or local laws be it enacted etc that from and after the passage of this act it shall be unlawful for any official or governmental employee in the revenue service of the united states or in any other department of the government to issue a license give a tax receipt or grant a legal permit to any person firm or corporation authorizing the sale or other disposition of any spiritous vinous or malt liquors or other intoxicating beverages in any community under the jurisdiction of the united states when even and wherever the sale or other disposition thereof is prohibited xt 141 by state or local laws and any such license if issued shall be a nullity and afford no shield or protection to the holder thereof sec 2 that any person violating the provisions of this law shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be fined a sum in double the amount of the license so issued c sec 3 that all laws and parts of laws in conflict herewith be and the same are hereby repealed some other bills have been offered having the same beneficent aim in view now indulge me please for a little while to say a few words in advocacy of thisbill i am not wedded to any special measure but unquestionably some legislation to suppress the evil herein complained of is imperatively demanded the newspaper editorials memorials from temperance organizations resolutions from religious bodies letters from prominent and influential gentlemen now on file with the committee on ways and means eariestly indorsing this bill which i had the honor to introduce at an early day of the present session speak more eloquently than i am able to do in favor of the proposed legislation and give better reasons than i can assign why this muchneeded relief should not be withheld the grhnting of a legal permit to sell intoxicating liquors eitlfer by federal or state government is not a vested or contract right but a mere privilege which can be taken away or revoked by the sovereign power at its own pleasure or discretion at any time even after a license has been issued to the vendor and that too when a cash consideration has been paid by him under a valid legislative enactment expressly authorizing a sale thereof by him upon his paying for and taking out a license to carry on such business the supreme court of my statealabamain the case of powell v the state 69 ala p 10 held several years ago that when the defendant had paid a price and obtained a license to sell spirituous vinous or malt liquors and other intoxicating beverages in the county of lowndes under a statute then in force authorizing such sale and subsequently the legislature repealed the law without providingfor any refund of the tax he was not entitled to recover back the license money so paid by him nor was he any longer legally warranted in carrying on the business of a retail liquor dealer under such statute or license under these circumstances and upon this state of facts our highest judicial tribunal affirmed a judgment of conviction rendered against the defendant in the lower court in reaching this conclusion the state supreme court decided of course that there was no such contractual relations existing between the defendant powell and the state of alabama as would make that provision of our constitution against impairing the obligations of a contract operative or applicable and that the state in granting authority to powell to sell liquors in lowndes county had not entered into a binding contract with him nor conferred any vested right upon him but had merely issued to him a permit or license revocable at the option of the legislative department of the commonwealth but as i have the volume before me containing this decision just referred to supra it is perhaps better that i take the facts and read the text of the courts opinion directly from the book itself briefly stated the facts of that case were substantially as follows at the spring term 1881 of the circuit court of lowndes county in the state of alabama the grand jury returned an indictment against the defendant charging in one count that he did sell vinous orspirituous liquors without a license and contrary to law and in another count that he did sell give away or otherwise dispose of vinous spirituous or malt liquors or intoxicating bitters or beverages within 5 miles ofrehoboth church in crenshaw county the evidence introduced on the trial showed that powell shortly before the indictment was preferred had sold a pint of whisky at his store to a certain purchaser within 3 miles of said church which was located not in lowndes county where the defendant lived but in the adjoining county of crenshaw that lie had previously duly applied for and obtained a license as a retailer under the general law which at that time was in full force and that the amount lie paid therefor had never been refunded to him this being all the evidence the trial court refused at defendants written request to charge the jury that if they believed the evidence they must find him not guilty but on the contrary the presiding judge instructed them to find him guilty thdreu~ionthe jury returned a verdict of guilty and from that judgment of conviction the defendant appealed to the supreme court the judgment of the circuit court was affirmed it will be observed that the indictment charged the defendant with the violation of a local law within 5 miles of a designated church in a county other than that in which he then resided and as being contrary to the provisions of a special statute only februaiy 7 recently enacted prohibiting the sale of spirituous liquors within a radius of 5 miles of said church on appeal the constitutionality of the act was assailed but upheld the language employed by the court is in part as follows it is immaterial that the defendant had obtained a license to engage in the liquor traffic and was doing business under it at the time of the passage of the act under consideration such a license was a mere permit revocable at the option of the state it was in no sense a contract between the licensee and the state within the meaning of the federal constitution which prohibits the states from passing any law impairing the obligations or contracts or within the meaning of a similar clause in our own constitution it is settled by the vast weight of authority that such licenses can be revoked by the legislative department at pleasure citing cooleys constitutional limitations 282283 fell v the state 20 american reports 83 boyd v alabama 94 u s reports 645 and authorities there cited i did not intend to address the house along this line and would not have thought to do so now but for the suggestion which i understand was made before the ways and means committee to the effect that if the united states government should refuse even under an inhibitory law of congress to give a permit to a particular pers6n to sell liquors in a community in which such sale is prohibited by law then in that event such person could not be convicted whenever tried in a federal court for the reason that he having applied to the proper department of the government for a license and not having obtained it would be authorized by natural right to proceed to do business without it or words in substance to that effectand that under this condition of affairs publicity was the only avenue of hope left open to us surely this position in my judgment is untenablean entire misconception of the law as applicable to this class of casescertainly sofar as i understand it now i desire to emphasize the declaration that upon no principle of justice equity or fair dealing can this great republic be justified in granting a legal permit for a moneyed consideration to any person no matter who he may be whether of high or low degree to violate a state law in any community throughout the broad limits of this country i care not where that locality may be in which prohibition prevails it is an invasion of the domain of state sovereignty and to do so in plain english is to encourageand sanction ab initio the infraction of state statutes by vicious men whose brazenfaced effrontery stalks forth for public imitation in defiance of lawmen who are afraid to face the constituted power of the federal government as displayed by federal courts because forsooth they feel sure of conviction by federal juries drawn outside the vicinage where the offense was committed selected from neighborhoods rar away from corruptiig local influences and environments these dead falls and blind tigers operated as they are in violation of state laws carried on clandestinely in places where police protection can not be afforded patronized and supported by ignorant and venal men for the most part by the worst element of a negro population so far as my state is concerned hre utterly demoralizing as well as destructive of the repose and wellbeing of society and are productive of numerous and heinous crimes these dens of iniquity are veritable hotbeds of vice and all licentiousness they lead to untold evils such as murder arson rapine and robbery and entail upon rural communities every earthly ill and human woe the people will not be slow to condemn any political party that forms a league with criminals that enters into a partnership with lawbreakers in this connection i ask the reading of an article from the alabama christian advocate which i now send to the clerks desk it reflects the sentiments of the lawabiding citizenship of the country"], [0.04150766134262085, 0.9584923386573792, 1, "and mississippithey did and i am astonished at the accuracy of the gentlemans geographical information because southern mississippi did once belong to france and was controlled by the bourbons but since we ousted them the race of bourbons have fled now it was said of those people that their marked peculiarity was that they learned nothing and forgot nothing if that be a correct definition of a bourbon i do not know a man upon this floor who better deserves to be admitted into the royal family than does my friend the gentleman from iowa to my certain knowledge he has been repeating some of these things he said this morning ever since the fiftysecond congress when i came up as a kid to watch the performance of that body before i was admitted into the fiftythird to which i had been elected and it seems to me that that far back the gentleman was ringing the chimges upon the assertion that we never had any panics except under democratic tariff lawsringing the changes regardless of all history regardless of all facts certainly after that in the fiftythird congress i believe it was that evermemorable geniusthe ablest running debater the american people ever saw thomas b reed of mainestanding upon that side of the chamber one day was asked the question as to why it was that under the mckinley bill we were then and there suffering from a panic as we then and there were and in a jocular vein replied because it was in anticipation of changing the mckinley law now that has been pollparroted around by my friend from iowa and other people ever since and with true bourbon characteristics no matter what you tell him no matter what dates tell himand chronology is about the only thing in the world that can not be disputedin spite of all that dates tell him and everything else he will keep on pollparroting and he is going to keep on until he dies why the gentleman from ohio even has quit thatgrown ashamed of itand the gentleman from ohio has quit that the other day the latter gentleman called me to order upon the floor for asserting that he had asserted that the wilsongorman bill had anything to do with the panic of 1893 and yet my friend from iowa repeats it here today the gentleman from massachusetts asked me if i believed in santa claus of course i do there he is right now in propria personathe dear old traditionthe gentleman from iowa and my friend from iowa comes up and tells us to beware that a burnt child fears the fire and that a bull pup got a smell of a live wire or an electric motor or something of that kind while engaged in a scientific investigation and that all sorts of things happened to the bull pup and that the american people similarly had smelled at a freetrade tariff in 189293 and the consequence was that they got blown up by coxeys army coming on to washington now it is utterly useless for me to tell the gentleman from iowa that coxeys army came here about a year and some months before there was any clnge in the old republican mckinley bill the highest protectionist measure that america ever saw except the present dingley bill it is utterly useless for me to produce the dates on him it is utterly useless for me to remind him of the fact that he and i were in the house at that time and that he ought to know or that he might could would or should have known it was long before the mckinley bill was repealed and long before the wilsongorman bill was framed equally useless to tell him that the panic of 1893 arose and afterwards spent its fury under the mckinley bill and before the wilsongorman bill was conceived or brought forth it is utterly useless because the gentleman has got so much in the habit that he does not know how to act or talk or think or think he is thinking otherwise it reminds me of an old mule on one of the old tennessee places i used to hear about that was in the habit of going around and around and around pulling a lever to grind meal in one of these oldfashioned horse mills and after a while the old mule got old and blind and got so he could not see new things of any description and after a while the mill burned down and the old mule true to the traditions of his former life went every morning to that old mill and traveled around and around and around and those who knew him best told me that his countenance bore the appearance of such goodnatured pleasantry while he was going around that it made all of his neighbors rejoice in his subjective happiness the gentleman furnished all sorts of figures to show how prosperous we have been in the exportation of products of the farmunprotected by the wayand then he undertakes to tell us that the price of products depends upon the surplus now he will never repeat that again as long as he lives i believe if he will stop to listen and think a minute the price of nothing in the world ever depended upon a surplus the price of all commodities in the world which the world uses depends upon the worlds supply and the worlds demand as far as the price is concerned it does not make a bit of difference where the product is sold geography of sale has nothing to do with it it is no more important to me as a cotton planter that a million of bales of cotton should be demanded and sold in south africa than it is for me that an equal number of bales be demanded and sold in mississippi it does not make a particle of difference to me whether my cotton is sold at timnbuctoo in africa or sold to the adjoining county the only thing that matters to me is whether i get a lower or a higher price for it and in a given year if there are 10 000 000 bales ot cotton made in the whole world cotton will be worth from 15 to 25 cents a pound and if there are 18 000 000 bales made cotton will be worth from 4 to 6 cents provided always that the demand remains the same it is not a question of how much of that cotton is sold in mississippi or in the united states or in great britain or france or germany it is a question of how much of that cotton is raised to be sold to the world and on the other side is how much of the mill power and consuming capacity the world makes an efficient demand for itthat is a demand from people able to pay for it the one factor is how much the world is producing not how much mississippi produces not how much the united states produces but how much the whole world produces the other factor is how many uses there are for it by people able to pay why the greatest superstition in the world is the idea that because you have a factory force of fellows brought down let us say from new york or out of france or out of germany to an adjoining town to your home that that makes your cotton or your wheat worth any mdre if the same force of people bought the same amount of cotton or the same amount of wheat while they were residents of new york or germany or france it would have had exactly the same effect upon the price of your wheat or your cotton there is but one difference in the world the american standard of wages is higher and it is higher because we have more cheap and fertile land than any other country in the world and therefore more opportunities to make money in the natural pursuit of man and therefore we require a higher bribe to go out of our natural pursuit into factory jife there is this difference and none other the american wage is higher and the fellows brought down from new york or france or g~rmany into an adjoining town earn more money and in proportion as they earn more money they can buy that much more wheat and more cotton but their residence has nothing in the world to do with it increased wage is of course increased demand but wage depends upon the number of people wanting work on one side and the amount of work calling for wageearners on the other and not on legislationeither of the tariff or of other varieties it is the entire product of an article set over against the entire demand for the article that fixes the market prices now i know that my friend from iowa will never repeat that error about surplus fixing price surplus is only a part of the total pricefixing product why the gentleman from iowa says that the germans make things and put on them made in germany but that he does not want the germans to write across a tariff bill of the united states made in germany and yet under the protecting tgis of our remarkable secretary of state and our great president who is worshiped in the bottom of your hearts by every one of you republicansit is no lip service you are paying him from day to day not at allthe administration has of late branded a part of our tariff system made in germany i frequently think how our last germanamerican modus vivendi must bring a sort of depression into the heart of my friend from minnesota who a little while ago was being interviewed and telling how he was going to raise a maximum tariff stick over the head of kaiser wilhelm and all the other effete european powers and make them come to tawin short was talking just the sort of talk that the gentleman from iowa was talking this morning namely to the effect that we did not propose to let anybody else on the surface of the earth dictate anything about our tariff laws that the very sacred scripture laid upon the sacred table inside of the sacred temple of american institutions was the dingley bill and that we did not propose to let kaiser wilhelm or anybody else question it but kaiser wilhelm did question it and when kaiser wilhelm got through questioning it i notice he entered into some sort of a modus vivendi and we have agreed to consulate german goods at towns of manufacture instead of at the ports of shipment and we agreed to do a great many other things that will reduce the number of dollars and cents or the number of marks that the german will pay upon his goods when brought into america and therefore enable him to sell the goods somewhat cheaper and thereby i am glad to say to the humiliation of standpatters enable the american consumer to buy them so much cheaper made in germany the gentleman does not want any tariff made in germany what is the difference between having your law branded made in germany and having your administrative regulations branded made in germany the secretary of the treasury has moreover invited us to brand the law made in germany now a few words upon that question i do not agree with my friend from minnesota that the right way to persuade people to reciprocal trade relations is to hold a big stick over them and threaten them i do not think you gain much in this world by going around with a stick anyhow that has not been my experience not only the bible but common sense teaches that a soft answer turneth away wrath i had this idea which i introduced into a bill i did it in consequence of the conclusions of a great reciprocity convention the delegates to that reciprocity convention were so overwhelmingly republican that they would not even allow anybody to hint at a profession of faith in democratic ideals but still they demanded a maximum and minimum tariff i knew what they wanted was a minimum tariff because i knew what they wanted to do was to induce people abroad to a more friendly state of mind toward us and to have grow out of that friendly state of mind a more friendly reciprocal trade relation i therefore introduced a bill providing for a minimum tariff and i sent it to the committee on ways and means presided over by the nestor of the congress of the united states the gentleman from new york and the membership of which was never exceeded in any congress by its member ship in this housein numbers at any rate i sent that bill to the committee on ways and means and took you republicans at your own word you will remember in section 3 of the dingley bill you providedalthough you provided it for only two years and the time has now expiredthaf the president could enter into reciprocal trade relations with anybody by reducing duties 20 per cent and by proclaiming that duty for that particular nation the moment he proclaimed at the same time the fact that that nation had given us certain trade advantages i therefore provided in my bill that the minimum tariff of the united states hereafter should be the resent rates less 20 per centthat is each tax should be fourfifths of the present tax i brought that matter before the ways and means committee i had childlike confidence in the patriotism and intelligence of the republican majority upon that committee my friend from missouri had the same degree of confidence and i shall never forget the look of coqaplacent and confiding optimism upon his childlike countenance the day i brought the bill up in committee but when i did so and faced my friend from new york with it our childlike confidence was disappointed and the demand of the reciprocity convention was voted down by a strict party voteall the republicans on the committee against this bill of constructive statesmanship all the democrats for it now my friend mccleary says i want a maximum i said i want a minimum tariff he said let us retaliate i said let us reciprocate he said let us threaten i said let us invite he said let us dare on the dogs of war i said let us invite the doves of peace that is in short meter republicanism on one side and democracy on the other and what was there at the end of it all i invoked the doves of peace and the countenance of my republican friend from new york the chairman of the ways and means committee at once resembled the warlike god of mars when he is getting ready for battle and somebody moved to lay the bill on the table they did it and they would have laid me on the table except out of pure parliamentary courtesy now my friend from iowa talks about our great home market and then he says our foreign market is not worth a tithe of it why it is not worth a fifth of a tithe of it one of the most curious things in the world to me is to see a republican upon this floor a protectionist wedded to the idols of the protectionist standing in the american congress and bragging and boasting congress after congress about our immense home market what created our immense home market why thank god it is the only thing we have that the protectionist can not touch yon say that we ought not to have that foreign market extended at the expense of throwing away our home market i thank god we can not throw away the home market in view of the absolute free unencumbered trade from maine to san diego cal from the coast opposite vancouver island to the utmost extent of the peninsula of florida from the great lakes down to the gulf and from the atlantic to the pacifica scope of territory with the greatest opportunities of industrial development that the world in all of its history has thus far seen which has been built up and made what it is by the absolute freedom of trade what right have you republicans to boast of our home market why if you could do it upon your socalled princi ples and your ideas you would protect iowa against the mbundance of all the other states then if the people of iowa in spite of your protecting them against mississippi and pennsylvania and massachusetts and new york grew prosperous anyhow not because you had protected them against these other great commonwealths but in spite of your attempted trade obstructions you would rise on this floor with the same childlike credulity and selfstultification you have today displayed and attribute that prosperity to the fact that iowa was protected against illinois and indiana why the very formation of the goverihment of the united states was a denial of the fundamental principles of the protectionist we constructed it for the purpose of having a free country and freedom of trade between the several states forming the united states still gentlemen rise and cry free trade as if the cry ought to affright children i would not be afraid of the cry i am not afraid of anything with the word free in it free religion free speech free assembly free trade free anything anything with the word free in it does not excite my dread or fear but when gentlemen talk about free trade they know it is absolutely impossible that anybody with common sense and wanting to carry on a government should advocate free trade in the united states they know that the democratic party has never at any time before or since the war advocated free trade i will not say that if it were possible to advocate it practically that it would not be a very much more beautiful and symmetrical doctrine than the one you are advoeating but youall of youknow as a matter of fact that there is nobody advocating it in the united states now and you know that the democratic idea of raising revenue by tariff is the idea of taxing the american consumers as nearly as possible equally and uniformly in proportion to the strength of the back of the taxpayer to bear the burden of the tax you know that if the democratic party could make an ideal democratic tariff that it would include upon the list a tax on nearly all articles to be consumed that a small tax would lie levied making it smaller and smaller in proportion as it became more and more a question of the living of the people and the living of the peoples industries and that a large tax would be levied on luxurieslarger and larger in proportion as it was more and more purely a luxury many duties would be almost nominala mere statistical tax upon the raw material or upon what you might call the raw materials of life the necessaries of a man to live by eating and the coarser clothingnecessary food bread and meat the duties needed for revenue and whose levy would be unavoidable would incidentally furnish protection enough for every man not an industrial coward why is it that you gentlemen are seared is it because you have no confidence in the intelligence of your own people why are you compelled every time this question is brought up in this house to refer to a rhetorical figure of speech by my friend from missouri saying that he wished there was no customhouses in this country when you know at the time he said it he did not say it with any applicability to legislation practically and that he was speaking of the theory of free trade if he had tabula rasa to write upon and could make the conditions anew to suit himselfno supreme court with its incometax decision and no federal government as in the present form our forefathers had that chance for a continent and wrote on the tabula rasa the words free trade between the states and territories what fool thinks we have suffered by it my friend from missouri has not and never had and never will have tabula rasa to write free trade between the nations knows he has not moreover you know he knows it why is it that whenever you come to discuss this matter instead of discussing what we actually propose to do you always go off and discuss something of that sort now what do you propose to do i have another bill that i introduced and that bill was to reduce the duties upon articles that were subject to taxation wherever those articles were taxed at over 100 per cent to 100 per cent i understand that the gentleman who presides over this house as its speaker for whom i entertain a personal affection not exceeded by the personal affection that i entertain for any man in the house was interviewed about that bill and when interviewed he said that lie reckoned it was one of john sharp williamss jokes because there were no duties over 100 per cent and i heard too although i did not see it in a newspaper but it was told me later that my friend the chairman of the committee on ways and means said he thought too it was one of ohn sharp williamss jokes"], [0.04186064004898071, 0.9581393599510193, 1, "well it may be that you couldnt easily get a jury but 1would keep on trying until i did do it now let me get back to the proposition on which i was dwelling reforms begin down among the plain people and not a thousand miles away from the evils in issue that is where they start you know we have been trying to clean out some of the bureaus in this government for years have we done it we have cleaned them out all around washington and left her a magnificent oasis gentlemen the democrats will have the biggest laundry when we get in in a year or two fromnow that you ever heard about and i tell you gentlemen we will show you then where the rascals are and we will use lye soap oh i have come in contact with some of them and i have been after them with a pitchfork i am not done with them but if congress can let us outlaw insurance thieves but do so within the limits of the constitution for gods sake and for the sake of the country let us at least take care of its dismembered parts if congress can help out legally the states who are trying to help themselves in this great struggle let us not turn our backs upon the effort surely the people of this country are asking for it but what distresses me is the fact that because the president a straightforward honest courageous man has found a lot of frauds and rascals in the departments and turned them out and is trying to punish the guilty and because he is trying to enforce the law the people are reflecting upon themselves and upon us by saying that it seems as if the president is the only honest man in office in the country to tell the truth they are sending to him and asking his advice asking him to help clean out the augean stables as if he was the only officer in the whole country who is honest shame upon the morals of the people in the states the law can make no man an honest man it may prevent him from being a desperado but god almighty makes the honest man tie law helps the honest man to put the dishonest one where lie ought to go it is a sad commentary that the people are looking at this one man in the white house to lead them out of this horrible and terrible abyss of corruption fraud and oppression of all sorts done by democrats and republicans xl 27 the president has his faults i have told him of some of them to his face and on the floor of this house i have extolled his virtues on the floor of this house and on a hundred stumps this sunmer on the ground and in the train and on horseback i hope and believe lie will stand firm i have done what i could to put that infernal outlawthe head of dukes tobacco companyin the penitefitiary where i believe he belongs and will at a near day go there so long as the great god gives me a voice so long as lie gives me the little gray matter that is left in my head the little spark of love i have for my mother and my country i shall never let up on that vampire until i see him behind the bars he has been robbing my people under the forms of law he has been at the head of an international and federal trust and the tobacco farmers have been stirred up in tennessee and kentucky in decency and in order and within the limits of the law thirty thousand strong blacks and whites old and young rich and poor have banded together to defend their homes and firesides waiting until the attorneygeneral can give them relief by injunction and indictments against this vampire now as i say the people were stirred up and when they were what did they do they said you have got to give us a living price for our tobacco it cost us 6 cents to raise it and you have been paying us a cent a cussing and nothing as my friend john b allen saysin fact paid them last year an average of 4 cents and what did they have to do when they got our tobacco this year they paid us about 8 89 cents for every pound they bought that was not the result of my efforts nor the efforts of any other one man not at all there was john b allen of clarksville tenn there was staxley of kentucky and olail james of kentucky joel b fort of springfield tenn and felix g ewing of the farmers hearts a plain little redheaded farmer down at glenraven tenn the chairman of the executive committee and his five or six associates it was the stirring up of peoples sensibilities to hate a lawbieaker that really did the work it was arousing the people and telling them what their rights are it was going home and stirring up the oldfashioned genuine americanism which ha s brought this righteous result about gentlemen before we get rid of the insurance frauds in new york or in philagelphia or in missouri or in ohio or dear old tennesseewhere so far as i know there are nonewe must stir the people up at home and make them enforce the laws at home just as mayor weaver is enforeiig the laws in the great city of philadelphia and joe folk enforced them in the state of missouri as they are fixing to do in ohio now suppose you pass your insurance law based on this commerce clause where are you going to get your juries to convict if the people are too rotten at home to punish under their home laws as somebody said here a while age where will you get honest juries to convict under the federal law the president has said a wise thing which some of the gentlemen on the other side have unwisely overlooked in his message on this subject he says of course the only complete remedy for this condition must be found in an aroused public conscience a higher sense of ethical conduct in the community at large and especially among business men and in the great profession of the lawi am glad to find that in the great profession of tie law that is something he said i had overlooked he continues and in the great profession of the law and in the growth of the spirit which condemns all dishonesty whether in rich man or in poor man in the shape of bribery or of blackmail the president says you may pass the law and he does ac t say we can base it on the commerce clause either and make it constitutional he puts it if he says the only way to exterminate fraud and blackmail and stealth is to stir up the morals of the people stir up the people at home in the states now i have said a great deal more on this subject than i intended i did not intend to speak when i came here today i just recall a point which i will discuss and then conclude mr justice white in the hooper case in 1894 and mr justice mekenna in 1900 in the missouri case that i cited a while ago reported in 178 united states at page let me get the page correctly because i want my distinguished friend from new york to read down to date i do not want him to depend on himself exclusively in getting down to the kernel of the proposition which he did not discuss this morningat page 389 new york life insurance company v craven here mr justice mckenna reviews the whole proposition to wit that a state can create and limit a corporation that it can create and limit the rights of its own corporation and that it can adml t to or exclude from its borders a foreign corporation let us read what mr justice white says the principle that the right of a foreign corporation to engage in business within a state other than that of its creation depends solely upon the will of such other state has been long settled and many phases of its application have been illustrated by the decisions of this court bank of augusta v earle 13 pet 519 lafayette ins co v french 18 iow 404 society for

[0.04292875528335571, 0.9570712447166443, 1, "mr chairman and gentlemen of the committee inasmuch as i do not want to be out of fashion i propose to make my remarks along the lines that others have made theirs since this discussion began and you may therefore prejudge that they will embrace a medley of subjects in the matter of the reference of that part of the presidents message that refers to insurance that has been under discussion for several days i in common with others have my individual views if it were not that we thought differently there would be no questions for us to assemble here to dispose of from time to time because our similar ideas would lead to but one conclusion no dissension anywhere and hence we could dispose of the subjects that we are sent here to dispose of by proxy and let them go at that in my humble judgment the insurance feature of the presidents message ought to be referred to the committee on the judiciary as a business proposition when we come to legislate we bught to do it on a business plane along business lines not in a scattering or guesswork manner as it were it strikes me that if we refer it to the committee on ways and means it would be a guesswork proceeding no member of that committee seems to know what to do with it unless it be that when they get it they could evolve something out of it that would produce revenue i can not see how taxing the insurance companies will amount to anything in controlling them unless it be that they are to be taxed out of existence to simply lay a tax upon them would do the companies no hurt for if you taxed them 10 000 000 each per annum the policy holders and not the companies would have to pay it such a tax would add considerably to the revenue of this country and we would all be glad to welcome 10 000 000 into the treasury at this particular time of revenue shortage from each of these companies if it came out of their fraudulent coffers instead of out of the orphans penury and the widows mite but there is no danger of the insurance business being legally regulated by taxation for nowhere within the lids of the constitution of the united states is there anything that tends to indicate that the congress has authority to tax individuals or corporations for the purpose of regulation therefore it seems that it is unnecessary to argue longer that the ways and means committee is not the proper committee to which to refer this particular question of insurance to which the president has so lucidly referred in his annual message to this body but sir it has been claimed that it ought to go to the committee on interstate and foreign commerce i can not see why certainly under the decisions of the supreme court insurance is not commerce and inasmuch as the interstate commerce committee has no other authority than that of dealing with the commerce of the country it seems entirely out of place to talk about sending this part of the message to that committee i think it would be wiser to refer it to the postoffice committee than to the interstate and foreign commerce committee because there they might deal with it along the lines of the getrichquick propositions we notice mr chairmdn that the postoffice authorities have power whenever they know of any concern that is organized corporation or otherwise for the purpose of getting rich quick by defrauding those who patronize such institutions to issue a fraud order and in that way get rid of the obnoxious imposition sir if the proceedings of the insurance companies the three great insurance companies of the united states for the past several years according to the evidence that has been adduced before the committee that is now investigating them in the city of new york do not show them to be getrichquick concerns then i do not know the meaning of the term they have certainly been getting rich quick according to the reports that have come to our ears telling of the vast sums that have been illegally appropriated to the use and benefit of the companies and their thieving oflicers to the eternal injury of the policy holders and their beneficiaries their officers have defrauded the policy holders by the misappropriation of trust funds and hence ire embezzlers under the laws of any state of the union if that does not call for a fraud order i would like to know what sort of conduct would call for one but sir it seems to be a doubtful question as to whether this government has any authority whatever to deal with the great insurance corporations therefore as long as there is doubt about that there can be no doubt about the committee that the insurance part of the presidents message should go to it has always been the rule in all legislative bodies whenever legislation is initiated that indicates that it would be in conflict with the constitution of the united states or of the states that the judiciary is the proper committee for it to be referred to where questions of that kind are considered and determined and the proper report made thereon therefore the motion which i understand is to be made to refer this resolution to the judiciary committee with instructions to report back to this body its findings will be the proper motion in my judgment and it ought to prevail certainly sir the insurance companies need some check upon their reckless course if they have misappropriated trust funds they have been profligate in the use of money that was placed in their hands to be given back to the policy holders or their beneficiaries as a dividend and sir when they misappropriate trust funds by way of paying excessive salaries when they misappropriate by way of speculation or when they misappropriate it by placing it in the campaign fund of a political party to corrupt voters their officers have simply committed the heinous crime of embezzlement and ought to be shrouded in stripes the balance of theirunwortby lives and the strong arm of the law of the proper jurisdiction should take hold of the companies themselves and either regulate or banish them but from the arguments that have been presented here by learned lawyers and the knowledge we all have of the constitution of the united states and of the powers reserved by the states to themselves when the union was created we are satisfied that it is within the province of the state and not of the nation to control insurance companies in my own state sir we have an insurance law that prohibits the transaction of business by any insurance company that is in a pool to fix prices made anywhere on earth for the purpose of doing business anywhere on earth in arkansas as long as that pool exists sir that has driven the oldline insurance companies that are in a pool to fix insurance prices from the borders of our state and if the state of arkansas has the power to do that as to the fire insurance corporations why has it not the power to enact a law that will do the very same thing for the life insurance companies i will answer the question myself sir it has the power and so has every other state in the union of states sirs i am persuaded that the disclosures made by the legislative committee in new york in their examination of this great question will awaken the conscience of the legislators of that state to the end that a law may be enacted at the next session of the legislature that will either control or banish the insurance companies that are now organized and doing business in that state if that is done this whole matter will be settled the question will be solved and insurance will come back to what it was wont to be in its incipiency a protection and not a fortunemaking business sir again i am inclined to think that the new officers that have been selected to preside over the destinies of these compailes will certainly be a little more careful will be a little wiser in the discharge of the duties they have assumed and especially so the president of the equitable association who was given a certificate of good character by the president of the united states when he sent him from his cabinet to become president of that institution sir he will not be unmindful of the certificate of good character that the president gave him to the extent of being willing to commit any act that will reflect upon the certificate or the man who so cordially gave it but this question as i said ought to be settled by the states it is a states rights question that none of us can get away from and that none of us who believe in the doctrine of independence ought to be willing to take from the states and give tb any other power on earth the states have complete power under existing constitutions to deny a corporation the privilege of doing business within its confines upon any terms and hence have power to say upon what terms they shall do business within them to take such power from the states by amendment of the national constitution would be a long step toward centralization of government and a wellaimed blow at the libertyrevering principle of states rights i for one am not ready to believe the peoples representatives who command the confidence of eighty million loyal patriots would rob their respective commonwealths of the power that they have under their own constitutions and under the constitution of the nation being a states rights advocate wanting to preserve every privilege and every power to the states that i possibly can that is consistent with good order and good government throughout the nation i protest against the thought of conceding the right of this government to control the insurance institutions of this country a gentleman of the committee said very properly the other daythe gentleman from kentucky that if you take the insurance control out of the hands of the states then and there you take the adjudication of all causes with them out of the local courts and sir the widows and orphans who are to be benefited by the policies of insurance would have to go into the united states court to collect them whenever payment from any technical or vicious cause was refused to do so would often take them great distances from their homes at great expense and inconvenience to themselves i think adjustments ought to be made by local courts upon questions of this kind and not put upon litigants the burden of having to go among strangers at great inconvenience and expense in order to get their rights adjudicated when they and those from whom they take have lived up to every feature of the contract that they are forced by a soulless corporation to sue upon we know the character of these great corporations whether they believe they can defeat a claim or not they will litigate in many instances for the purpose of delay for the purpose of withholding the money possibly to force a compromise that would be to their advantage sir i am violently opposed to any action that would bring about such an unfortunate and unfriendly condition to the insurance beneficiaries of my own proud state and hence protest most seriously against any effort on the part of congress to commit an act that would for a single moment take from the states of this union any of the power they now have to control the insurance associations of the land that come to their borders for the transaction of insurance business i will now leave the insurance question to the better judgment of the members of the committee and proceed to discuss the subject of railroadrate legislation for a short time i am in hearty sympathy with the president of the united states in his desire to have the interstate commerce commission given power to regulate rates whenever it finds them to be unreasonable unjust or discriminatory in their character sir i applaud his every utterance upon that line because they are right and i care not from whom righteous utterances come they are to be commended by an honest political foe as well as by friend i believe the president of the united states intends to do right upon all questions i believe his every purpose is to be president of the whole people of this union regardless of locality or condition and his only shortcoming seems to be that he sometimes allows the great corporations and trust interests of the country to pull the wool over his eyes for a season for instance when he allowed the standpatters upon the subjects of the tariff and railroadrate regulation to prevent him from calling an extra session of the fiftyninth congress in accordance with his openly and often expressed purpose in his recommendation to this body the president in his message to congress says in terms that the interstate commerce commission ought to be given the power to substitute a just and reasonable rate whenever upon hearing it finds that the railroads have fixed an unjust and unreasonable rate such rate so substituted by the interstate commerce commission to remain the rate unless and until it is reversed by a court of competent jurisdiction that sounds right in every sense of the word it is true that the railroads take issue with him why not i have never known a corporation or an individual so far as that is concerned who was engaged in wrongdoing who was exceeding the authority that he or it possessed but what complained whenever any authority any power saw fit to call a halt upon their wayward course take a criminal and he does not think the legislatures of the states ought to pass any law that would interfere with his wicked acts take the evilly disposed corporations and they think they ought to be given a loose rein that the bridle ought to be taken off so far as they are concerned and they left to do their worst they argue ingeniously in many instances when presenting their cause note some of their objections the president of the southern railroad some months ago undertook to prejudice the representatives of the south against the eschtownsend bill by saying that to pass that measure would take from the people of the south tie right by state legislation to provide for separate coaches for the two races i wonder if he thought we were a lot of fools in the south certainly he did not believe that we were destitute of legal learning we are wedded to the proposition of separate coaches for the two races and we have sense enough to know that under the constitution of the united states and under he constitutions of our own states we have power to pass and enforce a law providing for separate coaches and that congress can not interfere therewith therefore sir i have no fear upon that ground and there is nothing in that idle threat to deter us in our determination to stand by the president in his declaration upon the subject of railroadrate regulation it is consistent with every declaration of the democratic party upon the subject and hence there is no reason why we should be deterred in the performance of our duty simply because a republican president indorses the position of our own party upon the subject but the railroads in their arguments proceed on the theory that if the power be given to the interstate commerce commission to fix rates they will go into the ratemaking business specifically nobody contemplates any such authority being given it nobody understands for a moment that if it is given such authority as the president recommends the interstate commerce commission is going to get right down to rate making as a business it is understood that the commission is to have only such power as will permit it to substitute a reasonable or just rate whenever it finds that the railroads have fixed a rate whereby any community or individual will be prejudiced the commission must be given power to say to the railroad you shall not discriminate against this community in favor of that or in favor of this business as against that business that far it will go and no farther and yet the railroads proclaim from the house top that the government is going into the riftemaking business and that in doing so it is fixing to destroy them that whenever the commission is given the power to fix and substitute rates their property will be confiscated that their rights and privileges will be taken from them nothing of that kind is intended by anyone who is in favor of rate regulation the railroads contend that they know more about rate making than anyone else i suppose they do persons who have been long engaged in a given business are better informed concerning everything that pertains to that business than are others but we find that we have learned men in this country who can very easily adapt themselves to different kinds of business when called upon to do so therefore a president chosen by the people will in my judgment select only the kind of men that will be able to enter into the matter of fixing substitute rates that will be fair to both railroad and shipper without material delay or unusual embarrassment for nearly ten years the commission thought it had power to substitute a reasonable or just rate for an unreasonable or unjust one and it proceeded tc substitute without let or hindrance wherever it found them to be discriminatory in their character but in no instance did rates substituted by the commission become confiscators of railroad property or railroad rights the railroads seem to forget that the people have any rights at all when it comes to dealing with powerful corporations they seem to think that they have rights that are paramount to the rights of the people whenever their interests clash in any degree sir they forget that they have been kindly given certain privileges under the law that human beings do not enjoy they forget that by law they are given a perpetual lifesomething that god in his goodness did not accord to man they forget sir that they are exempt from many of the petty persecutions or prosecutions to which man is subjected they forget that they are excused from unhappy conditions that require the benefit of clergy but they do not seem to understand that we know that the reason of it is because the peculiar office of clergy is to administer to souls the railroads sir forget that we by law have given them the right to extend their selfish trail through homes that are as sacred to the owner as the grave they forget that we have given to them the right to ignore all boundary lines and all directions the individual can not ignore the sacredness of the home or ignore the boundary lines of his neighbor without suffering the severe pains and penalties of the law it is true that the railroads must go into court to obtain such benefits but they get them whenever they petition for them angels could get no more at the hands of the courts is if possible that beneficiaries who have received such superior benefits nt the hands of the people are now afraid of their generous benefactors or is it that they have grown so greedy and great that they now propose to declare themselves their masters and give them a kick at every turn of the road sir their arguments against rate substitution by the commission are so transparent and inconsistent that it easily enables us to understand and appreciate that they are simply trying to hoodwink the people of this country so that they will not become aroused to the point of studying the question for themselves knowing full well that if they do enter upon an investigation of the conditions as they actually exist they will rise up in their might and scourge them from their temple of usurped and arrogant power i have before me one of the various missionary tracts which they have sent to the various members of congress i suppose each and every one of you have received as many as a quarter of a dozen of these i did and i have received many pounds of this sort of literature one book i remember was gotten up very much like a novel as if it were a publication of that attractive character one of the arguments presented in this little tract is that we ought not to interfere with the railroads by giving the colnmission power to substitute rates because we would prevent their making special rates here and there in order to build up certain industries and give value to certain materials or products i will read from this pamphlet a few of their fallacious reasons as to why their rates should not be interfered with it is styled the facts about railroad rates one of the countless forms of this means by which railroads develop traffic occurred not long ago in indiana perhaps some of the indiana representatives may know of this transaction a resident of that state acquired control of an invention for making butter dishes from shaved veneer cut from timber it was discovered that sweet gum a previously worthless wood was best adapted to the new industry a study of the needs of the new business showed that to enable it to be successful a rate 25 per cent lower on this timber than on other kinds was necessary such a rate was promptly made with the result of building up a new and profitable industry giving employment to labor and capital and giving value to a natural product that had previously had no value mark these words gentlemen to a natural product that had previously had no value sir i live in a state where we have a great quantity of sweet gum about which they write i know that we have not been able to buy a single thousand of the lumber cut from this particular kind of natural product without paying 10 per thousand for it since the dingley bill became a law therefore when they say that within the last few years they have discovered that they could give value to a natural product that had heretofore had no value they state something gentlemen that they do not expect the people generally to believe but they think that by making the broad declaration that they have enabled this particular concern to build up its business by giving a 25 per cent cut they will encourage some one to think that his particular locality or his particular business will be given a cut which will enable him to increase the value or production of his business and thereby catch a sucker with that sort of selfish bait sir that is a fallacious statement because sweet gum could not be bought in the wildest territory in the state i come from for less than 10 a thousand before the indiana enterprise was organized it had that value before the ratemaking question was a subject of serious discussion it had a good value long before they thought of producing this kind of argument it has such a value now that the sawmill owners are growing independent while the people who buy the lumber are impoverished in proportion to the extra price they have to pay for the gum lumber that they must have to build the ordinary cabin that protects them from the blasts of winter and the floods that fall from gods sky the republican high tariff has done more to make the price of gum lumber go up than all of the 25 per cent reductions the railroads have given all of the lumber concerns in the world but sir let us look at some more of their funny argument i suppose they wanted to scare the congressmen from georgia wheon they put this particular thing in their little pamphlet a merchant in marietta can ship certain goods to chattanooga for 15 cents per hundred to knoxville for 19 cents per hundred to ship the same goods to atlanta he must pay 30 cents per hundred to macon 70 cents per hundred atlanta is 20 miles from marietta chattanooga is 128 miles and yet the chattanooga merchant pays just onehalf the freight the atlanta merchant does why because chattanooga is out of the state and atlanta is in it this is merely one of a hundred instances where georgia points are placed at a positive disadvantage in freight rates because they are located in the state i suppose they meant to say that because atlanta and macon are located in a state where they have a railroad commission is the reason for this state of things sir if this argument is true i want to say that georgia certainly has an inferior railroad commission because it surely has the power to control all of the rates for the shipment of freight from one point in the state of georgia to another and it strikes me that wherever their attention was called to the fact that they had to pay for a distance of 20 miles twice as much as persons living in chattanooga 120 miles away they would call a meeting of the commission at once and change the infamous rate and say to them you can not rob the people of our state in any such way if you are able to carry a commodity for people of another state 128 miles for 15 cents by the eternal you can not come to our state and rob our people by charging them twice as much for a 20mile haul gentlemen from georgia what kind 6f railroad commission have you in your state why sir look at the inconsistency of their argument why if that were the case are they complaining against giving the interstate commerce commission power to fix rates why should they howl about that they have a commission in georgia with power to fix rates and the railroads argue that it is hampering the material interests of that state because they do have the commission why is it if they can get higher rates for themselves in georgia with a commission than they indicate they could get if there were no commission there that they do not throw their arms wide open and welcome the proposition of giving the interstate commerce commission the power to regulate unjust discriminations in freight rates it strikes me that that is the course they ought to pursue if they want to be consistent they also reach far out in their funny argument and talk about governmental ownership of railroads or tell us what happened in canada where they have governmental ownership they say things dont always pan out as the theorists think they will the government of canada after operating the intercolonial railway for years at a loss has just announced an increase of rates all along the line to the disgust of persons who imagine government ownership means lower rates why that argument who is there in this congress either branch of it that is advocating government ownership of railroads sir if i understand it aright those of the members of this body who are favorable to railroadsand i believe all of us areare trying to keep them from going into the hands of the government none of us want the government to own a single line of railroad we want the corporations or the individuals wherever they possess them to operate them but we want them to operate them in accordance with wisdom in accordance with justice to every man alike recognizing that none should have favoritism extended to them as against their fellows they also argue that we are blessed with lower rates in this country than they are in any other country that is no argument i expect we have the best of most everything that is going so far as that is concerned because we have a superior citizenship and a government that surpasses that of any other nation on earth therefore i appirehend that because we have lower rates than they have in other countries is no argument at all as to why we should not have the power to fix a given rate when we find that the railroads have fixed an unjust rate when we find that they have fixed an unreasonable rate when we find that they have fixed a discriminatory rate sir one reason we have better rates in this country than they have elsewhere is that the hauls are better here than in other countries there is no nation on earth that has such long hauls as we have and they do not have as great hauls as ours in quantity where our hauls are measured by the thousands of miles theirs are measured by the hundreds and where our freight is measured by carloads or trainloads theirs is measured by the hundred pounds or the ton sir it looks to me as though we ought to have better rates here than elsewhere if we can furnish them better conditions to haul on than they can elsewhere therefore sir their argument along that line is not worth the consideration of an idler even i am reminded that they also argue that they are not unjust in fixing their rates that they are trying to do right and are doing right according to their contention but sir i am just in receipt of a letter from the fort smith traffic bureau of my deoeaberu 20 state that gives a different statement of facts to those presented by the railroads and as they are interested in a sense not finaiicially interested to the extent the railroads are i am bound to take their conclusions or their findings in this matter in preference to the conclusions or findings of the railroads upon the subject i read on page 3 of the letter the traffic problem is not that all rates are in themselves too high but that gross and damaging discrimination exists as result of unequal adjustment between cities and communities the duty of a common carrier is to receive and transport without favoritism or discrimination goods from one point to another transportation being subject to such reasonale rules and regulations as may be required cities like st louis memphis kansas city and chicago are given a very low basis of freight rates into a certain territory while for the same distance the rates from little rock fort smith texarkana etc are from 25 to 50 per cent higher such basis acts as a direct discrimination in restraint of interstate commerce against the smaller cities to the benefit of the larger to illustrate we will take the drygoods interests five large wholesale houses being located at fort smith with more than onehalf million capital invested cotton piece goods is an important item in this line the majorportion of which originates in new england moving through new york boston and philadelphia via rail and ocean to memphis st louis fort smith little rock etc by way of savannah ga or galveston tex fort smith is 300 miles farther west than is memphis the distance from galveston to fort smith being less than to memphis or st louis yet the rate on cotton piece goods from new york and points taking same route to fort smith is 31 cents in excess of the rate applying to memphis take hobart okla which is 487 miles from fort smith and 720 miles from memphis the rate applying on cotton piece goods from memphis to hobart is 1 03 from fort smith to hobart 1 34 you will note that while fort smith is 233 nearer flobart 0kla than is memphis the rate applying on cotton piece goods from fort smith is 31 cents in excess of the rate applying from memphis sir tell me that that is not a fair evidence of an unjust rate tell me that it is not clear as the sunshine to the naked eye when all cloud and mist have been removed the idea of charging 31 cents more to take a commodity from a given community to another community when it is 233 miles nearer than it is to the other shipping point is so unjust that it strikes me on its face that any man i care not who or how biased he may be ought to be able to say that it is discriminatory in an extreme degree yet they come to us and indicate that they are doing nothing that prejudices any community that prejudices any individual and that their purpose is to do right under any and all circunistances sirs none of you can hold to that belief if you will investigate the matter yourselves and see where these discriminations exist from memphis to catoosa ind t 453 miles the rate applying on cotton piece goods is 85 cents the rate on the same coinmodity from fort smith for a distance of 453 miles is 1 23 thus giving to the community of memphis a discriminatory rate as against the community of fort smith in the district that i represent the railroads make glaring discriminations they give a rate of 25 cents per barrel of flour from st louis to my home town helena ark while they charge more than twice that much to a point in the district 125 nilles nearer st louis such a discrimination is nothing short of robbery committed against the citizens of the nearer point i want my home folks to do well on all occasions but i do not want them to prosper if other people who are just as good must be robbed in order that they may do so ah gentlemen these things speak for themselves and it seems to me that under no circumstances could a man believe that the railroads are doing right when we find such discriminations as these but their arguments go further and they endeavor to show that they are conducting themselves correctly now i will read just a little of the evidence they are using to support their contentions mr 0 p bacon who is the chief legislative agent of those who wish to confer ratemaking authority upon the commission on december 9 1904 while addressing the committee on interstate and foreign commerce of the house of representatives was asked whether he had heard of any proceedings against the railroads in the matter of rebate and he replied as follows i have not heard of any occasion for proceedings it has been so generally observed by the railroads since its passage that there has been no occasion for prosecution now the railroads knowing that we understand that mr e p bacon is on the side of the president on the side of all rightthinking individuals of this nation on the side of the democratic party as declared in three national platforms upon the subject of regulating rates knowing that we know that his purpose is to give the interstate commerce commission power to fix rates i can not understand why they give us this little snatch of his testimony before that committee and withhold the other we all know in spite of what mr bacon said to the committee that these same railroads are being indicted today for giving rebates indicted in kansas city mo in philadelphia and god only knows in how many other places they could be indicted if people would tell the truth and officers do their duty i can not realize why they give this sort of testimony unless it is for the purpose of confusing our minds and leading us who do not have everyday transactions with them to believe that they are doing the correct thing in the matter of fixing rates railroad rates like the dingley tariff are fixed too high is why rebates can be given and yet a profit be made on the freight transported let the railroads fix and publish a proper reasonable and just rate and the interstate commerce commission will never make a rate no matter how great their power to do so railroads certainly would not give a rebate that would work a loss to them therefore the rebate rate must be just and remunerative to them and they certainly ought not to complain if the commission wishes to adopt a rate that they themselves have promulgated as a reasonable and just rate they also tell us that we ought to allow competition to regulate rates there is no known power of prophecy about me but i possess some of the elements of guessing therefore i will not attempt to prophesy but will venture the guess that railroad competition in this country is a thing of the past yes sir i believe it has taken the wings of the morning and flown to the uttermost parts of the sea now there is one other subject that i desire to refer to with no intention whatever of wounding the feelings of anyone in connection therewith and that is in reference to a bill that was introduced at a former day of the session of this congress by mr bennet of new york in which he seeks to reduce the representation of the state of arkansas from seven to five congressmen i represent a portion of the state of arkansas and i entered into a solemn compact with myself a great many years ago never to know of its being reflected upon by anyone without undertaking to explain the situation that brought about the reflection or else to repudiate the reflection if it was false sir this bill seeks to reduce the representation of the state of arkansas from seven to live for what purpose the bill goes on to indicate that it is because the legislature of the state has violated in the enactment of our election laws the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the united states sir this matter has never been carried to the supreme court of the united states from our state for determination but there is a provision in our election law that provides that a citizen before he shall become a voter or have the privilege of the ballot shall pay 1 for a poll tax in other words he must pay a poll tax before lie can vote the money received for the poll tax goes into the educational fund of the state and the voters children are educated partially with it that is the only qualification that the arkansas statute possesses that under any circumstances would be held to restrict the vote of any male human being after he has arrived at the age of 21 years except where convicted of a crime of heinous character now sir that is all that arkansas has done in what sense has she violated the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the united states i understand that other southern states have the same provision in their election laws and that the question has been before the supreme court of the united states from those states and that it was held to be constitutional and not in conflict with the provision of the amendment that i have just mentioned if the polltax provisions are not in violation of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the united states how can arkansass provision be i find sir in other states of the union that certain provisions are within the statutes of those states that seem to me would come nearer conflicting with this provision than ours and yet no one has seen fit to introduce a bill to reduce their representation for instance the state of new hampshire requires the payment of all taxes assessed against a voter for a period of one year before voting and will not allow paupers to vote there they not only have to pay a poll tax but they have to pay all their taxes we do not require that other taxes be paid we do not prohibit the voter from voting because he is poor a man may be ever so humble be ever so poor if he has a dollar with which to pay the poll tax he can walk up to the polls and vote like a king massachusetts requires that the voter shall be able to read the constitution of the commonwealth in the english language and to write his name except where precluded from reading or writing by reason of physical defects or he had the right to vote on the 1st day of may 1857 it strikes me gentlemen that there is a clear grandfather clause in the election law of that state and a clause requiring a voter to be a scholar and yet we hear of no one wanting to reduce its representation in congress connecticut requires a voter to be able to read a section of the constitution or a section of the statutes of the state before he can vote pennsylvania requires ail county or state taxes to be paid before her voters can vote except when the voter is dead at the time he votes while poor old arkansas as stated simply requires the voter to pay a poll tax of 1 with which his children are to be educated so that they will be qualified to vote when they see fit to change their domicile from arkansas to connecticut or massachusetts i can not to save myself understand the heart or head of a representative that could want the representation of arkansas reduced when she requires no more of a voter than that he pay the small sum of 1 to help educate his own children before he exercises the privilege of voting and at the same time oppose the reduction of representation of massachusetts connecticut new hampshire and pennsylvania that require so much more of their voters oh i suppose the difference is to be found in the fact that arkansas is in the south and massachusetts connecticut new hampshire and pennsylvania are in the north and the gentleman who introduced the bill comes from the north if northern representatives can afford to father such a partisan species of legislation we of the grand state of arkansas can stand it we do not want to control the elections of any other state but by all of the powers that a just god has given us we will control our own and we will do it for the best interests of all of the people of the state now i am done with the unpleasant subject but sir in closing permit me to slightly paraphrase the effusions of the verse maker and say let the howlers howl and the growlers growl let the prowlers prowl and the gaudy gewgaws go it for behind the night there is plenty of light and the people of old arkansas are all rightthank godand i know it"], [0.045670390129089355, 0.9543296098709106, 1, "i rise for the purpose of speaking in support of the pending bill it is a maxim of the law that where there is a wrong there is a remedy it is a little remarkable that in a broad and comprehensive system of jurisprudence like that of the united states this maxim is found to be mere fiction when applied to interstate railroads here we have wrongs and abuses for which the law has provided no ample remedy the laws now upon our statute books intended to correct such abuses have proven powerless and i consider the enactment of additional legislation which will guarantee a more effectual control and regulation of the rates of interstate railroads as the most important subject of legislation before the american congress today unlike the question of federal control of insurance so eloquently and ably discussed at the beginning of this session and concerning which there was expressed such wide difference of opinion in this case there is and can be no doubt as to our constitutional authority to act there is and can be no doubt as to our jurisdiction over the subjectmatter in article i section 8 of the federal constitution it is declared among other things that congress shall have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states by this provision of the organic law the states by express terms have delegated to congress the power to regulate commerce between the several states and thus and thereby lodged in congress the power to supervise control and regulate the rates of railroads and other common carriers engaged in interstate commerce the legislatures of the states have no power to legislate upon the subject the courts of the states or of the united states have no legislative powers or legislative functions the responsibility for such legislation rests upon congress and upon congress alone we are here as the representatives of the american people and from every quarter whether we be democrats or republicans our constituentsthe american producer the american shipper and the american public generallyare demanding such legislation at our hands the people are aggrieved they feel that an injustice has been done them andis being done thema by the railroads and they are demanding relief it is hardly fair for us on this side of the chamber to claim that this sentiment is wholly democratic because forsooth this proposed legislation has been demanded in three of our national democratic platforms it is hardly fair for you on the other side of the aisle to claim that it is wholly republican because it has been twice submitted to congress by a republican president it is more acenrate to state that this sentiment knows no party lines and is circumscribed by no party bounds but that it is a truly american sentiment it stands for justice it stands for fair play there seems to be a widespread misapprehension on the part of the railroad people and their reprefebruaity 3 sentatives as to what the american public is demanding and as to what the american congress is seeking to do it is not the purpose of anybody so far as i am advised to clothe the interstate commerce commission or any other administrative body with authority to initiate rates or revise general schedules of railroad companies that is a matter that is to be left primarily to the railroads as now and so long as they refrain from violating existing law by charging extortionate unreasonable and discriminatory rates or giving preferential rates or giving rebates it is not proposed that the interstate commerce commission or any other body should interfere with their established rates and schedules the sole purpose of this legislation so far as it relates to the fixing of rates as i understand it is to enlarge the powers of the interstate commerce commission so as to authorize such commission upon complaint made by any shipper or other person aggrieved to inquire into the alleged violation of law and if after a full and fair investigation of all the facts it is ascertained that the law has been violated then to set aside the unlawful rate and to substitute in lieu thereof a reasonable rate which shall take effect immediately upon notice and shall remain in force until annulled by a court of competent jurisdiction is there anything harsh revolutionary or unreasonable in that proposition why should it not be done in this country of ours founded upon principles of equality and justice why should one person or one corporation be permitted in plain violation of law to deal unfairly and unjustly with another person or corporation or with a community and yet the injured party have no redress and no remedy under the law concede that the railroads intend absolute fairness is it not possible for the traffic managers or ratemaking agencies of the railroads to make mistakes do they not err is it not possible for them by accident or inadvertence to impose an unjust rate upon some shipper if so then is it not right in case of disagreement between the railroad companies and the injured shipper that there should be some public disinterested tribunal some agency established by the government wherein and whereby the injured shipper may have a remedy may redress the wrong and be relieved of the hardship and injustice done him to my mind the proposition is selfevident but when we are confronted with the real situation namely that the managers of railroads like other men are possessed of selfishness and greed except perhaps in a more marked degree when we review the history of the railroads and contemplate the numerous instances of injustice and oppression that they have imposed upon their patrons and customersthen the demand for such legislation rests not alone upon expediency but upon the high ground of imperative public necessity but we were told the other day by the distinguished gentleman from pennsylvania that he was opposed to this bill because he believed this bill was a step in favor of government ownership and had a socialistic tendency about it the distinguished gentleman made a magnificent argument based upon that premise but i submit that his premise is false i submit the very contrary of this premiseis true this legislation instead of furthering socialism and being a step toward government ownership will result as a check upon that growlag sentiment it is not the advocacy of this legislation that has created in the public mind in america these socialistic tendencies and by way of digression permit me to suggest the real cause i want to say here that i have no prejudice against railroads nor against corporations but i can not say as much concerning the corrupt management of these great and useful corporations by men who are using thefl as instrumentalities of oppression as a means of exploiting the public and the stockholders the me calls the mccurdys the rogerses the rockefellers and the morgans are the men that are sowing in this fair land the seeds of anarchy and revolution henry h rogers may defy for a time the courts of the great state of missouri he may twit attorneygeneral hadley as a young man seeking notoriety attorneygeneral hadley will easily attain his purpose if such it be and that may not disturb mr rogers in the least but these masters of finance should remember that while the exposures made by folk and by hughes and by hadley have brought not only notoriety but substantial renown to these heroic advocates of civic virtue behind it all is an intelligent outraged independent people who believe in law and order who have imposed upon themselves the burdens of taxation to maintain courts and uphold the law who will not long tolerate the defiance of law and courts by the greatly rich in this country we have in america a feudalism not of landed estates but of trusts there has been permitted to grow up under our system a class of unrestricted monopolies that have amassed great wealth by secret understandings by pools by consolidations and by combinations commonly known as trusts they have unified these moneyed interests and have concentrated into the hands of a few men the power to dominate vast aggregations of wealth these few men constitute the lords of the manor in american finance the people are the vassals and in lieu of military service which none of us would render in their unholy cause we are compelled to pay a money tribute to these financial brigands these marauding chiefs of high finance who with the stride of a colossus stalk up and down the continent unrestrained by law and with the iron heel of tyranny trample under foot the rights of the people i submit to the distinguished gentleman from pennsylvania that it is this condition of affairs that is creating in the public mind these socialistic and anarchistic tendencies if you please and not the advocacy of wholesome measures of legislation such as the one now under consideration i have no prejudice as i have already said against the railroads they have been great and mighty factors in building up our country nobody wants to destroy them without them we could never have attained the onehundredth part of the prosperity we now enjoy they have been the means of building up our large cities of developing and settling up our great states and of rendering the american republic the brightest jewel in the civilization of the world we owe much to the railroads but while it is true that the public owes much to the railroads the railroads owe everything to the public no association of men or of corporations could afford to own any great line of railroad for their own private use however great their fortunes or their industries the railroad lives thrives and derives its profits from the public it owes to that public a duty and that is to deal fairly with it not to impose an unjust burden upon its patrons as a whole and not to resort to discriminations between individuals and between communities those engaged in this line of business have amassed colossal fortunes i hope i will not offend the pride of any of the railroad dignitariesthese fortunate possessors of predatory wealth some of whose daughters have intermarried with the nobility of europebut i propose to deal in some plain facts i propose to define the true status of the railroad and the railroad people in the body politic the railroad is a corporation it is a common carrier and its duties and functions md obligations are the same as those of common carriers of two hundred years ago these managers and high officials of railroads are sometimes called captains of industry the railroad derives its power to act from the charter granted to it by the state it is a creature of law and has no inalienable rights there is nothing sacred about it it is not divine in origin its owners are not descended from kings or princes their work is menial in the strictest sense of the term they work for hire notwithstanding the bright lights the gilded finishings and the velvet furnishings of its palace cars and the aweinspiring swiftness of its powerful locomotives the railroad in its functions and purposes is a common carrier and in its mission it is merely the successor of the dray cart the pack mule the road wagon and the old stagecoach and these captains of industry that we hear so much about are the lineal descendants as it were of the draymen the mule driver the teamster and the grandiloquent stage driver of the olden times then on what meat does this our cmsar feed that he is grown so great that he should demand that lie above all other men and that his interests above all other interests in this country should be held in complete immunity and exemption from the provisions of the law but we are told that while congress has the constitutional authority to legislate upon this subject we can not enact a law empowering a commission or administrative board with authority to fix a rate without violating the constitution this i deny i contend that when the people of the states delegated to congress the power to regulate interstate commerce reserving to themselves no limitation whatever that that carried with it the full power and authority to enact whatever legislation might be necessary in order to carry into force and effect these delegated powers i claim that in legislating upon this subject congress has all the powers that the british parliament which is unrestricted by coustitutional limitations has id legislating upon any subject before that body i claim that congress has all the power to legislate upon this subject that the people of the several states have in establishing or modifying their state constitutions over matters and things not inhibited by the federal constitution i have not time to quote the decisions in support of this proposition but will cite the cases of mcculloch v maryland 4 wheaton 315 stone et al v farmers loan and trust coigpany 116 united states 307 reagan v farmers loan and trust company 154 united states 362 but to all of this the railroads are opposed they tell us that the rate making is an exceedingly complicated subject this is admitted on all sides i am not going to take the position that it is not but 1 am going to take the position that it is not an incomprehensible subject i believe that other men and other agents save and except those engaged in railroading can comprehend can understand this subject as well as the railroad people i believe the railroads have exaggerated the difficulties of this complex subject with a view to covering up from the public a clear insight into their inequitable system of rate making even judge grosscup of the united states circuit court of appeals for whose opinions i have the highest respect and whose proposed plan of regulating rates i have carefully considered seems to have been led into a serious error on this subject he has taken the position that the united states courts as now constituted ate incompetent tribunals to try these railroad cases partly on account of being engrossed with other business and partly on account of the complicated nature of rate schedules he is led into the further error of advocating the establishment of a separate cour4 to be known as the transportation court he further recommends the selection of the judges of this court or at least that some of them be selected from the railroad peoplefrom the traffic men of the railroads i suppose for they know most about rate schedules this is the very point we desire to avoid the fixing of rates is now in the hands of the agents and trafficmanagers of the railroads i do not say that they always do injustice i do not believe they always do injustice they may fix just and reasonable rates in a hundred cases but if at the same time they fix unjust and unreasonable rates in any smaller number of cases those persons and corporations against whom such unjust and unreasonable rates are imposed are entitled to redress under any just system of government and we as lawmakers on account of the complexity of the subject ought not to be deterred from providing ample means for such relief there is much division of opinion on the subject due largely i think to the efforts of the railroads to forestall further legislation several months ago they instituted a campaign of literature against this proposed legislation no candidate for public office no chairman of a political organization in a heated campaign was ever morediligent and persistent in sending out literature circulars and documents than have been the railroads in their campaign against this proposed measure during the whole summer and fall day after day they poured literature of all kinds in opposition to governmental regulation and governmental rate making in upon my desk and i suppose upon the desk of every other member of this housenewspaper clippings magazine articles books papers and periodicals in one pamphlet are given the names of over 400 shippers who registered their opposition to it but a close analysis of this publication discloses that most of the organizations protesting are privy to the railroads in fact i have come into the possession of an elaborate library upon the subject and they have not contented themselves with sending out the works and productions of railroad economists published on this side of the atlantic i received an english textbook on this subject written by one william ackworth of london in this book is one whole chapter devoted to the futility of parliamentary interference the distinguished gentleman from massachusetts who opposes this bill on yesterday quoted mr ackworth as a leading authority upon railroad economics in england now i desire to pay my respects to this distinguished author railroad rate making is generally considered to be complicated but according to this distinguished writer it is very simplein fact as simple as the spanish doctors art of the practice of medicine i read the story in gil bias there lived in madrid a physician who had grown very rich in the practice of medicine he had about his office a young man employed to do his choresto build the fires and sweep his floorsfor whom he had formed a peculiar attachment so he took the young man aside one day and told him that he desired to make a doctor of him the young man insisted that he did not have sufficient education that he knew nothing about anatomy or hygiene or physiology or a hundred other things pertaining to medical science the old doctor said young man that matters not i am now going to give you the whole secret of the art of the practice of medicine in a few words it consists in copiously bleeding the patient and then giving him great drafts of hot water now this distinguished railroad economist mr w m ackworth of london clears up this whole mystified subject of rate making in a few words he says it consists in charging what the traffic will bear in other words like the spanish doctors universal remedy it consists in copiously bleeding the shipper and then giving him great drafts of not hot titer but hot air when he makes a complaint this distinguished author also says that this system of rate making has been adopted by all the great railroads of europe and the american railroads le says that for some reason not very obvious to him the expression charging what the traffic will bear has fallen into disrepute and he gives it as his candid opinion that if the railroads at the outset instead of using that expression bad adopted another and said that theytempered the wind to the shorn lamb that they could have proceeded with the identical methods they are now adopting and it would have been very popular with the people i can not subscribe to such doctrine it will deceive nobody such silly effort to belittle the intelligence of the masses is unworthy of a great writer for beneath the plain apparel of the common people beat hearts as brave and true as were ever covered by royal purple or by cloth of gold and from their humble abodes have sprung the masters of thought in every age and country you can not deceive them on this freightrate question by telling them that you temper the winds to the shorn lamb away with such sophistry no gentle words will relieve the burden of him who bears upon his neck a cruel yoke no gentle words will rend the shackles of him who is chained like prometheus to a rock and no shifting of phrases or juggling with words will lessen the burden of the miner the miller the farmer the fruit grower the merchant or other producer or the shipper whose profits are exhausted by extortionate or discriminatory charges and who is thus ground down under an unjust and unlawful system of railroad rates instituted and enforced against him in defiance of and in plain violation of law the only remedy for this lastnamed form of oppression will be found in additional and more effectual legislation concerning interstate railroad rates congress has the power to afford this remedy and i am in favor of exercising that power to the full extent i believe that we should pass this bill which enacted into law will give to the interstate commerce commission full power and authority to deal with every question of inequality or injustice growing out of or incidental to our interstate commerce the provisions of this bill apply not only to interstate railroads but also to private cars terminal lines and express companies engaged in interstate commerce i think that the committee on interstate commerce and the country at large are to be congratulated upon the fact that the passage of this measure has been recommended by the unanimous report of this great committee consisting of eighteen members including both democrats and republicans i for one in compliment to said committee shall vote for the bill as submitted to the house without modification or amendment enact this law and you will have stricken a herculean blow against that sentiment in this country in favor of municipal ownership so recently manifested in the mayoralty elections of the great cities of chicago and new york do this and when congress adjourns and you return to your respective homes whether you hail from maine or texas washington or florida or from the great states of the middle west or mississippi valley whether you be democrat or republican i believe you will receive the plaudits of a grateful constituency who will approve your course and who in emphasis of such approval will grapple you to their hearts with hooks of steel and commend you as devoted faithful servants of the plain people"], [0.05038869380950928, 0.9496113061904907, 1, "i am not misrepresenting the gentleman the gentleman undertakes to dodge it and there is no dodging the result of his proposition he knows what lie said and this house knows if his proposition is a correct one the man who comes with a buddhist bible and undertakes to tear down the christian churches of this country and to erect the temples of buddha on their ruins is a desirable addition to the population of our land the juggernaut of commercialism is being erected by that same body of men who today are trying to crush out american laborers with illiterate foreign labor and for the sermon on the mount they would substitute the philosophy of confucius i appeal to you of the south you of the land which has been baptized in the blood of your ancestors and of your brothers in their struggle for our white civilization the land which so far has been kept free from contamination to keep it spotless as a goodly heritage for your children why gentlemen i would read if i had time a clipping from one of the daily papers showing that in one of the towns of north carolina within the last few days a band of italians terrorized that town and the police and citizenship had to be called out and the town placed under martial law gentlemen of the south we believe that we have partially solved one race question we believe that by the help of the eternal god and our own intelligence the race problem with which we have had to contend is to a very great extent settled but if you allow this horde of italians austrians hungarians syrians bohemians and others of that class to come in great numbers then you are giving us a greater race problem than that which your intelligence and your patriotism have already solved i appeal to you gentlemen not to allow that day to come there is not a man living who understands the colored man in the south like the southern white man that colored man recognizesthe caucasian as his superior but there is not a negro in the south but what thinks that the dago as he calls him is his inferior and when the two races meet in great numbers there will be the devil to pay gentlemen this is a serious proposition i have nothing against foreigners many of the best friends i have are foreigners just a few months ago i appointed to annapolis a splendid young german from one of my counties after having first tendered the place to an excellent young jew of my own city but why is it that the desirable immigration from northwestern europe is ceasing to come to our borders it has been shown by those who have been investigating the conditions there that the very decrease in the splendid immigration from northwestern europe has been brought about by the influx of italians syrians austrians hungarians and others from that part of europe the immigrant from northwestern europe is not illiterate of the germans only about 4 per cent of those over 14 years of age are unable to read and write of the irish and scotch only about 3 per cent and of the english and scandinavian only about 1 per cent while of the south italians more than 56 per cent can not even read their own language gentlemen try to deceive the southern farmer into wanting italians for work on the farm who ever heard of a dago doing well on the farm you will find them herding together in the cities running push carts and fruit stands and hand organs and crowding together in tenement houses breeding disease and sending forth the seeds of death upon every passing breeze you all remember that when yellow fever was devastating new orleans the papers were full of statements as to how the italians were concealing its victims in their ranks and hiding their dead from those who would stay the progress of the terrible disease gentlemen do you call that class of people a desirable population the real farmers among the italians are from northern italy and as only 14 per cent of them are illiterate but few would be excluded by this bill let us see what is really the provision of the bill about which gentlemen rant and rave like they were mad here is that part of the section providing for the educational test sec 38 that no alien over 16 years of age physically capable of reading shall be admitted to the united states until he has proved to the satisfaction of the proper inspection officers that he can read english or some other language or dialect and the secretary of commerce and labor is hereby authorized and directed to prescribe from time to time such methods and rules as he may think best for the purpose of testing the ability of such immigrants to read provided that an admissible alien over 16 years of age or a person now or hereafter in the united states of like age may bring in or send for his wife his mother his grandmother his afflianced wife his father who is over 55 years of age or his grandfather if they are otherwise admissible whether they are able to read or not and such persons shall be permitted to land provided further that a daughter not exceeding 2 1 years of age o1 a son not exceeding 18 years of age otherwise adinssible if accompanying an admissible alien father or mother shall be permitted to land whethersaid daughter or son is able to read or not can gentlemen say that there is anything unreasonable in that a few weeks ago the gentleman from new york in a speech on this floor sneered at the illiteracy in the district of the gentleman fron kentucky we have many illiterates all over the south both white and black our people are poor a little more than a generation ago we emerged from one of the most terrible wars that ever drenched any land with the blood of its sons the old confederate soldier came hobbling home to find wreck and destruction on every side and starvation staring him and his family in the face but with nothing but his faith in the eternal god and his own unconquered will and energy he went to work to recover his ruined fortunes he had nothing with which to educate even his own children and yet the vicissitudes of war had thrust upon him the duty of educating not only his own but also those of his former slaves this duty he has striven and struggled to perform without a murmur the white people of the south have paid 90 per cent of the taxes and yet the colored man has had an equal share of these taxes in the education of his children now if the gentleman from new york has spoken truly when he taunted us with illiteracy in the south will you representatives of a southern constituency by your votes aid in bringing in a third race of illiterates to be educated by your poor struggling constituents is it fair to the poor farmer the blacksmith or the mechanic to tax their little homes to educate the children of the dago while our own nativeborn sons and daughters are growing up in ignorance gentlemen these poles hungarians syrians and italians are not the ones who send you here the proof shows that many of them do not become citizens or taxpayers but that as soon as they accumulate a little money they either return with it or send it back to their native land it has been shown that to hungary alone more than 50 000 000 was sent last year from this country most of them do not try to assimilate with our people but they are taught by their priests and their ministers from the very hour they laud on our shores not to renounce or forget their allegiance to the fatherland not so with the english the german and other people from northwestern europe they come seeking homes for themselves and their families i have many of them in cullman county in my district and they are an honest intelligent and industrious citizenship such as they are i welcome to our country and only wish we had more of them they have made cullman county to blossom as the rose and i am proud of them they are my friends and i rejoice in their friendship they have made our country their country our people are their people and our god is their god they have cast their lots beneath southern skies on alabama soil they have erected their homes and as an alabamian i bid them welcome but gentlemen they are very different from the dirty bohemian who vends decayed bananas and pushes a hand organ on the streets of our cities not all italians are illiterate or bad and i would not exclude them merely because of their name as good a friend as i have in my home city was born beneath italian skies so excellent a character does he bear that he is a member of one of the secret orders to which i myself belong and as a brother i am glad to meet and greet him and were all italians like mike costa i would never raise my voice against their admission but i have no doubt but that he would join me in my desire to shut out the illiterate hordes from entering our sunny south i do not subscribe to the doctrine of america for americans alone to those who come to help build up our national wealth and at the same time to help elevate and adorn our citizenship i say throw wide the doors but to those who come with the black hand or the mafia or who come to take away our wealth to build up foreign lands i say shut and bar the gates who is it that wants them it is not the laboring man for he has expressed his views in no uncertain sound i will here insert in the record resolutions passed by the federation of labor and by the brotherhood of railroad trainmen they are as follows a further check should be put upon assisted immigration the law now permits the passage of an alien to be paid by any relative or friend living in this country every employer who wants to bring in cheap laborers is of course a friend to them or can find somebody to play the part it is one of the readiest means of evading the contractlabor law the privilege of paying the passage of others should be restricted to the nearest relativesfathers mothers and children brothers and sisters husbands and wives in accordance with the views here outlined we recommend that you authorize your officers to use all honorable means for the amendment of our immigration laws so as to exclude persons physically unfit to check the evil of assisted immigration to introduce an educational test and to provide that ports of entry shall be confined to those on the atlantic and pacific oceans and the gulf of mexico resolution passed by the brotherhood of railroad trainmen at its seventh biennial convention held at buffalo n y may 1905 whereas the rdpublican party platforms of 1896 and 1900 contained planks favoring the further restriction of immigration and whereas the representatives of that party have been in complete control of the congress of the united states for the past ten years and have failed to carry out these pledges therefore be it resolved by the brotherhood of railroad trainmen in seventh biennial coinvention assembled at buffalo n y this rith day of may 1905 that we criticise the representatives of the republican party in congress for their failure to make good their pledges with regard to legislation for a further restriction of immigration it is not the farmers who want them for in their latest national congress they spoke out in the resolution which i here insert in the record resolved that we urge upon congress the importance of further judicious regulation of immigration and in particular demand the enactment of a law raising the present head tax upon immigrants and excluding absolutely immigrants of poor physique and those unable to read in some language the test in the bill now under consideration meets just the proposition stated in this resolution and yet gentlemen representing farmers are trying to defeat it under the rule adopted for consideration of this bill there can be no record vote in my opinion this rule was brought in by the enemies of the educational test with the deliberate purpose of allowing gentlemen to oppose the educational test without their constituents finding it out and i fear that there are some voting against a restricted immigration that will be denying it before five years shall have come and gone it is not because i look down upon the man who can not read that i favor this bill many of the best friends that i ever had were totally illiterate but they were reared in the midst of american civilization and from their youth up have drank of the fountain of liberty and have eaten the fruits of american freedom the report of the commissioner of immigration shows that during the last fiscal year 1 026 499 immigrants landed on our shores and up to the 1st of june of this year more than 950 000 landed so that the number this year will be even greater than that of last think of it gentlemen nearly two and a quarter millions of foreigners landing on our shores in two years of the 1 026 499 landing last year 239 091 could not even read their own language nearly all these illiterates came from austriahungary italy russia and other eastern and southeastern european countries think of it gentlemen and say whether the future american citizenship is to be made up of such as thesepeople who have no idea of our american system of government and are totally unable to prepare themselves for the duties of american voters already there are 5 000 000 foreign males in america of voting age out of an entire voting population of about 16 000 000 then what will it be if the present rate of increase continues for ten years more we now have the opportunity of at least miultigating the evil of too many undesirable immigrants and if we let this opportunity pass it may pass forever for as the tremendous tide of immigration piles up higher and higher representatives of a frep people become enthralled by the environments till they dare not lift their voice or cast their vote in the interest of a free republic again i ask who is it that is wanting this horde of illiterates i answer the steamship companies in their greed for the passage fees the railroad companies in their greed for the transportation fees the large manufacturing companies in their desire to destroy respectable wages to the intelligent laborer and a few large farmers who can live in ease and luxury with their families in the cities while their managers corral the ignorant laborer on the farm gentlemen in my district the small farmer has to bed and board his white laborer in his own household he sleeps in the bed with the farmers sons and eats at the table with his wife and his daughters so long as that laborer is a decent caucasian that is all right but where is the poor white man that wants the dirty syrian to thus share his home these poorer constituents are the men gentlemen that need our protection your pockets are not filled with telegrams from these poor farmers protesting against this legislation but gentlemen while they and their children and perhaps their wives are trying to support themselves by honest toil they are expecting us to protect them and by the help of their god i intend to try to do it so far as in me lies i would not close the doors of our republic against those who on account of religious or political persecution are refugees to our shores whether they can read or not and hence i most cheerfully supported the amendment of the gentleman from michigan to let such as these in without applying the educational test i say to such as they come over and cast your lots in free america where every man can worship god according to the dictates of his own conscience but i do not want to go further and make america the dumping ground for the millions of illiterates who come here merely to fill their pockets with american gold and then return to their home country to enjoy it i have not discussed at great length the effect of this unrestricted immigration on american labor for other gentlemen have elaborated on this phase of the case the labor unions in my district are not very strong but those we have are of as fine a class of citizenship as any in the land and i am glad to say that they are all my friends and i am one of those who believe that the laborer is worthy of his hire whether he follows the plow drives the plane mines the coal or smelts the ore just before every election the republican party has orated its lungs out in appeals for the protection of american labor against the pauper labor of europe and my greatest complaint against organized labor is that it has listened too often to those siren notes now gentlemen you have the chance to make good either do it or let the brand of hypocrisy stand forth on your brow within the last few days republicans on this floor have talked in pathetic strains of the rights of the workingman and now when you can escape a record vote you are trying to stab him from behind your president in his message has advised the literary test the platform of 1896 on which you defeated that real friend of the workingman william j bryan declared we demand that the immigration laws be thoroughly enforced and so extended as to exclude from entrance to the united states those who can neither read nor write gentlemen did you mean that when you said it or was it only hypocritical cant tocatch the workingmans vote if you meant it you have now the chance to make your promise good if you did not mean it you stand before the american people convicted of deliberate falsehood by your own words and deeds this day will tell the tale choose ye whom ye will serve i have witnessed today what i had expected never to see the speaker of the house on a nonpartisan question on a question of great and serious import to the american people lobbying on the floor of the house of representatives for the defeat of a just and wholesome bill on account of his great influence and high official character he is followed by men of his party who flying in the face of their own intelligent consciences and of their own platform declarations seek to strike a death blow to this important bill i would not put one single obstacle in the progress of legitimate commercial development and prosperity the town in which i live is moving upward by leaps and bounds and i am proud of it there is no city in the state except birmingham which is making such rapid strides and i would be the last man to stay its onward march yet i would rather see it forever nestling amid sylvan oaks only known as the pretty village beside the coosa rather than see it built up on the ruins of the civilization of our fathers as yet the influx of illiterate aliens to the south has been so small that we have felt but little evil effects from it and if the present exodus from the slums of western and southwestern europe were but a temporary expediept to meet urgent demands for more toilers then the danger would not be so great but gentlemen we are legislating for posterity and while the evil fruits may not be seriously felt while you and i live yet if this march of illiterates to american shores continue your children and mine will pronounce anathemas upon us who might have checked it and saved them the evils they will feel other members from the south may do as they please i am no mans conscience keeper but my own but gentlemen as for me i would vote for this bill if i knew it would be my political death knell and trust to posterity to write my just epitaph and to make my vindication"], [0.050856173038482666, 0.9491438269615173, 1, "coming to the discussion of this minoritymajority measure or which might properly be called this democratic republican bill proposed in answer to the demands made by the people of the united states for a number of years i shall not make any apology to the house nor any apology to my constituents because i have seen fit to advocate its passage it is unanimously reported from the committee on interstate and foreign commerce and i congratulate the house that it is the result of the joint and unanimous action of both the minority and the majority members upon that committee for uniting with the majority in reporting and advocating this bill i offer no explanation other than it is my duty as a representative to represent the people as well as my party i believe that that man serves his party best who serves the people and his country best and therefore though i am a partisan democrat though after the strictest sect of my party i have lived a democrat i can and do welcome the opportunity that is afforded in this great house of representatives by the report made upon this bill for the country and everyone who shall deal with it hereafter when it shall have passed through this house to understand that for once the american house of representatives is almost unanimous in answering the demand of the people of the united states for relief from unjust and unreasonable exactions at the hands of the railroads therefore though the bill is not in all respects such as i and my party colleagues upon the committee would have had it though there might be some additions made to it which we thought would improve the situation of interstate transportation yet when the majority of the committee accepted the proposition contained in the minority bill introduced by the gentleman from louisiana to give to the interstate commerce commission the power to fix reasonable and just rates as the maximum to be charged beyond which the railroads could not go instead of as proposed first in the bill offered by the chairman of this committee and by others and recommended by the president to authorize and direct that the commission should fix a maximum reasonable rate having conceded that the central figure of this great legislation around which all the others in my judgment revolve and by which they are controlled we thought it to be our duty to meet halfway the gentlemen on the other side the republican members of that committee and to undertake to give to the people substantial relief by this legislation we have done so in my judgment if this bill shall become a law what has been the trouble the trouble has been that since the decisions of the supreme court of the united states in the case of the one hundred and sixtyseventh followed on down by the case in the one hundred and sixtyeighth the first know as the maximum rate cases and the other as the alabama midland case the railroad commission has been stripped of the power with which it was thought to be clothed i do not undertake to say or to intimate that in the discussion which resulted in the adoption of the interstate commerce commission in 1887 that the legislative mind had in its intent to clothe the commission with this power but i do say this that in construing that power up to 1897 the commission itself exercised the power to make a rate for the future and the railroads obeyed them for ten years i do say further that the supreme court of the united states in the one hundred and sixtyeighth finally declared that no such power was supposed to have been conferred upon the interstate commission from which there was dissent by one of its most learned most able judges a man who in my opinion stands preeminent in the judicial history of that great court as a man who has ever stood firm for the rights of the people under the constitution as the fathers intended it to bei refer to justice harlan take his decisions on all these great questions which have arisen the rights of the state the denial of the right of this government to hold colonies the denial of the rights of all persons beneath the flag of our country to the rights of american citizens the right of the government to impose and collect an income taxon all these great questions which have entered into the judicial history of the country there has presided upon that bench one judge at least who at all times has endeavored to enforce legislation enacted for the benefit of the people and who has been guided alone by the great principles of government in the constitution of the united states and he has followed and upheld them in dissenting from the opinion of the court in the case of the commission v the alabama midland railroad 168 united states reports 144 he said taken in connection with the other decisions defining the powers of the interstate commerce commission the present decision goes far to make that commission a useless body for all practical purposes and to defeat many of the important objects designed to be accomplished by the various enactments of congress relating to interstate commerce the commission was established to protect the public against the improper practices of transportation companies engaged in commerce among the several states it has been left it is true with power to make reports and issue protests but it has been shorn by judicial interpretation of authority to do anything of an effective character it is denied many of the powers which in my judgment were intended to be conferred upon it so that it may be safely asserted that the right of the interstate commerce commission to fix charges and compel the railroads to observe them was not drawn into question until the case of the cincinnati new orleans and texas pacific railroad company first in 162 united states and next in 167 united states and finally these two cases were affirmed in 168 united states reports 144 in the case of the commission v the alabama midland railroad which held congress has not conferred upon the interstate commerce commission the legislative power of prescribing rates either maximum minimum or absolute and it did not intend to secure the same result indirectly by empowering that tribunal after having determined what in reference to the past were reasonable and just rates to obtain from the courts a peremptory order that in the future the railroad companies should follow the rates thus determined to have been in the past reasonable and just thus by this last decision in 168 united states reports not only was it decided that the commission had no right after investigation to say what a reasonable rate was and to fix it but that they could not resort to the courts for the purpose of compelling the railroads to observe what was found to be a reasonable rate so that now under the law the interstate commerce commission can neither fix a reasonable rate themselves nor apply to the courts to compel the railroads to charge a reasonable rate or desist from charging an unreasonable rate the only remedy left to the shipper or person injured is to sue in the courts for damages or for the excessive charge i do not mean to disparage any other judge or that court in the least i do not mean to disparage the decisions of the highest court in the world for it is the greatest and highest court in the world because it is the highest and greatest court of the greatest people in the world therefore i say that i bow to that decision as being the law of the land not cheerfully sometimes but willingly now this decision to which i am referring says that the legislative body whether they did intend to do so or not by the act of 1887 have not conferred upon the interstate commerce commission the power to substitute a reasonable rate in place of one found by them to be unreasonable and i will insert that statement in my remarks however judge harlan was but one judge out of nine stripped as he said by the supreme court of this power the commission became as nothing after that it had no power it could recommend it could appeal to the court and after varying and various vicissitudes after wearying of flesh and patience and loss of money in the pursuit of the railroads to the railroad commission after all that nothing has been accomplished so the people all over the country the shippers and the consumers those who shipped freight and those who received it but at last the consumer received no actual benefit the consumer is the man who pays the freight in the selling of produce that has been transported either to the consumer at home or abroad the man who uses it pays the freight and the man that raises the produce the cotton and the corn and the wheat and all of these great agricultural and manufactured products of this great nation also pays the freight and not the man who sells them in all parts of the country we have seen the question agitated in the various states and have seen the demand to have enacted state legislation with reference to interstate rates long and stubborn have been some of these battles fought by the champions of the peoples cause we know what it has accomplished in many statesfully twenty now regulate freight rates by commissions we know that whenever the issue has been made before the people the people have triumphed and the state legislatures have responded to this great demand of the people of the states in my own state there is being conducted this year a political campaign in order to relieve the people there from excessive rates although we have our railroad commission and one which i will refer to in a few momentsone which has been upheld by the supreme court of the united states one which has its powers delegated to it by the statute we are suffering in georgia as the country elsewhere is or bas been suffering with extravagant railroad rates and the people in that state as they have in other parts of the country answering these demands made by the people everywhere will in my judgment in this auspicious year rise up and take charge of their business and control and regulate the transportation within its own borders by electing its railroad commissioners by the people why my state demanded this as far back as 1869 and in 1902 the present governor was elected upon a platform which demanded that this congress should regulate interstate rates upon interstate shipments the democratic convention of georgia held on the 2d day of july 1902 voiced the demands of the assembled democracy of that state and recommended such national legislation as will confer upon the interstate commission power to make just and reasonable railroad rates and charges on interstate shipments now when stripped of its power by the supreme court the interstate commerce commission can no longer protect the people sheltered and protected by the interstatecommerce clause of the constitution the railroad magnates and corporations fly to it for protection against the laws of the state and when the people demand that the congress shall control and regulate interstate rates we are met by the assertion that congress has no authority to enact legislation that will control these great interstate railroad lines because it is an interference with private property and an invasion of states rights we are told that this congress has no power under the constitution to lay its unhallowed hands upon the sacred right of a corporation engaged in the transportation business to rob and plunder the people for myself i am not ready to accept that conclusion a conclusion chiefly advocated and asserted by many of the great metropolitan papers of the country and chiefly by the lawyers of these great corporations with the fees of the railroads in their pockets some of them are gentlemen who stand high in the estimation and justly so of the people of the united states i dissent even though some of them may have been at some time connected with the administration of this government as cabinet officers so that we come down to the proposition whether congress in the exercise of the great sovereign power of itself has the power and the right to control interstate commerce to the extent of fixing and regulating freight rates and charges of carriage both of passengers and freight now it will not do for any man i care not whether he occupies the highest office in the gift of this people or what his station is to lay claim that he is the great political columbus that discovered the proposition that we are now considering why congress as early as 1868 in this house appointed a committee or at least referred a resolution to a committee for the purpose of investigating the question of the power of congress to regulate freight rates in interstate shipments and a report was made to the house the senate in 1874 did the same thing which resulted in the windom report which i have at hand later on led by that great patriot and statesman judge reagan from texas in 1886 this house enacted a law which amended became known when on the statute books as the interstate commerce commission law in 1868 this house received a report from the committee on roads and canals in which they laid down the proposition and sustained it to my satisfaction at least and i think to the satisfaction of anyone who will read it of the right of congress in the exercise of the interstate powers given to it under the interstatecommerce clause of the constitution and the other provision to make all rules necessary and proper for carrying out the powers therein granted the congress of the united states by the constitutiondid have the right under that power to regulate rates of railroads engaged in interstate commerce i hope to be able to show before i get through with this argument the law and the decisions of the supreme court of the united states and other courts which demonstrate that right now existing in congress can it be said that the right to regulate commerce only applied to the right to regulate the kind of commerce then in existence when the constitution was adoptedby steamboat by stagecoach and other means of conveyance shall it be said that the fathers did not intend that whatever may have been the advancement in civilization in science in wealth and in all those other things that have been discovered by the ingenuity of man in the advancement of civilization and commerce that because they could not look beyond the hour into the future to the year of 1905 when speeding across upon iron bands that bind the union together in commerce and transportation great interstate trains traverse the countrythat they were not able to say did not intend to say that congress should have the power to regulate these modern means of interstate transportation that when congress regulated navigation transportation in ships between the states the stagecoach upon the public highway and across the bridges and means of transportation like these that when this power was exercised over these means of transportation then known and used it ceased that modern civilization and science has destroyed it ah that could not be true the men who organized and established this great government of ours the men who wrote the declaration of independence tile men who framed the constitution of the united states seem to me to have been inspired from above and to have written it as if they had written it to answer the demands of the coming ages and to meeting all the changing vicissitudes of time and progress we need not go beyond the provision of the constitution as it has been construedas i believe properlyby the courts both by judges who were federalists and judges who were democratic in order to show that the power of congress exercised as it must be and will be under the interstatecommerce clause of the constitution is not an invasion of the rights of the state but is simply an assertion and use of that power granted to the congress of the united states by the people of the states themselves why judge marshall in the first case in which he deals with this subject that of mcculloch against maryland uses this language it was contended that the powers of the general government are delegated by the states who alone are truly sovereign and must be exercised in subordination to the states who alone possess supreme dominion chief justice marshall in reply to the contention said it would be difficult to sustain this proposition the convention which framed the constitution was indeed elected by the state legislatures but the instrument when it came from their hands was a mere proposal without obligation or pretensions to it the constitution was reported to the then existing congress and was by them submitted to a convention of delegates chosen in each state by the people thereof under the recommendation of its legislatures for their assent and ratification under this mode of proceeding adopted by the convention by congress and by the states the instrument was submitted to the people from these conventions the constitution derived its whole authority rho government proceeds directly from the people etc when the constitution was thus adopted it was a complete obligation and bound the state sovereignties the government of the union then is emphatically and truly a government of the people in form and substance it emanates from them its powers are granted by them and are to be exercised directly on them and for their benefit if any one proposition could command universal assent of mankind we might expect it would be this that the government of the union though limited in its powers is supreme within its sphere of action mccnlloch v maryland 4 wheat 405 now that was decided it is true in a case which denied the right of the state to tax the united states bank i know that following that decision criticisms have been made that that decision and others made by the eminent justice changed the intention of the founders of the government and of the constitution makers from a republic of independent states to a great national government i do not believe that to be the fact now or then it is true that the powers of congress have been extended in my judgment much further than they ought to have been in many instances under the interstatecommerce clause but it has been invoked by the people who would shelter themselves from the assertion of the right of the state to protect them from unjust and improper exactions at the hands of the people and corporations that would plunder them therefore if the people of the united states can not by their state laws protect themselves in the way of regulating railroad charges beyond their borders and if congress has not the power to regulate those charges then indeed has comethe day and the hour when the people are owned by the wealth and power of the corporations so far as i am concerned i am ready at ajl times to uphold the rights of the state with reference to the enforcement of law within its borders and within its own sphere yet i shall always be ready to concede to the general government the powers that thu people of the united states have granted to it within that instrument and if it becomes necessary to protect my people and the people of this great country from exactions from extortions from robberies under the forms of law then i am willing to extend the interpretation of the constitution in order to relieve the people but i do not have to do it i am glad of that now if there ever was a man whom we as democrats could rely uponwe who revere the name of a great statesman and a great democratit is the great senator from south carolina mr john c calhoun we can always find words of wisdom that instruct those democrats who have come after him and we may safely follow in the path where his footsteps have trod he ever sought to maintain the rights of the states but also yielded and maintained the legitimate and granted rights of the federal government if we can get authority from this great democrat to exercise the power under the constitution we seek here in this bill to use we are fortunate indeed his devotion to the rights of the states and their power can not be questioned when we recall that he denied the power of the general government to collect a tariff tax at the ports of his own state without its consent in a report made on the 26th day of june 1846 to the senate speaking of the power conferred upon congress by the constitution to regulate commerce he said theythe committeeare of the opinion after due reflection that they conferred upon congress all the powers which by a fair interpretation belong to the states as fully as the states themselves possess it except such if there be any as may be prohibited by the constitution from being exercised either expressly or by implication that they confer on congress all the power to regulate commerce with each other with that exception would seem to be so clear as hardly to admit of doubt as the words by which it is delegated are used without qualification or condition but if there should be room for doubt it would be removed by adverting to the reasons for delegating the power it was not to limit it or prohibit it as a power of a dangerous character and which on that account ought to be restricted or prohibited on the contrary it was regarded as one of the utmost utility and on the proper control of which the prosperity of the states essentially depended and it was accordingly for the purpose of obtaining such control as well as preventing collisions among the states and not to restrict or prohibit it that it was delegated to the federal government as their common representative and organ in their external relations with each other and with foreign nations now there we have the judgment of this illustrious democrat as authority for my statement that i do not violate the constitution of the united states in voting for this bill i am sustained in that idea by the opinion left to us by that distinguished statesman and loyal democrat and that being so i think i can stand before my people and before the country before lawyers and before my fellowdemocrats as not advocating a violation of the constitution or any extension of power to the congress of the united states now let us see i have been taking pains with this because i am going to lead up to something else if i can establish the legal proposition that congress has the power under this interstatecommerce clause to regulate railroad rates then i have established the proposition that the people will be relieved because we all understand that driven at last from every other field of encounter the railroads have entrenched themselves in the belief first that such a measure can not pass both branches of congress and finally if it should that they will endeavor to defeat the will of the people by asserting that the right to regulate the charges that they make upon the people does not exist under the constitution of the united states before discussing here further the power of congress to regulate interstate railways i will first discuss the powel of the various states to regulate the charges of those interstate railways which are public highways by reason of the fact that they are chartered by the states are in the nature of monopolies and are engaged in the performance of a quasi public or governmental function if the states have both the right to regulate these railways and their charges and to delegate to commissions that power then the congress if it exercise it must assert that power and use it under section 8 article i of the constitution of the united states which is called the commerce clauses of the constitution and that other authority given in the same section to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution such powers first then have the states this power to regulate rates of transportation on interstate lines and if they have can such power be delegated to a commission or other administrative body to carry out the legislative will this power though always resisted by the railroads when sought to be exercised by the states has never been denied by the courts the power to regulate the charges for railroad transportation rests upon the following grounds 1 public necessity 2 that these concerns often exercise a monopoly 3 the fact that they have been specially franchised or chartered and so assumed obligations to the public said judge bradley in the sinking fund cases 99 u s 700 747 when an employment or business becomes a matter of such public interest and importance as to create a common charge or burden upon the citizen in other words when it becomes a practical monopol to which the citizen is obliged to resort and by means of which a tribute can be exacted from the community it is subject to regulation by the legislative power an investigation of the common law and the decisions of the state courts will show many occupations whose charges have been regulated and the rule seems to be settled that once the occupation is classed a public calling or is engaged in serving the public by reason of some power or franchise granted to it by the state the legislature has the right to fix the price that may be charged people v budd 117 n y 1 s c 115 am i st rep 460 affirmed by the supreme court of the united states in 143 u s 517 said the supreme court of illinois in the case of rouggles v people 91 ill 262 if then the legislature may fix the rate of charges by individuals as common carriers warehousemen or others exercising a calling or business public in its character or in which the public has an interest to be protected against extortion or oppression that body may do the same thing and fix the maximum charges of corporations exercising the same business of this there can we apprehend be no doubt s c 108 u s 525 it is the assertion of no new legal principle that the legislative body has the right to regulate charges for the use of property even though it be private property when for a particular purpose the public have a right to use it within boundary every government has the right to prescribe regulations demanded by the general welfare for the common protection of all this power of government was said by justice taney in 5 howard 583 license cases to be inherent in every sovereigntythe power to govern men and things this is however not an uncontrollable despotic power subject to no limitations exercisable without reason at the whim or caprice of the legislative body but within its legitimate domain the power is original absolute and indefeasible lord ellenborough in the case of allnut v inglis 12 east 527 said there is no doubt that the general principle is favored both in law and justice that every man may fix what price he pleases upon his own property or the use of it but if for a particular purpose the public have a right to resort to his premises and make use of them and he have a monopoly in them for that purpose if he will take the benefit of that monopoly he must as an equivalent perform the duty attached to it on reasonable terms lord hale in the treatises de portibus marls and de jure marls so largely quoted from in the opinions in the munn case used the language that when private property is affected with a public interest it ceases to be juris privati only in assigning the reason why ferries and public wharves should be under public regulation and only reasonable tolls charged the right to establish a ferry was a franchise and no man could set up a ferry although he owned the soil and landing places on both sides of the stream without a charter from the king or a prescription time out of mind the franchise to establish ferries was a royal prerogative and the grant of the king was necessary to authorize a subject to establish a public ferry even on his own premises when we recur to the origin and purpose of this prerogative it will be seen that it was vested in the king as a means by which a business in which the whole community was interested could be regulated in other words it was simply one mode of exercising a prerogative of governmentthat is to say through the sovereign instead of through parliamentin a matter of public concern this and similar prerogatives were vested in the king for public purposes and not for his private advantage or emolument lord kenyon in rorke v dayrell 4 term rep 410 said the prerogatives of the crown are not given for the personal advantage of the king but they are allowed to exist because they are beneficial to the subject and it is said in chitty on prerogatives 4 the splendor rights and power of the crown were attached to it for the benefit of the people and not for the private gratification of the subject and lord hale in one of the passages referred to in stating the reason why a man may not set up a ferry without a charter from the king says because it doth in consequence tend to a common charge and is become a thing of public interest and use and every man for his passage pays a toll which is a common charge and every ferry ought to be under a public regulation the right to take tolls for wharfage in a public port was also a franchise and tolls as lord hale says could not be taken without lawful title by charter or prescription de portibus mars 77 but the king if he maintained a public wharf was under the same obligation as a subject to exact only reasonable tolls nor could the king authorize unreasonable tolls to be taken by a subject the language of lord hale is explicit upon both these points if the king or subject have a public wharf into which all persons that come to that port must come to unload their goods as for the purpose because they are the wharves only licensed by the queen according to the statute of 1 elizabeth chapter 11 or because there is no other wharf in that port as it may fall out when a port is newly erected in that case there can not be taken arbitrary and excessive duties for cranage wharfage passage etc neither can they be enhanced to an immoderate degree but the duties must be reasonable and moderate though settled by the kings license or charter these modern american railway kings and captains of finance assert and demand more power than our english ancestors would permit the kings of england to exercise in the name of and in behalf of the american people i would stay by law the rapacity of these modern railway kings and protect the public from their unjust exactions by this law i would teach them that they too like the english icings can exact only reasonable tolls from the people the georgia railroad commission case aptly illustrates the contention here now made that congress has the right to delegate to the interstate commerce commission the power to fix what shall be reasonable and just rates upon the interstate railroad lines if the legislature of georgia could as it did delegate to a commission the power to regulate freight and passenger traffic over the roads in that state and this was constitutional under the constitution of georgia and if it were a proper delegation of power by the legislature then i see no reason why congress can not when these same railroads engage in interstate commerce and thus become subject to the powers of congress to regulate interstate commerce delegate to the interstate commerce commission a like power to fix rates on interstate shipments the constitution of georgia requires that the various departments of the government being the legislative the judicial and executive shall remain separate and distinct and no person discharging the duties of one shall at the same time exercise the functions of the other the constitution of georgia of 1877 confers upon the legislature the power and authority of regulating railroad freight and passenger traffic preventing unjust discriminations and requiring reasonable and just rates of freight and passenger tariffs it also makes it the duty of the legislature to pass laws to carry into effect this constitutional provision and to enforce the samn by suitable penalty in pursuance of that power the legislature in 1879 created a railroad commission and provided that fair and reasonable rates only shall be charged by the railroads of the state and further provided for the appointment of three railroad commissioners whose duty it shall be to make reasonable and just rates of freight and passenger tariffs to be observed by all the railroad companies doing business in the state this act was attacked in two casesfirst in the case of tilley v the s f and w r r co 5 fed rep 641 which was decided by tudge wood circuit court judge and afterwards a justice of the supreme court of the united states in that case the complainant insisted that the constitution of georgia required the general assembly itself to regulate railroad freight and passenger tariffs and that the delegation of this duty to these railroad commissioners was contrary to the constitution of georgia and therefore sought an injunction to enjoin the enforcement of the rates prescribed by the commission judge wood in a very able and exhaustive opinion held that the legislature of georgia had the right to delegate to a commission power to fix rates over the railroads in georgia and said on page 656 the fixing of just and reasonable maximum rates for all the railroads in the state is clearly a duty which can not be performed by the legislature unless it remains in perpetual session and devotes a large portion of its time to its performance the question what are just and reasonable rates is one which presents different phases from month to month upon every road in the state and in reference to all the innumerable articles and products that are the subjects of transportation this question can only be satisfactorily solved by a board which is in perpetual session and whose time is exclusively given to the consideration of the subject it is obvious that to require the duty of prescribing rates for the railroads of the state to be performed by the general assembly which meets in regular session only once in two years and then only for a period of forty days would result in the most illadvised and haphazard schedules and be productive of the greatest inconvenience and injustice in some cases to the railroad companies and in others to the people of the state it is impracticable for such a body to prescribe just and reasonable rates to insist that this duty must he performed by the general assembly itself is to defeat the purpose of that clause of the constitution under consideration and again he said the constitution of the united states gives to congress the power to levy and collect taxes but this does not require congress itself to assess the property of the taxpayer and collect the tax the constitution of georgia clothes the general assembly with the power of taxation over the whole state and requires taxes to be assessed upon all property ad valorem but this does not require the legislature to investigate through its committees or otherwise and declare by an act the value of every piece of property in the state subject to taxation and after citing a number of authorities one of which is the case of cincinnati etc railroad company v clinton county i ohio st 77 in which case he declares that the rule applicable to the delegation of power by the legislature is laid down with great clearness he concludes as follows my conclusion upon this point is therefore that the act creating the georgia railroad commission is not unconstitutional by reason of the delegation to the railroad commissioners of legislative power again in the case of the georgia railroad v smith 70 ga 694 the validity of the law establishing the georgia railroad commission and giving it power to fix rates was attacked mainly upon two grounds first because under the constitutiom of georgia the duty was imposed upon the general assembly to regulate freight and passenger tariffs and second because the act establishing the commission was unconstitutional and void as being an attempt to delegate legislative powers to said railroad commission these questions are taken up and in a very able and exhaustive opinion by justice crawford the court rendered a judgment refusing to declare the law unconstitutional for the reasons assigned and decided that under the constitution of georgia the power was conferred upon the legislature to regulate railroad freight and passenger tariffs but that it was not expected that the legislature should do more than pass laws to accomplish the end in view nor were they required to enter into the details of settling freights and tariffs over all the roads in the state that they had constitutional power to delegate to the railroad commissioners authority to carry into effect the laws passed by the legislature and that such commissioners are constitutional officers from the decision of the supreme court of georgia the case came to the supreme court of the united states and is reported in 128 united states reports page 174 in which the decision of the supreme court of georgia was affirmed in that case the supreme court of the united states in an opinion rendered by justice field after stating that the supreme court of georgia heldthat this delegation of authority by the legislature to the commission to prescribe what shall be reasonable and just rates for the carriage and transportation of persons and property over the railroads within its limits was a proper exercise of its power to provide protection for its citizens against unjust rates for such transportation and to prevent unjust discriminations and that it was expected not that the legislature would itself make specific regulations as to what should in each case be a proper charge but that it would simply provide the means by which such rates should be ascertained and enforcedsaid in reviewing that decisionit has been adjudged by this court in numerous instances that the legislature of a state has the power to prescribe the charges of a railroad company for the carriage of persons and merchandise within its limits citing in support stone v farmers loan and trust co 116 u s 307 dow v beldelman 125 u s 680 he further declares in this opinion the incorporation of the company by which numerous parties are permitted to act as a single party for the purpose of its creation or as chief justice marshall expresses it by which the character and properties of individuality are bestowed on a collective and changing body of men providence bank v billings 4 pet 514 562 the grant to it of special privileges to carry out the object of its incorporation particularly the authority to exercise the states right of eminent domain that it may appropriate needed propertya right which can be exercised only for a public purposeand the obligation assumed by the acceptance of its charter to transport all persons and merchandise upon like conditions and upon reasonable rates affect the property and employment with a public use and where property is thus affected the business in which it is used is subject to legislative control so long as the use continues the power of regulation remains and the regulation may extend not merely to provisions for the security of passengers and freight against accidents and for the convenience of the public but also to prevent extortion by unreasonable charges and favoritism by unjust discriminations thus we trace the decision of the question from the state court into the united states circuit court and afterwards to the supreme court of the united states all of which upheld and sustained the power of the legislature of georgia to create the railroad commission and authorize it to fix reasonable and just charges for freight and passenger tariffs on the railroads in georgia and none of these courts questioned the power of the legislature of georgia so to regulate the charges of these railroads or to delegate that power to a commission to repeat the language of justice field in the case in 128 united states 179 this is not a new doctrine but old doctrine always asserted whenever property or business is by reason of special privileges received from the government the better to secure the purposes to which the eroperty is dedicated or devoted affected with a public use there ave been differences of opinion among the judges of this court in some cases as to the circumstances or conditions under which some kinds of property or business may be properly held to be thus affected as in munn v illinois 94 u s 113 126 139 146 but none as to the doctrine that when such use exists the business becomes subject to legislative control in all respects necessary to protect the public against danger injustice and oppression the state which grants charters to railroad companies invested with corporate life and power to build and operate and charge tolls upon their roads has the right because of the nature of the privileges conferred upon such railroad companies and the character of the obligations assumed by them to regulate the rates and charges of such corporations as the business of such roads becomes affected with a public use and is subject to legislative regulation railroads that engage in interstate commerce although they derive their charters not from the congress of the united states become subject to the laws of congress and the right of congress to regulate the business of such transportation companies that states may regulate within their own borders the business of railroads seems to be admitted and in a number of casses referred to in other brief this right has been sustained 19 fed rep

legislature to confer this power upon the pilotage commissioners was upheld by the supreme court of massachusetts says the court such regulations are in the nature of police regulations the making of which within defined limits may be intrusted to other bodies than the legislature generally speaking a railroad commission is merely an administrative body created by the state for carrying into

authority must affirmatively appear reagan v loan co 154 u s 367 the principal purpose of most of the statutes which have created such railroad commissions is the regulation of freight and passenger

difference between the power to pass a law and the power to adopt rules and regulations in respect to a law already passed is apparent and great and this we maintain to be a distinction recognized strikingly by the courts as the true rule in determining whether or not in such cases the legislative power is granted the former would be unconstitutional while the latter is not railroad co v smith

for preventing excessive charges and unjust discriminations and preferences which the act had declared to be unlawful i desire to call attention to the case of railroad co v jones 149 ill 361 s c 41 am st rep 278 which construes a statute declaring that railroads should not charge and collect more than a fair and reasonable rate toll or compensation the supreme court of illinois held this to be a constitutional grant of power to a commission and could be enforced through a commission and that the courts had power under the act to determine what is reasonable in that same case the court held that the statute which created the commission and which omitted to fix the maximum rates or charges for the carriers but created a commission with authority to make schedules which should be prima facie evidence of the reasonableness of rotes to be charged was a valid statute lhey also held that authorizing a board of commissioners to make a schedule of rates instead of the legislature fixing the freight and fares to be charged by railroad companies is not a delegation to the board of commissioners of the legislative power to establish such rates and therefore is not invalid this case deals fully with the entire subject and upholds the power of the state to confer power upon a commission so long as it does not undertake to make the decision of the commission final or prevent a judicial inquiry as to the reasonableness of such rates on this subject i call attention to the case of railroad company v minnesota 134 u s 418 and the case of budd v new york 143 u s 517 to sum up the doctrine it is this statutes which create boards of cominissioners and authorize them to make schedules of rates for railroad companies are not invalid as being a delegation of legislative power the doctrine of the cases is that the functions of such boards are administrative rather than legislative that the authority conferred upon them relates merely to the execution of a law that the grant of legislative power to do a certain thing carries with it the power to use all proper and necessary means to accomplish the end and that as the reasonableness of rates changes with circumstances and legislatures can not be continuously in session the requirement that the statute itself shall fix the charge might preclude the legislature from the use of the agencies necessary to perform the duty imposed upon it by the constitution in short that the legislature may authorize others to do things which it might properly but can not conveniently or advantageously do itself in the case of chicago railroad company v minnesota 134 u s 418 and minneapolis railroad company v minnesota 134 u s 467 the power of the states to regulate the charges of common carriers and to delegate these powers to a commission was considered and reaffirmed by the supreme court of the united states where a state delegates power to a railroad commission to fix just and reasonable rates for freight and passenger

cases to be found in the 94 u s r from these cases we conclude that undoubtedly the legislature has the authority to declare what is a reasonable rate orcompensation for the railroad to charge or to fix reasonable charges or in the absence of statutory regulations upon the subject the courts must determine what is reasonable under the common law the carrier must accept and transport the goods for a reasonable charge this would be true without any statute but the legislature has the right to fix a reasonable charge and to delegate that authority to a commission the purpose of the act of 1887 known as the interstatecommerce act is fully set out in the opinion of justice brown in the case of the interstate commission v baltimore railroad 145 u s 263 wherein the purpose and object sought to be accomplished by the passage of the act is reviewed see snyder on interstatecommerce act pages 34 and 35 citing atchison v denver r r 110 u s r 667 as to the power of the government to prescribe rates see snyder pages 43 44 the interstate commerce commission in one of the earliest cases before it viz thatcher v hudson canal company 1 i c c rep 152 speaking through judge cooley decided its power in respect to rates is to determine whether those imposed by the railroad ore for any reason in conflict with the statute and later on the commission decided that the commission is not primarily a ratemaking body the carrier is left free to arrange its own tariffs in the first instance we sit for the correction of what is unreasonable and unjust in these tariffs and the commission up to the date of these decisions and up to now has never assumed in the first instance to make a rate yet they acted upon the idea that it was their duty to determine whether the rate complained of was just and reasonable and if found to be unjust and unreasonable to correct that violation of the statute and in so doing it was but reasonable to assume that the only way to do so was to prohibit the charging of an unreasonable rate and to compel the charging of one that was reasonable this power was exercised by the commission until the supreme court of the united states decided no such power had been granted in 1896 and 1897 three decisions were rendered virtually emasculating the commission of any power up to that time of the 135 orders made 68 were cases where a change of rate for the future was prescribed and most of them were observed by the railroads it is therefore to enable the commission to carry out the first section of this act to regulate commerce which declares that all interstate rates shall be reasonable and just and which prohibits the exaction of rates that are not reasonable and just that this legislation is intended the authority of congress to regulate railroad rates was stated by the supreme court of the united states to exist under the following circumstances when gcods shipped under a through bill of lading or in any other way indicating a common

confer upon the interstate commerce commission the power to itself fix rates for the court said that that question was mooted in the court below and was discussed in the briefs of counsel in that case and they said we do net find any provision of the act that expressly or by necessalry implication confers such a power this case was decided march 30 1896 realizing the effect that this decision had on the powers of the interstate commerce commission the national democratic convention at chicago in july 1896 in its platform demanded the enlargement of the powers of the interstate commerce commission and such restrictions and guaranties in the control of railroads as will protect the people from robbery and oppression th~is case it is true was followved by the decisions in 167 united states known as the maximum rate cases and again in the case of the interstate commerce commission v the alabama midland railroad 168 p 144 but as early as march 1896 it was known that the court would hold that the act of 1s87 had not conferred upon the commission power to fix rates i will now discuss the power of congress to regulate railroad charges of those railways engaged in interstate commerce under section 8 article 1 of the constitution in gibbons against ogden 9 wheaton 189 and 194 chief justice marshall defines what commerce is and construes its meaning under the provision of the constitution to regulate commuerce and to make laws which shall be necessary and proper fer carrying into execution the powers delegated in the constitution to congress and shows that it comprehended navigation in the same case mr justice johnson concurred we know who justice johnson was he was one who did not undertake to strain the constitution in order to maintain federal power we know he was a great lawyer and an honest and learned judge he said commerce in its simplest signification means an exchange of goods but in the advancement of society labor transportation intelligent care and the various mediums of exchange become commodities and enter into commerce nearly a hundred years ago this judge decided what commerce meant as though with prophetic eye he saw into the future when the greater part of the commerce would be interstate and clearly indicates that the framers of the constitution did not intend to confine and limit the word commerce as was contended for in that case viz to trafficto the mere buying and selling or the interchange of commodities for he says the subject the vehicle the agent and their various operations become the objects of commercial regulation shipbuilding and the carrying trade and the propagation of seamen are such vital agents of commercial prosperity that the nation which could not legislate over these subjects would not possess power to regulate commerce let the house understand the purpose of this argument is to demonstrate and show from a legal standpoint that when you establish the fact that railroads when they engage in interstate commerce and traffic become themselves the objects of commerce and therefore subject to be regulated by the congress of the united states you destroy the last argument and batter down the strongholds behind which the railroads now intrench themselves i think a careful consideration of some of these decisions to which i will refer will demonstrate to the house that there can be no doubt of the right of congress to so exercise this power constitutionally in the passenger cases 7 howard 416 the supreme court of the united states said commerce consists amongst other things in buying from one nation and selling to another or in transporting the merchandise from the seller to gain the freight in the case of the philadelphia and reading railroad conipany v pennsylvania 82 u s r 15 wall 232 284 the court said beyond all question the transportation of freight or of the subjects of commerce for the purposes of exchange or sale is a constituent of commerce itself if transportation is a constituent of commerce and congress can regulate and control and has the supreme power exclusively to control such transportation when it becomes interstate upon what can be based the argument that it can control in every particular except to regulate the price of the transportation nowsaid this court in the case just referred tothis has never been doubted and probably the transportation of articles of trade from one state to anotherwas the prominent idea in the minds of the framers of the constitution when to congress was committed the power to regulate commerce among the several states it would be absurd to suppose that the transmission of the subjects of trade from the seller to the buyer or from the place of production to the market was not contemplated for without that there could be no consummated trade with foreign nations or amongst the states that is the great argument now the fathers could not see that these great transportation companies combined into six powerful monopolies as they now are would carry threefourths of all the traffic of this great country they could not foresee that in a short while after the supreme court by its decisioi removed the restraining hand of the interstate commerce commission from them these great railway monopolies would plunder the people of the united states to the amount of 155 000 000 by a simple change of classification of freight and an advance in rates these six systems with a few independent lines controlling 214 000 miles received from its business 2 073 177 325 during the last year as its gross earnings can you comprehend it can the people of the country realize how great are these amounts that are taken from them in the transportation of freight and passengers 2 073 000 000 how much does the government take from the pockets of the people to run the government in 1905 excluding the postal receipts it took 544 000 274 the expenses for the postoffice were 152 000 000 so adding that to the other it amounts to not quite 700 000 000 as the receipts of the government from every source and yet these railroad corporations have received nearly three times as much in revenues as has the government of the united states the government taxes its people about 7 per capita to carry on the business of the government while the railroads tax the people nearly 27 per capita to carry the freight and passengers over the public highways of the nation why an increase of onehalf a mill a mile per tonmark itthe increase of onehalf of a mill a ton per mile on the amount of tonnage carried by the railroad for 1904 would at once have added to the receipts of these railroad corporations over 88 000 000 onetwentieth of a cent per ton per mile would increase it to nearly 100 000 000 and yet this great business concentrated in the hands of a few controlling the shipment both interstate and foreign the very lifeblood of the people because these public highways are but the arteries through which the commercial life of the people flow controlling all this immense property defy the state and the supreme court of the united states in its power and proper construction of the constitution protect them from the state laws they have defeated the right of the state to enact laws that protect the people on interstate freights they defy congress and hope to escape it by undertaking to say that it was not within the knowledge or intention of the fathers that a railroad would be built or operated to transport freight between the states but they never dreamed that the railroad corporations of the country would become so powerful that they would become greater than the law and greater than the constitution for myself i have no desire to injure the property of any man i have no desire to diminish the dividend of any proper legitimate honest investment but i am unwilling to continue this state of affairs in the united states if by my voice or by my vote i can correct it and i shall be able by this legislation if it shall pass to take from the throats of the american producer and the american consumer the grasping choking fingers of these railroad corporations and i shall do it under the law of my country under the law which i revere under the constitution which is the sheet anchor of every man who lives beneath the flag that represents the sovereignty of his country i am amenable to the law and so is every citizen from the humblest to the greatest in this great country there are only a few people in the country who snap their fingers in the face of the law one of them a railroad magnate gave much evidence of it in theexamination in new york a few days ago when he snapped his fingers and said what do i care for the law i desire that they shall learn the law and that the constitutionally enacted law shall relieve the people of the burdens under which they groan and that everyone shall be made to respect the law even though he counts his fortunes by the hundreds of millions they should be made to obey the laws though we shall have to put some of them where they deserve to goira the penitentiaries of the country now you hear a great deal on this subject about the innocent stockholders who owns the stock of these great railroads a few of them are owned by some citizens go to my own state for example the railroads were built by its own people subscribed by the money that they have made at their avocations on their plantations in their stores and they built and operated them until the railroads became wealthproducing property when they fell beneath the greedy eye of the wall street manipulators of railroad stock soon every georgia railroad except the one that runs from atlanta to augusta is found destroyed wrecked bankrupted proceedings instigated by the people that should have protected the railroads from all assault of any kind soon they fell within the capacious and insatiate maw of wall street and now they have become a part of the morgan system who in georgia is a stockholder in the morgan syndicate of the georgia roads a few most excellent men hold stock enough to become directors but they obey and carry out the policy dictated by those who control in wall street i have nothing to say with reference to the gentlemen who own these properties and who run them they are not to answer to me or to my people for the plunder of the stockholder and the wrecking of his property but i would have them answer to the law and i would have them restrained by the law when they continue in order to further enrich their greed and power to exact from my people or from the people of the united states unjust discrimination unfair unreasonable and exorbitant charges so there is but one way to do it ir chairman and that is to exercise the power of congress under this bill now hav we got it i desire to call attention to a decision rendered in the united states circuit court of iowa by mr jus tice miller of the supreme court of the united states presidig in the case of gray v clinton bridge company in 1868 nearly thirtyeight years ago this great judge seemed to see into the future in fact did see and pointed out in clear and lucid language the right to exercise the power we are here contending for in the case of in re clinton bridge at the ocber term 1867 the circuit court for the district of iowa rendered a decision to be found in 1 woolworths circuit court reperts page 150 same case to be found in 5 federal cases case no 2900 p 1060 justice miller decided any means by which passengers and merchandise are transported is an element of commerce this has been repeatedly held in respect to navigation and congress has repeatedly legislated on the subject accordingly the rairoad as much as the steamboat is a means of interchange of persons and property which interchange is commerce itself when railroads become portions of the great highways of our union acting an important part in commerce which embraces many states to regulate them is to regulate commerce and it may not be amiss to read the opinion of this distinguished judge for i am sure it is sound both in law and logic said he navigation however is only one of the elements of commerce it is an element of commerce because it affords the means of transporting passengers and merchandise the interchange of which is commerce itself any other mode of effecting this would be as much an elbment of commerce as navigation when this transportation or interchange of commodities is carried on by land it is commerce as well as when carried on by water and the power of congress to regulate it is as ample in the one case as in the other the commerce among the states spoken of in the constitution must at the time that that instrument was adopted have been mainly of this character for the steamboat which has created our great internal commerce on the rivers was then unknown another means of transportation equal in importance to the steamboat has also come into existence since the constitution was adopted a means by which merchandise is transported across states and kingdoms in the same vehicle in which it started the railroad now shares with the steamboat the monopoly of the carrying trade the one has with great benefit been subject to the control of salutary congressional legislation because it is an instrument of commerce is there any reason why the other should not however this question may be answered in regard to that commerce which is conducted wholly within the limits of a state and is therefore neither foreign commerce nor commerce among the states it seems to me that where these roads become parts of great highways of our union transporting a commerce which embraces many states and destined as some of these roads are to become the channels through which the nations of europe and asia shall interchange their commodities there can be no reason to doubt that to regulate them is to regulate commerce both with foreign nations and among the states and that to refuse to do this is a refusal to discharge one of the most important duties of the federal government as already intimated the shackles with which the different states fettered commerce in their selfish efforts to benefit themselves at the expense of their confederates was one of the main causes which led to the formation of our present constitution the wonderful growth of that commerce since it has been placed exclusively under the control of the federal government has justified the wisdom of our fathers but are we to remit the most valuable part of that commerce again to the control of the states and to the consequent vexations and burdens which the states may impose through whose territories it must be carried on and must all this be permitted because the carrying is done by a method not thought of when the constitution was framed for myself i must say that i have no doubt of the right of congress to prescribe all needful and proper regulations for the conduct of thtu immense traffic over any railroad which has voluntarily become part of one of those lines of interstate communication or to authorize the creation of such roads when the purposes of interstate transportation of persons and property justify or require it this case was appealed to the supreme court of the united states and the decision rendered by judge miller in the circuit court was upheld and the judgment affirmed see gray v r r co 10 wallace 454463 77 u s justice field an able democratic judge in his opinion in the case of union pacific railroad v peniston 18 wallace 85 u s 47 cites the case of the clinton bridge and approves it this same great judge justice miller in the case of minnesota v the railroad company 134 u s r 467 had occasion to again discuss the question of regulation of railroad rates by the states and in an opinion delivered in that case clearly pointed out the powers of the state in that regard the authority to delegate to a commission this power to fix the rates the remedies that either the shipper or the ailroad could resort to in order to resist the rates thus fixed by a commission and the rules by which the court should be guided in passing upon the question it is so full and complete that i read it 1 in regard to the business of common carriers limited to points within a single state that state has the legislative power to establish the rates of compensation for such carriage 2 the power which the legislature has to do this can be exercised through a commission which it may authorize to act in the matter such as the one appointed by the legislature of minnesota by the act now under consideration 3 neither the legislature nor such commission acting under the authority of the legislature can establish arbitrarily and without regard to justice and right a tariff of rates for such transportation which is so unreasonable as to practically destroy the value of property of persons engaged in the carrying business on the one hand nor so exorbitant as to be in utter disregard of the rights of the public for the use of such transportation on the other 4 in either of these classes of cases there is an ultimate remedy by the parties aggrieved in the courts for relief against such oppressive legislation and especially in the courts of the united states where the tariff of rates established by the legislature or by the commission is such as to deprive a party of his property without due process of law 5 but until the judiciary had been appealed to to declare the regulation made whether by the legislature or by the commission voidable for the yeasons mentioned the tariff of rates so fixed is the law of the land and must be submitted to both by the carrier and by the parties with whom he deals 6 that the proper if not the only mode of judicial relief against the tariff of rates established by the legislature or by its commission is by a bill in chancery asserting its unreasonable character and its conflict with the constitution of the united states and asking a decree of the court forbidding the corporation from exacting such fare as excessive or establishing its right to collect the rates as being within the limits of a just compensation for the service rendered 7 that until this is done it is not competent for such individual having dealings with the carrying corporation or for the corporation with regard to each individual who demands its services to raise a contest in the courts over the question which ought to be settled in this general and conclusive method 8 but in the present case whee an application is made to the supreme court of the state to compel the common carriers namely the railroad companies to perform the services which their duty requires them to do for the general public which is equivalent to establishing by judicial proceeding the reasonableness of the charges fixed by the commission i think the court has the same duty to inquire into the reasonableness of the tariff of rates established by the commission before granting such relief that it would have if called upon to so do by a bill in chancery 9 i do not agree that it was necessary to the validity of the action of the commission that previous notice should have been gven to all common carriers interested in the rates to be established nor to any particular one of them any more than it would have been necessary which i think it is not for the legislature to have given such notice if it had established such rates by legislative enactment 10 but when the question becomes a judicial one the validity and justice of these rates are not to be established or rejected by the judgment of a court it is necessary that the railroad corporations interested in the fare to be considered should have notice and have a right to be heard on the question relating to such fare which i have pointed out as judicial questions now i might as well right here read a decision which i havea later one the supreme court in one of the cases in which they declared that the commission had no power to fix rates at the same time rendered this decision which is found in 162 united states page 184 the case of cincinnati etc railroad company v interstate commerce commission when goods shipped under through bill of lading or any other way indicating a common control management or arrangement from a point in one state to a point in another state are received in transit by a state common carrier such carrier if a railroad company must be deemed as subjecting its road to an arrangement for a continuous carriage or shipment within the meaning of the act to regulate commerce now you understand that all these questions have been before the supreme court the right of the commission itself to exist the right to have its orders enforced and finally the right has been decided whether the commission had the right to fix a rate in place of one found to be unreasonable and it has been reserved to tnese astute railroad lawyers some of them exs and some of them in office now to present a proposition to the country that although all these questions have been before the country and the supreme court of the united states they yet neither lawyer nor judge have never seen the great question which ought to stand out most prominently if there was any reason for unconstitutionality that congress had no power to regulate freight rates on interstate railroad lines this power of congress over interstate commerce was sustained by a decision made by justice storey i have collected these from chief justices mashall and taney justices johnson and storey because they are the great lights amongst our national judiciary that illumine the judicial history of our country one a federalist a great chief justice the other a great democrat equally as distinguished marshall extending as has been claimed by implication the powers of the government taney standing by the rights of the state denying the right of congress to legislate in some respects in reference to the rights of the citizens of a state to do what they pleased with its property rendered a decision which finally resulted in civil war and which could only be settled on the battlefield those two chief justices one a great federalist another a great democrat both dealt with the proposition as to the power of congress over interstate commerce and both upheld it i have read judge marshalls views i now call attention to one of judge taneys opinions in the case of the genesee chief v fitzhugh 12 how u s 244 referring to the commerce power judge taney says this power is as extensive upon land as upon water the constitution makes no distinction in that respect and if the admiralty jurisdiction in matters of contract and tort which the courts of the united states may lawfully exercise on the high seas can be extended to the lakes under the power to regulate commerce it can with the same propriety and on the same construction be extended to contracts and torts on land where the commerce is between different states and it may also embrace the vehicles and persons ongaged in carrying it on he says further in further illustration of the unreasonableness of holding the admiralty jurisdiction to be coextensive with the power of congress ever commerce the learned judge says it would in that case be in the power of congress to confer admiralty jurisdiction upon its courts over the cars engaged in transporting passengers or merchandise from one state to another and over the persons engaged in conducting them against the opinions of paid lawyers of the railway systems against the opinions of people who would resist this great movement in the interest of the people i put the decisions and the judgment of these great american chief justices of the supreme court i will not detain the committee with undertaking to go over the old assertion of the right of the sovereign to regulate public highways nor will i detain the committee twothirds of which are lawyers with accepted undisputedexcept by railroad officials and railroad lawyersright of the state as sovereign and the power and the right of the national government in the exercise of its sovereign power when granting a franchise and a right to a corporation to exercise part of the sovereign power that that corporation is under the control of the sovereign now i know they have been driven from the proposition that the states could not regulate and fix freights within its borders we have fought that out with the railroads in my state through the superior court of the first control up to the supreme court of the united states in 1877 there met a constitutional convention in my state composed of its brainiest members and truest men led by that immortal statesman who illustrated that state both in this house and in the senate who attracted the attention of the united states and of the world by the power of his intellect and greatness of his abilityrobert toombs he enacted into the constitution of our state the direction to the legislature that they should pass laws to regulate freight rates that was left to the legislature the legislature met aid appointed a commission in 1879 that commission originated rates they took up the railroad rates of the state from a to z and prescribed and fixed them there was hurrying and scurrying in hot haste to find shelter first behind the circuit court of the united states we find it in the fifth federal reporter in the case of tilley v the railroad commission they asserted that georgia through its legislature had no right to delegate the power to a commission to fix a rate a learned judge who afterwards graced the supreme court of the united statesjudge woodrendered an able opinion on that subject part of which i will put into my remarks saying among other things ilow a delegation of power to declare what is just and reasonable could be more plain and explicit is difficult to see it is not conferred on the courts the railroad companies have no part or lot in the decision of the question but the constitution declares it is hereby conferred on the general assembly even where there is no constitutional provision as that which exists in this state it has been held that where property has been clothed with a public interest legislature may fix a limit to that which in law shall be reasonable for its use this limit binds the courts as well as the people if it has been improperly fixed the legislature not the court must be appealed to to change it and discussing it further on the true distinction therefore is between the delegation of power to make the law which necessarily involves a discretion as to what it shall be and conferring authority or discretion as to its execution to be exercised under and in pursuance of the law the supreme court of georgia in the case which i hold in my hand upheld the power of the state to delegate this authority to a railroad commission"], [0.05404084920883179, 0.9459591507911682, 1, "i think it a case of both closing and disclosing i want the case for the affirmative disclosed if possible the other day i spent some time trying to the best of my ability to disclose the remarkable powers furnished by this charter to this corporation i shall not dwell upon that subject any more i shall devote myself now to the fundamental principles involved in this sort of legislation my friend the gentleman from louisiana a moment ago quoted me as having said that this measure was a nonpartisan question and it is a nonpartisan question i am not appealing to a single man on this side of this chamber to vote for or against this bill because of political reasons i have been trying to appeal to members on the other side of the chamber to vote upon this bill for nonpolitical reasons i did try to get them to forget that the humble individual who happened to oppose this bill happened at the same time to be the leader of the minority in this house i would scorn to put this bill upon the footing of a partisan or political question it amounts to something higher than that it amounts to a question of an attack upon the fundamental principles of right government and it ought to surpass all partisanship in the world the gentleman from wisconsin who is always clear and always courteous has shown in his usual manner the importance of this scheme its very importance rings an accusation against the bill damning in its character it is so important that it is a national and governmental affair and is not an affair to be carried out by a private corporation for its own profit why on this side of the chamber this morning a friend of mine said john what is your opposition to this bill they are going to do it for nothing it is not going to cost the government of the united states a cent oh my friends whenever pittsburg does anything for ndthing let me know and let me know all about it right early in the morning and whenever a private corporation organizes itself with immense capital and wants to do something for nothing i want to ask the question first will it cost the government anything that is a little bit of a question and after i get through with that i want to ask will it cost the people anything and that is a great big question i dare say there is not a man on either side of this chamber fool enough to think there can be organized in the district of my frieid of pennsylvania a corporation to carry on a canal or other business for purely philanthropic and altruistic purposes especially if it be the business of digging a canal to compete with a railroad ready and able to buy the canal out i dare say there is not a man on this fioor who does not know at the bottom of his heart that if this charter was put up for sale today it would be worth four or five million dollars in the market to the men who are going to undertake the project whether for the purpose of digging a canal and working it and charging tolls upon it at the highest possible legal rate or for the purpose of leasing the canal afterwards to a railroad or for the purpose of selling the canal afterwards to the pennsylvania the baltimore and ohio or any of the other cognate railroads that are interested in transportation down that valley so that the very reason i am opposed to the bill is the immense importance of the canal both to the lower mississippi valley and the upper lakes of the country it is so important that it ought to be executed by the government gentlemen must not forget that in the early history of this country we went both as state governments and as a national government into the canalbuilding business and gentlemen must not forget there is not a single solitary one of those prfvate or company canals left today that is not under railroad ownership not one the chesapeake and ohio has gone the old delaware canal has gone there is only one left that is not under railroad ownership and that is the erie canal system in the state of new york and the only reason why it is left is because the people of the state of new york chose rather to make it free and to pay out of the state treasury every dollar for its construction without charging back to commerce or the people one cent of dividend or interest on the original cost and even in the early history of the erie canal they charged no more than was necessary for maintenance and equipment now they charge nothing at all the people of new york have taxed themselves to procure in that great commercial state a free regulator of transportation rates the gentleman says there are ten lines of railway running through the country this canal will traverse if i remember his language correctly ah the ten put together are rich enough either to lease or to buy this canal after you have dealt out its privileges and toll power as a charter right freely and without pay to certain men whose very names none of us were ever acquainted with until this bill presented itself in this house they are rich enough to buy it it can be turned over to the pennsylvania railroad tomorrow under this charter because the parties who receive the charter can sell it or lease it tomorrow and although r can not prove it and i do not like to make assertions that i can not prove and therefore will not positively assert it i suspect in my heart that it is already turned over to the pennsylvania railroad or some other great railroad interest what are you going to do by this bill you are going to organize a private company to do what to do what the government of the united states ought to do to do it why because you say the government of the united states will not do it why will not the government of the united states do it because you are spending your money around upon the surface of the earth seagirdling the globe with islands that you want to possess yourselves of and neglecting the domestic development of your own people neglecting to put your dollar where your dollar will grow and grow into what into fruit of luxuriant benefit to your own children you are choosing rather to put it elsewhere among aliens half devil and half child 1 welcomed the speech made by the gentleman from louisiana this morning upon the subject of the duty of the united states to engage in the heyday of its prosperity and its wealth because the heyday can not last always in the development of the industry and the commerce and the navigation of the united states and in building up great competitive lines of free waterways against exploitive railroad influences but does the gentleman from louisiana think he is going to arrive at his end by this sort of legislation no this is the first step in this line it will not be long before we will have all sorts of private corporations coming here to get charters to do all sorts of river and harbor and canal work wherever in the opinion of the incorporators the work can be done profitably for the incorporators there is no sense in deepening harbors and in building canals except to furnish a bridle upon railway rate regulation and you can not furnish a bridle if you give substantially unrestricted power to a private corporation whose interest it is to charge the utmost possible under the law for the transportation of freight along its line six hundred thousand dollars a mile 1 believe the gentleman from wisconsin said this work would cost somewhere within the free limit of between thirtyfour and forty million in toto he said the work would cost count the interest to be earned upon that a dividend to be earned upon that a fairly remunerative rate to be earned upon it why if this is true you might better appropriate out of the treasury today the sum of 30 000 a mile or even 60 000 to build a singletrack road and 60 000 a mile would build a double track along that line and then give it to somebody free upon the condition that they would not charge anything upon the original cost my friend from pennsylvania says that he has not heard anybody but democrats and a few railroads opposing this legislation ah my friend mr dalzell and i have served in the united states congress too long for him of all men to accuse me of being tied up to the railroad interests of this country the pennsylvania railroad is not close to me let him say how close it is to him i have no interest in this bill except the interest that every citizen of the united states has in it and one further interest and that is the interest as an inhabitant of the lower mississippi valley of s~eing to it that the railroad interests of this country and private corporation interests of this country do not forestall the great enterprise of a free canal from the great lakes to the lower mississippi leading out by new orleans to the panama canal gentlemen say that they are going to do this for nothing that is to say it is not going to cost the government as a government anything but it will cost the people something and i want to warn you now every man of you that votes for this bill will return to curse you when your people find out what this canal company charges"], [0.0576401948928833, 0.9423598051071167, 1, "considering its record one must view with misgiving confidence the conduct of the party in power as represented on this floor in having suprorted the measure to save the people from the extortions discrininations and rebates by the railroads if sincere in its protestation for public good why has it not made an effort to rid the country of that more grievous evilthe unbridled and unconscionable trusts nor will the american people confide in the fidelity of the president in supporting this great democratic policy unless he intensifies his efforts to save them from these far more destructive evils his abortive court procedure invokes derisive contempt from both the people and the trusts and this mockery is being accepted by many as either an approval of or a surrender to these monsters of iniquity by the party in power the administration must know that the trusts are barricaded by protection it must further know the most serious blow that could be inflicted is to repeal the protective schedules of the dingley law they laugh at the futile attempts to enforce the antitrust laws but if the trustcontrolled articles were put upon the free list there would be wailing and gnashing of teeth in their camp it is within the power of this congress to destroy 85 per cent of the trusts within the next twenty days and it is up to our republican friends to act now or stand branded as the champions of the most villainous iniquity of the age the president in his early manhood drank too deeply of the political philosophy of cobden and bright not to be fully advised that the trusts are the fruits of protection and his acute strenuosity in investigating public wrongs must have long since convinced him that the existing railroad abuses are largely the parasitic evils of protecton and truststhat in the clutches of such giants as the steel beef and oil trusts the greatest railroads are as powerless as a private citizen and that when they say come they cometh go they goeth or are either absorbed or subjected to a ruinous boycott knowing these facts and remembering that he has acquired a reputation for proverbial honesty of statesmanship we can not account for his complete surrender to the tariff standpat policy of his party unless it be that his quietude is inspired by the disloyalty of his party friends too he doubtless temembers that it took moses many years to overcome the idolatry of the israelites i am an avowed advocate of railroad rate legislation believing that rebates and private car lines are auxiliaries to the trusts i voted for the hepburn bill and though defective as it is i believe its adoption will likely result in much good to the country but to one who thinks a moment about the industrial conditions of the country how insignificant must appear the graft of railroads when contrasted with the wholesale robberies of the trusts while the railroads have increased the price of freight on lumber about 17 per cent the lumber trust has increased the cost of the product to the home builder more than 100 per cent while the railroads have increased the freight on shoes about onefourth of a cent per pair from boston to the south the hide trust an adjunct of the beef trust has increased the price from 10 to 50 cents per pai r within the last six months governor douglas of massachusetts is credited with recently saying that the duty on hides alone annually cost the people 10 000 000 of which 2 250 000 is paid to the government and the balance of more than 7 000 000 to the hide trust the railroads have unjustly increased the freight on agricultural implements from chicago to the great southwest but the international harvester trust sell the same products to the foreign farmer for from 20 to 30 per cent less than to those at home since the dingley law went into operation the railroads have doubtless largely increased the freight on iron steel and the manufactures thereof but the steel trust has almost doubled the price of these products a manufacturer of farm wagons in explaining why he advanced prices 25 per cent said less than two years ago the president of the great steel corporation testified that bar iron and steel could be produced at a profit for 12 50 per ton and for steel we must pay 40 or over 200 per cent profit the steel magnates tell us that when iron was sold at 18 per ton the price was too low and was a breeder of panics but we all recall the fact that in 1893 the carnegie properties were valued at less than 10 000 000 and that after five years of panic and 18 prices mr carnegie sold his interests alone in these properties for 360 000 000 this was 350 per cent profit in five years or 72 per cent annually and in panic times too how long 0 lord how long will the dear people be thus fooled anti too how insignificant appear the rebates on the freight on sugar when compared with the millions annually pocketed by the sugar trust and as another evidence of the insincerity of our republican friends let me state that the democrats on two different occasions within the last two years have voted almost solidly to repeal the duty on refined sugar and thereby destroy the sugar trust while our republican friends voted almost solidly against the proposition but more than this there are a cartload of bills before the ways and means committee touch1906 i ing every phase of the tariff law all having for their chief aim the abolition of a trust as well as the opening of new markets for our increasing commerce and if passed would save millions to the consumers on agricultural implements barbed wire shoes vehicles and other necessaries but they are as dead in that committee as though interred in the arlington cemetery what better evidence of the duplicity and arrant hypocrisy of the republican party is wanted it may be that their policy of crucifying the witch and sparing the devil is founded upon the lurking prejudice against the railroads for failing to come across as liberally as they should have done in the late presidential campaign perhaps if the latter had contributed as liberally as did the trusts and the insurance companies these ahabs of protection might have spared their vineyards and at this good hour their lords might have been wining and dining with the mccurdys in the courts abroad our republican friends should not conclude for a moment that by their cuttlefish antics in dealing with existing wrongs they can muddy the waters of public opinion the people are beginning to know the real issue the real cause of the trouble and appreciate the insincerity of any effort to abolish the trusts without the abolition of protection it is known in every hamlet that the steel trust sugar trust agriculturalimplement trust and many others are waxing strong and stronger day by day under the sheltering schedules of the dingley law the question of the hour is who shall live the people or the trusts who shall sway the rod of empirethe people or these monsters of protection whether the great agricultural industry of the south and west shall be released from these bandits of spoliation and have a free and unfettered market for their increasing crops and whether the multitude of american consumers shall continue to pay more tribute to the moguls of protection than to the support of their government are the real issues the people are determined in their efforts for reform and our republican friends can not quell them by such pacific measures as this emasculated hepburn bill or by sending a few petty thieves from the postoffice department to the penitentiary the wageearners want a chance to enjoy the fruits of their toil the masses are crying for an opportunity to spend their hard earnings in the support and education of their families instead of dividing it with bandits the 30 000 000 of our farmers who sc6rn a bounty from the government demand the world for their market their broad acres are smiling with riches as soon as the government stays the hand of the robber and removes the protective wall that isolates them from the world i dare say that if the great consuming masses of the country could fully appreciate the extent of the wholesale robbery being daily perpetrated under the laws of their country if they could know and behold the truth of the iniquities that follow in the wake of protection there would be a political revolution the like of which has not found a place in history the great mass of our plain patriotic people having labored incessantly for a living have never considered reriously the proposition that under trust rule every cent of duty levied under the dingley law on any article is paid by them whether the same is imported or made at home thus if the american farmers annually purchase 1 000 000 sewing machines of which 1 000 are imported and 999 000 made at home then the price of the 1 000 plus the tax of from 5 to 10 each fixes the price of the entire number manufactured at home the tariff tax is always added to the cost of the domestic product as well as to the cost of the imported article if it is not added to the domestic as well as the imported article there would be no use for protection its sole purpose is to enable the home manufacturer to add the amount of the tariff as an extra profit to the cost of production otherwise no one would want protection or a low duty would do as well as a high one in other words when a manufacturer demands that there shall be a duty of 45 or 50 per cent tax on the article he makes then he is simply asking the government to permit him to add the said amount to the cost of production since the diffqrence in the expense of manufacturing here and elsewhere is more than equaled by the cost of transportation from a foreign country this seems so plain that a wayfaring man though a fool may see it speaking of the effect of protection alexander hamilton said duties of this nature evidently amount to a virtual bounty on the domestic fabrics to the same effect john quincy adams wrote the duty constitutes a part of the price of the whole mass of the article in the market it is substantially paid upon the article of do mestic manufacture as well as upon that of foreign production upoi one it is a bounty upon the other a burden and the repeal of the tai must operate as an equivalent reduction of the price of the article whether foreign or domestic if the duty was regarded by the ablest friends of protection as a bounty to the manufacturer and paid by the consumer when there were no trusts how should it now be considered when every vestige of domestic competition is destroyed i contend that separated by thousands of miles from all formidable competition and having more convenient raw material than any other nation we can compete with any country in the manufacture of almost any article i contend further that the entire tariff tax amounting to not less than an average of 48 per cent on all kinds of manufactures is a subsidy to the manufacturers if taken and i contend further that under the trust rule it is accepted and passed as a surplus profit into the coffers of the trusts in these contentions i believe that i am sustained by the intelligent judgment of the american people if not by the republican wizards of this house in this connection let me read you a table showing the total amount of four leading products imported into the united states in 1905 together with the actual per cent rate of duty paid and amount received by the government ad articles value duty valorem rate per ct iron and steel products 22 044 97 s 4g2 237 33 meat products 72 c04 254 0 85 agricultural implements 13 876 2 775 0 glass and glassware 776 669 8 311 715 57 the value of these imports plus the cost of transportation and plus the duty collected not only fixed their prices in this market but also the prices of all like domestic products consumed there is no difference in market price of an imported and nonimported article of like class a dress suit that cost 22 in berlin plus a 19 import duty could not be duplicated out of domestic goods of like kind in this city for less than 40 says a substantial citizen schwab while at the head of tile steel trust wrote his man frick a few years ago that while steel rails sold here for 28 a ton he could deliver them in england for 16 and make 4 profit it is a wellknown fact that the beef trust sells meat 25 per cent higher in buffalo than just across the line in canada the net profits of american steel industry alone for 1905 amounted to 119 80 2s2 the canadian tariff commission says makers of thrashing machines feeders stackers weighers baggers and portable farm engines in the united states are selling these things in canada at 35 per cent below american prices they say that the discounts are that much below what any jobber can obtain them for in the united states and that a trade has been built up which amounts to 750 000 a year these facts not only verify the doctrine of hamilton and adams but demonstrate to every impartial mind that the entire duty is taxed against the consumer that on the imported article going to the government and on the domestic article to the trusts which are born of protection and sired by the republican party thus there are 6 000 000 farms in the united states an l granting that each consumes 200 pounds of domestic wire valued at 4 cents per pound we find they consume 1 200 000 900 pounds costing 48 000 000 and applying the principle just enunciated we find that 42 per cent of the 43 000 000 or 20 000 000 is tariff profit to the trusts the truth of this is apparent let us apply this doctrine to a few of the general schedules of the dingley law and note the results by adding 15 per cent increase to tie amount shown by the census report for 1900 we find that in 1905 the total iron and steel products manufactured in the united states amounted to 1 131 395 205 of which 134 727 221 was exported leaving for home consumption the amount of 996 067 984 of this amount 3s per cent or approlaiately 378 000 000 was tax levied for the trust while the government on like products imported for the same year received only 8 472 237 as is shown by the table just read in the same year and in the same manner we find that our total manufactured meat products amoumted to 1 000 000 000 being 745 567 433 in 1900 of which was exported the amount of 169 999 685 leaving 830 000 315 for home consumption of this amount 35 per cent or quite 290 000 000 was tariff bounty to the meat trust while the government as per the table read received a tax on the imported product of only 254 332 the e average duty of 35 per cent is a modest estimate since the tax is 2 cents a pound on fresh meats 5 cents on hams and bacon and 35 per cent on extracts of neat likewise in 1905 we manufactured agricultural implements to the amount of 126 000 000 of which we exported 29 721 741 leaving 96 278 259 for the home market of this 20 per cent or about 19 000 000 was tariff to the trust while the government on like imported articles received only 2 775 the amount imported being 13 876 it is estimated that in 1905 we produced about 175 000 000 of glass and glassware and exported 2 252 709 leaving for the domestic market 192 747 291 of which 57 per cent or more than 86 000 000 is tax profit pure and simple in the same manner on scores of other articles of everyday consumption such as sugar leather products woolen goods hats cutlery sewing machines etc it can be shown that under the dingley trust reign the consumers are paying many times more to the trusts than to the government collecting the facts i have just stated we find that in 1905 the american consumers on four leading articles of everyday consumption were taxed by the dingley law 773 000 000 for the trusts while only 14 506 013 for their government as is shown by this table to the gov to the articles ernment trusts iron and steel products 8 472 237 378 000 000 meat products 254 432 290 000 000 agricultural implements 2 775 19 i00 000 glass and glassware 88 008 000 total 14 508 013 773 00 000 this is a remarkable disclosure indeed but it is nevertheless true these estimates are based upon the rate of duty collected on the class of articles imported while there are many articles in the schedules bearing a much higher duty that are not imported if anyone doubts the truth of these figures let him go in the markets and buy a beefsteak a window sash a mowing machine a roll of steel wire and then have the same order duplicated in any free market i dare say that there are 80 000 000 of american consumers who are willing to attest the truth of this proposition let us present this robbery in another phase a purchaser going into the markets to buy a bill of goods places at least onethird of his money to the credit of the trusts the farmer buying a bill of necessaries in the home market pays the trusts the same tax he would have to pay the government were he to buy them in england and bring them to this country we submit the following showing the approximate amount of graft for the trust on a modest bill of domestic merchandise estimating the same according to the actual amount of tax paid on like products imported in 1905 articles total trust cost tax sewing machine 25 0 7 00 disk harrow 4008 11 00 vehicle 50 00 8 33 set of harness 30 00 8 26 worsted suit 20 00 9 46 glass door and window panels 50 00 31 80 8 barrels sugar 15 00 4 62 total 00 80 47 the same bill of goods made at the same time out of the same material and in the same factories is sold to foreigners at 80 57 less than at home and still the farmer votes the republican ticket i never think of protection and the farmer that i am not reminded of macklins definition of law when he said it is a sort of hocuspocus science that smiles in yer face while it picks yer pockets but sir there is one pertinent inquiry in this connection that i desire to make how can your party face the farmers of the west in defense of a policy that taxes them 19 000 000 for the trusts while only 2 775 for their government or how are you to stand before the 80 000 000 of our meat consumers who are being annually robbed under your coveted policy of 290 000 000 if they knew as we know your party would be crying for the mountains to fall upon it to hide its iniquity a few days ago i introduced a bill to place all kinds of manufactured meat products on the free list and if this congress will pass it not only will the beef trust be destroyed but millions will be blessed canada has a meat surplus of 31 000 000 argentina 27 000 000 new zealand 19 000 000 and australia 11 000 000 as well as other countriesmany millions all ready to come into our market and destroy the trust if you will but pass this bill now what are you going to dostand by the people or the trust charles edward russell in his valuable work on the beef trust says it annually extracts from the railroads 25 000 000 in rebates the rate bill is intended to stop this iniquity now by passing this bill and cutting off the multiplied millions of tariff graft this monster of criminal aggression will be shorn of its gory locks in the brief period of ten days you can accomplish more good than can the courts in a century adopt this measure and not only will the trust be destroyed but millions of the poor who have not tasted this lifegiving food for months will waft your praises to heaven in view of these appalling abuses of protection we should send a message of warning to the american people it should be proclaimed in every hamlet that the time has arrived in the life of this republic when under the law a private citizen is taxed many times more to enrich the trusts than to support his government every toiling farmer should be impressed with the truth of the statement that his class is taxed annually a hundred times more for the trusts than for the government on the implements of husbandry and the whole people should know that their annual tribute to the beef trust alone is nearly equal to the total expenditures of the government impart these facts as we know them and i dare say there will be a political panic in november"]],

the farming implements he can possibly use every carpenter in the country has every tool he can possibly need every man woman and child has all the clothing they can possibly need every mile of railroad using steel rails is already supplied and no additional rails are needed for any purpose every housewife in the land has all the household supplies she needs there is not a lawyer or business man who is not supplied with a typewriter there is not a hardworked seamstress who needs a new sewing machine there is no man in the whole land who has not already supplied his home with a sewing machine in the cities the people need nothing there are no poor people anywhere the gentleman has seriously declared that our manufacturers have not only supplied the wants but the desires of our people as well that they have all they need all they buy and all they want if the gentleman from pennsylvania really meant what he said then he is more ignorant of the true condition of our people than any educated man in america why we all know hundreds and hundreds of people who can not afford even the necessaries of life you will find people not five blocks from this capitol who are so poor that they have not the necessary furniture in their homes the necessary utilities of humble living there are today thousands of american women who are wearing away their very fingers because they are too poor to buy a machine to do their sewing and yet the republican party permits a law to remain in force which allows the manufacturers to sell to foreigners their sewing machines at a lower price than the same machines are sold here i would to god that the gentleman from pennsylvania spoke the truth when he declared that our people have all they need and all they want but unfortunately it is far from true i dare say the gentleman can find a few people even in the city of pittsburg who need a few things if he will take the trouble to inquire now as a matter of fact to what extent are goods of american manufacture sold cheaper to foreigners than to americans mr charles schwab was the president of the united states steel corporation which manufactures more than half of the iron and steel products of the united states he is perhaps as well informed as to the prices of american manufactures as any living man in may 1901 mr schwab was examined by the industrial commission i quote the following from his testimony it is quite true that export prices are made at a very much lower rate than those at home i think you can safely say this that where large export business is done for example in the line of iron and steel nearly all the people from whom supplies are bought for that purpose give you a good price for the materials that go into export railroads will in most instances carry them a little cheaper for you and so on all down the line is it a fact generally true of all exporters of this country that they do sell at lower prices in foreign markets than they do in the home markets that is true perfectly true if the value of goods sold cheaper abroad than at home was only threetenths of 1 per cent of our manufactured products do you not suppose mr schwab would have taken the pains to say so if the value of goods sold cheaper abroad than at home had been only 4 000 000 do you not suppose mr schwab would have said so he must have known it if it was true and if the goods sold cheaper abroad had been of an inferior quality would not mr schwab have called attention to that fact also an examination of his testimony is quite interesting he answered clearly and emphatically that it is the practice of our manufacturers to discriminate in favor of foreigners he declared that all exporters of this country sell cheaper abroad than at home he made no limitation whatever he did not qualify his statement but the gentleman from pennsylvania evidently differs from mr schwab the latter was examined under oath the former was speaking for campaign consumption therefore whose statement should be accepted that of mr schwab testifying under oath or that of mr dalzell delivering a speech for campaign distribution i think it may be accepted as a fact that as a rule the manufacturers of this 921i country discriminate against our own people they are enabled to do it why because they are protected against outside competition we must buy from them or else not buy at all and having us in their power they charge us whatever price they decide we must pay we hear a great deal about the oppression of the trusts in this country the president is having them prosecuted in the courts laws are being enacted intended to protect the people against their iniquities honest men all over the land are trying to provide some intelligent scheme by which these great organizations may be forced to treat the people fairly yet while all this is taking place and while the whole country from the president down is crying out against them we allow a scheme of legislation to remain in force which openly and notoriously allows them to treat us worse than they treat foreigners and gentlemen upon this floor in their partisan zeal defend this practice yet two facts remained undisputed first iron and steel products can be manufactured in america cheaper than anywhere in the world second the manufacturers of these very products are forcing the american people to pay more for their manufactures than they require foreigners to pay why because there is a tairiff duty of about 40 per cent ad valorem on all iron and steel manufactures brought into this country up to this hour absolutely nothing practical has been accomplished in forcing the trusts to deal fairly with the people instead of instituting a prosecution here and there in the courts which merely subjects these violators of the law to a trifling fine had we not better say to them if you can afford to sell your products to a foreigner at a certain price you can afford to sell the same product to your own people at that price and we will pass a law reducing the import duty on similar goods manufactured abroad so that you will be forced to sell to americans at least as cheaply as you sell to foreigners whenever such a law as this is passed the people will experience instant relief to a certain extent at least and if your party will pass such a law the people will then believe that you are honest and sincere when you declare that something must be done to protect them against the oppression of monopoly i do not believe there is another country under the sun where such monstrous conditions exist again the distinguished gentleman from pennsylvania declared that there is no demand for general tariff revision outside the democratic party where did the gentleman get that information probably from the highly protected manufacturer of his own district probably from the men who by reason of the protection they enjoy are enabled to charge the american people more than they charge foreigners these men regard the lowering of any tariff schedule as treason they believe that the man who proposes such a change on this floor is an enemy to society where would you go if you wished to ascertain the true sentiment of the american people of any people respecting any great question where would you expect to get the truth what class of men make a business of studying and interpreting public sentiment are they not the editors of the great newspapers of the countries where there is freedom of speech this is a day of independence of political thought and action the newspaper which is the constant and willing slave of any political party has but little influence does the gentleman read the independent newspapers of this country if he does will he say there is no demand outside the democratic party for a revision of those schedules in the dingley tariff law which enable our manufacturers to form themselves into trusts and monopolies and to charge our own people far more for their output than they charge the balance of the world will he say there is no demand from the independent press of this nation for a revision of those schedules which enable our tariffmade trust and monopoly to single out the american people for oppression and extortion will he read the independent press of his own state and say that there is no demand for such a revision of tariff schedules as will force the trust which manufactures agricultural implements to sell those implements as cheaply to the resident of pennsylvania as to the resident of canada it is not denied that the manufacture of agricultural implements is largely controlled by a monopoly it is not denied that this monopoly does charge our own people nore for its manufactures than it charges the balance of mankind who buy it is not denied that it is enabled to perpetrate this injustice by reason of the protective schedules of the dingley tariff it is not denied that a slight lowering of those schedules would force the protected trust to sell cheaper to our own people nobody can with any show of reason contend that the trusts and monopolies of this country need the protection of the dingley schedules at this very moment the president is ordering the institution of prosecutions because our trusts are violating our laws the republican party for forty years has been the patron the promoter of monopoly what good will a prosecution here and there accomplish so far as the great mass of consumers are concerned our republican friends boast of the prosecutions which the president has ordered to be instituted will any gentleman rise here and now in his seat and point out a single one of the necessaries of life which the people are enabled to purchase cheaper because of any prosecution ordered by the president certainly the president is to be commended for enforcing the law let the prosecutions continue but would it not be better far better more practical to cut out the root of the evil and remove the protection which tempts these corporations to violate the law i beg to submit clippings from more than a dozen great newspapers demanding a revision of the tariff along the lines i have indicated i trust the gentleman from pennsylvania and the gentleman from indiana will read these clippings for they represent the cause of the american people most strongly and they may serve to open the eyes of these gentlemen as to the sentiment of their own people these gentlemen insist that there is nothing wrong in the practices of these protected trusts but the independent press of their own states declare that these practices are wrong that it is wrong to force the american people to pay tribute to monopoly that it is wrong to allow a system of protective schedules to continue which permits monopoly not only to flourish but to discriminate against our own people president roosevelt says it is wrong for on the 3d day of june 1900 he declared in a message to the legislature of the state of new york referring to the growth of monopolythat the man who by swindling or wrongdoing acquires great wealth for himself at the expense of his fellow stands as low morally as any predatory medinval nobleman and is a more dangerous member of society any law and any method of construing the law which will enable the community to punish him either by taking away his wealth or by imprisonment should be welcomed under the revision of the tariff demanded by the democratic party and the great independent press of the country we may not be able to return to the people the illgotten gain extorted from them but we will at least put an end to such practice in the future no demand for revision outside the democratic party have the gentlemen forgotten the last public utterance of president mckinley the kind the gentle the good mckinley who lit up no fires of hate who made no schisms mckinley who was great enough to demand a revision of the very system which he himself had fabricated president mckinley in that memorable speech used these words by sensible trade arrangements which will not interrupt our home production we shall extend the outlets for our increasing surplus a system which provides a mutual exchange of commodities a mutual exchange is manifestly essential to the continued and healthful growth of our export trade we must not repose in fancied security that we can forever sell everything and buy little or nothing if such a thing were possible it would not be best for us or for those with whom we deal we should take from our customers such of their products as we can use without harm to our industries and labor reciprocity is the natural outgrowth of our wonderful industrial development under the domestic policy now firmly established the period of exclusiveness is past the expansion of our trade and commerce is the pressing problem commercial wars are unprofitable a policy of good will and friendly trade relations will prevent reprisals reciprocity treaties are in harmony with the spirit of the times measures of retaliation are not if perchance some of our tariffs are no longer needed for revenue or to encourage and protect our industries at home why should they not be employed to extend and promote our markets abroad i beg to submit now editorial clippings showing to soie extent the sentiment of

mississippi the minority leader of this body one of the kids of the house i can only expect your indulgence for a very short time i do not desire to speak in support of this bill because i fear it will not pass this body by almost a unanimous vote neither do i wish to speak in favor of the bill because i believe anything i might say could influence that branch of the legislative department of our government occupying the other end of the capitol the fact is i am of the opinion that august body has heard from homethe people of the several statesduring the past few months and now stands ready to hail with delight the opportunity to support the measure that bears the honored name of the distinguished gentleman from the great state of iowa but i do want to speak in favor of this bill because i want the consciousness of having gone on record in the early part of my experience as a member of this honorable body favoring this bill because i believe it to be a measure that is fair practical and just i believe it to be a measure that is equitable both to the shippers and the carriers of tile country therefore i desire tt assign a few good reasons wihy i favor the bill and why i shall vote for it some gentlemen who have spoken undertook to go into a complete analysis of the bill but i shall content myself with an examination at this time of its caption i observe in the caption of the bill it is recited that it is the object of the measure to amend the act of february 4 1887 and all acts amendatory thereof and to enlarge the powers of the interstate commerce commission hence i infer a law has been on the statute books of this country for nineteen years the object of which is to clothe the interstate commerce commission with authority to adjust differences and controversies arising between the shippers and the carriers i also observe from the language of this bill there is not only existing laws on the subject of transportation and rates charged by the carriers engaged in interstate commerce but the laws which do exist are not far enough reaching in their effect i also observe there are certain evils existing regarding rates as fixed by the railroads and transportation companies and that existing laws ought to be so amended as to afford remedies for existing wrongs is the author of this bill wrong when he assumes that there is pressing necessity for legislation such as this mleasure contemplates was the committee wrong when it voted unanimously to recommend the bill favorably is the record wrong that has been made up from the various hearings before the interstate commerce commission last but not least are the people of our country wrong in their almost unanimous appeal to congress to enact remedial legislation along these lines in other words if those who favor this bill are right it is high time we get about our business and enact it into law it is my opinion there has never been a public question in this country since the days of the revolutionary war on which there has been such unanimity of opinion among our people as there is today of the rate bill what does it mean to see this house almost solidly united in the support of this bill it means the people of this country have spoken and this body merely reflects their opinion it can truly be said the house of representatives is the peoples branch of the legislative department of our government n there can be no doubt that the time has come when legislation affecting the transportation problem in this country is needed if so let us rise to the occasion and discharge our whole duty i am here reminded of the very able speech of the distinguished gentleman from pennsylvania a few days ago i nam also reminded of the very able speech of the distinguished gentleman from alabama i feel thee gentlemen took the most extreme views of this questionthe gentleman from pennsylvania opposing the bill and the gentleman from alabama supporting it i deem it my duty as there seems to be a difference of opinion among gentlemen on this question to here strike a happy medium or golden mean between these two extreme views and settle this question and settle it right for all time to come i feel i ought to do this i also feel when i shall have finished my purpose will be accomplished and the matter settled the gentleman from pennsylvania fears if this bill passes capital will become uneasy and withdraw from investment he fears this is a step in the direction of anarchy and socialism he fears this is a step which will ultimately result in governiient ownership of railroads he even fears our whole economic system will be disturbed and the splendid prosperity of our country destroyed why should tie gentleman be so alarmed i assure him there is not a member of this house but what wants to see every commercial interest of our great country thrive i for one am opposed to government ownership of railroads but i do believe it is the duty of the government to look well to the matter of the interstate commerce of the country the gentleman from alabama refers to the privileged classes of this country which have been permitted to thrive and fatten under the present system of government while the common people have been oppressed i do not believe any class of our people has been oppressed on the contrary i believe the great mass of our people have been progressing with the rest of the world i truly believe the laboring people of our country are better clothed better fed better educated and better housed than ever before in our history in fact there is no people in the civilized world who enjoy so fully the high degree of the comforts of life as do our people the fact is our people are better and more gen erally employed today than ever before in our historynot only in our history but in the worlds history in short our people are practically happy satisfied and contented now to the point i favor this bill because i believe it to be a conservative practical and equitable measure i do not favor it because i want to punish railroad companies neither do i favor it because i believe our people are being downtrodden and greatly oppressed and that this bill is intended to revolutionize our whole economlic system however i do want to caution the gentleman from pennsylvania and tie gentleman from maine that they ought not accuse those of us who favor this bill as favoring anarchy and socialism i rather believe this bill is calculated to bar socialism and anarchy because it expresses the wishes of the people of our country and the people can always be trusted socialism and anarchy do not thrive under free government like ours hence we should not forget the timehonored and basic principles of our government i desire to say just a word further before beginning the discussion of my subject proper that i may be fully understood i do not believe in enacting any law in a spirit of revenge i am not one who believes it necessary to punish railroads i rather like the great transcontinental railways of our country for what they have done for civilization we must not forge t the fact that the builders of railroads in the early days were among the honored pioneers of this country they blazed the way to higher civilization and made it possible for us to enjoy the manifold blessings of the splendid civilization we now enjoy we must not forget the fact also that in a great majority of instances the pioneer builders of our railroads not only encountered great difficulties but found themselves the most gigantic financial failures the country ever saw that building railroads was a hazardous business in the early days there is no doubt and because it was a hazardous busines the railroads or i should say the builders of railroads 21t04 appealed to the federal government to aid them in their undertakings they also appealed to state governments county governments and municipal governments the basis of their appeal was that the building of railroads was a public necessity therefore the public ought to contribute of their land and money to the building of the railroads federal state county and municipal governments accepted the explanation given by the railroads and contributed liberally it is authentically estimated that the federal government gave the railroads from time to time enough of its public domain which if in a contiguous body could be converted into five great states equal in area to illinois missouri iowa ohio and indiana state governments and county governments and municipal governments all gave liberally to the railroads of their money and property some of the counties in my own state missouri gave so liberally the people have yet outstanding railroad debts one county st clair county mo is required to hold its sessions of the county court in the woods to escape the enforcement of the law on the railroadbond question i laughter it now occurs to me our railroads have forgotten the time in the history of our country when they had to appeal to the government for aid now when the government desires to inquire into matters and things relating to railroad affairs it is claimed the government is overstepping the constitutional limitations and the railroads are exceedingly private corporations while the courts of the country have repeatedly declared the railroads to be common carriers and public highways i take it the review of the history of railroad building in this country brings us face to face with the fundamental right of the government to at least exercise a restraining influence over the railways and transportation companies engaged in the interstate commerce of our country it is to this right of the government to which i now desire to address myself to meet and discharge wisely the responsibility of regulating commerce and to bring the railways and other transportation companies engaged in interstate commerce back to their legitimate sphere and have them serve fully the purpose for which they were created in my opinion is the greatest question with which the present congress has to deal gentlemen have argued on the floor of this house during the progress of this debate and i am sure the railways all argue it that no substantial reasons exist for the passage of this bill it is argued it is a step in the direction of anarchy and socialism they express the belief such legislation will prove detrimental to the whole commercial system and that it is inconsistent with the principles of free government they are of the opinion should this bill become a law capital will be withdrawn from investment and the whole commercial world suffer gentlemen may be sincere in their contentions but those who are of this opinion are certainly in the extreme minority as compared with the great bulk of our people who are of the opposite opinion the fact is we are confronted with a condition from which there is no escape and as the chosen representatives of the sovereign people we must enact this bill into law the condition is that the people of this country are demanding legislation calculated to prevent certain unjust discriminations in the matter of freight rates charges and rebates as practiced by certain carriers of the country if the public is suffering serious wrong if there are farreaching abuses in the transportation of our commerce if the railways are not only carrying the commerce of the colutry but controlling the commerce of the country determining where it shall be massed where the markets are even located if they are discriminating in favor of big shippers as against little shippers if they are creating and fostering monopolies then there rests upon the congress the responsibility to act at once and act with determination and precisioni say it behooves the congress of the united states to rise to the occasion and do its patriotic duty by enacting this bill into law that the president of the united states stands ready to give the executive approval to the measure there is no doubt because he has expressed himself at sundry times and on divers occasions as favoring such legislation i am warranted in making this statement because he has so expressed himself in his various messages to congress the transportation question is one that lies close to all the people it affects every individual every community and all parts of the country either directly or indirectly both capital and labor are mutually dependent upon transportation in the production of wealth let it either be manufacturing mining or agriculture in fact all the occupations of men in the civilized world are dependent upon it it is not only important that lines of transportation be established but it is important that after they are established the rates be just and the service be adequate this proposition then naturally divides itself into two phases the first is the adequacy of the service the second is the justice of the charges or rates it is to the latter condition to which i shall now invite your attention because the people are not so much complaining at the service afforded by the carriers as they are complaining of unjust charges and unfair discriminations the community which is denied the opportunity to move its products to market at fair rates and upon an even footing with a competing community must inevitably suffer great loss therefore the very growth development and prosperity of every community to a very marked degree depends upon the transportation of the products of the community at large the truth is the founders of our republic saw at the very outset and in the general order of things it was necessary that lines of transportation be established and at the same time they saw the necessity of fixing a basis of equality for each community in the transportation of its goods wares men and merchandise as related to every other community we have to go to no other source for authority on which to base this argument than tie constitution of the united states because it is therein ordained that the congress of the united states shall have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states and that such commerce should be equitably carried on it was the evident intention of the fathers that the door of opportunity should be open equally wide to each and every community of the thirteen original states if that was tie spirit of the law then it is the spirit of the law now because these were the men who builded for the future in their wisdom they laid and grounded the very corner stones of this republic upon the eternal and everlasting principles of equality and fairness thereby making it possible today for us to enjoy the manifold blessings of freedom and independence sirs in the language of rudyard kipling we can not lose sight of these timehonored and basic principles of free government in this great and strenuous age of commercial activity lest we forget lest we forget and i beg of you let us not forget yet those who oppose the bill fear we are overstepping our constitutional authority i tell you where the trouble is we are not suffering so much from our efforts to overstep the bounds of constitutional authority as we suffer from lack of properly exercising our powers under the constitution tell me our constitution is so void of equity that it does not clothe the legislative department of our government with ample authority to correct existing evils and i will tell you then ours is no longer a government by the people of the people and for the people which i do not concede it will be remembered in the outset of my remarks i called your attention to the fact that the railroads of the country do not occupy the same position with reference to the people that the average private corporation does for the reason that the government assisted the railroads by donating land and money in their building i here wish to discuss briefly the relation of railroads to state and federal governments to begin with the railway corporations are creatures purely and simply of the state governments from the states they get their special powers and special privileges the state vests in the transportation company the greatest possible powers when it grants the franchise to do business within the state and even makes it possible for the corporation to take private property without the consent of the owner i here mean the method by which land is acquired by railway companies under condemnation proceedings in the various states of the union why is it possible that a railway company can do this is it because it is the bare intention of state governments to bestow special favors on the carriers or is it that they may be the better enabled thereby to discharge their duties to the public it must be for the latter reason it could be justified on no other ground the fact is the courts of this country have repeatedly held that the state would have no right to divest its citizen of his property except the purpose to which the property is put be a public one hence taking land for railroad purposes must be taking it for a public purpose again i wish to insist such an act could be justified on no other ground and the fact that it is taken for a public purpose is the sole justification for taking it at all then tell me that the states have not the right to control state commerce to prove beyond question of doubt the several states of the union have the right to at least exercise a restraining influence over the railways of their respective states i wish to give briefly the history of state railway legislation to begin with under our form of governmentfederal and statea division of powers and responsibilities with respect to transportation and the protection of the commerce of the country at large is fixed by constitutional limitation yet gentlemen fear we are overriding the constitution commerce is either state or interstate commerce a shipment beginning and ending in a state is state commerce hence the carrier undertaking the transportation must be subject to the laws of that state because the general government can exercise no anthority if the shipper is to be protected in his rights both as to efficient service and as i said before there is little complaint from that source and reasonable rates without being discriminated against he must look to the government of his state ile must do this because such is a transaction that is purely domestic on the other hand a shipment consigned in one state to a point in another state is interstate commerce this is necessarily true from the time it starts to move until it reaches its destination with respect to such a shipment the state has no authority and can afford the public no relief from wrongs at the hands of the carriers hence the absolute and imperative necessity that the federal goverhmentvest sufficient authority in the interstate commerce commission to at least exercise a restraining influence over the transportation companies which this bill seeks to do and will do if enacted into law these are to my mind some of the fundamental reasons on which the right of the government to enact such laws rests these principles were recognized nineteen years ago when the present interstateconmerce law was enacted and these are the reasons todaywhy this bill which seeks to amend this law should be enacted into law while it is a known fact that most of the states of the union have created commissions the object of which is to exercise a controlling or restraining influence over the railways engaged in state commerce it is also a fact that the public atlarge has little definite information concerning the experience of those states in which those commissions have been created and the conditibns and circumstances leading up to the enactment of present laws that i may more fully demonstrate the correctness of my position by alluding to the question of state regulation of common carriers i submit the following observations the tiuth is the states lead off in an effort at regulation of railways and railway rates the present interstatecommerce law was enacted in 1887 and the states began in 1871 i believe minnesota led the states then came illinois ii 1873 and iowa and wisconsin in 1874 the great central west or northwest was the pioneer in railwayrate regulation and it is the great west and central west today that stand in solid phalanx in support of this measure it is true other sectionsof the country are supporting the measure but it is doubted by some that they are so ardently supporting th measure as is the west a gentleman whose name i can not recall at this time made certain references a few days ago in a speech on the floor of this house to the socalled granger legislation i am here reminded that it might be well to review some oc the objections that were urged by the railways at the time the states tool up the idea of creating state boards or railroad commissions it was claimed that railroad construction would cease and that railroad business would be completely crippled and come to a standstillharrowing stories just such as we have heard during this debate coming from those who oppose the bill that dire and awful consequences would follow the enactment of such laws let us now see whether or not these consequences did follow it will be remembered the people said the railroads were wrong just as we say they are mistaken t6day in the year 1871 there were 12 401 miles of railroad in the four states that enacted this socalled antirailroad legislation from 1871 to 1875 viz minnesota illinois iowa and wisconsin in the same states in 1873 there were 14 627 miles showing the building of railroads had increased instead of having come to a standstill in 1875 there were 15 515 miles of road in the same states again showing the building of railroads had not come to a standstill this period of time covers the period when these same states were enacting this alleged hostile railroad legislation now to prove that railroad interests did not suffer in the states enacting this socalled antirailroad legislation i wish to submit the status of railroad building in four states which were about on a par with minnesota illinois iowa and wis cousin in population and in general development in which no railroad legislation was had during the same period the four states selected are missouri nebraska indiana and michigan in these states in 1871 there were 9 168 miles of railroad in 1873 there were 10 932 miles of road in 1875 there were 11 381 miles the figures presented show that minnesota illinois iowa and wisconsin held their own in railroad construction with the states of missouri nebraska indiana and michigan in fact they did better than missouri nebraska indiana and michigan i take it these states with which they have been compared are four states that were about as nearly on the same footing as any four that could have been selected in the whole united states hence this is not only a just comparison but abundant proof that the railroad interests did not suffer as a result of the legislation enacted by the states which was so much opposed by the railroads the question might present itself that the railroad business is not shown by these figures to have been in a very prosperous condition at that time while this is true the cause is easily traceable to conditions resulting from the general depression which affected the commercial world in all its phases at that time and not to the legislation of the states on the subject of railroad control by state boards now to the question proper i want this bill to pass because it is calculated to relieve the people from excessive transportation charges and discriminations and rebates there seems to me to be an effort on the part of the transportation companies to have us feel that this is such a complex and intricate subject that it is dangerous to meddle with it i remember well within a very short time after i was elected to congress in 1904 i received a letter from a certain shipper in missouri not in my district however and not a stockholder in a railroad company the nature of the communication was something like this the matter of railroad transportation is one that so affects the community at large that it behooves the congress of the united states to move cautiously along these lines that as a shipper he believed the public at large had little cause to complain at the treatment received at the hands of the transportation companies that his experience led him to believe as a rule all people were fairly treated and the public was suffering largely from imaginary and not real evils a little investigation on my part convinced me that as a shipper he was getting rates cheaper to chicago minneapolis and omaha than other shippers were who were not half so far away if it is a factand i am fully convinced it isthat favoritism partiality and unjust indiscriminations exist then this bill ought to pass these discriminations with respect to communities individuals and enterprises ought to be stopped because they tend to retard a good healthy development and growth locally in many sections of the country on the other hand these discriminations serve as an undue stimulus to certain localities which produce abnormal commercial conditions and which ought not to exist reasonably good service and at a reasonably fair cost of service is all the people want that is all this bill seeks to accomplish gentlemen fail to agree as to what the true scope and power of the interstate commerce commission should be they philosophize on the ultimate outcome of some abstract proposition or hypothetical case why not get down to business and enact this bill into a law let the commission get to work under the operation of the new law then we will see what the results are there is too much time in my opinion spent in speculation and the discussion of abstract propositions while i am of the opinion that the commission under certain conditions ought to be clothed with absolute power to fix schedules yet because this bill may notgo that far i do say it is an improve ment over the present law it is certainly a step in the right direction while i am also of the opinion that the great body of the people who suffer either directly or indirectly from these excessive transportation charges can not appear before the commission yet they will be relieved practically by the individual who does appear before the commission and prosecutes his cause to final issue just as it is in the courts of the country many citizens enjoy benefits under the laws that are tested by those who carry the cases through the courts just as fully as though they were able to carry on litigation themselves the commission should be clothed with full power to enforce publicity in respect to all matters pertaining to the public interests because invested with this power the necessity of prosecutions would less frequently arise but shall i vote against the bill because it may not meet my approval in this regard no i shall vote for the bill not for what of good it does not contain but forthat of the good it does contain in my opinion this bill when enacted into law will afford relief the extent to which this relief will be afforded depends like all other laws upon the extent of its enforcement and i here wish to assume that every man who is on the interstate commerce commission today and who may be on that commission in the future is and will be such type of american citizen that his purpose will be at all times to equitably enforce the law i have a right to assume this because no man has a right to go on such a commission except he be the highest type of american citizen except he be well seasoned in statesmanship well tried in public service and his patriotism integrity and ability beyond question the selection of the commission therefore becomes a question of importance and in my judglnent the bill has wisely provided that the selection be by appointment rather than by election i favor this method because it sometimes occurs that in the heat of contest for place political parties do not take into account all these essential qualifications the candidate should possess consequently public olficers do not always measure up fully to every requirement hence i favor the method provided for in this bill viz that the commission should be appointed by the executive gentlemen argue against this bill because they say they are against public ownership of railroads i am also against government ownership of railroads the author of this bill i assure you is against government ownership of railroads and i also assure you a majority of the committee from which the bill comes are against government ownership of railroads i take it this particular objection gentlemen have urged has no application to this measure while the government does not seek ownership of railroads and while i should oppose any such effort on the part of the government yet i do say the government has a duty to perform in the regulation of the railway transportation business of this country because the service is a public service which makes it in a sense essentially a function of government what is the nature of a railroad company in its capacity it should be public while the truth is it is more often a monopoly because it shuts out all other competition by a monopoly i understand it is meant that which takes unto itself all or the whole thing this may not be webster but this is the way i think of the word at this time and in the sense in which i have used it why is a railroad company a monopoly because all the people as a rule who live near it or tributary to it nmarket their products and receive their supplies over it they have no other alternative the state in which they live may have permitted the railroad company to take the land on which it has laid its tracks and built its switches from the individual yet he is dependent upon the company the people must accept the service offered cart their produce away haul in their supplies or walk the fact is the corporation which is a creature of the state and the recipient of public gifts and favors in many cases is permitted to tyrannize over the people i shall vote for this bill because it seeks to protectthe people against these wrongs and injus tices at the hands of the corporations the creatures of the states i shall vote for this bill because i say it is the plain duty of the government to protect its citizens against unjust discriminations one of our ablest supreme court judges once said the superintending power over the highways and the charges imposed upon the public for their use has always been in the government that such is not only right but necessary to protect the people against extortion there can be no kind of doubt the same duty the state owes its citizens in the protection of their rights under state laws tie government owes its citizens in the protection of their rights under federal laws the act of 1887 provides for a commission of five men to be appointed by the president with the consent of the senate the act also provides that all transportation charges shall be reasonable and just and that every unreasonable and unjust charge shall be unlawful it further provides that the commission is required to execute and enforce all provisions of the act that it shall investigate and inquire into all complaints of violations of the law and that it shall execute the law by petition to the court and the court shall enforce all lawful orders made by the commission at the time congress enacted the present law it was thought the commission was vested with ample authority to supervise rates and to issue orders and decrees with respect to what rates should be as a result of the various legal controversies between shippers and carriers in the courts the authority of the commission has been narrowed down until today it is powerless to afford relief in other words by judicial decision the commission has practically been deprived of the powers it was originally thought to possess in the annual report of the commission in 1897 it is stated as construed by the supreme court the carrier is given the right to establish and charge rates independent of the judgment of the commission and independent of the action of any court or tribunal the right to establish charge and receive unreasonable and unjust charges is not prohibited and in respect to charges which may be demanded and received for any transportation service the carriers are made the judges in their own cases as to what is reasonable and just this is the statement of the commission the commission was evidently led to make this statement as a result of its ten years of fruitless endeavors to enforce the law hence we are warranted at this time in assuming that all the people and the commission believed had been secured by the act of 1887 has been swept away by court decisions if this is true there is but one thing for congress to do now and that is to pass this bill the commission from year to year since 1897 in its annual reports to congress has made it clear that it was practically shorn of its power we ought either to pass this rate bill or abolish the interstate commerce commission and no longer keep up the present empty pretense again in 1902 the commission in its report in speaking of the defect in the law said that this imperfection is curable is conceded the fullest power of correction is vested in congress and the exercise of that power is demanded in the interest of the public welfare the sense of the wrongs and injustice which can not be prevented in the present state of the law as well as the duty enjoined by the act itself impels the commission to reaffirm its recommendations for the reasons so often and so fully set forth in previous reports and before the congressional committees moreover in view of the rapid disappearance of railway competition and the maintenance of rates fixed by combination attended as they are by substantial advances in the charges on pany articles of household necessity the commission regards this matter as increasingly grave and desires to emphasize its conviction that the safeguards required for the protection of the public will not be provided until the regulating statute is thoroughly revised what does such a report mean is it possible these men of whom this great commission is composed are mistaken in what they so appealingly urge in their reports to congress i can not believe they are mistaken i now wish to discuss briefly the situation that is referred to in this last report wherein it is stated moreover in view of the rapid disappearance of railway competition etc what does the commission say that competition is rapidly disappearing in transportation i say it so states and i further say there is no longer practically any competition among the railroads of this country the contentions of the gentleman from pennsylvania the distinguished gentleman from maine and the distinguished gentleman from ohio to the contrary notwithstanding i here wish to remind you of the contentions of these gentlemen who so eloquently declared that competition among railroads was the just and proper means by which this rate controversy should be determined how in the name of common sense and human reason can competition correct evils if there is practically no competition as is contended by the commission in its report in 1902 that my contention may be more fully explained that there is no longer competition among railroads i beg to submit the following table which shows that almost the entire railroads of the united states are controlled by six sets of financiers then talk about competition in the railroad business table showing number of roads embraced mileage and capitalization of each of the six great systems numclassification ber ofmile captalizaroads age tion vanderbilt 3 12 21 888 1 169 196 132

these figures mean they mean that at least 90 per cent of all the railwayswhich are public highwaysover which the commerce of the country is carried are controlled by six financial boards or agencies this to me looks more like one gigantic community of interests than a condition of competitive legitimate business enterprise about which we have heard so much from distinguished gentlemen who oppose this bill the truth is railway companies have been working for years to eliminate competition and they have about succeeded now that they have succeeded and there is no more of competition among the carriers of the country it is eminently proper that the government take a hand in this matter the railway managers were quick to see that railroads are monopolies and that competition between them differed from competition in other lines of business the advantage of maintaining rates was seen hence the roads at once began to arrange among themselves to divide the traffic which has been very effectively and equitably done but when the roads did this what about your competition this consolidation of interests was called pooling and in the act of 1887 pooling was prohibited since that time some very famous prosecutions have been made by the government and i desire to say with a reasonable degree of success but this table shows six boards with identical interests control practically the transportation business of the country yet gentlemen talk about competition in the railroad business not only do we find six great financial agencies in control of the railroads of the country but we find that between the six companies there is a mutual understanding as to rates and which places the entire commerce of the country practically under one common source of control then need we marvel that present rates are high and constantly subject to advance and being advanced there is but one logical conclusion at which we can arrive and that is the railway business has become a monopoly and needs to be restrained in some of its practices it was contended that by the consolidation of these interests expenses would be reduced consequently better rates would follow it was further contended this was the only purpose of the consolidation was this true consider what those in control of the railroads have done by consolidation 922 lines of road i mean different roads and nearly 50 different systems have been merged into 6 great systems they now reach out into every nook and corner of the united states and with a common interest determine what rates shall be charged the people of the different communities for transporting their commodities is it to be wondered at that unjust discriminations exist is it to be wondered at that rebates are granted favored shippers is it to be wondered at that people for short hauls pay more than others do for long hauls then is it to be wondered at that president roosevelt in his last message to congress said in order to insure a healthy social and industrial life every big corporation should be held responsible by and be accountable to some sovereign strong enough to control its conduct this declaration from the president of the united states comes well enough recommended to me to cause me to support the pending bill as an abstract economic proposition it might be true that increased profits in the hands of a few shippers may allow greater development than where the business is divided but it is certainly harmful to any community in its practical application wealth may be more rapidly accumulated when an individual or a number of individuals get a monopoly on any business but the thrift and prosperity of the community at large depend upon a general distribution of opportunities and accumulated wealth these large railroad corporations have come to look upon the small shipper with a degree of contempt in their big way of doing things and in their way of looking at big things they only look with favor upon the big shippers of the country this is why there is such a thing as a system of secret rebates practiced and unjust discriminations made hence the railroad companies encourage centralization in business we must not forget that one of the objects set out in the preamble to the constitution of the united states is to promote the general welfare i take it this bill seeks to promote the general welfare of all our people consequently i shall vote for it as i said in the outset i shall vote for this bill because it is reasonable practical and equitable"], [0.8713482618331909, 0.8713482618331909, 0, "there is not anything novel about this nothing startling i have copied the exact words of the constitution of the state of pennsylvania if that had been in force in the state of pennsylvania the enormous coal strike of three years ago would not have happened if that was in force today in the great coalproducing states of the union the strike of 600 000 coal miners that now stand menacing the industries of this country would not have been suggested because there would have been no contest between the opposing interests this is the law of pennsylvania today in substance and effect the only difficulty about the constitution of pennsylvania is that there is a question of the refusal of the state legislature to pass laws to carry into effect this organic act there is one section of this article of the constitution which i will read sze 12 the legislature shall enforce by proper legislation the proviblon of this article but they have never enforced it there it stands a monument of the wisdom of the constitution makers and a monument of the potential influence of the coal operators there is one of the propositions is that covered by the elkins law what have you done in this bill to carry it into effect if it is not covered by the elkins law and ought to be adopted what right have you to stand and say it shall not be put into this bill it is a very simple provision why it is said and my colleague from ohio after having gracefully yielded to my suggestion as to some of the things he said in a former speech has finally come down to the conclusion that the most that can be said about the railroad company is that it is an instrumentality of commerce that while not exactly owned by the state it is in a position to be dictated to as to its organization and as to its administration if that be so and i agree to it then what is to hinder the congress of the united states from saying to this great railroad corporation you shall be public servants and if you want to invest your money in running a railroad you shall run it under such conditions as shall not challenge your cupidity and challenge your disposition to commit outrages against the rights of the producing forces along your line you shall be the agent for the transportation lines why throughout the whole country we make laws in every state of the union saying what manner of man shall hold office what hianner of man shall administer the legal offices of the country we say the same thingwe provide that no man shall hold an office that has been created during his term as congressman until it is ended and we put all sorts of regulations on the instrumentalities of our administrative branch of the government why not say to this corporatiba that if it takes the franchise with the right of eminent domain you may go into the business of transportation you may carry coal and iron and steel farm products and cattle but you shall not have an interest in the production of it for the very reason that we will not consent that there shall be such an unfair advantage given to an owner of a railroad company there isnt anything new or novel about that we all understand the power of it why wasnt it put into this bill if the elkins law has failed and is worthless then there is a little matter a very small matter that i would like to inquire into i have not undertaken to exhaust the subject of improvements that might be made to remedy the evils that we complain of and that we have a right to complain of why not put it exactly this way any railroad company upon whose line there is a coal mine or sawmill or a shipping point of cattle shall furnish to every man on the line the same facilities the same right of transportation and every other thing that goes to make this property valuable and if you do not do it we will suspend your charter and turn you out why we have got power enough in the state some of my friends have forgotten that there are states in this union not long ago a railroad company in the state of ohio undertook in relation to a transaction to discriminate against the operators that had put down shafts and erected coal tipples to start in and mine coal there is no law in ohio on the subject the railroads refused to take on the switch when it was ready and yet they did take on another switch after that one had been constructed that took in a tremendous output of coal and which belonged to the officers or stockholders of the railroad company or in which they had interest a suit was brought in a state court and for what not for damages but a proposition to oust the corporation from its legal existence and that under no law except the common law applicableto all common carriers the result of it was when they hadquibbled long enough and delayed a little while they came down very gladly and took on the switch those are the evils we are complaining about i happen to know something about the conditions in thestate of west virginia and there is another evil there that i desire to instance in this connection a great trunk line of railroad had attached onto it a little short line running up a creek at the upper end of which was a big coal operator the owner of a few miles of railroad along the line below him where there was another mine there was coal mines open and after a while it was discovered that the upper mine was getting rich and crowding the markets of cincinnati and chicago and the lower mine was pining for the want of profits and dying when they came to look into it they found that they were each charged exactly the same pricethey paid the same price from the upper mine that they did from the lower mine the rate was the same but what else was done when the upper mine settled their freight account at the end of the month they were paid back a rate of freight that made their operation profitable while it starved the others to death i could prove that by my friend here from west virginia if i were to give the location and mention the names a young man friend of mine who had invested his money in the matter came to me and i told him offhand to get out of it and save what money he could and he did now why could not they put into a bill like this seeking to answer a great demand that is growing by which we have been threatened by the gentleman from michigan the wrath of the people which is going to be hurled at anybody for having even an opinion on one of these amendmentswhy couldnt they put into this bill if the elkins law is not sufficient something that would make it efficient and sufficient i maintain there is not one word here that is added to or subtracted from the elkins law there is one other little matter that i desire to talk about there has been some genius in the drawing of this bill if it has not been studied genius it has been a wonderful accident that has happened to it if there is in these united states of america a corporation that is absolutely soulless and absolutely lawless it is the pullman palace car company now listen to me we are undertaking to regulate now the transportation of passengers in the united states we are undertaking to see to it that everybody shall have a square deal as it is said i do not know anything about a square deal i know somethin about a fair deal but the square deal is something that i dont understand why dont we go after the pullman palace car company what have they done that they should be eliminated from all regulation and control some of the members of this committee say that those regulations are here and that the pullman palace car company is included i desire to show how ingeniously they are not included turn if you please to the first section of the bill here is a bill that undertakes to be definite and absolutely certain and i am sorry to say it is this looks as though it might have been accidental i hope it was it is a bill of definitions the term railroad as used in this act shall include all bridges and ferries used or operated in connection with any railroad and also all the road in use by any corporation operating a railroad whether owned or operated under a contract agreement or lease and shall also include all switches spurs tracks and terminal facilities of every kind used or necessary in the transportation of persons or property now watch the word property for that is going to become important after a little they come to the question of what transportation is on the third page and what it would be to be a violation of this law and here they say and the term transportation shall include cars and other vehicles and all instrumentalities and facilities of shipments or carriage irrespective of ownership or of any contract express or implied for the use thereof and all services in connection with the receipt delivery elevation and transfer in transit ventilation refrigeration or icing storage and handling of property transported the very ingenious and unnecessary use of that word property at that place excludes the pullman palace car company from the operation of the law totally and absolutely and yet some gentlemen on the committee tell me that that is included and they are sure it ought to have been included and so am i why not say so why not leave out the word property there and then you have it exactly covered by the first subdivision of the section but suppose they do not want to do that but put in the words including especially palace sleeping cars and dining cars they have been very elaborate in their description of the other instrumentalities but they have been very cunning in eliminating or else raising the question as they have all through this bill so much for that it is a matter of very small importance only it shows how little we have got out of this bill at last notwithstanding how widely the idea has been promulgated that all the ills that flesh is heir to in this country are to be cured by these provisions this is called a rate bill and yet when the president is approacied by a labor organization that represents an overwhelming moral influence in this country he tells us or tells them and we read and appreciate it that it is not intended to cut down the income of the railroad that they need not have any alarm about that and yesterday or the day before the gentleman from wisconsin who ought to be as well acquainted with the provisions of this bill as anybody else having been a faithful worker in the interest of it from the beginning said in his public speech here on the floor of the house there is not to be any reduction in the revenues of the railroads that the laboring men need not have any fears thatthe profits of the railroads are to be just the same that there will be no reduction in the revenues whatever in the language of a gentleman in one of our chicago conventions in the name of common sense what are we here for what are we here for what are you trying to do you have no proposition to raise any freight rates have you are you going to raise the freight rates is there some shipper somewhere who is to be muleted in higher rates of freight or do you not intend that there shall be any instrunentality here put in the form of law that shall cut down the rates of freight anywhere the income of the railroads is the income that is derived from freight and passenger fares and the carrying of express packages and all the other incidentals and if you are not going to cut down and circumscribe their income what are we doing what is it for dare you say that it is the purpose of this bill to increase freight rates in some directions dare you then will you not say it is your intention to cut down any freight rates anywhere for if you cut down any in order to keep you word good that you have pledged now to the labor interest of the country you have got to raise them somewhere there you are there is an absolute stultification of the position in which you have placed yourselves i do not believe that there is any political power any political organization on the face of this earth which an confer the general ratemaking power upon that political organization that will not inside of five years so demoralize and break up the harmonious system of today that it will carry consternation to the industrial interests of the country it is not going to affect it can not affect the section of the coulltry which i represent considerably for there is nothing in the bill which reaches our trouble but when you come to adjusting freight rates you will find that the center of the country will be safe and sound and the extremities of the country will be in a woeful condition if this bill goes into law and i hope it may not i should like to go down into texas and alabama two years from now and ask those gentlemen how they are getting along with a uniform system of freight rates why ever since i was old enough to know what a railroad was made for i have always understood that a railroad was fitted to carry commodities and that the people would be benefited by competition in rival railroad lines that has been the cry of the people of this country and that is why we built the southern railroad with the money of cincinnatibuilt it for the purpose of having a competing line against the louisville and nashville and other railroads and the competition in freight rates has brought this low standard of freight less today than onethird of some of the great coun tries of europe all of which has been brought about by competition now comes a sweeping proposition that every sane nian knows is the absolute end of all comp etition let somebody tell me now in the closing days of this debate how you are going to have competition under this lawhow you are going to have it the very moment that line a undertakes to cut the rate line b will enjoin them through the instrumentality of this ratemaking power why a few years agothere are very few members here now who were here then and it has been only a short time agoall the railroads in the country worked out a plan that seemed to be advisable to me to permit pooling it was very simple except that it put an end to competition it simply permitted the great lines of railroad running to the pacific ocean or anywhere else to join in an agreed tariff of rates then upon that agreement the income was to be parcelled to the members of the pool a cry went up all over this country quite equal to that which is emanating from this capitol of the great outrage that was being done to the people of this country in permitting the pooling of freight rates a distinguished senator of the united states said it was a great trust that was being formed now i have lived first to see that bil defeated for which i voted and i have lived to see the time when the whole american public apparently are demanding a bill that in natural operation and effect is nothing more or less than a great national pooling scheme that is what it is competition is forbidden competition is strangled all the rates in given directions and from given points to given points are to be uniform what is that but a system of pooling and so we are coming to that muchdecried and muchabused pooling bill that was cried down i had intended to say sometfiing about some of the extraneous outside ornamental arguments that have been made in favor of this bill when i was a young lawyer we had a famous judge in our state judge nash the author of some works on law ant other things and i tried a case in which i was defending a man for a high crime i had rather of a slim case after it was over the old gentleman criticised my way of doing business and said you have caught on to some of the points pretty early in these ugly cases where you have nothing else to go on abuse the prosecuting attorney it is fashionable nowadays when you have nothing else to go on to abuse the standard oil company"], [0.8696611523628235,

allegiance to five flagsthat of spain of mexico of the republic of texas of the confederacy and now for a second time she stands beneath the flagwhose stripes have streamed in glory to foes a fear to friends a festal robe and spread in rythmic lines the sacred story of freedoms triumph over all the globe and long before she dreamt of the lone star of her own republic of texas before mexico had broken away from spain or the flag of spain had reached the rio grande her soil had been dominated by the tricolor of france she has had her own declaration of independence her own constitution and when she came to us it was as a sister republic and not as a dependent territory she came on the condition that she might in her own right divide herself into five states and send ten senators here to washington she came to us with a history of her own she ame a sovereign singing her own national hymn and with the glory of the alamo as a halo about her head some may say that states must be admitted on an equality they never have been admitted on an equality in the history of our union you can not make texas and rhode island equal you can not make new york and delaware equal except in the legal sense of sovereignty in the old days we admitted free states and we admitted slave states and the very enabling act that admitted the republic of texas provided that the states formed out of the territory north of the missouri compromise line should be free and all formed out of the territory south of the compromise line should be free or slave as their people might determine so we see that states have been admitted into this union not on an equality and the whole question that i submit to the judiciary committee is what is a state and what is a republican form of government i heari do not know how true the statement may be and i do not want to say that anybody would state an untruth on this floor after the expericnce we have just had but i have heard it said on this floor that the states of ohio and pennsylvania and certain other great states owed allegiance to some bosses in those states before they owed it to the republic of the united states and if that be true why may not texas subdivide herself into four states have a central government a governor over all and lieutenantgovernors in the four several states and elect eight united states senators there is nothing about it in my judgment unconstitutional but there are a great many things which are constitutional that this congress isnt going to do i understand that perfectly well it would be entirely constitutional for us to come in here tomorrow morning and admit oklahoma to the union but we are not going to do it just because it would be constitutional it would be constitutional for us to cease to compel arizona and new mexico to come in together but we are not going to do that right away it seems to me from the history of affairs in this house i have been pleased to find the allegiance of the delegation from texas to her own lone star state holding itself with an unfaltering trust even when the other brethren of the south had come over and supported the federal quarantine bill they stood up in a solid phalanx of sixteen and voted for texas rather than for uncle sam i rather like such sweet devotion for their great state is big enough for an empire or republic of its own it reminded me of an incident which occurred in duluth a few years ago when a pretty little scandinavian girl who had recently come over from her native land and had learned something of our language but who bad not learned all of our ways attended church the minister in keeping with his custom stood at the door and as the audience passed out shook hands and said a kind word to each he asked the girl her name and where she lived and then thinking only of his pastoral duty added i will call on you in a few days when she exclaimed oh but i have got a feller already and so texas has a fellow already she is a wonderful commonwealth and her people can scarcely have a greater love for any outside power than they have for their local government but i remember when to tell a lian to go to texas was just like telling him to go to the other place i remember when texas was a synonym for hell and now it is almost as populousand two senators are not enough to represent such a country as that there is now an attempt within texas herself to subdivide the state for local governmental purposes into north texas east texas south texas and west texas the whole state with its 262 000 square miles is too big for the practical purposes of government the farmers of north texas are mostly native americans and believe in prohibition of the liquor traffic the people of southern texas are largely of european extrac tion and want their beer north texas has land worth up to 100 an acre the people there put the assessment very low and can meet their local obligations and so the farmers of south texas who have lowpriced land complain constantly against the farmers of north texas and there are criminations back and forth because of the wonderful difference of conditions between the north and the south southern texas raises cotton sugar rice tobacco and protectionists they lihae a member of congress in this house who voted against the philippine tariff bill this winter because his people believe in protecting home industry western texas raises cattle and is engaged in mining and also believes in protection there is in this house a member from western texas who voted for the dingley bill because western texas believes in protection eastern texas has fruit farmers and truck gardeners who are lowtariff people they want drainage laws and legislation preventing anyone from holding large tracts of land out in the western part they want irrigation and they want laws passed for large holdings so you have the prohibitionists in the north and the liberal thinkers in the south you have fruit growers in the east andminers and stock raisers in the west and thus the state of texas although bound together by the glory of the alamo and the history of its republic is on the verge of dividing up into subordinate states in order to have a better local government yet in spite of the experience of texasand this is the real moral of my remarksthis house proposes to compel arizona and new mexico to get together and make another state just as great as that of texas whose people would in future be constantly criminating each other and so i hold that we should in acting reasonably upon this question make into a single commonwealth only a sufficient area within which the people may have common interests in which there shall not be bickering or backbiting nor quarreling over taxes or the rates of assessment upon similar forms of property and in which the people may have a common interest and stand together in all their affairs some have complained that there are not folks enough out in arizona there will be folks enough out there in a few years plans are now formed for the irrigation of 600 000 acres of arid hind and in many cases irrigated land supports one person to the acre i predict that in the next twenty years a half million people will go into the state of arizona and if they have half a million people added to what they have now they will surpass the population of the average state east of the mississippi river if you should admit oklahoma as a single state if you should permit texas to organize herself into a little republic of four states if you should admit arizona and new mexico separately you would then have west of the mississippi river twentyfive states with fifty senators east of the mississippi river there are twentysix states with fiftytwo senators so that the west must always be outnumbered by the senators from the east and yet in the future history of our country the territory west of the mississippi river twice and a half times as great as that in the east will double in population that of our eastern brethren i am therefore asking for more senators from the west i know they will not immediately represent as many folks as senators from the great states of the east but gentlemen i feel that the senators the members of the upper house of congresswhere there is real deliberation as is being exhibited now upon the rate billshould be so distributed over our continental area as to come in contact with all the different environments of this great republic for it is environment that shapes the conduct of men in public life you have six states in new england 6 1 000 square miles and twelve senators does anyone doubt that if the little state of rhode island were tacked onto massachusetts the bay state would not have something to say about the policy of the consolidated commonwealth does anyone believe that if new 1hampshire and vermont and maine and connecticut were to be hitched onto massachusetts it would not change somewhat the policy of the men who represent those states for this reason i feel that we should so divide the territory of the west that the senators should come in contact with every different environment and not throw all into one commonwealth where the greatest interest can control all oh i hear it said that the senatorsare bad folks i do not know whether it is against the rules of this house to speak well of the senate or not but i am going to make that attempt i began to speak well of the senate once before while iwas on my feet but either my time expired or i was called to order there are some complaints that the senators of the west do not represent enough people and are therefore lacking in character but i say to you that i would rather leave my political rights in the keeping of a member of either ilouse of congress hailing from the rocky mountains and representing nothing but the sunset than to one standing in the shadow of a trust company and representing the unearned increment some gentlemen upon this floor would have us believe that the people of arizona do not know their initiative from their referendum but all that the friends of that territory ask is that these people may have the right to vote upon the propositions which so greatly affect them thus shaping in some measure their own destiny whil 0 demonstrating their fitness for selfgovernment and their knowledge of affairs now what is the matter with the united states senate that some do not wish its numbers increased i hold that there are today in the senate men of just as high character and just as great ability as have ever sat in that house if there is anything wrong the wrong comes up from the people the wrongs complained of are the result of the expensiveness of politics if t man gets into a county office or a city office he is reached every time thereis a subscription paper going around a man getting a salary of 1 000 to 5 000 in a political office is presumed to subscribe to every charitable purpose on the same basis as a millionaire the cause of wrong in the tipper places in our government whether lochl or national comes clear up from the bottom the graft beginning with the garden seeds mind going up through our institutions to the top if we want to make a united states senator honest if we want to anake city officials honest we must appeal to the american people to assist in making public life less expensive to them iow can we expect a united states senator to maintain an administration family of ten children on a salary of 5 000 a year and then subscribe from ten to a hundred dollars to some purpose every tile 1ie turns around so if there be evils il our public life the evils do not begin at the top they begin at the bottom and it is up to the american people to remove the cause if they want good government in philadelphia and good government in cincinnati they must not make political life expensive it is all right to say that if a man can not afford the burdens he ought to get out of political life but what is the logical result of such a course it is to drive all poor men out of public life and to drive rich men into all public places within the gift of the people so i think i am getting at the very meat of the thing so far as wrongdoing in public life is concerned when i lay the blame at the door of the people themselves they are not willful in this it is mere thoughtlessness they have not studied this problem so it is due to some one to speak out and as usual the duty falls on me my district is a little different from that of the rest of you there is not another man in it who could be induced to come to congress because under republican prosperity everybody is making so much money that no one is willing to quit the game so they induced me to come and in a feeble way to represent them temporarily in this house they know also that if i had anything to give i would turn it over to them without asking and so they have not tempted me in any way i have no conplaint to make about my own people but i know how expensive it is to sit in the other house and i have declined to go there on that account how often has every man in the hearing of my voice heard it said when some man aspired to the united states senate how can he afford to go there he is a poor mau is he not it should not be so in this country that a poor man is excluded from any political office because of the burden imposed in holding it i want to see it so that a poor man can come to washington and lead the simple life and represent the people of the united states and make as good a senator as any millionaire and we shall do that when the burdens are rolled away just here i see my friend from michigan looking at me and wondering just how expensive it is i will give him a bill of particulars privately a little later on but i wish to read this one paragraph a paragraph that was in the organic act making a territory of arizona it says that said government shall be maintained and continued until such time as the people residing in said territory shall with the consent of congress form a state government republican in form as prescribed in the constitution of the united states and apply for and obtain admission into the union as a state on an equal footing with the original states that is in the original organic act creating the territory of arizona and surely this house understands the obligation of a contract but again and again it is said that you can not raise folks enough out in arizona to support a state government and two united states senators why gentlemen of tie committee if i were il arizona i could take a street sprinkler and go out before breakfast and make a bigger oasis than all the agricultural lands in any of the states of new england i laughter yet those states are prosperous and well governed arizona is going to have large tracts of irrigated lands she is going to have vast mining interests sue is going ultimately to have imanufacturing interests and when finally admitted as a single state she will be one of the best commonwealths in the union i am merely making this talk today mr clairman to lave tile country know that the statehood bill has not been entirely overlooked i know that there is a conference committee at work upon it but they have not told me what they are doing anild i want to know if they are going to bring back to this house an agreelnent and let oklahoma with her 2 000 000 people come in i want to know if they are going to make it possible to give free schools to the more than 100 000 children in tle indian territory who are now schoolless i seldom fall into poetry and i am not a singer but i have thought that if we do not admit oklahoma to the union a citizen of that territory might well adapt the words of the old negro melody and say my canoe is under water and my banjo is unstrung i am tired of living any more my eyes shall look downward and my song shall be unsung while i stay on the oklahoma slore why oklahoma has today the same population as the original thirteen states had whlen they formed the union and yet we hesitate about admitting lzer she has almost the population that overcame tile onslaughts of the british empire and yet we hesitate about giving admission and statehood to that people who have been so patient but i shall not weary you there are others to speak and my time has alhost expired i merely wish to place myself on record and let the people of the west know where i stood while the conference committee was at work and i hope that some day you will look a little more seriously upon the resolution which i introduced here this afternoon you may think you can not form states in that way and admit them into the union but on a little reflection you will find such action is wholly within the constitution of the united states it is up to texas to say after we have given her permission whether she will accept it or not because she has the right now to divide into five states and come here with ten senators i have sometimes wondered how the people of this beautiful capital city would feel to see ten stalwart texans with sombreros on their heads their pants in their boots and their guns in their belts marching on washington with the firm determination to blow out the gas but i love the people of the south and because i love them i am going to vote for their old subsidy without thinking much more about it i am still going to send the daily papers there as fast as i can and here too let me add that i am glad most of the democrats have taken my advice of two years ago and hove come over and voted for most of the republican measures t am glad that they made the election of the president so unanimaous in 1904 in accordance with my request i owe them a great deal for accepting my advice for i have given so much advice that has never been accepted by anyone else and in conclusion i wish to say to my good brethern of the four states of texas and all the south that i shall never weary of telling in the words of one of our own sweet verse writers mr nesbitt the story ofyour flag and my flag and how it flies today in your land and my land and half a world away rose red and blood red its stripes forever gleam snow white and soul white the good forefathers dream sky blue and true blue with stars that

house that he then voted for the railroad rate bill but somewhere along the way he has seen a ghostthe ghost of railroad preferentialsand his attitude now reminds me of the story in the schoolbook of the boy who was traveling along the road at night and saw come out of the darkness what appeared to him to be an actual living ghost in his fright he turned and ran but as he ran he began to think over the things of his youth and while he remembered that his grandfather and grandmother said there were ghosts he remembered also that his father and mother said there are no ghosts so concluding that the grandfather and grandmother were wrong and believing the father and mother he plucked up courage and turned back in the direction from which he had come when he got up to the supposed ghost it turned out to be nothing but a great white friendly guideboard and not only that it was pointing just the way he wanted to go so if the distinguished gentleman from maine for whom i have the highest regard had kept on and not been deterred by the hobgoblin story which has been poured into his ears somewhere between the fiftyeighth and the fiftyninth congress in my humble judgment he would be with us today there is also that other story that i am reminded of which went the rounds as a cartoon that illustrates his position taking into account his earnest appeal to day and his appaxent troubled condition of mind i refer to the man with the wheelbarrow that was heavily loaded with articles labeled cares duties and responsibilities of tomorrow his back was bending in trundling the load his face was distorted perspiration was dripping fromt his forehead but out of his pocket protruded a bundle giving him no trouble labeled cares duties and responsibilities of today it is the hobgoblin of something that is to come that troubles some of the members of the house who oppose this measure as i understand the situation the rights of the railway companies and the rights of the people in brief are these not one rod of the 21 0 000 miles of railway in this country was constructed except by laying it across private property and to that end the property owner even though it took from him the old home with all of its sentiment had to surrender under the principle the greatest good to the greatest number but along with that right not only went the rights of the railwaycompany to forever send its cars over the steel track but that other great right of franchise to the great traveling and shipping public and it is because of that franchise to the public guaranteed to every american citizen and the stranger within our gates who may desire to use these railways at all times and tnder all circumstances to ship hiscommodity over them on equal terms with al others at a reasonable rate that these companiest had the right to lay one foot of such track any shift or device to evade that vested right of the great traveling and shipping public is in contravention of the constitution it makes nor difference whether it is a contract entered into between the railroad company and a ship per or is a law passed by congress or a finding by the interstate commerce commission or an act by the legislatureof a state if it takes away that vested right in the great shipping and traveling public it is absolutely void the interstate commerce cbmmission is not clothed with power to lay down any new rule as to rates that is a part of the franchises that belong to the railroad companies and the public fixed by the common law that the rates must be reasonable and all served alike the commission simply hears the evidence on complaint and follows this rule what is it it is that the rate must not be discriminatory and shall be reasonable what the interstate commerce commission can do and all that the promoters of this bill and those who havebeen so faithful having it in charge claim is that the conmission shall hear the testimony on complaint made to see whetlier or not the rate is reasonable if unreasonable fix a maxihnum reasonable one if discriminatory correct that and that is all beyond that the interstate commerce comnission can not go there are three great arteries of transportation in this countrythe waterways the dirt highways and the steel highways i remember readiig not many years ago an interesting case reported in one of the united states supreme court reports it seems that fulton and robertson as a company were granted a charter by the state of new york by the terms of which they were given the right forever to navigate by steam power all the navigable streams of the state of new york against the world and strange as it may seem to us of this day and generation that legislation was sustained by every intermediate court until it reached the supreme court of the united states when john marshall that greatest of all elucidators of the constitution delivered an opinion that forever swept away such a doctrine in which he stated that such a privilege is in contravention of interstate commerce and therefore could not be the law today we have these great steel highways and by reason of the character of the track we can not pass over them with our private vehicles and so the government has given to individuals and companies the right to construct these highways over private property by paying only its actual value to aid the public if i read the decisions aright that right carries but two exclusive privileges to the promoters or companiesthat is to carry over the roads passengers and the commodities of the people they have no right under the constitution to engage in any other business in conjunction with the roads though it is true in many instances they are doing it in violation of law the roads have no right to make profits in any way out of anything save and except in transporting the commodities of the public and carrying passengers over the roads i acquiesce fully in the claim made by the distinguished gentleman from ohio i believe he is absolutely right in his contention and the agitation and legislation must go on until the railways of this country have surrendered all interest in outside enterprises i never could figure out how any private car company has a right as against the public to send its cars over these tracks by contract with the railroad companies i do not believe that it is either the spirit or letter of the constitution to permit it the spirit and letter of the constitution is that you may send your commodity over these tracks the company must receive your commodity it must send it on equal and reasonable terms with everybody else it must give all equal facilities it has no right to say to a company or an individual owning private cars we will take your car or cars and for a stated amount send them with your commodities and passengers over these tracks for all these railroad tracks on the rights of way in the broad sense belong to the publicabsolutely to the public and until these private infringements are gotten rid of and we come back to the constitutional rights of the people this contention will go on look at the situation a young man with ability and limited means undertakes to start in business on one of these railvay tracks if he is in the field of endeavor of those who have pooled their issues and put up a plant he is at their mercy for he finds them accorded rates by the railroad companies not given him the gentleman from maine said in substance if he had his way he would do away with the interstate commerce commission i was startled by the statement he madethat the wronged shipper should resort to common law for redress i will admit that a wronged shipper has at common law a remedy so far as the law itself is concerned but the difficulty is in working it out it may be fine in theory but impracticable in practice and it was because of that fact that this interstate commerce commission was organized no man can take his complaint of unjust rates and discrimination into a commonlaw court of justice and try to work the problem out under the rules of common law in these days against these corporations doing an interstate business and secure justice and it is because men wiser than myself saw this impractical situation for the shipper that the interstate commerce commission was organized there they can at once bring their complaints to the commission the gentleman from maine says how can this commission tell what is a just rate he says there is no scientific rule by which it can be determined there is no scientific rule by which it can be determined anywhere human judgment under the evidence and rules of common law finally determines suppose the congress were to give to the interstate commerce commission the name of interstate judges would such legislation make them any wiser supposethe same evidence is brought before the commonlaw court will the judges composing such tribunal be any wiser than the men who make up the commission it is a mans judgment when you get through with it you have to lodge the power somewhere somebody has to hear the evidence when the gentleman says away with the commission and leave the people to common law he is twenty years behind the progress of events that was tried for years and brought no results the process was too slow this bill does not contain what those most deeply interested in itthose who drafted it and the committee who reported itwould like to have in it like everything else in legislation it is a compromise measure but let us stand for the bill and as we move along in the course of events and more testimony is gathered and its workings are put to the test and we find wherein the weakness lies more legislation can follow to remedy the mistakes but to do away with the interstate commerce commission after all the effort that has been put forth would be a sad blow to the shipper i know there are a large number of people who wanted to have the investigations of the interstate commerce commission done away with a long time ago for they suffered the penalties of law as results of the evidence given before that commission against them arrayed against this commission is this immense capital back of which are the trained brains of the railway men of this country i do not understand that the distinguished gentleman from ohio desires to have the commission done away with he says that he does not think the bill goes far enough i agree with him but the bill in its present form is in the right direction and should pass if it can be made broader at this time i shall be glad"], [0.8625102043151855, 0.8625102043151855, 0, "at the conclusion of his speech should have been recognized for

out their pledges to the people and trembling with fear before the approaching election the republicans in this house saw the old tariff ship tossed upon the bosom of a restless sea then they cried loud and long for one skilled in the art of commanding a vessel on a stormy sea for a moment silence reigned and 1o uncle pete hepburn the old tariff sea captain of iowa appeared but in spite of his republican skill and tariff genius the old vesselheaved and sot and sot and heaved and high her rudder flung and every time she heaved and sot a mighty leak she sprung the republican party claims credit for the existence of every good thing even regarding those things over which they have absolutely no control now that money of final redemption is plentiful they say that it is the result of republican policies and legislation the fact is that the democratic party in 1896 contended for more money of final redemption the republican party refused to open the mints and god almighty opened the mines and the large increase in the volume of money of final redemption establishes the correctness of the democratic contention at that time if you should ask one of the protective tariff advocates to whom we should be grateful for sunshine and shower he would out of the fullness of his heart exclaim the dingley tariff system when the people demanded tariff revision you promised to revise when they demanded that trusts be destroyed you promised to destroy them you have not kept these pledges under the reign of the republican party trusts have multiplied and they flourish today as never before in the history of the country private fortunes are springing up in the wake of the robber tariff and graft the latest offspring of republican conditions is rampant in the republic the consumer here sees american products sold to the foreigner at a price lower than he enjoys in his home land tribute money is demafided of the american by the american government and under republican tariff system while favoritism is enjoyed by the foreigner to the detriment of our own people now when the land yields abundantly responds liberally to the pulse beats of the enterprising plowman and the demands of the people are increasing and the people themselves becoming more and more industrious and enterprising and because in spite of special privileges and republican favoritism we enjoy in a large measure material prosperity the republican party is ready to proclaim from every house top that tie credit for all this is due the republican party the gall of the republican party is marvelous the comforts and conveniences of life that the american people in a measure enjoy today are not the products of the republican party but through the skill the industry and enterprise of our people they have been achieved over republican difficulties and in spite of the republican party you boast before election times about what you will do when you get in office bees on flowers lighting cease their hum and republicans in office soon grow dumb today the democratic party has asked you to lay the hand of destruction upon the trusts that corrupt the electorate of the country and rob the people we have asked you not to allow the ballot to become a matter of commodity for sale and trallic to the highest bidder you refuse to do that you do not want to cut off this hand of contribution that comes in and aids you so materially in election time like jove of oldyou have turned your thunder into showers of gold whose silent courtship wins securer joys taints by degrees and ruins without

[0.8534126877784729, 0.8534126877784729, 0, "i am in this matter placed in a rather peculiar position i wish it to be understood at the beginning where i stand on this measure i wilf try to make myself clear in what i have to say about it so that there will be no misunderstanding as to what my views are i am opposed to this bill for many reasons in the time given me i will try in a plain businesslike way to explain why i oppose this bill in the first place let me say i understand the measure is called a republican measure from the wording of the bill and the effects which may arise from it no human being in my opinion could understand whether it is a republican or a democratic measure i have always understood that the republican party to which i belong stood for protection to american industries i believe that the president of the united states is a protectionist and that many republican presidents before him were protectionists i believe that the platforms adopted in national conventions by the republican party have declared for protection to american industries to bear me out in that statement i want to ask the time of the house while i read a portion of the republican platform adopted in the national tonvention in st louis in 1896 it is the plank in that platforin that refers particularly to sugar ve condemn the present administration for not keeping faith with the sugar producers of this country the republican party favors such protection as will lead to the production on american soil of all the sugar which the american people use and for which they pay other countries more than 100 000 000 annually i believe that the republicans in convention that framed that plank in this platform meant what they said meant that if the people of this country would return that party to power they would carry out their pledge have they done it let me read you just a little of the platform adopted in 1900 by the republican party in convention assembled we renew our faith in the policy of protection to american labor in that policy our industries have been established diversified and maintained by protecting the home market competition has been stimulated and productlion cheapened opportunity to the inventive genius of our people has been secured and wages in every department of labor maintained at high rateshigher now than ever before and always distinguishing our working people in their better conditions of life from those of any competing country enjoying the blessings of the american common school secure in the right of selfgovernment and protected in the occupancy of their own markets their constantly increasing knowledge and skill have enabled them to finally enter the markets of the world further on in that platform let me read to you what was said about reciprocity i believe that this measure is claimed by its friends to be a reciprocity measure oh i have become so disgusted with the term reciprocity as used by the republican partynot the democratic partysince i have been a member of this house that i can not believe for an instant that the friends of this measure and the friends of cuban reciprocity ever knew what reciprocity meant as referred to by james g blaine and william mckinley we favor the associated policy of reciprocity so directed as to open or inarkets on favorable termsnow listen jlease and then compare it with the effects of this billfor what we do not ourselves producethat is reciprocity that is what was meant by the republican party at that time when they mentioned reciprocityin return for the foreign markets that is reciprocity as i understand it gentlemen reciprocity does not mean that we propose to open our markets to the goods of foreign countries to come in here without duty on competitive articles that is not what was meant by the term reciprocity by opening our markets to the raw sugars of the world produced by the cheapest labor on earthis that reciprocity when we can produce that product on american soil i say no let me read to you what our president theodore roosevelt said in his letter of acceptance in 1904 and then if you please i will ask the friends of this measure to reconcile it with the principles in tlls bill if they can here is what the president said in his letter of acceptance in the last campaign the one consideration which must never be omitted in a tariff change is the imperative need of preserving the american standard of living for the american workingman i will show you later on what this bill proposes to do in the standard of wages for the american laboring man the tariff rate must never fall below that which will protect the american workingman by allowing for the difference between the general labor cost mere and abroad so as at least to equalize the conditions arising from the difference in the standard of labor here and abroada difference which it should not be our aim to foster in so far as it represents the needs of better educated better paid better fed and better clothed workingmen of a higher type than any to be found in a foreign country at all hazards and no matter what else is sought for or accomplished by changes of the tariff the american workingman must be protected in his standard of wagesthat is in his standard of livingand must be secured the fullest opnortunity of employment our laws should in no event afford advantage to foreign industries over american industries they should in no event do less than equalize the difference in conditions at home and abroad that is what our president said in his letter of acceptance before entering upon the campaign that eleited him president of the united states the position he now holds let me read you what he further said it is a matter of regret that the protective tariff policy which during the last fortyodd years has become part of the very fiber of the country is not now accepted as definitely established surely we have a right to say that it has passed beyond the domain of theory and t right to expect that not only its original advocates but those who at one time distrusted it on theoretical grounds should now acquiesce in the results that have been proved over and over again by actual experience these fortyodd years have been the most prosperous years this nation has ever seen more prosperous years than other nations have ever seen again he says every class of our people is benefited by the protective tariff during the lastfew years a merchant has seen tie export trade of this country glow faster than ever in our previous history the manufacturer could not keep his factory running if it were not for the protective tariff te wageworker would do well to remember that if protection is robbery and is to be punished accordingly he will be the first to pay the penalty taking all in all what i have read from our republican platform and what i have read from the letter of acceptance by theodore roosevelt i still my friends cling to the high protective tariff as the safeguard of american liberty and i believe the president of the united states stands with me on that principle now let us see if this bill becomes a law whether or not we are carrying out the pledges that we made to the people of this country upon which every republican in this house stood and pledged himself to the letter of the law when i accepted the nomination in my district my friends i pledged myself to these platforms and i propose to stand there until the last ditch if i am the only man on this side of the house to stand in that line it is my opinion and my beliefand i am candid and firm in that beliefthat we can not tear down this protective wall which the republican party has put around american institutions and let in the product of foreign cheap labor without injuring that industry if it is a competitive article let us see whether or not the sugar from the philippine islands and the sugar from cuba is a competitive article with something made in this country the year of 1883 was about the time the sugar industry in this country began to grow it ran along gradually and slowly until 1897 when william mckinley called together congress in extra session for the purpose of repealing the wilson bill and put in its place a highprotection tariff measure the dingley bill provided that sugar coming from foreign countries 16 dutch standard or 96 per cent pure should pay a duty of 1 681 cents per hundred pounds by the provisions of that bill the american sugar manufacturers of the united states had that much advantage over the cheapmade sugar in foreign countries that tariff stood there as a stonewall against the foreign nations of the earth that stimulated the sugar industry in the united states and right in the state of michigan which i have the honor to represent in part in congress the first sugar factory began to make sugar from beets grown in the fields of michigan in 1898 the first factory in that state turned out some sugar under the belief that the republican party meant just what it said in its platform and that that party so long as it remained in power was going to carry out its pledge capital became confident and sugar factories began to spring up all over our state and by 1900 we had 17 magnificent sugar factories in that state that industry kept going on so rapidly that the average man could not keep pace with it but the very instant the republican party introduced into congress a socalled cuban reciprocity measure immediately the hope of every business man in the state of michigan who had a single dollar invested in that industry vanished they hesitated and sajd what does our party propose to do it has given encouragement to this industry we have invested our moneyall we had in many insancsand now by the adoption of cuban reciprocity and the removal of 20 per dent of the 1 681 duty that stood there as a stone wall we can readily see that the great sugar trusts of this country are going to have an advantage over us and with their 90 000 u00 and not one drop of warm human blood flowing in their veins we know that the inevitable must come unless the republican party will stand by its pledges made in 1896 and again in 1900 and imagine their surprise when cuban reciprocity was introduced and the committee on ways and means gave notice that the hearings would be given from all over the united states came delegations representing the beetsugar industry and representing the canesugar industry in the south and earnestly registered their protest against the passage of that measure but what was the use it was a packed jury and a conclusion had been reached before the bill was introduced they pleaded for mercy they said they had their money invested they said that the sugar trust could import into the united states from cuba raw sugar pay the dingley rate of duty pay the prevailing price for the raw sugars in the markets of the world pay the cost of refining and put refined sugar upon the market for just about what the manufacturer could produce sugar from beets for and put it on the market ever since the first pound of sugar was produced in this country from beets and cane the sugar trust has fixed a standard of prices and it receives for sugar made from cane 10 cents a hundred pounds more than the sugarbeet manufacturer can get for his sugar and no matter whether the price in the market is high or whether it is low the manufacturer of beet sugar dare not undersell or oversell the sugar trust in any market of the united states no merchantno wholesale grocery merchant in the united statescan buy from the sugarbeet manufacturers in this country his supply of sugar for the twelve months in the year there is a time during the twelve months when every merchant in the united states must go to the sugar trust for his sugar and the sugar trust has laid down this rule and they have carried out this rule to the letter if you buy more than so much sugar from the beetsugar manufacturer hy the gods you can not have a pound 9f sugar from us when beet sugar is exhausted i know a case in the state of michigan where a wholesale grocery man in the city of detroit had an interest in a sugar factory in the eighth district at a town called caro the sugar trust served notice upon him that he must not use over a certain amount of sugar coming from his own factory and if he did not a pound could he get from them when his sugar was gone oh what kind of competition is that if in your opinion cuban reciprocity or this philippine freetrade measure would help to stimulate the markets for the sugar trust undee such circumstances is there a man within the sound of my voice who would support such a measure if so he is not a friend of mine but thank god gentlemen here have the right to think as they please and act as their good judgment dictates if they differ with me it is their privilege but if there are any gentlemen in the house of representatives or in either end of this capitol who would support a measure that will drive out of existence one single industry in the united states to the benefit of the trusts i would like to know who he is is there a man here who would do it i believe not but let us see whether or not this bill does that in effect i have stated to you before that when cuban reciprocity becamea law the sugar trust if they should receive the benefits of the 20 per cent reduction could put upon our markets raw sugars imported from cuba at a third of a cent per pound less than sugar could be produced from beets mr willetts of willetts gray sugar statisticians of new york one of the greatest experts among the statisticians and mathematicians of this country stated last spring before the committee on ways and means that at that time the sugar trust was purchasing raw sugar from cuba at 13 cents a hundred pounds below the hamburg or london prices and the refined sugar produced by thdf american sugar refining company and the arbuckles was at that time being sold and put upon our markets for 11 or 12 cents a hundred pounds above the price obtained for refined sugar in hamburg and in london if that is so my friends the 20 per cent reduction given to cubans for their sugar in that cuban reciprocity measure amounted to 33 7 cents per hundred pounds then mr willetts shows conclusively that the sugar trust had absorbed 24 cents of the 34 cents while at the same time every man woman and child within my hearing or out of my hearing in this country knows that the consumer paid 1 and 2 cents a pound more for his sugar than he did before the enactment of the cuban bill how do you reconcile those differences my friends i can not do it other than by the fact that the sugar trust absorbed as i stated twothirds of that reduction and the poor devil of a cuban got but onethird now to bear out the statement that this is possible that mr willetts was correct a public announcement was made in the newspapers of thin country on or about january or february 1905 that the sugar trust had declared a dividendan annual dividend mind youof 26 per cent on their 90 000 000 of capital and that 26 per cent did not include the profits on coffee and in the banking business in both of which they are heavily engaged is that any good excuse why the gentleman from new york yesterday lightlyspoke of the correctness of mr willettss statement the other day before the committee on ways and means giving him credit for being a very flue and scholarly gentleman but doubting his figures let me say to you if you read the hearings before the committee on ways and means that took place just before the holidays and then listened to the gentlemans remarks from the state of new york made yesterday or read his remarks and you will find that he discredits or attempts to discredit the statements made by every man who appeared in opposition to this measure the gentleman referred to mr hathaway a gentleman employed by several sugar factories in the state of michigan to go to the philippine islands and investigate the sugar situation so that at the beginning of this congress knowing that this bill would again be brought up for consideration they might be in possession of some facts to meet the committees recommendations mr hathaway is a resident of my home town an estimable gentlemnan not one word in the hearings before the ways and means committee appears to discredit the honesty and integrity of that gentleman yet mr payne yesterday in his remarks on the floor of this house referred to him as representing 5 mo 000 of capital going to the philippines to purchase sugar land mr gove another gentleman who happened to be in the philippines at the same time mr hathaway was there gave his testimony or statement and the question was asked him by mr smith of michigan a member of the committee on ways and means what did you hear as to what mr hathaway represented himself to be in the philippine islands did you hear him claim that he was a representative of millions of dollars and that he was over there for the purpose of buying sugar plantations and building factories his answer was i traveled for days and days and weeks with that gentleman and never heard such a statement until i heard it here in the committee room i take mr hathaways statement as being absolutily honest and fair i believe what he has to say i would believe him as quick as any other honorable gentleman whom i know i know of no instance where mr hathaway either in speaking of the philippine islands or of the sugar industry of this country ever made a misstatement unless it happened to be a clerical error all men are apt to do that but i know of none even clerical made by that gentleman in the first place let me say that when cuban reciprocity was introduced in 1900 there were 5 gagar factories in the united states and they were springing up so fast as i have stated before that the average business man could not keep track of the progress of that industry fiftytwo factories produced sugar from beets in 1900 and the report of the agricultural department shows that there were 34 more factories either under construction or contemplated in the united states at that time but upon the agitation of cuban reciprocity what happened my friends today we have but 54 in the united states and i will give their location to you and their slicing capacity i want to call your attention to this for the reason that i want to show you how much money the american people put in that industry upon their faith in the republican party pledged by their platforms td which i have referred california has 7 factories today in operation as shown by statistics their slicing capacity daily is 9 100 tons colorado has 12 with a daily slicing capacity of 9 300 tons of beets idaho has 3 with a slicing capacity of 3 000 tons illinois has i with a slicing capacity of 350 tons per day michigan has 17 factories with a slicing capacity of 11 150 tons daily nebraska 2 with a slicing capacity of 1 450 tons per day new york 1 slicing 600 tons daily ohio 1 slicing 400 tons daily oregon 1 slicing 400 tons daily utah 7 slicing 4 000 tons daily washington 1 slicing 500 tons daily wisconsin 3 slicing 1 700 tons daily the total number of factories running in the united states year 1905 56 total slicing capacity 42 000 tons of beets total investment of capital in these factories now in operation about 42 000 000 when cuban reciprocity was introduced in the house michigan factories sent such a delegation down here to oppose that measure composed of such representative and honorable business men that the sugar trust was simply awed they immediately sent a representative to the state of michigan and purchased an interest in some of the best factories in that state in order to hush up that opposition and one man from bay city mich came down here and i had the pleasure of accoinpanying him to the white house to appeal to theodore roosevelt to urge congress to withdraw cuban reciprocity ie appealed to the president most earnestly but got no relief in a few days the trusts got hold of him and purchased a half interest in his factory in the course of a week or ten days afterwards lie came back here sent in his card asking me to meet him in the hall and go to lunch with him he begged me to accept the 20 per cent reduction why because lie had been purchased by havemeyer and it was to havemeyers interest to have that bill become a law when i found what lie wanted of me i begged to be excused i could not turn my coat as quickly as all that today my friends let me say to you the sugar trust has purchased through a representative a trustee in order that they might not be known in the transaction an interest in eight or nine of the best factories in the state one at kalamazoo has i understand been torn to the ground if i am wrong in that i hope my colleague will correct me they became interested in another factory at oscoda after that factory had been built it was found that there were not enough farmers in that immediate vicinity to raise beets for the factory and that the land was not the best adapted for the raising of beets in the state and the consequence is that factory has been torn down or is now being demolished they purchased another factory known as the michigan sugar factory at bay city its doors are closed and nailed up never to run again they purchased an interest in the saginaw sugar company in my own towna magnificent structure a monument to our town or to any city in the land that cost something like seven or eight hundred thousand dollars to that factory they obtained absolute control or title and within ninety days time they put upon its roof 150 men tore it to the ground and nothing but the smokestack remains god forbid gentlemen that you and i or any other set of men should ever pass a measure to help such a hydraheaded damnable corporation as that why do they not want american beetsugar factories to run i will tell you why they have sufficient capacity in their refineries today to refine all of the sugar that all of the people in the united states constume and 20 000 000 of people more without adding one dollars worth of machinery to their present plants and with this beetsugar competition out of the way they can buy the raw sugar in the markets of the world bring it into the united states refine it and hand it out to the consumer at just what price they see fit to charge for it"], [0.8490227460861206, 0.8490227460861206, 0, "but we are coming to this question ofconsistency there are a lot of things about consistency that will hardly pay to take the time to review democracy consistent on the tariff well yes and no we have some marvelous history on that subject the first startling thing that came from leading democracy was in the year 1832 the vicepresident of the united states john c calhoun left the chair and went to south carolina and there induced his state to declare nullification against the laws of the united states because a mild protective tariff was put upon goods that were being imported into charleston harbor unconstitutional was the cry then as now after some rather pointed emphatic and certainly patriotic talk from one andrew jackson who happened to be then president of the united states this nullification ceased and the great leader of democracy resigned the office of vicepresident of the united states and went back to the senate as senator from his state about the first thing he did after getting there was to vote for a tariff law varying but little from the one he had just declared was unconstitutional but that was a long way back let us not go into much of that something was said about the great tariff law that dallas voted for and gave the casting vote as vicepresident of the united states in 1846 i believe my recollection is that congress did not pass any tariff law then of any important kind and that dallas simply distinguished himself then because he violated the pledge he made as candidate for vicepresident and before he was elected when on a tie vote in the senate he voted to repeal the tariff act of 1842 1 am a young man yet i can recollect that in 1844 the democratic cry rang throughout the north as it was emblazoned upon the banners of democracy polk dallas and the tariff of 1842 but let us get along a little further let us come up to 1883 1 had something to do with the passage of a tariff bill which became a law on march 3 1883 the democrats denounced that act as unconstitutional throughout it was denounced in every way i heard the distinguished men from north and south on the other side of the house then talk against the unconstitutionality of the act and they denounced some of us for favoring it because we would be perjuring ourselves and some of them when we were going over the bill in the committee of the whole house on the state of the union voted to increase the duty on some things i remember one was sumac the representative over there from about lynchburg va wanted to raise the duty on that for it was then about the only product of that region now happily changed another representative who had made a long constitutional argument against this bill voted to have a high duty put upon roasted shelled peanuts so that there would not be any competition with the peanuts raised in tennessee but that too was a day of small things they could vote thus then and now we have the same principle applied but we are talking about consistency blaine led his party to defeat in 1884 and after that we had a new regime the act of 1883 did not have a fair trial the democracy did not enforce and work it out and it was repealed and another passed called the mckinley act of october 1 1890 and this mckinley act was in turn repealed by the wilsongorman act of now it will be remembered that the mckinley act of october 1 1890 had the first appearance of reciprocity legislation that ever came to the congress of the united states it was a suggestion perhaps of mr blaine but it had gotten into the act of 1890 well democrats were not very consistent about that because they brought about some litigation and the case went to the supreme court it is called field v clark it will be found in the 143 united states supreme court reports page 697 the question there was whether reciprocity was constitutional justice lamar of mississippi writing a dissenting opinion pronounced it unconstitutional and chief justice fuller concurred some of the other judges dodged a little on it and said the question did not arise fairly but so far as we got the views of democrats of the court it was that the reciprocity section of the act was unconstitutional but that is a small matter maybe in 1894 the democratic party passed what is called the wilsongorman tariff bill and its seventyfirst section repealed in express terms all the reciprocity there was in the prior mckinley act stating that everything that was done or attempted to be done in enforcing it that was inconsistent with the act of 1894 should be held null and void so there is the legislative record well there was a little history right along there the democratic platform of 1888 was perhaps the most memorable on the tariff question we have ever had if it had been practicable i would be pleased to have favored it see what it was we the democratic party of the united statesi put the headingresolve that we arle in favor of cheapening the cost of living and in creasing the price of the farmers product by jove i am inclined to agree to that but how can we cheapen the cost of bread meat eggs and poultry to the consumer and at the same time increase the price of the farmers product that was the national democratic platform of 1888 on the tariff it has been a remarkable party in new things when i first entered politics the thing that struck me most in 1876 was the wonderful facility of the democratic party in settling great political questions scientific as well in its national platform of 1876 where tilden was nominated they tried to outherod herod in condemning the chinese they resolved as ethuolo gists that the chinese race did not spring from adam all remember it the language more precisely you will see was resolved that the chinese race did not spring from the same parent stock that we did now i have always had a respect for a party that can settle a question and it seems to have settled that one let us look further in 1892 we had a democratic platform and the chief plank of the national democratic platform was a denunciation of protection as a fraud and unconstitutional now as to reciprocity that my friend from missouri talked about the democratic party had another resolution on the subject of reciprocity i would like to read part of it if i can turn to it without too much delay i have found it i readlisten gentlemen we denounce the sham of reciprocity which juggles with the peoples desire for enlarged foreign markets and freer exchanges by pretending to establish closer trade relations with a country whose articles of export are almost exclusively agricultural products they had just before that declared that the tariff was a fraud now let us seei must hurry alongif i can not find another place where reciprocity is mentioned i am reading a part of the platform of 1904 of the national democratic party first this we denounce protection as a robbery of the many to enrich the few i read now on reciprocity from the same platform remember in 1892 it was declared a sham and a jugglery to cheat the agriculturists and that it had been legislated out of our statute books by a democratic congress conversion seems to have come to the democratic party on reciprocity almost as suddenly as it did to saul of tarsus on his way to damascus we favor liberal trade arrangements with canada and with the peoples of other countries where they can be entered into with benefit to american agriculture manufactures and mining or commerce here democracy indorses the doctrine of reciprocity for the first strangely it seems to think reciprocity had become constitutional or at least that it would be innocent to follow it i agree if you will put free trade and reciprocity side by side you will have no reciprocity at all there is no such thing as reciprocity without a tariff duty so the democracy stands for absolute free trade and then wants to trade that off for some sort of reciprocity with some country in the world that is an innocent kind of reciprocity this is the history of the matter with some little things left out it is not very consistent but these gentlemen are going to vote for this bill because it only has a little robbery in it and there is not much room for reciprocity that could be based on that now i ought to be through but i will talk a moment longer while this thing was going on about the tariff and reciprocity was declared to be the basic principle of democracy in 1904 we had an election a very excellent gentleman a distinguished judge of new york mr parker led the democratic party indeed he somehow or other found that it was necessary not only for him to lead it hut to tell them that they did not know anything about certain subjects at all as after they had unanimously voted a platform on the money question he told them that they were all wrong and they took it back now the election came the people of this country the kind i speak forthe farmer the machinist the mechanic the laborertook some interest in that election and mr roosevelt was elected president of the united states by a plurality of 2 549 331 somebody said something about standing by the president on this tariff question i should like to have the clerk read a marked extract from what the president says on the question and how it is to be dealt with if we are going to have revision and if there is anybody who ought to listen to this it is the gentlemen from the state of massachusetts"], [0.8449637293815613,

interview of an independent oil producer with the third vicepresident and traffic manager of the pennsylvania railroad the producer said if we should ship as much will you give us as low freight rates the traffic manager no the producer we have been shipping over tie pennsylvania railroad and why can we not continue the traffic manager it would make them mad i think you ought to fix it up with them being unable to get a satisfactory rate from the traffic inanager the independent producers applied to the president of the road and his reply was you had better go and arrange with the standard oil company i do not want to get into any trouble with them i will do all in my power to bring it about the producers if we ship the same amount of oil can we have the same rate the president no the producer if you have not cars enough will you if we build cars haul them the president no you will not have any peace or prosperity until you make terms with the company the president of the pennsylvania railroad then offered his services to the independent producers to intercede with the standard oil company to get transportation over his own road for his own customers in pennsylvania v the pennsylvania railroad pages 725 and 726 the third vicepresident and traffic manager of that road testified i stated to the outside refiners that we would make lower rates to the standard oil company than to anyone else we declined to let them have cars of their own on the road his evidence covers 76 pages and in that he verifies in toto the interview with himself and with the president of the road that i have just quoted and yet the officers of the standard oil company declare that they have never had rates or privileges that have not been open and equal to all their competitors the hepburn report to the new york assembly shows in one case where the rate to the independent refiners was 1 15 and the rate to the standard oil company was 38 cents and in another instance where the rate to independents was 1 40 per barrel on crude oil and to the standard oil company the rate was 88j cents o an officer of the standard oil company in the case of pennsylvania v the pennsylvania railroad testified q were you allowed a rebate amounting to 64h cents per barrel a no sir being compelled to produce the books of the company he was compelled to read from the books that there was a rebate of 64j cents per barrel but the business ability of the standard oil company has not been confined to such trifling matters as forcing favorable freight rates the testimony of the hepburn report to the new york assembly and in the case of pennsylvania v the pennsylvania railroad shows that the standard oil company in one year through the device of a mistletoe company demanded and received from three trunk lines of railway over 3 000 000 the money was forcibly taken from the railroads by collecting 22j cents per barrel on all oil received and transported over the roads referred to the traffic manager of the pennsylvania railroad testified on page 691 pennsylvania v the pennsylvania railroad as follows q this 22 cents per barrel paid to the american transfer companythe tool of the standard oilis not restricted to oil passed through their llnes a no air it is paid on all oil received and transported by the roads a license to steal could add nothing to such sagacity and business ability they would not play false and yet would wrongly win homer declares autolycus was excellent above all men in theft and perjury homer returned altogether too early to the skies now does it not seem natural that the people of the country should protest against practices and policies that lead to such inequalities as i have detailed the limited time that i have to occupy the attention of the house this morning has made it impossible for me but to refer briefly to a few of the many conditions of injustice that have been practiced by these powerful concerns against their weaker competitors and against the public welfare no it is not strange that upon every hand throughout every section of the country a prosperous people who believe in equal and exact justice are everywhere engaged in an effort to give every man and every dollar an equal chance with every other man and every other dollar in the race of life the countrys demand is a fair show whether a man has small capital or large it is not hoped even with an equal chance that limited capital will enjoy the advantages ofunlimited capital or that a man with little business capacity may succeed as well as a man with great business capacity but it is hoped that we may be able to make the big fellow stop taking unwarranted and unlawful advantage of the little fellow this is the fair play and the square deal that the american people demand why there is no fight on wealth or corporate capital on the contrary the demand is for a square deal for all men and all capital great and small the fight is centered against the indefensible methods in business practiced by the large concerns such as the standard oil company and the beef combine and is a protestagainst every method and every practice of common carriers that would deprive anyone of his constitutionalrights to a fair chance and an equal opportunity in the pursuit of happiness the whole country insists that the highways shall be open to all on equal terms and that these highways shall be protected against the spoliation of the bandit and the highwayman of trade and commerce for the common good of all now the answer made by those who are charged with these abuses is that they who complain are populists or dangerous agitators and if one seeks a remedy for wrongs already done or a preventive against further injustice to the public he is denounced as an ambitious demagogue neither is true the great body of the american people make intelligent protest against a disregard of their rights by those whose duty it is under public franchises to deal impartially and fairly with all the people it is arrogantly charged that the poor envy the rich and covet the power of wealth it is not true the people have proper regard for those who have wealth and possess its power without ostentation or arrogance and use it without wanton disregard of the rights of others and there are many who have wealth and manage its power so that they do unto others as they would that others should do unto them but there are those who use their power as the highwayman uses his and it is against the methods of these few that the people seek to protect themselves and it is for these they have a just contempt why sir the captain of industry who so uses his skill and manages the capital under his control as to bring honest returns to honest investors is sought for on every hand and in every field of enterprise the protest is against the captain kidd of industry who would reap where he has not sown who would gather in where he has not scattered abroad we must have wealth and large accumulations of capital to meet the conditions under which we live today an evolution of economic conditions that has been at work for more than half a century has made necessary the creation and incorporation of great enterprises with large capital within the memory of many members upon this floor the candle mold the cobblers kit the smokehouse the loom the freight wagon and the stagecoach were the means of production and distribution that ministered to the necessities of the people these crude implements cost but little and property in them was within the reach of all few were dependent upon others for the little they had of the necessities of life in three score years the increasing desire of a great people for better things has brought about an evolution in these means until today the candle molds the cobblers kit the loom the smokehouse the freight wagon and the stagecoach are almost forgotten the refinery the great factory the large mill the larger packing house the fast freight and the transcontinental limited have taken their place the people have brought on this change and it is here to stay now it took but little capital to start a set of candle molds a cobblers kit a loom a smokehouse a freight wagon or a stagecoach but it takes large accumulations of capital to start a refinery a factory a mill a packing house the fast freight and the limited train we must have wealth and large accumulations of capital to maintain these necessities of the life we are living today and there is no fear of such wealth or such capital or the power they wield in the hands of honest men the fear that justly alarms the people is of the dishonest management of large concerns that make or distribute the necessities of life have the fears of the people been justly alarmed are they unthinking populists have the platform the pulpit and the press all gone mad no no the people are dependent upon these large concerns to make and bring to them the necessities of lifethe light they use the shoes and clothes they wear the food they eat and the fuel they burn there is therefore just cause for complaint when refiners mills factories and packers combine to create monopolies that keep down the price of raw materials to the producers and raise the price of the finished products to the consumers and to drive the man of small means who would do an independent competitive business to the wall why on yesterday in the conservative east in the staid old state of new jersey a senator offered a resolution when i read it this morning i said certainly this is a bronco statesman from the west he does not belong to the conservative east he is from kansas nebraska missouri south dakota or arkansas or texas he does not live in new jersey but he offered the resolution which i send to the clerks desk and ask to have read the resolution is worth listening to"]], "top_unsure": [[2.193450927734375e-05, 0.5000219345092773, 1, "yes i think

anybody versed in the iron business would refer to a place where they finish guns as a foundry i am opposed to the amendment made by the gentleman from virginia pertaining to an appropriation for an additional foundry at the washington navyyard as i do not believe that the interests of the government can be best conserved by making same at this time the infoimation that i have gathered regarding the present conditiofs was obtained mainly through personal observations and through conversation with capt e h c leutze the present commandant or superintendent of the navyyard upon examining the report of the commandant i was amazed at the lax expenditure of money for the employment of skilled mechanics who are not able mainly on account of the poor facilities of the present foundry to do their work efficiently and i am constrained to say just a wotd or two on this subject according to the report referred to there are employed in the foundry 227 molders in a space 260 feet by 113 feet the fact is patent that there is not sufficient space for the number of men employed they are literally stepping over one another there is no question but that the present foundry is inadequate in size to make all of the castings required by the government at this time yet it must be admitted from the dimensions given that it is one of the largest in the country but if the same policy is to be continued 13y the management as heretofore there is no reason to expect that the congestion will be r~lieved why it should have been thought necessary to plod on in a rut when molding machines pneumatic machines and other uptodate appliances could have been procured is a question that i think should appeal to every fairminded man i am not arguing for a reduction of men understand but for better resultsby the same number of men and with less effort making it easier on the men it is stated that there is not sufficient room for machines then why should the number of employees have been augmented to the detriment of the work in general when by the erection of a few little buildings machines could have been installed and the product increased many fold the practice now in vogue at the navyyard is to work the molders in two shifts but anyone at all conversant with a foundry knows that this plan is an extravagant way of doing that class of work it is admitted that the men on the night shift are unable to turn out more than 75 per cent of the work accomplished by the day molders and i do not doubt it the wonder is that they are capable of doing as much for a casting may take three hours or it may take three days to cool depending upon its size hence there is so much floor space wasted or delayed which can not be used by the oncoming shift then again i understand that all of the men employed are highclass moldersnot laborers but moldersall of them receiving molders wages there is not a firstclass foundry in the country that would tolerate such a practice from a business standpoint after all it is not so much a question of appropriating money for an additional foundry as it is a question of better management in the present one it is no conclusive argument to assert that the molds are heavier in the government plant than in other foundries and therefore require more skilled help if that be the case there is a justifiable reason why there should be a decided reduction in the cost of producing them not alone in the failure to provide laborers is the management subject to criticism but also in the lack of machine facilities it is fair to assume that in the foundry practice here there are many castings being made in duplicate then why should they not be made in a molding machine this machine can be made to turn out a very large tonnage and particularly on small cfistings as required by the government two men with such a machine can domore work in eight hours than twelve molders without a machine could possibly do this statement may be doubted by those who have not had experience with the molding machine but its truth can be thoroughly established by a little investigation government enterprise as well as public office is a public trust and if private concerns can make money out of their foundry product i do not see why the government should not profit likewise yet it is admitted in this report that the cost of the product is higher than the selling price of outside corporations instead of being antiquated in management and method a government institution like this foundry should be found abreast of the times if not just a little ahead of them it is a good principleto be not the first by whom the new is tried nor yet the last to lay the old aside but the government follows neither of these injunctions it seems to me that if we are to run a foundry it should be the highest type of its kind on this continent it should be a model for the foundries of the nation it should be the mecca for the mechanics of the country new devices and new methods should be immediately installed judgment passed upon them and condemned or approved as the case might be i desire it to be understood that i am making no personal accusations against anyone connected with the management of the foundry but i do insist that the policy thus far in control of the manufacture of castings is one of shortsighted business economy i do not question the honesty or the integrity of the officials in chairge but i do claim that it would be far wiser for the department to consult with experienced men out of the business world and possibly appoint a temporary board of experts to outline a practice that would be conducive to the best interests of the government i insist that if this foundry is to be run on business lrinciples it would be far wiser to employ a foundry expert than it is to trust the expenditure of all this money to the inexperienced judgment of naval officials if you were in the foundry business you would not think of employing a naval captain to manage it any more than you would consider it proper for a foundry man to be placed in charge of a ship one is as incongruous as the other those who advance the argument in favor of an extensive foundry that there is a possibility of combination or collusion among manufacturers to maintain prices show a lack of familiarity with the iron industry of the united states when we consider the fact that thi s land is fairly dotted with small foundries it is a manifest absurdity to suppose that a sufficient number could so combine as to control prices every city and almost every town of any importance supports one or more foundries with all this competition if the government finds it impossible to purchase iron castings at reasonable prices there must be very poor management to say the least too often we are prone to blame outside influences for deficiencies in our own makeup to be specific if the cost of gray iron castings is 3 cents per pound when they can be purchased in the open market for much less the fault is not in external combinations but in our own lax managerial methods and the need of cities and towns for small foundries is as great to my mind as the need of the government for a large foundry understand the scope of my argument is not so much in opposition to the governments going into the foundry business on a large scale as it is in favor of better management of the inqustries which it now controls i mention the need of the country for these small institutions to show the utter impracticability of their being blotted out they are moreover a necessity if we would foster the spirit of initiative and industry among small investors to expect to build a nation out of citizens whose power of initiative isdwarfed by the growth of
