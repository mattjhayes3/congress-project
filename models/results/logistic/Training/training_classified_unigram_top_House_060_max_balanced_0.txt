not to force them to do it the racial fact in this case is a stubborn thing and gentleilnen had just as well recognize it you cant legislate it out of men in the great plan of things it has a great purpose to serve in your hopeless condition politically you are grasping at anything and everything with which to make political capital since the prosperity plank in the republican platform broke you seize eagerly upon any material available for campaign purposes and now when we call on you to provide better street car accommodations for the white and the black races in washingtonwhen we ask that the dominant race here be relieved from a condition sorely distasteful and aggravating from a condition where white women suffer indignities and abuses at the hands of negroes on the carsyou try to evade the issue by going into a discussion of the negros political rights you take up the old crythe one with which you have deceived the negro a thousand times you have gone into office in some localities on that cry many times and you take it up now on the theory that it has landed many thousands and will land as many more glory hallelujah 1 but i do not believe that your soft words and pleasing platitudes about the negroes political rights will deceive the negro this year the sensible negro knows that my position on this question is the position of the white race and i want to say here and now that i believe that if we could have a secret vote on my amendment nearly all of you would vote for it and those of you who would not vote for it would deep down in your hearts pray for its passage you do not discuss the merits of my amendment you dare not do it it is sound and wholesome and provides equal accommodations for both races and is a guaranty against the troubles now occurring between the races the white people want it and the negroes will be better off with its adoption in those states and mine is one of them i am glad to say where we have separate cars for white and negro passengers it was found necessary for the peace and harmony between the races to provide separate cars prior to the time of separate cars there was no end to troubles and annoyances arising from negroes and white passengers huddled together in the same car but since we have separate cars with equal accommodations and the cars are of the same character the statement of the gentleman from new york to the contrary notwithstanding there is no trouble whatsoever between tile racesthe old cause for trouble on the cars having been removed the gentleman from new york and the gentleman from kansas have left my amendment and they have left the rotten street car service of this city and they have gone to labama and have undertaken to discuss the franchise clause in the constitution of my state both gentlemen have demonstrated very clearly that they occupy the same relation to the constitution of alabama that the young man from kansas did to the law for when he was asked what is law looked bewildered for a moment and said its that that i know but durn little about we have the best election law in the union we have the educational qualification the property qualification so the man who has 300 worth of real or personal property and who can not read and write can vote and we have the polltax plan but what has this to do with the obnoxious street car situation in this city the gentleman from illinois mounts his campaign steed charges up the mountain of the federal constitution pauses on an elevation overlooking his district and proclaims that the federal constitution guarantees to every citizen the godgiven right of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness if i can cause him to curb his campaign steed long enough for a question or two i shall be very happy i will ask him what part of that constitutional provision is affected by my amendment is it the pursuit of happiness clause if so i will ask him to explain to me and to this hiouse if he wants the negro to pursue happiness in the same car with white passengers then i will ask him how he will reconcile this same guaranty to the case of the white man who wants to pursue happiness in a car to himself the gentleman from vermont deplores the fact that such an amendment as mine should be offered on washingtons birthday why my amendment will do more for the peace and happiness of both races in the district of columbia than any other thing that we can do today for the city that bears the immortal washingtons name pass my amendment and discord and friction between the races will disappear and peace will be restored and the bible says blessed is the peacemaker if george washington were living today he would certainly favor my amendment my auendinent deals with a condition that every intelligent man knows is a serious one and one from which a great deal of bad feeling and racial difficulties have come and will continue to come unless separate cars are provided the gentleman from illinois referring to me said the legislation which he proposes is purely of a character such as we might expect to be asked to enact by a gentleman coming from the part of the country the gentleman in part represents the gentleman from illinois in the language just used has paid to me and to the good people that i have the honor to represent a splendid complilment yes coming front a section where at one time we had no separate cars for white and negro passengers and where this failure to provide separate accommodations was a source of much mischief of much bitter feeling and difficulty between the races and having seen the whole trouble settled and peace and harmony restored between the races by the separatecar system when i see the same conditions here that we once had and when i know that the remedy we applied will settle the question here and settle it to the best interest of both races i would fail to do my duty if i did not offer the remedy that i know to be a sure cure the gentleman from illinois who failed utterly to discuss my amendment said among other things referring to alabama laws have been enacted by its legislature preventing these citizens from exercising the rights guaranteed to them by the constitution and doubtless methods of intimidation have been practiced which added to the burdens of unjust laws would if exposed to public view make a record of oppression which would bring a blush of shame to the face of every believer in law and justice the country over this statement of the gentleman from illinois is a gross misrepresentation of the facts no such condition exists in alabama or anywhere else save in the convenient and wild imagination of the gentleman from illinois who is making a very disgusting and cheap bid for negro votes in his district i was not old enough to remember just how a carpetbagger looked but i believe that i have seen one or the son of one today continuing the gentleman from illinois said and now the gentleman from alabama under the false cry of social equality seeks to insert in this bill a provision which lie as a lawyer knows to be unconstitutional in order that he may receive the applause of a haughty austere and egotistical aristocracy who are laboring under the false impression that they are the first and the foremost people on earth i deny that my amendment is unconstitutional on the other hand in my judgment it would stand the test before the supreme court of the united states this same gentleman from illinois says that i have offered this amendment in order to receive the applause of a haughty austere and egotistical aristocracy who are laboring under the false impression that they are the first and foremost people on earth i offered this amendment because i believe that it carries with it the right solution of a very obnoxious and disagreeable system now in force in the district of columbia i intrbduced that amendment because i believe in separate cars for the races i did not introduce it in order to receive the applause of a haughty austere and egotistical aristocracy the gentlemans want of information regarding my district and the proud and patriotic people that i represent is in itself appalling my people are not haughty austere and egotistical aristocrats they are as intelligent as brave and patriotic a people as live on this earth the gentleman from illinois said as the climax of his remarks that my purpose in introducing the amendment was to humiliate the negro and that i never lost an opportunity to express my views on the negro question when i could add anything to their suffering and humiliation i bear no malice toward the negro race on the contrary i have the very kindliest feelings and good will for all lawabiding industrious negroes the old negroes who were the slaves of my father love hin and love his children and when the gentleman states that my purpose is to humiliate the negro he displays a glaring ignorance of my feelings and motives the southern white lan is the best friend that the negro has on earth he knows the negro as nobody else in america knows him he will not permit anybody to impose on or mistreat a good negro at the same time we have recognized a racial fact that you do not seem to understand or if you do understand it you have not the courage to say so the gentleman from illinois may be deceiving himself but he is not deceiving the negro he is trying to make political capital of my amendment to regulate the street cars of washington he is trying to get up something with which to solidify the negro vote in his district and in the doubtful states so he can say to the leaders it worked like a charm you told about the treatment of the negro in the south let me remind you that there is no community in the south where negroes are not allowed to live but there are several localities in the north where you absolutely forbid him living in the south when he commits tile unnanmable crime he dies and he deserves to die sometimes the mob gets him but the difference in the mob in the south and the mob in the north is the mob in the south seeks and visits punishment only upon the guilty party but in the north you shoot them as you come to them and burn them out in communities the gentleman from illinois harps on the negros political rights i want to remind the gentleman that some time ago his party put a negro on the ticket for judge in chicago he was put on to hold the negro vote to the republican party to the surprise of everybody republicans and all he was electedand then what became of this negros political rights in the gentlemans own state of illinois white republicans declared that it would not do for a negro to try and sentence white men and what happened this negro judge lost his job the election was over and they got rid of him republicans talk one way and act another you talk about negroes being disfranchised in the south you seem to forget that at one time the people of washington voted white men and negroes the republican party disfranchised the voters of this district and it is a notorious fact that you did it to get rid of the negro voter these longdistance champions of the negros political rights grow pathetic and eloquent when speaking of the downtrodden brother in black but when the negro wants to move up into their presence we sometimes hear of opposition to his coming some months ago the indianapolis news called on the negroes already residents there to use their influence to keep out their brethren from the south saying that the impression is abroad to the effect that indianapolis is a negro paradise it warns them against the horrors that will come if these ignorant vicious blacks from the south continue swooping down upon the hoosier capital city the northwestern christian advocate published in the home of the gentleman some time ago in speaking of crime and the frequent arrests of negroes said it is not surprising that the number of arrests of negroes should be out of all proportion to the number of the race race prejudice just listen to that gentleman race prejudice even in the north forces them to live in districts notorious for crime the gentleman from illinois had better get the mote out of his own eye before he undertakes to get it out for others i would remind the gentleman from illinois of what a distinguished and able republican once said about the races at charleston ill in the gentlemans own state september 18 185s mr lincoln in a speech said i will say that i am not and never have been in favor of bringing ahout in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races that i am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes nor of qualifying them to hold office nor to intermarry with white people and i will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which i believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality and inasmuch as they can not so live while they remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior and as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race was lincoln right or is the gentleman from kansas right the gentleman from kansas made no argument against my amendment he was content to inform the house and the country that his children and negro children went to the same school and that he and negroes attended the same church well every man to his taste i do not believe that the gentleman from kansas reflects the views of his white constituency on this subject i am reminded of a politician who shaped his creed for his cravings and swallowed his convictions for a job i believe in separate cars for the races and i believe in separate schools and churches and i believe that i state the doctrine of the white race on these subjects in spite of the kansas gentlemans extraordinary views in conclusion i want to say that in spite of the effort of hardpressed republicans to make political capital out of my amendment if you will adopt it it will be for the very best interests of both races"], [0.015403568744659424, 0.9845964312553406, 1, "oh i will be glad to discuss peanuts with the gentleman some other time but i want to call attention to some other things now when you come to reform this tariff and my friend has talked about the standard oil there are some things here on the free list that you ought to allow to remain sacred this is a great production this tariff bill and i do not wonder that the distinguished leaders on that side halt considerably when we talk about revising it your charity my friends to the american people has been so great that in their interest and on their behalf i protest against your undertaking to reform this tariff that is unless you allow to remain sacred forever this free list think of it here is article 588 old junk that is also placed on the free list every farmer in the country and every laboring man that gets old junk can thank god there is no tariff tax upon that that you have placed that on the free list i do not wonder as i said that this tariff bill is not to be touched but i want to call your attention to the position of the republican party when legislation of some real value i offered to the american people you had an opportunity to vote upon different questions and your record has been written you can not change it i know that you are trying to imitate bryan and i wish you would only do more of it but your record has been written and it is written in the ment offeredyou talk about trustshere was an amendment offered to you on june 2 1900 this amendment was offered by mr terry of arkansas on behalf of the democrats whenever the president of the united states shall be satisfied that the price of any commodity or article of merchandise has been enhanced in consequence of any monopoly as defined in this act he shall issue his proclamation suspending the collection of all customs duties or import taxes on like articles of merchandise or commodities brought from foreign countries such suspension shall continue as long as such enhancement in price of such commodity or article of merchandise exists and until revoked by the president h=ow did our republican friends vote then you talk about the standard oil today the president of the united states whom you electedwe did not put him in powerif that amendment had passed would have the power if he believed that were a monopoly as he must believe to take the tariff off of oil and let oil come in free he would have not only that power but he would have the power to take the tariff off of steel if he believed therewas a steel trust controlling the price of that commodity but when you had an opportunity to vote on these questions the republican party looked to the trusts and the trusts looked to the republican party and when the democratic party was about to lay the ax to the very root of monopoly which would destroy it the trusts cried out to you for protection and the cry was not in vain that the tariff is used as a fomenter and protector of trusts no man conversant with the history of this country can deny statistics show that there are more than two hundred trusts in this country that are made possible by the tariff who can give any just reason why the tariff should be allowed to protect a trust or monopoly which is so mercenary so forgetful of the people in this government which offers to them its protection they manufacture goods here and send them across the ocean pay the freight and sell them to foreigners in an unprotected market and charge less than they do to our own home people and yet if this amendment had been the law it could have been used as a sword to cut down monopoly and millions of dollars would have been saved to the people under the dingley law section 3 you provide that the president shall have the power by proclamation to impose a tariff upon coffee tea and vanilla beans when he becomes convinced that any articles of our manufacture are dealt with unreasonably you were quite willing to give the chance and right to the president to raise the tariff when some manufacturer was being discriminated against by foreign countries but you were unwilling to give the american consumers the millions of our countrymen who have made this country great the benefit of such a law in their interests when manufacturers in their own country had monopolized against them and were discriminating against them in favor of the foreign consumer it is not necessary to be sending longdrawnout messages in pyrotechnic display before the country inveighing against dishonest methodsdishonesty in high places with these i most cordially agree yet the president with a message of a dozen lines could strike a blow for the american people that would be more effectual than a train load of such messages if he will ask congress to place upon the free list all articles that are manufactured or controlled by trusts in the united states why only in this congress when an amendment was offered by the gentleman from nebraska providing that the agents of the united states in foreign countries should ascertain and obtain proof as to whether or not manufacturers in the united states were selling goods in foreign markets cheaper than at home the republican party voted down the amendment and sustained the speaker in ruling it out of order we saw this illustrated in the fiftyeighth congress when the republicans voted to a man in favor of giving the armorplate manufacturers a monopoly in armor plate for our navy an amendment was offered providing that not more than 398 per ton should be paid for armor plate the proof was incontrovertible that this profit was enormous and outrageous and yet our republican friends on the other side voted it down and an amendment was offered providing that in case they were unable to purchase armor plate at these places the united states should manufacture it itself that a monopoly existed in the manufacture of armor plate there is no controversy but the republicans lined up in favor of the monopoly and voted down the amendment when san francisco had been wrecked by the great earthquake when the hearts of the american people bled for these stricken people when homes and fortunes of lifetime accumulation had been swept away when representatives on this floor opened the doors of the treasury to provide for them when alien people in distant lands gave of their substance to these people a bill was introduced providing that those articles upon which a tariff appeared which would be needed in rebuilding this stricken city should be permitted to come into the country free of duty but the riepublican party was again to the rescue and voted it down they were willing to take the peoples money that had been gathered by taxation and give it to this city and these people but the onslaught of monopoly and the iron hand of greed could not be loosened from the throat of this prostrate city and so it was with baltimore when that city was swept by flames the glare of which could be seen from this capitol monopoly was permitted by the republican party to feed upon these people in rebuilding that city we saw another evidence of the republican partys friendship for the trusts when on june 16 1906 mr sullivan a democrat from massachusetts offered the following amendment provided that no part of this provision shall be expended for material and supplies which are manufactured or produced in the united states unless said articles are sold to the isthmian canal commission at export prices whenever such export prices are lower than the prices charged the consumer in the united states this was to deny the monopolies of the country the right to rob the government in building the great panama canal yet our republican friends all rallied to the support of their speaker when he declared it out of order and on appeal by the democrats the republicans voted to sustain him and by that to allow the monopolies in this country to rob the government in the sale of supplies in the building of this canal by charging more for them than they sell the same supplies to foreign purchasers for another evidence of the partnership that exists between the republican party and the trusts was shown with striking force when the democrats on june 2 1900 offered an amendment denying to any corporation association or joint stock company operating or doing business in any state of the united states the right of interstate commerce when it was organized and carried on for the purpose of controlling the manufacture or sale of any article of commerce but our republican friends again rallied to the support of the monopolies and voted this down another amendment was offered by the democratic side denying to trusts and monopolies the use of the united states mails in aid or furtherance of their business or purpose to monopolize either the production or sale of any article of commerce and the republican party was again to the rescue of the trusts and voted this amendment down so it is the whole history of the two political parties shows the democratic side battling for the people against monopolies and the republican party battling with monopolies against the people why i heard the distinguished gentleman from michigan the other day trying to prove that railroad rate legislation was a republican doctrine how did he prove it by the declaration of his party platform no for in 1s96 it was silent in 1900 it was silent in 1904 it was silent that was a burning question then a party is known by the principle it declares in its national convention and not by a bill introduced by some man here and yonder but what are the real facts the democratic platform in 1896 demanded railroad rate regulation as a crusader it certainly brought forth good fruit i care not who it was that took up this proposition so long as he fought along democratic lines the republican party had the hearty support of the railroads in 189g and 1900 i remember they had parades in kentucky they forced their men into them they poured money from their treasury into the republican fund to corrupt the voters what was the result they bought up the election for the republican party you came into power and what did you do having been educated by the democratic party educated by bryan you heard the roar of discontent throughout the country by reason of discriminations and wrongs wrought upon the people of this country by the common carriers you brought out the townsendesch bill what sort of a bill was that did it have the penitentiary penalty it did not i made a speech calling attention to this failure in the law and saying the only way to regulate the railroads was by providing a penitentiary penalty the hepburn bill came to this house without any such penalty from my place upon this floor i offered an amendment providing for a penitentiary penalty which secretary taft says is the only thing that vitalizes and makes powerful this law how did you gentlemen vote every republican upon that side of the house voted no you wanted to fine them you wanted the railroads to be speculating on the question as to whether they could steal more from the people than they could be fined by the courts i read from secretary tafts speech at columbus ohio of august 19 1907 he says it is well understood that the elkins bill was passed without opposition by and with free consent of the railroads and that the chief reason for this was the elimination of the penitentiary penalty for unjust discriminations the abolition of imprisonment as a possible penalty was unfortunate experience has shown that a mere fine is generally not enough to deter a corporation from violation of the law because it then becomes a matter of mcre business speculation the imprisonment of two or three prominent officers of a railway company or a trust engaged in giving or receiving secret rebates would have a greater deterrent for the future than millions in fine by this utterance secretary taft shows that the imprisoninent penalty is all that vitalizes and makes powerful or effective the railroad rate law yet he does not give the credit to the democratic party the republican party voted down the amendment which i offered providing for this imprisonment penalty and when the bill went to the senate senator stone a democrat offered the amendment providing for the penitentiary penalty and it was incorporated into the law so it was not the republicans but the democrats who made this fight in the interests of the people what an indictment against the republican party in congress made by a man in whose hands you want to place your standard saying the republican party in the congress of the united states brought forward a bill here to do what give the railroads immunity from punishment with the full consent and the approval of the railroad companies the democratic party has announced to the country a new mode of warfare it isthe people shall command and the leaders must obey they have a leader his name is upon every tongue it is gravened on the heart of every democrat he has convictions and the courage to express them he has stood for something he has sown the good seed and has raised in front of an army of the most merciless vultures the world ever saw the commandment thou shalt not steal he is the one indeed who has never prostituted his giant intellect for money and never sold the love the american people bear him for corporation gold he cut the way through the wilderness of greed and was the pioneer its great to be a pioneer his path is always red with blood and wet with tears but his name lives the people of this republic at the coming election are going to reward him and the hand that will bear the democratic standard is the same one that wielded the first sword in defense of the american people against organized greed they only wait sir with restless anxiety the opportunity to elect that grand that splendid that matchless democrat william j bryan president of the united states"], [0.016376018524169922, 0.9836239814758301, 1, "mr chairman and gentlemen of the committee for the past month it strikes me that everything which has occurred from the birth of adam do~vn to the execution of midgetts has been discussed in this house being a new member i invite your attention for a few moments to some of tile questions now before the amer can people i can not enter upon a discussion of what i have to say without replying to some of the things set forth by the president in his recent message i was one of the men on this side of the house who applauded certain parts of the message i did not do it as a democrat nor did i do it because it came from a republican president but i did it under the profound belief that it enunciated certain principles that if enacted into law would redound to the interest of the masses of the people of this country i am in hearty accord with the presidents message in what he says in reference to the coemployees liability act under the rules of common law that has been in force not only in 1640 our federal courts but in the majority of our state courts of the union ever since 1837 time and again and it has been next to an impossibility for a deserving employee to recover from his employer because he was met with the proposition at the ery threshold of his case thatyou were a fellowservant of the man at the time you were hurt therefore you can not recover the idea of any law in this country holding that an operator a section man and a man upon a train are fellowservants is absurd i the idea of a law in this country holding that an operator a section man or a man working upon a train to be fellowservants and thereby preventing recovery is absurd there may be some things embraced in this law of doubtful propriety but still it embraces a principle of law that is absolutely right and i believe ought to be enacted into legislation if a suit is brought in the various state courts under this federal coemployees liability law against carriers doing an interstate business i believe that a removal would lie from the circuit courts of the states to the federal courts of the united states and to meet this objection i believe the law relating to the removal of causes from the various courts of the states to the federal courts ought to be amended for nearly one hundred years the jurisdiction of the federal courts was fixed at 500 in 1887 the act was amended the amount in controversy was fixed at 2 000 in the past twenty years the volume of business in this country has increased at least fivefold and in my judgment the law ought to be amended so as to fix the jurisdiction of the federal courts in all amounts in controversy at not less than 10 000 this would give an employee engaged at work upon carriers engaged in interstate commerce a right of action under the federal statute in the state eburts and it would prevent removals to the federal courts in all cases where the amount in controversy did not exceed 10 000 i am further in favor of active legislation along the line of the presidents message regarding antiinjunction i believe that before even a temporary restraining order should be issued notice should be served upon the parties this was the law of this country for nearly one hundred years and in my judgment ought to be the law now with these two recommendations made by the president heartily agree not as a democrat but because as a citizen of this country i believe that if these measures are enacted into laws they would be of great benefit to the masses of the people i further believe that the question of indirect contempt shoul be submitted to a jury for trial no one should ever fear to submit his cause to a jury of his peers and when you deprive a lmn of this right you deprive him of one of his inherent rights guaranteed to him by the declaration of indepeudence and the constitution of the united states i desire to say a few words this evening on the tariff question there is no question in which the american people are more interested than the question of taxation around this one question centers all our social and political fabric without some system of goverlnent taxation no civilized government could exist with anm unjust system of taxation the question remains ilow long can any government organized by law exist that all governments need some kind of a system of taxation for the purpose of raising revenues to meet their required expenditures no one denies but all admit i recognize the fact because it is a fact that it is practically as impossible to get perfection in a law enacted by man as it is to get perfection in man himself this being true we can only adopt the conservative plan and reach as near perfection in our law as is possible for us to do therefore il framing all laws by all lawmaking bodies the one great cardinal principle that should ever guide them is to so frame laws that they will inure to the benefit of the greatest number and at the same time protect the interests of the minority provided it is entitled to protection in a young growing undeveloped country such as ours laws to govern it are subject to a constantly growing science what would have been a law sufficient to meet the demands of this country one hundred years ago may not be at all adapted for it today and vice versa therefore our tariff law being under the supervision and control of congress if it does not meet the ends for which it was designed it is our duty to amend it and bring it within the required demands of the people i do not desire to array class against class or section against sectionfar from it but i propose o1 this line to present a few facts with a view of seeing wlmether or not this was the principle upon which our present tariff laws were enacted or if they were guided in the making of this law by the contrary principle of legislating in the interest of the few to the detriment of the many knowing the necessity of raising money for the purpose of meeting the expenditures of the government the framers of the constitution among other things provided that congress should have power to collect taxes duties imposts excises etc under this constitutional provision congress has from time to time since the year 1791 on down to the passage of the dingley law in 1897 imposed a duty upon certain goods manufactured abroad and imported into this country under this provision since its adoption there has been in this country headed by two great political parties two welldefined policies one of these policies headed by a strong political party has contended that it had a right to enact a law not only for the purpose of raising revenue to support the government but along protective lines as well the other party contending that under it a duty could only be laid for the purpose of raising revenue to support the government of the united states economically administered while the constitution gives congress the power to lay and collect duties upon foreign manufactured goods imported into this country it does not give to congress or to any party the right to distort this power into a policy which works to the interest of the few to the detriment of the many the constitution also provides that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation and as a corollary to this proposition it is equally clear that private property can not be taken for private use under any circumstances by due process of law or otherwise therefore if under our present or past protective tariff laws framed under this constitutional provision a right is givenby the federal government to impose such duties upon foreign manufactured goods imported into this country that private property is taken for private use such taking has been a wrongful taking and under no principle can it be defended that the present existing tariff law is unjust and ought to be amended so as to give every man as far as possible a square deal and prevent the taking of private property for private purposes is conceded by all with few exceptions the arguments heretofore advanced for protection by the republican party has been solely on the side of the corporations and trusts and of the larger class at that the supposed benefits growing out of protection have all been held up in the interest of these institutions today another class of people are talking tariff reform in this country who until recently were scarcely heard in this field of discussion it is the farmer the laboring man the consumer and the smaller manufacturers who are now loud in their denunciation of the present tariff laws demanding its immediate revision the democratic party stands today on this question where it has stood for the past forty years it stands in open opposition to a high protective tariff it stands in open opposition to all unlawful combinations and trusts organized under the dingley law or otherwise designed to crush out competition and fix the price not only of their manufactured commodities but of all raw material entering into the cost of manufacturing it stands as the open champion of tar iff reform it stands upon the benign principle of the greatest good to the greatest number it stands for the needs of the present hour and says now is the accepted time to revise the tariff the republican party on the other hand has always been the champion of high protection yet today it is showing signs of receding from its former position upon this subject one man high in the councils of the republican party an avowed candidate for the presidency of the united states says he believes the tariff ought to be revised but he also says wait until after the election of 1908 still another high in the councils of his party in my state says he believes it ought to be revised but he believes that a comnission ought to be appointed for this purpose why wait until after the election of 1908 is it for fear that a revision of it will injure the masses of the people now staggering under this unequal load of oppression or is it for fear that a revision of the tariff at this session of congress would destroy his chance of being elected president in the fall of 1908 in the event he should receive the nomination at the hands of his party or may it not be for the more subtle reason and hope that after election the masses of the people can be whitewashed by the passage of some pretended revision of our present existing tariff laws why appoint a commission to investigate this matter it is a political question pure and simple is it because you do not believe you have the ability to revise it or is it rather because you hope that if you can succeed in getting a commission appointed to investigate this matter then if the people are not satisfied with the revision you can throw the responsibility back upon their shoulders the people will not let you whitewash them in any such manner as this the tariff will be revised early in 1909 we are going to elect william j bryan this fall president of the united states and get control of this house of representatives organize the ways and means committee with a view of revising the tariff and then true to our promises and pledges made to tile people we will revise it as they want it revised unless the united states senate refuses to do its part in the way of revising it what assurances have the people that you would revise it after the election of 1908 if you should be returned to power none whatever to admit that our present tariff laws ought to be amended is an argument and a strong one that the law as it now stands is wrong to admit that it ought to be amended and revised and then refuse to amend and revise it is in my judgment the worst element of bad faith and should characterize the party in power as being unwilling to amend the law as it now is and unwilling to heed the cries of the people asking for its amendment and revision for years and years the republican party has rung down the curtain all over this country that the panic of 1893 was due to a revision of our then existing tariff law the history upon this subject is that the panic was on in full blast for more than fourteen months before the wilson bill became a law the loudest advocates of protection go so far as to say that it was for fear of a reformation of the tariff laws that the manufacturers and corporations of the country long in advance of the time when the tariff was revised brought the house down upon their own heads just as well may the argument be advanced that a man for fear that his house was going to be robbed burned it down for the purpose of preventing the robbery in every campaign following the revision of the tariff in 1894 the republican party has never tired of keeping in the foreground the panic of 1893 as one of the inevitable results following the tariff revision of 1892 when in truth the revision of the tariff in 1894 had no more to do with bringing on the panic than a south sea islander had if the election of grover cleveland in 1892 and the control of this house by the democratic party and the revision of the tariff following his election one and all contributed to bring on the panic then my republican friends on that side of the house let me ask you what was the cause of the panic il the fall of 1907 through which we are still traveling was it due to the fact that your candidate for president says he is in favor of tariff revision but wants it postponed until after the election of 1908 was it for fear that others were saying it ought to be revised by a commission or was it due to the demand of tle farmers over the country who are now insisting upon an immediate revision of the present unwise and discriminatory tariff law if you still insist that the panic of 1893 was due to the revision of the tariff which did not occur until 1894 by the same argument we would have the right to insist that the present panic was due to the demand for present revision of the tariff by your candidate for president and by the manufacturers boards of trade farmers and consumers all over the country we denied that the revision of the tariff of 1894 had anything to do with the panic of 1893 and we now deny that the present talk for tariff revision had anything whatever to do with the present panic if every time the business man the laborer the farmer the consumer feeling the heavy burdens of an unjust tariff talks and speaks for a revision of the law a panic must be brought on by the possessors of predatory wealth gotten by means of a law showing the worst degree of favoritism that was ever shown by any law passed by this government then indeed we are in a deplorable condition and the sooner we meet the issue the better for all concerned i imagine that no more will we hear the story of the panic of 1893 heralded by the republican party in any future campaign i wo uld sooner think that the farther you can get away from panics and the argument relating thereto the better satisfied you will be the panic now on and through which we are just traveling can not be due to any freetrade scare was it due to the fact that on our statute books there is today a statute imposing a duty of more than 50 per cent upon all foreignmanufactured goods imported into this country in loss of property and shrinkage of alues tle panic of 1907 far eclipsed the panic of 1893 it required the issuance of nearly 100 000 000 worth of clearinghouse certificates circulating as mediums of exchange and in addition to this the dumping into wall street banks by the secretary of the united states treasury more than 60 000 000 of the peoplets money with rush orders for gold from abroad and in spite of all this with the newspapers and magazines of the country working overtime telling the people not to be alarmed that the worst was over and that business had resumed its normal condition still there was a loss of property and shrinkage in the values of securities in the united states of more than thirtyfive hundred millions of dollars with your tariff law building a wall around us so high that in comparison with our natural resources given us by the allwise and good god in connection with the energy industry and initiative of the american people it is and was wellnigh prohibitory if i could make up my mind that a high protective tariff was for the best interests of all the people unhesitatingly as an american citizen desirous of doing the greatest good to the greatest number i would unfalteringly support such a policy i am unable to subscribe myself to the doctrine of high protection because i am unable to see how any system of taxation inuring to the benefit of the few will bring wealth and prosperity to the masses of the people who eat bread by the sweat of their brow if the prosperous condition of our country prior to the present panic was due solely to high protection as we are told it was by the protectionists and protectionist congress why not go a step further indeed we would not have much further to go and apply the rule of exclusion why not prohibit all importation of foreign manufactured goods into this country absolutely why not say to the world we will do our own spinning and toiling we want none of your interference in our affairs whatever if the principle upon which you base your argument is soundthat a high protective tariff is always conducive to prosperitythe same principle ought to uphold itself to the end of the reason there is no halfway place in your argument it is either all one way or all the other it is either right or it is wrong if it is right it ought to stand up under the argument of exclusion and if it will not stand up under this argument it is wrong on principle and if wrong on principle then the right thing to do is to formulate a law that will stand under the close scrutiny of careful analytical arguments if our prosperity in this country prior to the present panic was due to the policy of the republican party in favoring a high protective tariff why the almost universal demand going on for a revision of it especially among the boot and shoe manufacturers of the new england states including a large number of smaller manufacturing concerns in the united states why are the farmers over this country asking for a revision of the tariff particularly in the west and northwest including such states as wisconsin minnesota iowa and my own state indiana one of the most sensitive parts about all of us is our pocketbook this is human selfishness but it is one of the best traits of selfishness that god has planted in the breasts of us all a full pocketbook produced by honest toil is always conducive to happiness and if the farmer the laboring man the manufacturer who are as capable of judging of their own prosperity and much more so than any other person believe that it would add to their prosperity to continue the policy of high protection instead of asking that the tariff law be amended and revised with one accord they would stand for it to be raised instead of lowered our republican friends especially the stanedpatters would not believe a democrat or a democratic argument though one should rise from the grave and tell it to them but out of the mouths of some of the ablest men in your party today you shall stand rebuked and condemned in the presence of this mighty army of men and women who are asking a revision of the tariff laws so that equal and exact justice may be given to them freely without purchase and speedily without delay gqvernor cummins a republican who has had the honor of thrice being elected governor of the great state of iowa in speaking upon this subject of tariff reform not long ago said all the robberies and thefts committed by all the insurance companies officers since the business of life insurance originated do not amount to the extortion due to the dingley bill for one year what an appalling statement to the gentlemen on the other side is this true or would you characterize governor cummings as a dreamer mark you this is a declaration coming from a live republican high in the councils of his party do you my republican friends believe this statement to be true if so are you going to let this congress adjourn without at least attempting to rectify and correct this collossal wrong at this time i do not have the data at hand showing out of how much money the people have been wronged by the officers of all the life insurance companies since the origin of life insurance business but suffice it to say that it has cost them countless millions of dollars while the life insurance companies have done an immense amount of good for the people in coming to the rescue of many widows and orphans yet the officers and men in charge of these life insurance companies have mercilessly plundered the people of their wealth the investigation of the new york life insurance companies two years ago revealed an apptlling state of affairs for rottenness theft robbery and corruption so much so that it startled the millions of policy holders of these companies throughout europe and america its revelations were so startling that before the investigation was completed one of the presidents of one of these companies unable longer to stand the disgrace died others became exiles in foreign countries just a few days ago i read in one of the newspapers that one of the former presidents of one of the new york life insurance companies was returning home broken in health spirit and power the victims of his robbery had haunted him whither he went in europe or asia longer unable to endure the strain he set his face toward the setting sun to return to his old home where but a few years ago he held undisputed power at the carnival board of robbery in one of the great new york life insurance companies if all the robberies and thefts committed by ill the officers of all the life insurance companies since the business of life insurance first began does not equal the extortion due to the dingley bill for one year then think of the robbery and extortion that has been going on in this country for the past ten years during the time the dingley bill has been in force the amassing of immense wealth into the hands of a few individuals corporations trusts or combinations does not bespeak for the universal wealth universally distributed which is the true and lasting wealth that does bring happiness and prosperity to all the inhabitants of the country but on the other hand rather bespeaks for that dangerous centralized wealth always inimical to the general welfare of all the people the substrata upon which all wealth is based is the laboring man no matter what his occupation or station in life be if he be a producer of something of value every item of his product adds so much to the wealth of the country for the purpose of makebelieve that prosperity is abroad in the land arguments are made here by the gentlemen on that side of the house and by the republican newspapers throughout the country that the past decade has been an era of great prosperity and one of the cogent arguments in support of this proposition is the vast accumulation of wealth by the trusts and combinations of the country one of the dangers to any country having a high protective tariff policy is that a few men of wealth by combining their capital and energy secure complete control of the wealth of the country this is exactly what has happened under the operation of the dingley bill the fathers of your protective tariff policy believed entirely different and believed that while protection would protect us against foreign competition yet they equally believed that home competition would prevent combinations and keep prices down for the consumer in speaking of this very subject in 1889 john sherman then a republican senator from ohio said the primary object of a protective tariff is to secure the fullest competition by individuals and corporations in domestic production if such individuals or corporations combine to advance the price of the domestic product and to prevent the free result of open and fair competition i would without a moments hesitation reduce the duties of foreign goods competing with them in order to break down the combination james g blaine in his twenty years in congress says protection in the perfection of its design does not invite competition from abroad but is based on the contrary irinciple that competition at home will always prevent monopoly on the part of capitalists assure good wages to the laboring iman and defend the consumers against the evil of extortion andrew carnegie writing for the american manufacturer of pittsburg july 5 2884 says we are the creatures of the tariff and if ever the steel manufacturers here attempt to control or have any general understanding among them the tariff would not exist one session of congress the theory of protection is that home competition will soon reduce the price of the product so it will yield only the usual profit any understanding among us would simply attempt to defeat this there never has been nor ever will be such an understanding how different to the expectation of these great men have the conditions in this country changed since their prophetic prophecies during the first three years of the operation of the dingley tariff law 149 industrial corporations were combined with a total capitalization of 5 364 000 000 or an average of nearly 36 000 000 each i do not have a complete list of all the trusts formed since the dingley bill became a law but i submit a few"], [0.029204726219177246,

casecalls representative to account and hot argument fails to alter opinion of either i shall not read the balance of the news item i merely read the headlines and want to say now only this that it is a part of our fundamental law that no representative of the people shall be called into question for any vote or utterance or report made in his capacity as a representative and to add that our forefathers inserted that clause because it had been the habit of george iii and other english kings to call to the kings palace members of parliament and to berate them on account of their votes in parliament or when members of parliament called upon other business to take advantage of the fact to berate them sometimes in public as reported in this case and to class them amongst the crowd of kings friends or no kings friends i shall later on the house permitting examine into the truth of this statement and if it be true i shall introduce a resolution to ask the committee on the judiciary to examine whether or not there has been upon the part of the executive so grave a breach of the privileges of the house of representatives now mr chairman i have been for several days ill and i am not well now upon yesterday with a view of giving certain ideas of the minority in connection with the presidents last message to the country and to save myself the physical work of making a speech i gave an interview to the press i find judging by the report of it in this mornings post that this interview has been curtailed misemphasized and garbled and otherwise oh well without words of complaint that are useless and to make a long story short it becomes necessary for me this morning to do what i have never done before to read an utterance of my own to wit the real interview to the house i am going to read the interview as i gave it out so that it may the washington post took the liberty to head that interview with this preamble it is understood to be an attempt on the part of the minority to gain considerable credit for legislation of the sort that may be decided upon by the republican leaders before tho close of the session so that the democratic party may gain considerable advantage in the coming national campaign words of criticism from me as to the evident unfairness and anunus of that sort of voluntary and attributed exordium are unnecessary especially in view of the fact that i am informed that the associated press gave an introduction to it which was stricken out by the journal that i hold in my hand and this introduction substituted for it now the interview which i really gave out was this some things in the presidents recent message are so immedi1908 ately important to the interests of the entire country as to pass the bounds of partisanship and to make it excusable at any rate if not to make it necessary that i should say something concerning them with the view of assuring the president himself and reasonably inclined republican members of the house and the country as well of the support and indorsement or opposition of the democratic minority in so far as the things urged by the president are good things i would like the country to know that all he has to do is to deliver twentynine republican house votes in favor of them these conjoined with the solid democratic vote will put them through i was sorry to note in the presidents message the absence of reference to a campaign contribution publicity bill giving names postoffice addresses and amounts of contributions and providing for their publication before the election in past messages however he has urged this and it is therefore well perhaps that i should say that the virtually solid democratic vote will be behind legislation of this sort within constitutional limit the democratic party has ever been a friend of all legitimate demands of labor and has therefore stood for constitutional regulation of child labor not only in the interest of labor generally but in order that the fathers and mothers of the next generation may be physically and mentally fit progenitors of the generation to succeed them i shall ask gentlemien not to applaud because it will take the whole of my time to read this and as i have already announced i would object to unanimous consent for others to extend i could not of course expect that courtesy to me the following quotation from the 4presidents message therefore meets with our hearty approval child labor should be prohibited throughout the nation at least a model childlabor bill should be passed for the district of columbia it is unfortunate that in the one place solely dependent upon congress for its legislation there should be no law whatever to protect children by forbidding or regulating their labor the first sentence requires more particular notice child labor ought to be prohibited throughout the nation but the states are the sole authorities having constitutional power to prohibit it within the states if those who would protect the children of the land and through them the generations to come would waste less of their time and energy in the useless agitation for invalid and unconstitutional federal legislation and would devote more of their time to that purpose in the several states it would be better for all the holding out the hope of some efficient federal legislation merely wastes and dissipates energies of those who are devoted to the cause nothing more absurd than the beveridge childlabor law was ever offered to congress to say that a given product should not pass through interstate commerce because it was manufactured in a factory where children were employed and are permitted by the state law to be employed is a stretch of the interstatecommerce clause of the constitution no less strenuous and no less ridiculous than a law which should say that a divorced man or woman should not travel upon ain interstatecommerce passenger ticket unless the state law under which the divorce had been granted met with the approbation of the federal government but the president is right in saying that we can act for the district of columbia and i will add for the territories as well aild that we ought to do it those who are always complaining of the ineffectiveness of state legislation and imagining that federal legislation is a cureall are singularly rebuked by the spectacle of the condition of legislation not only in the district of columbia but in the territories where congress has almost full legislative power perhaps the worst corporation laws in the union outside of new jersey are in arizona and perhaps the poorest labor laws anywhere are in the district of colunbia i was glad to see in the presidents message the following clause i renew my recommendation for the immediate reenactment of an employers liability law drawn to conform to the recent decision of the supreme court within the limits indicated by the court the law should be made thorough and comprehensive there is no excuse for the delay upon the part of the republican members of the committee on the judiciary in the house of representatives in reporting out an employers liability law their delay at least arouses if it does not justify a suspicion that they are having a lot of useless hearings simply for the purpose of fising that bill as a buffer to prevent the serious consideration of other bills pending before the committee for example the clayton bill to put an end to temporary restraining orders of federal courts granted on mere ex pm rte corporation testimony invalidating state laws and the various bills there pending to recognize the police power of the states in dealing with alcoholic stimulants when introduced into prohibition territory and to use the interstatecommerce power of congress as auxiliary to the enforcement of state policy i have given notice in the house that no legislation shall be enacted by unanimous consent until an employers liability bill is at least reported for the consideration of the house the president can be assured of the absolute support of the unanimous minority in this nmatter the succeeding clause of his message also meets with unanimous democratic approval in addition to a liability law protecting the employees of common carriers the government should show its good faith by enacting a further law giving compensation to its own employees for injury or death incurred in its service it is a reproach to us as a nation that in both federal and state legislation we have afforded less protection to public and private employees than any other industrial country of the world i have had several cases called to my attention where constituents were injured in the service of the government and where no sort of recourse or remedy exists not even where the injury occurred through gross negligence upon the part of the governmental authorities there are very few if any democrats in the house who do not indorse the next quotation which i shall make from the presidents message to wit no temporary restraining order should be issued by any court without notice and the petition for a permanent injunction upon which such temporary restraining order has been issued should be beard by the court issuing the same within a reasonable timesay not to exceed a week or thereabout from the date when the order was issued this is especially applicable to temporary restraining orders setting aside upon a mere ex parte hearing the solemn law of a sovereign state deliberately enacted i have given notice in the house that until congress is given an opportunity to vote upon this proposition no legislation by unanimous consent shall occur i am sorry that the president could not see his way to go one step further and to say that where a constructive contempt of court is committed that is to say a contempt not in the presence of the courtthe party alleged to have committed it shall before being deprived of liberty or property be entitled to a trial by jury of course i take it that nobody will understand the president or me to mean that there should be any limit upon temporary restraining orders when issued for the purpose of preventing immediate and otherwise unavoidable destruction of property or of life or limb when i say property i do not mean judicially construed property rights but property the president says in another part of his message that nothing should be done to legalize a blacklist or boycott that would be illegal at common law so say we all of us but it is a sad commentary upon this utterance of his that while the federal courts have held that a boycott is a combination in restraint of trade and therefore illegal other federal courts have virtually upheld the employer in his assertion of a right to blacklist because one federal court went so far as to say that because the employer had a right to discharge without giving any notice at all that thcrefore he had a right to discharge because the man discharged was a member of a labor union it is a poor rule that does not work both ways another decision of a federal court the decision by judge gould has gone so far as to say that a labor union newspaper should not publish the name of a firm under the heading we do not patronize there ought to have been no quarrel with the decision that the journal had no right to publish the name of an individual or firm under the heading unfair list because the very use of the word unfair might have been in itself slanderous or libelouswas at any rate insulting but that any body of men have not the right to publish a list of the people whom they do not propose to patronize has seemed to me to be going very far the analogy of the decision in the federal court in the case that i have previously referred to might have applied a man has a right to patronize or not to patronize anybody according to his own sweet will and he therefore has the right to publish the names of those that he does not patronize it makes no difference what reason he may give provided the reason given is not insulting slanderous libelous or injurious in its character the next clause from the presidents message to wit i am of the opinion however that one change in the tariff could with advantage be made forthwith ou r forests need every protection and one method of protecting them would be to put upon the free list wood pulp with a corresponding reduction upon paper made from wood pulp whedi they come from any country that does not put an export duty upon them meets with democratic approval exceptthat it does not go quite far enough not only ought wood pulp to be placed upon the free list but print paper ought to be placed there also the publishers and readers will not be very much benefited if wood pulp be placed upon the free list if at the same time there be only a slight reduction of the duty upon print paper both should go there not only in the interest of the preservation of ourforests but in the interests of the cheap dissemination of ideas the world grows and civilizes and refines itself by the dissemination of ideas and every tax upon intelligence is a relic of barbarity i am sorry to see that the president did not follow this up by a recommendation for free works of art as well because these too are refining agencies it being almost as important to cultivate the taste of a people as it is to cultivate the growth of information among them i do not know whether the majority of the democratic party will indorse the presidents utterances in favor of a permanent waterways commission or not i myself have long been of the opinion that we ought to have a board of public works which would include not only the waterways but public buildings congress should make a lumpsum appropriation each year and the waterways and public buildings should be provided for out of that sum by the board of public works thus relieving congress not only of much unnecessary work but of a great deal of logrolling every rivers and harbors bill and every public buildings bill must necessarily carry upon it a few unworthy projects in order to gain the number of votes in the liouse and senate necessary to put it through this country ought to appropriate 50 000 000 a year for waterway improvements and not less than 10 000 000 a year for public buildings and the distribution of this amount ought to be made not for the purpose of strengthening a bill in the house or senate by getting votes for it but in the interest of real economical progress we can spare the money by curtailing military expenses and waste one more clause in the presidents message meets with my unqualified approval it is this numerous bills granting waterpower rights on navigable streams have been introduced none of them give the government the right to make a reasonable charge for the valuable privileges so granted in spite of the fact that these waterpower privileges are equivalent to many thousands of acres of the best coal lands for their production of power nor is any definite time limit set as should always be done in such cases i shall be obliged hereafter in accordance with the policy stated in a recent message to veto any waterpower bill which does not provide for a time limit and for the right of the president or of the secretary concerned to fix and collect such a charge as he may find to be just and reasonable in each case personally i applaud that in a bill concerning the disposal of certain water powers in the state of washington i voted unavailingly in the negative although i thought it right not to interpose an objection to unanimous consent which would have prohibited the fair and full consideration of the measure by the house in that vote and fight against the bill i was joined by a large majority upon the minority side of the house and the bill passed by only a small majority in another case in the last congress i voted and spoke against a bill which was to turn over to a private corporation the right to canalize certain streams in the state of pennsylvania it seemed to me wrong then as it seems to me now to set the precedent of turning over the water routes of the country or any part of them for navigation or for power purposes to private corporations with a right to charge toll thereupon if a work of canalization be sufficiently important to receive federal notice at all on the ground that it is productive of benefit to interstate commerce then it ought to be sufficiently important to secure the doing of the work by the government and its free use by the people there are objectionable things in the presidents message as one might naturally expect considering his education in the line of hamiltonianism and his ingrained tendencies toward federalismthings which can not meet with democratic approval one of them is his idea that the attorneygeneral representing the government should have the right to nominate receivers when a common carrier is thrown into the hands of a receiver that right ought to rest in the court and not in the executive nor in any representative of the executive it is a judicial proceeding and a separation of the executive and judicial powers ought to be preserved the court has the right and the power now to avoid the evil which the president deprecates and any judge who would to use the presidents language appoint as receiver the very man or men the failure of whose policy may have necessitated the creation of the receivership is corrupt or conniving and ought to be impeached that it is sometimes done is no doubt probably true but the right way to correct the evident wrong is to bring public opinion to bear upon the judges who allow themselves thus to be dictated to by manipulators of large concerns who in many cases have so manipulated them as to make the stockholders and the general public both lose money while theythe manipulatorsalone have made it the presidents utterances concerning the antitrust law are an indication of his utter and innate inability to see that which will appear plain to a democratic mind to wit that anything approximating a private monopoly is intolerable and unendurable under a free government his attempt and that of others to classify trusts and monopolies as good trusts and bad trusts is abhorrent there can be no such thing as a good trust there have been good emperors but never a good empire good kings but never yet a good monarchy simply because oneman power whether exerted benevolently or malevolently is contrary to democratic instinct and that instinct is right because even the best of men with too much power grow worse than they were before they were tempted by power so there may sometimes be a good trust magnate who uses his powers benevolently but the power is too much fraught with danger to be vested in one man or a few men no wonder his late message has been welcomed on the wall street curb as a truce in his fight on combinations and that rumors are afloat that large campaign contributions are resulting i am sorry to see that the president did not cut the gordian knot presented by the late decision of the federal court virtually declaring labor unions to be trusts in a perfectly frank way we ought simply to enact a law saying that farmers unions or associations formed for the purpose of improving agricultural methods increasing the quantity of crops decreasing the expenses of marketing them improving the quality of crops and stabilizing the price of agricultural products shall not be construed to fall within the inhibitions of any existing law the debates in both houses at the tinge the antitrust measure was adopted show that this was the clear intention of congress and the court will be exceedingly technical indeed if it subjects them as it has virtually subjected labor unions to the operation of a law that was never intended to cover them the same statement is true as to labor unions labor unions are legalized in great britain and in every other free country and as the presidents own messagethis very oneproves have been legalized here we ought simply to provide that organizations of labor and workingmen for the purpose of securing shorter hours of labor or higher pay or more equitable treatment shall not be construed to fall within the inhibition of any existing law so long as the methods pursued by them are peaceable and orderly there is no danger of monopolistic abuses in connection with farmers unions or labor unions agriculture is the basic industry of the world and progress is very largely measured by comparison of the condition of agriculture from time to time in any given country whose history or condition is being considered from the very nature of the farmers pursuits he can not form a monopolistic association again the progress and civilization of the world depend very largely upon the worlds going on from day to day increasing its output of product per man while shortening its hours of labor and in our free republic especially the success of our democratic experiment very largely depends and must depend upon placing the common people including the workingmen upon a plane of intelligence and refinement which shall render them capable of selfgovernment and this can never occur as long as they are brutalized by hours of labor too long or by rates of pay too low thus leaving them without means of leisure to improve their minds and to refine their souls as sir matthew hale said years ago time may properly be divided into three equal parts eight hours for sleep eight for work and eight for worship edification and amusement our experiment in democratic goyernment will prove a failure and macaulays prophecy be fulfilled when we once reach a condition of very dense settlement all over the country with millions more than we have now of wageworkers unless these workingmen shall work under conditions such that their labor shall not brutalize them and shall not prevent them from rendering themselves sufficiently intelligent as citizens to be sound judges of the public good and not mere envious seekers for class domination every effort to prevent the american workingman from improving his condition and by peaceful association raising himself to a higher plane leaves in control of labor opinion the foreign element of the workingmen who do not comprehend our institutions and that class of our native workingmen as well who are ignorant and illiterate in a word the enemies of all government who strike out with their blind fists against the limitations of comparative poverty during the consideration of the penal code in the house an effort was piade by several democrats to forestall the very construction which has just been placed upon the law by the supreme court it met with united republican opposition no man who loves his country is in favor of permitting laboring men or any other class of men to resort to violence or to take the law into their own hands or to set themselves aside as a ruling class to intimidate legislation or legislators in any way but nevertheless every man who loves the cause of the democratization of the world will solve points of doubt in favor of the weak and the laboring those of us who have never had to labor with our hands and who have been able to give our minds up to improvement of intellect or to aniusement are the very men of all men who ought to be most careful not to permit a feeling of hopelessness and helplessness and blind envy to sink into the hearts of our workingmen the presidents idea of letting the substantive part of the antitrust law remain as it is but giving to some branch of the executive government authority to determine when a trust is a good trust and when it is a bad onein effect to license one and to restrain anotheris so very vicious in its ultimate effects if adopted that it would seem that no friend of a wellordered government could stand for it already we have a law upon the statute books making it tile duty of the bureau of corporations to collect certain evidence concerning corporations and then we have a provision of that law making it discretionary with the president of the united states whether or not the evi dence thus collected shall be published for the use of congress and the people if you add to that and to the arbitrary power now existing in the postoffice department concerning the mailability of newspapers and magazines the further arbitrary power to be lodged in ain executive officer to hold a big stick over all sorts of combinations and trusts to say to one you may operate and to another you shall not operate we shall have made the very longest single stride ever taken in tie history of this country in behalf of the arbitrary government of men as distinguished from the prescribed government of laws what a campaignfund begetter it would be as to the presidents proposition for tariff revision by investigation and consideration at the hands of a commission composed of members of the house and senate and five socalled experts it is both cumbersome and useless aye it is worse than that it would be fraught with necessary evil men who are designated by republicans to be tariff experts are always men who are engaged in certain industries protected under the tariff and they are expert in knowing just what measure of duties it is necessary to have in order to enable them to exploit the conqumers of their product under the shelter of tariff legislation nobody is ever recognized as an expert upon tariff questions except somebody who is interested in maintaining a tariff tax besides that the plan is a reflection upon the intelligence of the house of representatives the very best possible tariff commission is a commission consisting of the representatives of the people selected by the people supposedly in the interest of the people even that body has too many men really and concealedly selected by private interests in the interest of private interests if the republican party can not furnish a ways and means committee with sufficient intelligence to revise the tariff then will it surrender the reins of power to us of the minority and let us see whether we can or not at any rate we are not willing to confess beforehand that we can not the republican slogan has been a revision and here of late since the illinois idea has come into play an adjustment of the tariff by the friends of the tariff in the name of god when will the tariff ever have more friends in legislative halls than right now a good big easily controlled majority in the house of representatives obedient to every nod of the four or five republican leaders a twothirds majority in tile senate and a unainmous and impulsive majority in the white house ought to be sufficient why wait on a commission why not proceed now why wait until after the election why not prove to the people by a bill formulated before the election that the republican party has the wisdom and patriotisin to confront the actual and crying situation can it be that republican leaders here are aware of the fact that any tariff concocted in their committee on ways and means and enacted by their house of representatives if promulgated and made known before the election would be so vicious in its provisions as to lead the people of the united states to thrust the republican party by crop and by neck

the bill but it seems to me there is a disposition on the other side of the aisle to try to play politics on this question you have not much else except the negro left and you want to cling to him in spite of the brownsville affair this discussion has been purposely broadened by the republican members of this house into a general discussion of the negro as a voter with special reference to the policy of the south on that subject it has been so broadened in the hope that the negro vote throughout the land reported to be much dissatisfied with the conduct of the present administration will be not only mollified but solidified under the republican banner it is also doubtless the hope as it is surely the desire of our opponents that some white voters in the north and west principally theorists and uninformed but wellmeaning enthusiasts on this subject may be turned to the republican candidate in the approaching election that such a purpose should be entertained is perhaps only natural that such an effort should be made is only usual whenever the people of this country fully understand the hollowness of these republican protestations and professions the sincerity of that party will be entirely discredited in its very last platformthat of 1904the republican party made this declaration we favor such congressional action as shall determine whether by special discriminations the elective franchise in any state has been unconstitutionally limited and if such is the case we demand that representation in congress and in the electoral college shall be proportionally reduced as directed by the constitution of the united states an emptier weaker more inane pledge was never made in a party platform if any state has unconstitutionally limited the elective franchise such action is invalid and void and the unconstitutional statute must necessarily fall upon such a statute you could not successfully base a proposition to reduce representation in accordance with the provisions of the second section of the fourteenth amendment besides if you were only to act in case special discriminations were made by unconstitutional statutes is not the determination of the constitutional question necessarily a judicial question and not a legislative one what a ridiculous attitude congress would assume if it should undertake to usurp the functions of the judicial branch of the government and declare that the statutes of any state on any question were unconstitutional and yet this was the solemn nay farcical declaration that your chicago platform of 1904 made to the people recognizing as i did that many of the brightest minds and keenest intellects in the country were at the chicago convention and were guiding its proceedings i entertained the suspicion then that has crystallized into certainty nowthat the platform of the republican party on this question was purposely obscure and was designedly muddy i thought then as i think now that it was intended to please the negro delegates from the south and much more important to solidify the negro vote in the doubtful states it was the sirup to catch the flies with nothing more and nothing less now what happened after the convention the election was won by the republicans that party elected its president and elected a large majority of both houses of congress three and a half years have passed during every single second of that time the republican party has had complete power in every branch of the government what has it done to redeem this vague uncertain and indefinite pledge nothing absolutely nothing what congressional action has it taken to determine whether by special discriminations the elective franchise in any state has been unconstitutionally limited none absolutely none what attention has it paid to the demand that representation shall be reduced none absolutely none why can not we be sincere with one another on this great question why do you continue to torment the south on this question do you wish to hold her in terrorism forever simply to be able to shout equal political rights for the negro once every four years so that you may rally a dusky host about your banners in every presidential contest speaking for myself alone but voicing i believe the sentiment of a vast majority of the white men and women of the south i tell you frankly that if we could thereby secure the repeal of the fifteenth amendment and settle the political phase of this negro question forever i believe the south would be willing to part with a part of its representation on this floor and in the electoral college that the generousminded people of the entire union will ever demand such a pound of flesh i do not for a moment believe that they would have a right to do so under the federal constitution i emphatically deny but if i am mistaken about tile temper of the people if i am mistaken about the constitutional question involved if the sacrifice is to be demanded and is to be sanctioned under forms of law then sir i repeat the south had far better make it than to continue forever with this sword of damocles suspended over her head and chained to this body of death let me say further that while the republican party has enacted no legislation on this subject as it never intended to that the judicial door is open to any of the gentlemen here or elsewhere who complain so bitterly about these unconstitutional statutes the states of the south contend with full confidence in the merit of their contention that under the suffrage laws of no one of them has the elective franchise been unconstitutionally limited so far as the courts have passed on these questions in the cases of williams v mississippi of giles v harris alabama and of jones v montague governor virginia it has sustained our contention ind upheld the state statutes that the highest court in tile land is bound to uphold the constitutionality of each of these statutes we firmly believe and confidently assert why then because the gentleman from alabama proposes an amendment that undertakes to deal with a social question all this clamor about the election laws of the south why long inaction in the face of an absurd platform declaration until just before another presidential election the purpose is patent the motives that prompt it are neither fair nor just to a great section of our common country that already has trouble enough sir on this negro question and whose troubles no gentleman on this floor ought to be willing to augment in an effort to seek a

now desire to make as to the state of the country and as to the presidents message which is so broad that it covers almost every subject of national interest and as to the state of the country and certain particular criticisms as to certain parts of that message in the first place i believe that it will now be generally conceded throughout the country that we at least have a panica real widespread republican panic it is an inexcusable panic because cotton corn and wheat have all brought good prices and the agricultural and manufacturing interests of the country have prospered as never before at the very time when this panic came it is a panic caused by tremendous stockgambling operations all over the country and especially in that great center of such operations new york city the fact that this panic stretches out from new york to every part of the country and from the stock gamblers themselves to every class of industrious and honest citizens is a fact for which the republican party is entirely responsible and from which responsibility it may not hope to escape new york would never have been the industrial and financial despot of the republic but for the reservecity provisions in our national banking laws making new york the chief reserve city of the entire country and allowing other national banks in the minor reserve cities in which list of cities are included the principal financial and industrial cities of the republic to keep on deposit in new york onehalf of their cash reserve fund and allowing about 4j per cent of the cash reserve fund of all the other national banks in the country to be kept there the national bankers can by keeping in new york as much of their reserve fund as the law allows obtain either credit or interest from the new york banks and sometimes both this system makes new york the great money center of the republic its financial despot and when new york sneezes we all must take snuff the result is that the suspension of currency payments in new york has occasioned a like suspension of currency payment by the banks throughout the country and the stock gamblers and frenzied financiers in new york have brought financial disaster to every part of our country by being unable or unwilling to turn loose the money that is so essential to the business of the country and which has been banked up there under the provisions of the law to which i have referred this law was enacted and is kept in force by the republican party and the responsibility for it is clearly upon that party now i want to ask this question of my republican friends when you go to the country in the election about to come will you say that it is a roosevelt panic will you say that it is a roosevelt panic because mr roosevelt has been democratic in spots to use the words of a much more distinguished democrat than myself or do you propose to stand by him and say as you have been shouting and vociferating for the past four years that the republican party as well as mr roosevelt is responsible for what has been done republican financiers in new york city and throughout the country and republican newspapers in new york and in other states are now assuming the safe sane and conservative pose they are now saying that mr roosevelts trust baiting more deadly than either his bear baiting or his wolf hunting has caused the panic they are saying that persecution of the railroads and the demagogic arraying of the people against property interests are responsible for impaired confidence and the resulting financial troubles only the other day the distinguished gentleman who so eloqubntly nominated the president at your last national convention referred to him as the man on the barrel exhorting the crowd to madness and almost to mob law and the great republican newspapers in new york printed in parallel columns the eloquent words of exgovernor black at the republican convention in 1904 and the scorching words of the same distinguished gentleman before the new hampshire bar association in 1907 now so far as i may venture to speak for the democratic party i wish to say that we do not believe that mr roosevelt is responsible for this panic we do not believe that even his socalled trust baiting has caused it we do not believe that his prosecution of the trusts has been wrong we do not believe that the requirement that the railroads shall charge the public only just and reasonable rates is a mistake if these policies have exposed overcapitalization if they have wrung the water out of certain stocks and securities that have been foisted on an unsuspecting public if they have bared robbery if they have put an end to or even lessened discriminatory dealings and unjust charges then we ought to be glad to submit to any little temporary flurry which has resulted from the turning on of the light to use substantially the presidents own figure of speech i submit that if there is a cancer in the body politic then the knife of the surgeon must be fearlessly applied in order to save the life of the patient even if the operation is painful it is far better to submit to the pain of the operation in order that a sound condition may be restored than to await certain death that would come from the disease if the operation were not performed socalled prosperity is not so dear that we are willifig to purchase it at the price of supine and unmanly submission to extortion and injustice if railroad securities are so delicate and sensitive that they can be blighted and withered because the railroads are required to do simple justice to the public then the sooner these securities are pruned to a proper size and shape the better for the public the democratic party does not advocate and has never advocated injustice to railroads or to any other corporation but it has never submitted to and will never submit to injustices from the railroads or other corporations to the public even if the failure to so submit will cause not one but many panics but it is my desire to show you and the country how proud some of the most prominent republicans in congress have been for a long time past of these very policies that the president has advocated and which these safe sound and conservative newspapers in the north and in the west in the east and in the south are saying has wrecked business ruined industrial conditions and brought on a distressing panic on june 26 1906 my eloquent and able friend from michigan made a speech on the floor of this house that was so forceful and so eloquent that the republican congressional campaign committee thought it worthy of preservation and embalmed it in your last republican textbook for the congressional capaign of 1900 and by the way there are some very interesting things in that book i see from the back of it that you can buy it somewhere in new york city either on broadway or on wall street broadway i believe but pretty near wall street you can buy it for one dollar and i tell you it is worth the moneynot as a source of information for i think it is largely a mass of misinformation but is a compilation of republican admission and confessions and of a whole lot of things that are going to risd up and hit the republican party in the face whenever it becomes once more thoroughly safe sane and conservative and nominates some conservative reactionary for president but to return to mr townsends speech he said the sherman antitrust law a republican measure has been enforced by a republican executive until illegal combinations are in great fear and trembling while some of their constituents are either on the road to the penitentiary or hiding from the officers of justice under the leadership of an incorruptible fearless and patriotic president supported by an equally patriotic congress a campaign has been made against fraud and corruption in what hitherto has been called high places which has given hope and courage to honest men and placed the crown of honor where it belongs upon the brow of true american manhood but the distinguished gentleman from michigan is not the only authority that i wish to cite in this connection let me call your attention to the remarks of the gentleman from indiana made on this floor on the very day following the speech of the gentleman from michigan on june 27 1906 this speech was also considered worthy of the embalming process and is likewise to be found in the last republican textbook the gentleman from indiana with that exuberance and eloquence for which heis so justly famous gave a long list of the naughty trusts that have been brought to the bar of justice by this great republican president he spoke of the paper trust of the tobacco trust the drug trust and the elevator trust i did not know that there was one of that character until i heard his speech of the coal trust and of a host of other wicked trusts a brief summary of which required nine pages of eloquence so numerous and so naughty were they why he then mentioned the nome retailgrocery trust in faraway alaska on that subject he said the governments prosecution of the trusts has extended even to faraway alaska complaint was made that there was a combination known as the nome retail grocers association which had fixed prices and suppressed competition the government took action won a decree in its favor against the combination and the attorneygeneral is advised that the effect has been very salutary but let me say without any invidious comparison that i am about now to quote from a gentleman who is still more distinguished as an exponent of republican policies i refer to no less a person than the distinguished speaker of this house who returning to the bosom of the people who sent him here made on august 16 1906 an able and eloquent speech to his own constituents explaining what congress had done and what the state of the country was on the subject trust baiting the speaker said lie has been particularly zealous in administering the law against the trusts and combinations of capital which have ignored the old adage of live and let live the beef trust the paper trust the tobacco trust the drug trust the coal combinations and various combinations of railroads and shippers have felt the heavy hand of the law and learned that it is strong enough to compel them to give all a square deal the record of trust prosecutions and investigations into their practices is too long to here recite but it is acknowledged to be the most creditable even by our political opponents not only that gentlemen but you have been boasting for several years past of the railroad rate legislation you have said that the republican party is responsible for it assumed the credit and claimed the glory of it the gentleman from michigan boasts of it the gentleman from indiana is also proud of it and the speaker of this house commends it each of them so expressed himself in the speeches to which i have already referred not only that but your great leaders have spoken of president roosevelt in terms of such unstinted admiration of such broad and comprehensive commendation and of such fulsome adulation that the adjectives of a vocabulary no richer than mine would stand aghast at the task of repeating what you have said on this subject the gentleman from michigan in the speech to which i have referred said theodore roosevelt president of the united states needs no encomium from me he has already written his name high upon that illustrious roll of fame along with those of washington and lincoln washington established the republic lincoln preserved it roosevelt has dedicated it anew to the cause of justice and equality the first two escaped not the calumniator and detractor no man who has been strong and courageous for the right ever did but the people they who make republics have crowned him benefactor some there have been who have sought to belittle our great president and have been audacious enough to attack him but they only bear scars and 80 000 000 american people have awarded him the victory he at times may have been impulsive but the impulse was born of love for the people he has been strenuous but the exigencies of the times have demanded it and it has been the strenuosity of public service he has done things and who is there so reckless as to rise here or elsewhere and condemn what he has accomplished by his fruits ye shall know him the gentleman from indiana paid the president the exceedingly valuable compliment in his speech of making no reference whatever to the paul morton incident hear also the distinguished and lovable speaker of the house break into eloquent eulogy of the president in his address to his constituents he says in the executive departments of the government the record of the arty has been brilliant courageous and honest and the name of roosevelt has become a synonym for all those qualities throughout the realms of civilization he has been the president of all the people and lie has been tireless in his efforts to serve the people by wise just and fearless administration of the law it seems to me that the republican party and particularly most of its members in congress is thoroughly committed to roosevelt and rooseveltism i believe that it would be a difficult task for them to go to the country with the contention that we have had a roosevelt panic and yet how are they to admit that this is a republican panic since the most effective campaign argument that they have ever made is the false charge that the democratic party was responsible for the last great panic that we had and the contention that no party under whose administration a panic occurred ought to be trusted by the people with power what becomes of them in the next election if the people should determine to apply the oldtime yardstick to them the only safety for the leading lights of the republican party in congress at least unless they are prepared to do a lot of humblepie eating is to nominate the secretary of war who at least has the manhood not to eat his own words and chew up his own record because hard times have come a large and evergrowing number of people in this country believe that there ought to be a revision of the tariff many of the republicans even believe so now when shall we have tariff revision now i am going to cite you two authorities on that subject and neither of them is democratic authority one of them is that gentleman whose name is on every lip and was once first in every republican heart i do not know whether this is still true since the panic came i refer to the president of the united states mr roosevelt says that we otight to have tariff revision after the presidential election if tariff revision is a good thing if certain of the schedules need altering why wait until after the election if the people are suffering from wrongs and injustices wny postpone relief surely it is no sufficient answer to say that to give relief from wrongs and injustices may bring on business disturbances the president himself contends that this is no good answer as far as the trusts and the railroads are concerned let me inquire in all sincerity and candor why the same doctrine does not hold good when it comes to giving relief fron an unjust tariff but i promised to quote from another distinguished republican authority on the subject as to when we ought to have tariff revision that authority is a republican statesman hardly less distinguished than the president himself who is no less a person than the speaker of this house who in the same speech to his constituents to which i have already referred said we ought to have tariff revision when we no longer had prosperity on that subject the speaker said tariff revision in time of prosperity always has halted and will always halt business activity production and commerce the manufacturer will lessen his output for he fears to pile up his product unless there is reasonable certainty of realizing its cost and a fair {rofit the farmer halts in making improvements and consumes less ecause there is a shortened demand for his products the decrease in the wages of labor alone pending revision would amount to many hundred million dollars where there is confidence and prosperity without precedent there would be doubt and destruction of confidence i heartily indorse the platform lately adopted by the republicans of indiana which in substance says that the republican party will revise the tariff when it will do more good than harm to the masses of the people the latter part of this utterance smacks of some delphic oracle when the speaker says that the republican party will revise the tariff when it will do more good than harm to the majority of the people it is my judgment that if the speaker is left to decide when the time shall arrive we might possibly hope to see it twentyfour hours in advance of judgment day still after all the proposition of the speaker was that the tariff ought to be revised when hard times came and i think it would be a good thing for the country if we could act in accordance with the cannon doctrine instead of the roosevelt doctrine and revise the tariff now when we no longer have the prosperity of which our friends have been so long boasting under the cannon doctrine what better time for revision than the present could be selected now let me call your attention to one specific reason why the tariff ought to be revised at once it is an undoubted and undeniable fact that many large american manufacturers are selling enormous quantities of their products very much cheaper abroad than they are at home two years ago the gentleman from pennsylvania said on this floor that only 3 per cent of the steel output for instance was sold to the export trade at a lower price than it was sold at home there was considerable debate on this floor as to whether american manufacturers were selling cheaper abroad than at home the gentleman from iowa as i remember it took one horn of the dilenmma and denied the allegation that there was a difference in the two prices the gentleman from pennsylvania took the other horn of the dilemma he confessed and avoided he said that it was a good thing because otherwise american labor would have been out of employment he said there was very little of it anyhow and that it was necessary in order to keep american labor from going home to a hungry and foodless family in support of his contention lie cited the testimony of judge e h gary chairman of thb board of directors of the united states steel corporation delivered before the committee on merchant marine and fisheries on april 11 1906 i invite the attention of the house and of the country to this colloquy between judge gary and mr spiaht of mississippi a member of that committee i would like to ask this questionsaid representative splohtihlas your company ever delfvered your product in foreign yards at a cheaper rate than you sell to the domestic customers at your mills the united states steel corporation is not an operating companyreplied judge garybut i suppose you refer to our subsidiary companies i have already stated that we have sold some of our products for export at certain prices but those prices were f o b the mill and we have never delivered our products abroad for less than the cost to the domestic consumer at our mill now in opposition to that statement of judge gary i desire to invite the attention of the gentleman from pennsylvania to an article from the new york commercial oil january 2 1908 this paper is considered to be one of the greatest commercial papers in the country and its utterances are generally accepted as high authority on matters industrial commercial and financial in the course of the article to which i refer and which i shall read a citation is made from the industrial world an iron and steel publication of pittsburg pa which is not suspected of having any democratic tendencies the article reads as follows independent makers of tin plate and sheets are complaining over a report that the united states steel corporation has sold to welsh tin plate makers 100 000 tons of sheet bars at 10 a ton cheaper than they are quoting to manufacturers in the united states incidentally the manufacturers of tin plate and sheets are chafing because they are unable to get steel bars at a price in keeping with prevailing conditions advocates of lower duties are using the recent sale as an argument against the high tariff which enables the united states steel corporation to hold up the american steel makers for 29 a ton while the same product is laid down at swansea for 21 08 the cost of transportation to wales is about 4 10 per ton so that the actual price received f o b pittsburg is 17 80 against 29 quoted to the consunlers in the pittsburg district the industrial world an iron and steel publication in this city which was founded for the purpose of maintaining the high tariff in an editorial condemning the transaction says viewed from any conceivable standpoint these transactions deserve the severest condemnation what does most to discredit the protective tariff system what does most to unsettle the confidence of american consumers in the maintenance of the prices on all steel products what does most to expose the sham in the claims made as to costs of iron and steel production what does most to show that international price and agreements are likely to become universal is the dumping of steel in foreign markets at prices enormously lower than the domestic rates nothing can do more to discredit the protective tariff system than such operations the tariff on such material is high yet it is only 6 70 did the steel corporation tie the foreign powers up tight and did not the latter know that if they resold their shipments would be stopped very promptly they could ship these bars to the united states at a profit after paying transportation charges the cheap plea of keeping mills going and employing labor through these exports is an insult to the intelligence of the american public how much more employment would be created if the domestic prices were reduced to half as much surely the gentleman from pennsylvania will not contend that either one of these newspapers have manufactured statemeiats in order to help the democrats or to hurt the republicans i do not believe that he will or can dispute the facts stated in that article whelno i will not say thieves but high protectionists fall out then honest men may hope to get their dues the gentleman from pennsylvania said on the floor of this house two years ago that we had to sell to the export trade at a smaller price in order to keep american labor employed"], [0.0322880744934082, 0.9677119255065918, 1, "sir that letter tells the story and the whole story and shows how futile it

beyond all dispute that the consumers pay the taxes ultimately all the burdens of protective taxation fall upon the consumers of the country protection for protections sake is a system of indirect taxation which robs the many for the benefit of the few no party that stands for the best interests of all the people can support it especially where it fosters trusts shelters monopolies and saddles

dingley law but they do not tell us whether they will revise the schedules up or downwhether they will make the taxes more or less they may if they are continued in power revise the tariff taxes at some future time but if they do i am satisfied they will make the taxes higher instead of lower and legislate for monopoly instead of man the democratic party stands for a fair just and equitable revenue system a tariff for revenue that will support the government economically administered with ejual justice to all and favoritism to none having a jealous care for our farmers and our toilers the democratic party does not believe in free trade any more than it believes in protection for the sake of protection free trade is a scarecrowa bugaboo free trade at the present time and for generations to come is an absolute impossibility there is not a civilized country in the world today that is a freetrade country all the nations of the earth raise most of their revenue from a tax on imports we must do the same but we do not believe in taxing the necessaries of life and exempting the luxuries of life on the contrary those articles the least needed by all the people should pay the highest tax and those most needed by all the people should pay the least tax the republicans contend when we demand a revision of these unjust tariff discriminations in taxation that it is all in the interest of labor that this exorbitant protection is for the benefit of the wageearner but every intelligent man in the country knows the absurdity of the proposition labor comes in free labor receives no protection tariff taxation has nothing to do with the price of labor capital buys labor as cheaply as it can wages are regulated by the inexorable law of supply and demand whenever you find two employers looking for one workman wages will be high and whenever you find two workmen looking for one employer wages will be low when the demand is greater than the supply wages go up and when the supply is greater than the demand wages go down tariff taxes and import duties have nothing to do with it in all prosperous communities labor is sought for not turned aside sifr the democratic party favors tariff reform in the interest of the consumers of the country and for the benefit of the toilers of the land it is in favor of reducing the tariff taxes wherever they foster trusts or shelter monopoly it would reduce the tariff taxes on all goods wares and merchandise manufactured in this country and sold cheaper abroad than at home it would revise the dingley tariff schedules in a business way in the interest of all the people the dingley tariff law violates every principle of democracy it is the highest protection measure ever written on our statute books it is a law for protection for the sake of protection and not for the sake of revenue most of the dingley tariff schedules are entirely too high and in the interest of monopoly the dingley tax laws violate the cardinal principle of jefferson equal rights to all special privileges to none they burden beyond the calculation of the human intellect the struggling people of our country they foster monopoly and make a few rich men a little more prosperous they take fromthose least able to pay and give to those most able to pay most of the dingley tariff schedules are for the rich and against the poorfor the few and against the many these highprotection tariff schedules that foster trusts and shelter monopoly should be revised not by their friendsthe republicans but by those who would see to it that

great properties of arousing public sentiment everywhere to war on them national and state of tying up and depressing their securities of affecting the whole great transportation business of the country producing this panic now i am one of those who cheerfully voted for the control of the railroads i believe it is democratic legislation and i would not stop in its support because our distinguished friend in the white house became democratic on that subject and took our three national platforms and recommended their adoption in a republican ilouse nor do i fall out with my distinguished republican friends because they suddenly became democratic in their desire to serve the people in this matter but frankness forces me to admit that there is a measure of truth in senator forakers contention it was unavoidably true that the attempt to regulate railroads in their rates was to affect the price of their securities and especially those that had been boosted to a speculative value and those held in europe but that does not concern me however because if the legislation was just and i believe it was it ought to have been enacted no matter if the effect was unavoidably to hurt the owners of property that had been mismanaged but i think that was not a very great cause operating in this panic as a matter of fact of itself it would not have amounted to a ripple on the great financial shore two other distinguished republicans have put that issue more broadly exgovernor frank black who by the way nominated president roosevelt at the last republican national convention has recently said in effect that this panic was produced by the man on the barrel and chancellor day another distinguished gentleman has likewise said in substance that this panic was the legitimate result of the roosevelt raid on prosperity and attack on anybody that had any capital or that was trying to do any business i do not think myself there is so much in that i am sure there is nothing in it in so far as president roosevelt has been democratic in his policy i am not so sure but what there is something in it in some policies he has advocated which are undemocratic unrepublican and unamerican president roosevelt has advocated the control by the federal government of all corporations engaged in interstate business seventyfive per cent of the business in this country is done by corporations in interstate business doubtless it was true that the holders of these great securities as great and greater authorities say than the total securities of all the railroads in the united states became alarmed they feared that roosevelts success in regulating the railroads might be speedily followed by his success with federal regulation of all corporations doing interstate business that doubtless had the effect to depress the industrial securities and to cooperate for the depression of the railroad securities and to some extent in precipitating the panic if so no democrat can be held responsible for that policy was never written in the democratic platform and in my judgment never will be i do not care to discuss it further than to say that it is centralization gone to seed not only that but president roosevelt has recommended a graduated income tax the democratic party has declared for an income tax it did pass such a law the democratic party is now for an income tax but i hope it never will be foolish enough to declare for a graduated income tax which is an unjust unfair undemocratic and unamerican as a graduated ad valorem state tax on land would be it means an increase of burden upon every man who has ability enough to increase his income it violates all democratic taxation principles and is confiscatory not only that but mr roosevelt has recommended a federal inheritance tax that has never been declared for in any national democratic platform and i trust it never will be not because the tax is not a fair one but because it is a matter that ought to be handled alone by the states it rests on such distinct grounds as pertain in my judgment alone to the powers of the states with reference to the holding and final distribution of property and the protection of property rights an inheritance tax if one is enacted following the logical situation ought only to be by state enactment the federal government has nothing to do with property and its descent and distribution and has no business to go into that subject to derive federal revenue from it the late president mckinley was rapidly producing an era of good feeling between the sections and among the classes and undoubtedly was generally popular and especially so among the capitalistic classes the late senator marcus a hanna was still stronger with these classes and was as close to the president as any man living the fact that immediately after the death of president mckinley president roosevelt proclaimed his purpose to follow in the footsteps of his illustrious predecessor predisposed this class toward president roosevelt the fact that president roosevelt began soon thereafter to proceed upon utterly distinct and new lines which were not approved by these classes tended gradually to bring them into antagonism with him and his success before the people and in congress produced more and more alarm and disquiet in the centers of industry and finance which has grown intense down to date i am not discussing the wisdom of his course i am stating the fact as tending to produce a condition cooperative with other matters which tended to precipitate the panic and to make it worse when it came again it is a mistake to assume that all republicans believe in the extension of federal powers at the expense of the powers of the states and large capital becomes easily suspicious along this line it is my judgment whatever else may be said of president roosevelt that he is of all the presidents in the history of the republic the centralizationist of our history and that by word act and deed he has done more to magnify the presidential office unduly and to extend the federal power than any president the country has ever had and hence is in fact further from fundamental democracy than any president the country has had well i shall not get more partisan than that i wish simply to mention briefly those things which in my judgment have mingled with the real causes of this panic and let the blame fall where it may i shall be true to myself and my subject as i see it another man says that the bulk of this panic was caused by wall street speculation there is much in this in my judgment but i am not willing to lay all the blame on the back of wall street i do not think all the speculators and all the gamblers in the country live in the city of new york there are perhaps more of them there and they are bigger ones and worse ones in power and effect but i see no difference in principle in speculation in texas and speculation in new york another one says it was the hoarding of money on the part of the people i think there is less in that than in anything i have heard assigned as a cause for the panic that was an incident to the condition not a cause if the causes had not operated there would have been no hoarding and there you are another one says it was holding crops for market in the south and west i live there and i love those people down there but i am not going to be a demagogue about it frankly i think that had some slight effect in the matter because to withhold the crops from market beyond the normal period of marketing had the effect to lessen the draft in our favor on european gold and to tighten the demand locally among us for money and that had some effect in the general relation of thingsnot a very great one in my judgment nor do i think it is one that ought to be condemned for if a man owns anything that is the product of his brain or body or both he has a right to hold it if he can until he gets what he think it is worth before he turns it loose another one says that the cause was individual municipal state and national extravagance i think there is something in that i think the individuals in this country the municipalities the states and the federal government have been going at a terrific pace in expenditure for the last ten years i think it is tie to slow down all along the line but i think that was rather an incident than a cause of the condition which really produced this panic another one says it was governmental favoritism by the republican party i would like if i could to avoid any partisan reference in this matter but candor to my subject and fairness to myself compels me to say i think there is much in that i think the centralization policy of the tariff that the policy of centralizing wealth by favoritism generally tends always to aid the production of a panic and to make it worse when the conditions produce it undoubtedly the administration of the government itself by the republican party has contributed much to the production of this panic and to its magnitude as well i call to mind the fact that you have administered the government so as to tax wealth out of the pockets of the people and to accumulate in the treasury a surplus of about 250 000 000 thus contracting yourself the circulation of the money and then pursuing the policy of loaning this out for nothing in the aid of wall street mainly and this method being known it tended to sustain a speculative period and therefore to make the crash worse when it came the government ought to be economically administered so as to make the revenues and the expenditures closely tally since the taxes are taken up generally and hence annually the circulation contracted i wish justhere to specifically condemn no matter what administration follows it the practice of accumulating a big surplus in the treasury as well as that of loaning it out without interest and of course since we are human as well as partisan to our bank favorites i think it is true that for a series of years wealth has been taxed out of the pockets of the masses and into the pockets of the classes and that class legislation has given the classes the power to concentrate wealth in a large degree these classes are massed about the great financial centers and cooperate with and in many cases are stock gamblers and hence when trouble comes it comes swiftly and with more deadly effect than it would if the wealth of the people had been evenly distributed under wise and beneficent laws such as i hope to see enacted when the democratic party comes into power but it is my candid judgment that not any of these causes nor all of them combined would have produced this panic except for other things i believe two things were mainly responsible for the present panic before i name them and elucidate that i want to size it up in a breath in a homely sort of way when i say that for ten or eleven years this country has been on a protracted prosperity spree and it has got to sober up that is the whole story all these other causes were more or less cooperative but minor causes the major causes were these two things let us 16ok back a little fifteen years ago we were a debtor country nearly all of our securities were held abroad if you wanted to build a railroad you had to finance it in europe and if you wanted to go into any great industrial undertaking you had largely to do the same thing and mortgages of foreign loan companies were plastered all over the soil from maine to texas two things began to happen and they happened rapidly and continuously first our exports began to run up in excess over our imports beginning in 1896 down to late the balance of trade in our favor has been in round numbers four billions of dollars the american wheat raiser the american cotton raiserfor cotton is still king and will remain so for an hundred yearsthe cattle producers got out their products into the markets of europe more and more year by year those were the three main articles that make up this great balance of trade as reports from bureaus of your own departments will show what was the effect of that it rapidly changed us from a debtor to a creditor nation brought increased capacity to buy everywhere opened up more farms and more ranches and that stimulated all the avenues of trade increased the foreign trade operated to produce prosperity in the natural godgiven way it must be produced for i want to say to you that i have contempt for the idea of producing permanent and universal prosperity by law i believe that prosperity is a hybrid that it is a product of the blessing of god in soil and season and the industry and intelligence of mankind combined that is what makes america great cooperating with that there were sudden discoveries of gold and cheaper processes of mining and there began to pour in a flood of money that increase went into our circulation we have added in ten years more than a billion dollars to our money in this country every dollar good every dollar equal in purchasing as well as debtpaying power with every other dollar that process has been going on annually the last fiscai year we added in gold alone the amount of 125 000 000 to the circulation of our country an increase of more than 75 per capita based upon the increase in the population to give the figures accurately from this last report of the comptroller of the currency we had in 1896 a gold circulation of 8 we have now a gold circulation of 17 what did this all 4nean why it meant an era of rising prices everywhere why because it is an eternal immutable truth that value is the creature of relation when you measure in dollars that are good it is an axiom that as you increase the dollars you increase the relation and increase the price there is no escape fron it we have had an era of rising prices everything has been going upstocks bonds lands everything from goats to goobers have been going up for ten years in this country what is the result of that why every man who had any sense went plunging he felt thlt it was a period in which he could get rich quick he could afford to buy anything if he got it at a fair value now and that next year it was a cinch it would be worth more and we went on investing all the money we could get hold of and strained our credit to the limit confidence was universal the country was prosperous every mans credit was better than he ever knew it to be in all his life before and all men everywhere rushed into business indiscriminatelt looking to the woinb of futurity to wring out profits for him the bears went permanently into winter quarters the bull was rampart everywherein the stock market in the produce market in the grain market in the cotton market in the realestate market in the vegetable market everywhere the bull was getting in his work and our republican friends with all the political tricks they were capable of and led by the matchless businessvote catcher marcus a hanna began whooping this thing for all it was worth they were going out on every stump and they were preaching prosperity follows the flag of republican victory nocalamity can afflict the american people so long as the government is in the hands of the republicans you took advantage of a calamity under the last democratic administration which was more attributable to harrisons administration or the conditions rather which existed under harrisons administration than to the conditions under cleveland and you went out into the country and you said why you did this and that just look what has happened and you got a great many cotton raisers to believe that somehow there was kind of a relation between 5cent cotton and the party in power at washington you corrupted the current of public thought you preached the utterly foolish doctrine that legislation and administrative policies can produce and preserve universal and permanent prosperity and at a time when every mothers son of you who claimed that could not but admit to yourselves that you fooled the people and yourselves too there was nothing in it there never was anything in it and if people expect to be permantely and universally prosperous they must recognize the fundamental truth that all relations of life are interdependent and that upon the cooperation of honor genius industry and economy all combined working upon the natural great resources of our country depends really the prosperity and the success of the american people i often have sat here in my seat and thought of two years ago when my bright and smiling friend the genial gentleman from indiana and the courtly little gentleman from pennsylvania and the rugged vigorous intellect from iowa preached to this house the doctrine that the republican party had produced prosperity in this country and that all that imperiled it was the possible success of the democratic arty my friend mr landis said that you would find all over indiana signposts everywhere all kinds of work for all kinds of men and i wondered whether the signs had been taken down lately or not you gentlemen have corrupted as i said a while ago the chamels of public thought by preaching this kind of paternalistic idea that government is the daddy of all the people and flings out its blessings in bunches all around quit it let us be honest in the face of this great national crisis we are willing to help you by standing by the truth now as we stood by it then we will not charge you with having been wholly responsible for this panic we will tell the real causes now you have got an opportunity to get straight and get back on the road to truth and right it is time to make a confession under all these conditions the whole people became drunk with the wine of prosperity they inflated values and credits far beyond actual relations to which they must in fact conform if the financial and industrial health of the country is to be perfect thoughtful men began to realize that we were floating on the dangerous sea of inflation stocks and bonds the first things perhaps to respond to such a condition began to waver in upward tendency and then to come down then the bears came out of their winter quarters and proceeded in every artful way by every device of which they are masters to further depress the prices by intensifying the scare which existed the bull bauks and the bear banks were drawn into the struggle as their interests and connections prompted alarm grew apace banking antagonisms intensified the fright wandered into the homes of the depositors the demand for money suddenly became general and clamorous wall street ran to the treasuryits favorite resort when it wants something for nothingand got what it could but it was not enough and then in selfdefense wall street enacted a law of its own and buiwarked itself behind it and 1refused to pay out except under a daily limit of an insignificant amount and then the soberup process wans on everywhere and the panic was an accomplished fact well naturally the question suggests itself what do you want done nothing that is plain english you tell me that you can legislate values and credits in this country you tell me that you can legislate public confidence into values and credits which is but another form of stating the same proposition you tell me that to inflate the currency would benefit this situation not on your life that would only make it worse you uight just as well talk and with just as much reason of legislating a drunken man sober as to legislatively cure this condition it has got to work itself out there has got to be a readjustment of values and credits there has got to be a wider recognition of what honest and conservative banking means and the bankers are learning a sore lesson in these days they are learning that this speculation with deposits and this plunging into various side issues with their bank and involving its capital will not do there is no other way to face this situation there is no use in playing deniagogue about it i am tired to death of this constant cry when anything happens in the country from an earthquake to a failure of the peanut crop to run to congress and the legislatures in order to do something for the people we have got american dementia not on the question of love but we have got it oin the question of law the republican party is largely responsible for it it is time to tell the american people the truth it is time to say frankly that this condition is beyond legislative present relief you ask me whether i am in favor of issuing more money and i tell you no we are pouring 100 000 000 of gold now into circulation annually we have now more money per capita than any nation in the world except france and we have more gold per capita than france has we do not need it the last report of the comptroller of the

ther fact that we are adding more than a hundred millions in gold to our circulation annually that we do not at this time need any permanent addition to our money volume what we need is a wide recognition of the necessity for sobering up as quickly as possible and getting busy about it that is all now do you think anything ought to be done hereafter yes i think so that is one of the reasons why i am pressing my banking and currency bill i think it may be possible to devise some safe and wise emergency currency system which will lessen the force and effect of these recurrent periods of inflation when they come as come they will you need not be in a hurry about it however it may be ten years before another one comes the presidential election will be over to a dead moral certainty before another one comes you need not worry about that i think this one will last until after the presidential election i hope it will not last any longer but i can tell you more easily what i do not want and why i do not want it than i can tell you what i do want and why i do want it i have somewhat decided views as to some things that are pending that i do not want and i desire to mention them and tell why i do not want them one of the first of these is the fowler bill now it may be possible in a series of future years that some such plan as this distinguished and able man proposes mty finally be arrived at but i will tell you now if he expects the american congress and the american people to adopt a bill so radical in all of its provisions changing all existing systems from top to bottom lie is absolutely hugging a delusion to his bosom the interests are too vast the public tension is too suspicious and acute the situation is such that if we ever come to any such system as he proposes it must 1 e through a series of years by careful steps each tested by the light of experience the main and serious objection to his bill is that it is too sweeping too drastic too infinite too great in its effects to be considered for a moment then there is the aldrich bill i need not discuss it in detail because i presume all of the members are thoroughly familiar with its provisions it proposes in brief to issue 500 000 000 of currency upon the security of state municipal and railroad bonds i do not care to discuss the railroad feature because you could cut that out and i would be against it as i was before i am not going to be led into the bushes on that i am opposed to any sort or any form of such bond currency it will not do for several reasons in the first place these state and county bonds inevitably drift into the hands of a few owners of large capital and that sort of emergency currency must simply mean a bondholders currency it puts in the hands of a few men the power to contract or inflate our currency at will this will do no good to the money centers it will do no good to the agricultural and mining sections but do infinite hurt in fright and scare and uncertainty and unrest all the time to the whole country it is no advantage to the country you say that it will increase the price of those state and municipal bonds doubtless that is true but that only makes a bad matter worse for two reasons in the first place it is bad enough for the federal government to have a banking system based on boosting its national bonds to have another class o currency called eniergency currency based on boosting the bonds of the states and municipalities is a governmental procedure which i can not at all indorse"], [0.037447452545166016, 0.962552547454834,

is given of a motion for an injunction out of a circuit or district court the party or person sought to be enjoined shall have at least five days notice thereof which said notice shall be in writing and shall state the time and place and the court or judge thereof before whom said motion will be made snless the court or judge thereof shall be of the opinion that irreparable injury will result from delay which fact must be made to appear from the affidavits of not less than three responsible persons and said order can only be granted upon the condition that the party seeking the order gives security therefor to the approval of the court sec 2 that section 725 be amended to read as follows sec 725 that the said courts shall have the power to impose and administer all necessary oaths and to punish by fine or imprisonment at the discretion of the court contempts of their authority as herein provided that contempts committed during the sitting of the court or of the judge of chambers in its or his presence or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice are direct contempts and such power to punish direct contempts therein shall not be construed to extend to any cases except the misbehavior of any person in their presence or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice including the misbehavior of any officers of said court in their oficil transactions and direct contempts may be punished summarily without a written accusation against the person arraigned but if the court shall adjudge him guilty thereof a judgment shall be entered of record in which shall be specified the conduct constituting such contempt with a statement of whatever defense or extenuation time accused offered thereto and the sentence of the court thereon all other contempts are indirect contempts that upon the return of an officer on process or affidavits duly filed by the party seeking the injunction showing any person guilty of indirect contempt a writ of attachment or other lawful process may issue and such person be arrested and brought before the court and thereupon a written accusation setting forth succinctly and clearly the facts alleged to constitute such indirect contempt shall be filed by the party seeking the injunction and the accused shall be required to answer the same by an order which shall fix the time t0erefor and also the time and place for hearing the matter and the court may on proper showing extend the time so as to give the accused a reasonable opportunity to purge himself of such contempt but pending the trial and until the final trial and termination of the case the accused shall be admitted to bail in such sum as the court may direct after the answer of the accused or if ie refuse to answer the court shall proceed at the time so fixed to hear and determine such accusation upon such testimony as shall be produced if the accused answer tie trial shall proceed upon the testimony as in criminal cases and the accused shall be entitled to be confronted with the witnesses against him but such trial shall be by the court or upon applicatiod of the accused a trial by jury sball be haid as in any criminal case if the accused be found guilty judgment shall be entered accordingly prescribing the punishment that the testimony taken on the trial of any accusation of indirect contempt may be preserved by bill of exceptions and any judgment of conviction thferefor may be reviewed upon direct appeal to or by writ of error from the supreme court and affirmed reversed or modified as justice may require i have introduced the above bill knowing that it will not be enacted into law at this session of congress but with the hope of keeping the question alive to the end that it or a similar bill may be enacted into law by the sixtyfirst coingress in presenting my irgument ulln the question of amendlug the law as it now exists and in behalf of the measure which i have introduced i will present it as free from politics as possible and upon broad grounds free from class or bias the question i desire to discuss is the question of trial by jury in contempt cases and the constitutional power of congress to limit the granting of injunctions and in presenting it i shall refrain from abuse or criticism ofthe courts confining myself to the exigencies of the occasion dealing with the law as i find it and urging such legislation as i deem expedient to remedy the existing evil if there be any emanating from the law and the practice in cases of this kind now section 718 of the revised statutes of the united states provides that whenever notice is given of a motion for an injunction out of a circuit or district court the court or judge thercof may if there appears to be danger of irreparable injury from delay grant an order restraining the act sought to be enjoined until the decision upon the motion and such order may be granted with or without security in the discretion of the court section 725 of the same statutes provides thatthe said courts shall have power to impose and administer all necessary oaths and to punish by fine or imprisonment at the discretion of the court contempts of their authority provided this power to punish contempts shall not be construed to cover any cases except the misbehavior of any person in the presence of the court or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice the misbehavior of the officers of said court in their official transactions and the disobedience or resistance of any such officers or any party juror witnesses or other persons to any lawful writ process order rule decree or command of said court it will be observed that section 725 provides that the court shall have power to punish for contempts of its authority by fine or imprisonment at the discretion of the court it undertakes to make a distinction between direct and indirect contempts not in the ultimate punishment to be inflicted but in the acts and things which go to make contempts of court i believe the law should draw a plain distinction between the acts constituting direct contempts from those which constitute indirect contempts and i believe that the procedure dealing with these two kinds of contempts should be different provided the contemnor desires to be dealt with differently direct contempts which come under the immediate cognizance of the court or so near thereto as to obstruct and impede its progress should be dealt with summarily by the court but a totally different rule of practice should obtain in indirect contempts i admit that when we undertake to frame a definition of indirect contempt we find it rather difficult because of the width and scope of the field as applied to indirect contempts by the courts through lack of a statute defining indirect contempts yet by declaring what shall constitute direct contempts as decided by the practice of the courts and then declaring that all others shall be indirect we arrive at rather a definite and accurate understanding of what shall constitute an indirect contempt i may say that i am in favor of the injunctive arm of the court and not for one moment would i by statute passed by any legislative body or by judicial construction strike down this arm of the law the right of trial by jury is a question which for the past twenty years or more has agitated the minds of the american people a great deal more it is true in campaign times and immediately antecampaign times than at any other time i shall not say that this has been with the hope of securing the votes of any particular class of people but shall leave the reason why for the calm judgment of the people themselves the election being over and the people having resumed their normal mental condition now or in the immediate future would be a very opportune time to consider this important question believing the day has come when we should have some legislation along this line and offering no criticism upon the many champions of this reform it strikes me that their presentation of the case has been by far too narrow this question having been largely forced to the front in the past by great economical questions growing out of labor and capital has led a large number of people to believe that it is only the laboring class who are demanding this reform in legislation and thereby a prejudice against it has grown up among another large class of people who otherwise would give the movement their hearty moral support and cooperation yet the law as it now stands catches all alike so far as the power of the courts to issue injunctions and so far as their power to punish for contempts of their authority is concerned what i desire to do if possible is topresent the question so as to show the necessity for this reform in legislation hoping to gain moral support for it from every possible source for the past twelve years this has been one of the burning political questions discussed by all from every conceivable point of view in every election the platforms of the democratic and republican parties in the last campaign both pledged the people to some reform along this line the republican platform speaking upon this subject says 0 0 we believe however that the rules of procedure in the federal courts with reference to the issuance of the writ of injunction should be more accurately defined by statute and that no injunction or temporary restraining order should be issued without notice except where irreparable injury would result from delay in which case a speedy hearing thereafter should be granted the democratic platform declared unequivocally for a trial by jury in indirect contempt cases mr taft the presidentelect in a speech delivered in new york january 10 1908 said i would favor a provision allowing the defendant in contempt proceedings to challenge the judge issuing the injunction and to call for the designation of another judge to hear the issue in his letter of acceptance in an attempt to amend his platform he says i have been willing in order to meet a popular but unfounded impression that a judge in punishing for contempt of his own order may be affected by personal feeling to approve the law which would enable the contemnor upon his application to have another judge sit to hear the charge of contempt here is an open confession by the republican party in its platform that something is wrong that something should be done to amend this wrong and this admission is strongly reenforced by the statement of mr taft in his new york speech and in his letter of acceptance the difference in the positions of the two parties on this question is the democratic platform in cases involving indirect contempts insists upon a trial by jury and the republican party on granting to the contemner a change of judges in the event it is desired on the part of the party charged with having violated an order of the court the democratic party insists upon submitting these questions of fact to a jury the republican party insists upon submitting them to a judge who like a jury must hear the evidence upon the subject before he can determine the rights of the parties thereto an admission that another judge might be called to consider the question of contempt is an open admission that some change in theexisting law or procedure is needed and a radical change at that if you have a change from one judge to another to try the question of contempt why not have a change to a jury of 12 men to try these questions of fact would the judge be any more competent to try the questions of fact than a jury of 12 men i think not mnr taft in another place in his letter of acceptance states that the democratic partys position upon this question is a dangerous attack upon the judiciary of the land why is it a dangerous attack upon the judiciary to allow a jury trial in indirect contempt cases would it mean the ultimate overthrow of our judiciary system to allow a jury trial in indirect contempt cases grant that it would be an innovation upon the mode of procedure now in force in regard to the practice of punishing for indirect contempts and grant further that it would be revolutionary so far as this practice is concerned it does not follow that it would be anarchistic or destructive in it tendencies to the judiciary of the land nor to the institutions of our country the right of the trial by jury has for the past eight hundred years been regarded as one of the most sacred rights to which the anglosaxon race is heir it was a right wrung by the peasants of england from king john at runnymede and embodied in magna charta the great charter of all libertyloving people which has come down to us from that day through the ages of time ever held as one of the priceless jewels of our inherent political rights from that time to this that right has been claimed by the anglosaxon race and i hope will continue to be claimed by it wherever it may be found either in the republic of the united states or throughout the world one of the causes for which the king of england was arraigned in the declaration of independence was that he had denied the right of trial by jury to some of his subjects living in the colonies when the time came to construct a republican form of government upon the wreck and ruins of the colonial system the builders of this government and the framers of the constitution true to their former convictions on this subject and true to the arraignment of the king of england as set forth in the declaration of independence declared in the constitution of the united states that the trial of all crimes except in cases of impeachment shall be by jury fearing that this right of trial by jury was not thus properly safeguarded by the article referred to in less than two years after the adoption of the constitution amendments 6 and 7 were submitted and adopted by the legislatures of the various states and thereby became a part of this instrument and declared by it to be the fundamental law of the land amendment 6 to the constitution provides in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy a right to a speedy and public trial by a jury of the state y and to have the assistance of counsel in his defense amendment 7 provides in suits at common law where the value in controversy exceeds 20 the right of trial by jury shall be preserved article iii section 1 of the constitution provides the judicial power of the united states shall be vested in one supreme court and in such inferior courts as the congress may from time to time ordain and establish it will be observed that this section of the constitution referred to places plenary power in congress to ordain and establish inferior federal courts such as the united states circuit court and the united states district court and congress having the power to ordain and establish these courts it follows that congress has plenary power to prescribe the rules and practice of these courts and having the power to prescribe the rules and practice governing them it has complete power not only to define and state what contempts shall consist of but it has complete power to prescribe the manner and modes of punishment which shall follow in contempt cases i listened the other day with rapt attention to the able argument delivered upon the floor of the house by judge jenkins of wisconsin upon the lack of constitutional power in congress to pass laws preventing the issuing of injunctions in certain cases while it was an able presentation of the question from his viewpoint yet i can not subscribe to the doctrine annunciated by him in all its details i believe congress has the power under the constitution to prescribe the practice of federal courts in the issuing of injunctions by inferior federal courts if congress has the power to create inferior courts as provided by the constitution to my mind it is clear that it must and does have the power to prescribe the rules of practice which shall govern them and to prescribe how and in what manner injunctions may be issued and how and in what manner parties litigant civil or criminal who come before them in their several jurisdictions shall be treated judge cooley one of the greatest expounders of constitutional law of the present age in his splendid work on page 11 says the government of the united states is one of enumerated powers the national constitution being the instrument which specifies these powers and in which authority should be found for the exercise of any power which the national government assumes to possess to accomplish these purposes the congress is empowered by section 8 of article i to constitute tribunals inferior to the supreme court to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers and all other powers vested by the constitution in the government of the united states or in any department or officer thereof judge cooley again says within the legitimate scope of this grant congress can determine for itself what is necessary and in support of this principle cites the case ex parte curtis 106 u s 371 wherein chief justice waite while speaking of the powers of congress to carry into effect all laws that are delegated in article i section 8 of the constitution says within the legitimate scope of this grant congress is permitted to determine for itself what is necessary and what is proper if this principle be the law should congress determine that it is not only necessary but proper to prescribe the limits within which injunctions may be issued as well as to prescribe the modes of practice which shall govern inferior courts in the trial of cases before them then it is clear that congress has such constitutional power i may remark it was under this clause of the constitution that the supreme court 110 u s 421 held that congress had the constitutional power to make treasury notes of the united states otherwise greenbacks legal tender in payment of private debts in time of peace as well as in time of war when the constitution declared that nothing but gold or silver should be legal tender in the payment of debts judge redfield another eminent jurist in the case of thorpe v rutland and burlington railroad company 27 vt 140 lays down the following doctrine as being the law it has never been questioned so far as i know that american legislatures have the same unlimited power in regard to legislation which resides in the british parliament except where they are restrained by written constitutions that must be conceded i think to be a funds mental principle in the political organization of the american states we can not well comprehend how upon princile it could be otherwise the people must of course possess all legislative power originally they have committed this in the most general and unimited manner to the several state legislatures saving only such restrictions as are imposed by the constitution of the united states or of the particular state in question this is universally conceded to be the rule with reference to the states has not the congress of the united states the same power through the people who created it within the constitutional limits it itself prescribes cooley again on page 127 says in creating the legislative department and in conferring upon it legislative power the people must be understood to have conferred the full and complete power as it rests in and may be exercised by the sovereign power of any country subject only to such restrictions as they may have seen fit to impose and to the limitations which are contained in the constitution itself the legislative department is not made a special agency for the exercise of specifically desired legislative powers but it is intrusted with a general authority to make laws at its discretion justice story another equally eminent jurist in his treatise on the constitution section 1590 makes it clear that it is obligatory upon congress to establish inferior courts as provided in the constitution but nowhere does he say that after having created an inferior court it can not prescribe and define what its powers and duties may be one of the bestconsidered cases which i have been able to find bearing upon this proposition is the case of wayman et al v sauthard et al tenth wheaton page 1 a decision rendered by chief justice marshall i may say that this case was certified to the supreme court of the united states by the circuit court of the state of kentucky involving several propositions one of the propositions involved was whether or not congress had power to prescribe the mode of practice of inferior federal courts in speaking upon this proposition on page 13 chief justice marshall says all the legislative power is vested exclusively in congress supposing congress to have power under the clause for making all laws necessary and proper and to make laws for executing the judicial power of the union it can not delegate such power to the judiciary the rules by which the citizen shall be deprived of his liberty or property to enforce a judicial sentence ought to be prescribed and known and the power to prescribe such rules belongs exclusively to the legislative department congress could not delegate this power to the judiciary or to any other department of the government the right to liberty and property is a sacred vested right under the constitution and laws of the union and states the regulations by which it is to be divested for the purpose of enforcing the performance of contracts are of vital importance to the citizen the power of making such regulations is exclusively vested in the legislative department by all our constitutions and by the general spirit and principles of all their government it is the office of the legislator to prescribe the rule and of the judge to apply it and it is immaterial whether it respects the right in controversy or the remedy by which it is to be enforced having by statute spoken these inferior tribunals into existence by the same or another statute congress has complete power not only to prescribe the kind of cases in which injunctions shall issue but in addition thereto has power to prescribe the mode of practice which shall obtain in any kind of case pending for trial before inferior courts i advert to this argument in response to the argument made by the gentleman from wisconsin the other evening judge sedgwick in his valuable work on statutory and constitutional construction scond edition page 577 says in speaking of amendments 6 and 7 the right of a trial by jury under the constitution of the united states is secured by three provisions to be found in the section of the third article and the sixth and saventh amendments to the constitution the two former of these relating to criminal laws the latter relates to civil causes one of the strongest objections originally taken to the constitution of the united states was the want of an express provision securing the right of a trial by jury in civil cases and this gave rise to the seventh amendment if the case of twentieth wallace and that of one hundred and fiftieth united states be the law that a contempt is a criminal case then it is clear that under the sixth amendment to the constitution the party demanding it is entitled to a trial by jury indeed i believe that it was the intention of the framers of the constitution that a jury trial should be granted in all cases of a criminal nature and as bearing this belief out an act was passed by congress in 1789 found in first statutes page 77 which plainly provides that district courts shall have exclusive of the courts of the several states cognizance of all crimes and offenses that shall be cognizable under the authority of the united states committed within their respective districts or upon the high seas and the trial of issues in fact in the district courts in all cases except civil causes or admiralty or maritime jurisdiction shall be by jury the whole tenor of our law from the constitution of the united states down to the constitutions of the various states recognize the right of trial by jury in all criminal cases the constitution plainly providing that in all criminal cases the right of trial by jury shall remain inviolate and to contemplate that the constitution grants a right of trial by jury in all criminal cases and to realize that under a construction placed upon existing law by the courts themselves that a jury is not permissible in trials of contempts and then to realize the failure of congress to pass a law to faithfully carry out all of these plain constitutional provisions is astounding especially does this impress itself upon us in view of the numerous petitions requests and appeals made by a large class of citizens of this country to congress asking it to enact a law which would enable them to avail themselves of these plain constitutional provisions it can not be argued that the punishment of contempts is a civil proceeding because the supreme court of the united states in different decisions has expressly held otherwise in the case of new orleans v new york maire steamship company 20 wallace 387 it is expressly held that contempts of court is a criminal offense and this same doctrine was reaffirmed by chief justice fuller in the case of re swan 150 u s 637 where the chief justice lays the doctrine down as follows that contempts of courts is a specific criminal offense we have therefore section 718 giving to the courts power to issue restraining orders and section 725 giving to the same courts power to punish for contempts of their authority and at the same time no statute in force to back up these constitutional provisions under construction placed upon existing law by the courts whereby the contemner can demand the right of trial by jury although in the two cases cited above the supreme court of the united states holds that contempt cases are criminal in their nature if the decision in the case in twentieth wallace and in re swan be law that contempt cases are criminal then the rules and practice relating to criminal law should obtain in all cases where the question of contempt is involved if they be criminal cases the contemner should be put in the attitude and in the position of any other defendant charged with having violated some of the penal statutes of the government and when put in this attitude he is then in a position to demand a trial by jury and in addition thereto surround himself with all reasonable doubt of his guilt the practice grown up in the punishment of contempts of court in this country inverts the order of procedure instead of throwing the burden of proof upon the government to establish the guilt of the defendant beyond all reasonable doubt the rule has been inverted and the burden of proof is now thrown upon the defendant to show that he did not violate any rule of the courta legal absurdity the constitution again declares that no mans life or property shall be taken from him without due process of law the jury system has come down to us until it is a part and parcel of the judiciary system of the land and when the contemner is denied the right of trial by jury he then has not only his property but his liberties denied and taken from him without due process of law one of the objections made to this mode of procedure is placed upon the ground that it would delay the procedure of courts have we reached the stage in life where human rights and human liberty must be sacrificed in the interest of time and i may add in the interest of property how about the delay now when men are charged with violating contempts of court this is one of the evils complained of today contemners never being permitted to get a hearing until exhausted financially and otherwise how about the continuance of the cases of gompers mitchell and morrison until after the election when these men were and had been ready for trial weeks and months before the election if a charge involves the inherent rights and liberties of the individual guaranteed to him under the constitution and if the individual can not demand a jury trial to determine his personal rights and liberties then indeed the framers of the constitution lived and worked in vain and we become the subjects of legal construction instead of constitutional rights and privileges the jury system since its early adoption has always stood and i hope always will stand as one of the surest bulwarks against military political and judicial despotism the gist of the bill which i have introduced is to be found in section 2 which seeks to throw around the contemner the protection ordinarily thrown around a defendant charged with violating a criminal statute giving him not only the right of trial by jury in indirect contempt cases but giving him the benefit of all reasonable doubt if we are not careful and mindful of these constitutional rights given to us by our forefathers the day is fast approaching when one by one these inalienable rights which we now enjoy will be undermined and we will be but the representatives of a once proud glorious and independent people to the end that this government may never perish from the earth but shall live forever in all of its grandeur and glory let us return to the constitution of the united states and live under and beneath its strong protecting arm not fearing to enact a law granting the right of trial by jury to contemners in cases of indirect contempts we need have no fear in the enactment of such a law as this it will not undermine the judiciary system of our country but on the contrary will go far to rehabilitate and reestablish that degree of confidence in the minds of the people in the courts of the land which they ought to and should have and which they do not this day entertain"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.9775047898292542,

rising sun he is never so much at peace with himself as when he is quarreling with some one else instinctively he prefers a funeral dirge to a wedding march and believes that the song of the dying swan would make a most glorious national anthem when caniping out purely as a matter of choice he always pitches his tent amid the somber surroundings of a cemetery in the cheerless shade of a weeping willow le is happy only when his fellowman is sad night after night he sends up a fervent petition to the great white throne asking the good lord above to visit his children with some great disaster such as fire or fever flood or famine drought or death earthquake shock or ocean storm for in a visitation of that kind his morbid and melancholy mind thinks it sees some promising political possibilities it does not take much to encourage him however when he picks up his morning paper and reads of a defaulting bank cashier he at once grows hopeful when he scans the market reports and finds that the price of wheat has dropped 1 cent he actually becomes cheerful and when he learns that cholera or some other contagion has broken out in one of our insular possessions he simply grows delirious with joy and forthwith proceeds to gather together all manner of indorsements for a political job under a democratic administration our democratic friends are even now trying to extract some comfort out of the fact that the republicans are not an absolute unit as to who should lead us to victory in november next get all of the comfort and satisfaction out of that situation that you possibly can gentlemen but i want to say to you that i am proud of the fact that the republican party is not the personal asset of any individual no man holds a mortgage on its principles its policies or its purposes it has never issued a commission in perpetuity to anyone to write its platforms and to do all its thinking thank god it has never been afflicted with a political old man of the sea who has secured a stranglehold on its windpipe and choked it into abject submission to his every whim and caprice in all its history the republican party has never developed and i hope it never will develop a perennial disappearless leader who arrogates to himself the sole power of political excommunication i say it more in sorrow than in anger but it is true nevertheless that you on that side have long since lost your courage your independence your political manhood you have been compelled nolens volens to submit to the inevitable and to accept bryan with all his idiosyncracies or suffer the consequences of his mighty wrath there is not a rienzi among you there is not one among you unless perchance it be the eloquent young gentleman from new jersey and it is doubtful if even he would have the temerity to do so now after sitting for four months at the feet of the minority leader in close proximity to the heir apparent champ clark and the heir presumptive ollie james there is not one among you who would have the courage today to even protest against the story of your thralldom but try as you may to create the impression that you are sincerely united on the candidacy of your selfappointed and selfannointed leader whose knowledge of political generalship seems to embrace only an elaborate and comprehensive plan of retreat yet the fact remains and is known of all men that the great majority of you have simply taken counsel of your fears and that your simulated enthusiasm is in reality the hysteria of a crushed and conquered hostage no real change has come over the spirit of your opposition to bryan and bryanism you have not been converted you are still the same old saul of tarsus but your feigned loyalty will not last you can not keep up the delusion the history of the democratic party teaches us that the glory of today is the pathos of tomorrow only a few short years ago you had another idol to whom you swore undying fealty and devotion grover cleveland was once your uncrowned hero your man of destiny around his massive brow you twined the wreath of immortality and in his mighty presence you crooked the pregnant hinges of the knee that thrift might follow fawning where oh where is that idol now ask of the populistic winds that blow from the sand dunes of the river platte and that have grown in volume and velocity since 1896 until today they have reached the menacing proportions of a cyclone of socialism in the language of mark antony but yesterday he might have stood against the world now lies he there with none so poor to do him reverence during the four terms of my service in this body i have yet to hear for the first time a single word of praise or commendation from the lips of any democrat in behalf of the only democrat who has occupied the presidency since 1860 and to whom you once ascribed powers supernatural and wisdom infinite when i contemplate the fate of grover cleveland when i recall the once high estate of that discarded and forgotten idol of democracy then indeed do i feel sorry for one william jennings bryan the day will come and it is not far distant when he too will be made to walk the gang plank of democratic execration and go to his political grave unhonored unwept and unsung i repeat gentlemen and i take pride in the statement that the republican party has always been opposed on principle to the incorporation of a presidential nominating trust in which one man enjoys a monopoly of all the stock both common and preferred i glory in the fact that there is a division of sentiment among republicans as to the personality of our candidate for the presidency but whoever he may be whether that splendid rugged type of oldfashioned american manhood that man whose every heartbeat has been in sympathy with the best aspirations of the common people and who gained his education in the great school of human experience the school that has given to the worlds heritage of true nobility its best and brightest men that man who presides over the deliberations of this house with firmness and fairness and who lives in the hearts of his fellowmembers joser g cannon whether it be that brave and manly man of magnificent judicial poise who in the faroff philippines has reared a inonument to his own greatness of intellect aqd genius of organization that will endure until time shall be no more whether it be the distinguished son of indiana who is today vicepresident of the united states and who has brought to the discharge of his every duty the highest ideals of intelligent and patriotic citizenship whether it be the governor of the empire state of the union who drove the money changers from the temple and is today cleaning out the augean stables of questionable financewhoever it may be the man who receives the republican nomination at chicago in june will receive the united support of the republicans of the nation in november and will succeed theodore roosevelt in the white house on march 4 1909 the republican party deserves success and will succeed because it has been right on all of the great questions that have confronted the american people since the foundation of the republic it was right when as the old federal party in the days of alexander hamilton it advocated the formation of a government big enough and strong enough and grand enough to protect the humblest citizen of the land it was right when as the old whig party in the days of daniel webster and henry clay it made the protection of american industries the cornerstone of american greatness it was right when in the days of abraham lincoln it said that this republic could not endure half slave half free it was right when in the days of ulysses s grant it dealt a death blow to the democratic doctrine of repudiation and said that every bond of this government should be held as sacred as a soldiers grave it was right when in the days of william mckinley it said that the laborer was worthy of his hire and that the man who performed honest work was entitled to honest money for that work it is right today when it says with theodore roosevelt that no man or combination of men is greater than the law of the land and that he that transgresses be he rich or poor shall be made to pay the penalty of his transgressions the history of the democratic party on the other hand is an unbroken record of incoherent inconsistencies the democratic party has demonstrated a capacity only for mischief and mistake it has been so persistently and insistently wrong on all of the great social and economic questions of modern times that every thinking citizen instinctively looks upon its promises and professions with doubt and misgiving in 1892 we were told by the democratic party that the one great overwhelming paramount issue before the american people was the question of the tariff protection was denounced as robbery of the many for the benefit of the few war fierce and unrelenting was declared on the protected industries of the country and it was to be a war to the death import duties were to be abolished customhouses were to be scattered to the four winds of the heavens our home market was to be opened to all the world and every citizen without regard to creed color or previous condition of servitude was to be accorded the proud and priceless privilege of buying where he could buy the cheapest and selling where he could sell the dearest the golden era was to be ushered in our cup of national happiness was to be filled to overflowing with the untold blessings that were sure to gush forth in neverending abundance from a tariff for revenue only aye we were told that the protective system of the republican party was a delusion and a snare a miserable mockery a travesty on truth and god alone knows what not they told us that we were taxed from the cradle to the grave and that even death brought no surcease from sorrow for the wicked republican party had placed a tariff on tombstones i almost shudder even at this late day as i recall the harrowing and grewsome picture that was painted by the democratic spellbinder of 1892 well the american people like ulysses of old finally succumbed to the song of the siren grover cleveland was elected president and with him came into power a congress democratic in both branches and then came the deluge the wilap~n 27 son bill that bright and shining example of democratic constructive statesmanship was enacted into lawand you know the rest it is not necessary for me today to lift the veil that hangs over that darkest period of our national industrial life the farmers the merchants and the mechanics of this generation have not forgotten and they never will forget their one sad experience with a tariff for revenue only nor will they forget that william jennings bryan as a member of congress was one of the most eloquent champions of that measure it was then that the farmers wheat brought 40 cents a bushel his corn 10 cents his oats nothing and his potatoes considerably less than nothing it was then that the merchant turned prematurely gray and the deep furrows of care and trouble appeared on his brow it was then too that labor walked the streets night and day searching in vain for work the mills and factories throughout the length and breadth of the land closed their doors and across their silent and smokeless chimneys was written the epitaph died of an overdose of democracy for four long and weary years years that were lean and barren years of sorrow and of suffering of poverty and of pain we struggled on and on under this weight of voe hoping against hope but relief came only when the republican party was restored to power and the diugley republican protective tariff bill was enacted into law for when that great constructive statesman of the fiftyfifth congress touched the buried industries of the nation with the magic wand of protection phonix like they sprang forth from their ashes their democratic tombs in the wealth of the products of field and factory of mill and mine and in the magnificent growth of our export trade far exceeding that of any other nation on earth and reaching every part of the civilized world we behold an enduring monument to that great cardinal principle of the republican creedprotection to the products of american genius american brain and american industry our democratic friends say that they intend to make the tariff an issue in this campaign i suppose this is their intention for the peerless one has spoken and i am sir oracle when i ope my lips let no dog bark i hope it is true and that they will make it the paramount issue i for one shall welcome an opportunity to contrast the barrenness of yesterday with the bounty of today i shall be glad to match democratic fancy with republican fact democratic promise with republican performance democratic expectation with republican realization ah my countrymen the protective policy of the republican party needs no defense it has stood the test of time and experience its manifold benefits are altogether too apparent to admit of the possibility of successful attack it constitutes the proudest boast of our civilization and finds its glorious justification today in the strength and power and prestige of the nation and in the prosperity and happiness of all the people it is possible that new conditions have made necessary some changes in our present tariff law as no law devised by mortal man ever possessed the element of perfection but the time will never come when the great body of the american people remembering the disastrous experience of twelve years ago will ever be willing to surrender any part of their loyalty to the great principle of protection whenever a revision of existing tariff schedules shall become necessary that work must and will be done by the friends of the protective system and not by its enemies the wageearners of america prefer the practical patriotism and the good common sense of republicans like josepi g cannon and jonn dalzell to the violent vaporings and visionary vagaries of any democrat in the united states in 1892 as i have just stated tariff for revenue only was democracys battle cry but four years later they tried their very best to have the people forget all about the tariff in 1896 the democrats discovered their second paramount issue in that year when every one of them had taken to the woods to escape the righteous wrath of an indignant and impoverished people a new moses appeared upon the political horizon who thought that he held a commission from on high to lead the forlorn and scattered children of democracy out of the wilderness and back into the promised land of official plenty it was then that you on the other side of the house made the discovery that the one panacea for all the ills that the body politic was heir to the one sure neverfailing remedy for every real and imaginary political disease was the free and unlimited coinage of silver at the heavenborn ratio of 16 to 1 without waiting for the aid or consent of any other nation on earth it was then that you spread the doctrine of discontent the pessimistic propaganda of populism class was arrayed against class and inflammatory appeal was made to passion and to prejudice you denounced those of us who believed in preserving the financial integrity of the nation as enemies of the plain people tools of wall street goldbugs oppressors of the poor you completely exhausted the vocabulary of vituperative abuse in your characterization of the friends of honest money as the unscrupulous hirelings of plutocracy why a young democratic friend of mine actually became so wrought up in that campaign that he had the gold fillings removed from his teeth as a practical evidence of his uncompromising hostility to the gold standard and then there was the awful awful crime of 73 you remember that phrase dont you you remember how our democratic friends used to roll it under their tongues like a sweet morsel and how throughout that frenzied campaign they clung to it closer than to a brother they told us in lurid and bloodcurdling language how one dark and stormy night while the owls were hooting and the spooks and hobgoblins were abroad in the land old john sherman than whom a better patriot never lived arose from his slumbers at midnight and with tarquins ravishing strides toward his design moved like a ghost and how before he returned to his plutocratic bed murder murder most foul had been committed the dollar of our daddies had been slain and democracy shrieked out aloud against the deep damnation of his taking off oh you remember that dont you you also remember coins financial school by the way what has become of that famous publication which in 1s96 supplanted the family bible in every wellregulated democratic household you recall the ingenuity of the authors argument that the price of wheat and silver rose and fell together and how he succeeded in proving to his own satisfaction at least that the american farmer would never again receive more than 50 cents for a bushel of wheat until the old ratio of 16 to 1 were reestablished in that campaign mr bryan told the american people that if mckinley were successful and the gold standard were continued as the monetary standard of this country the farmers and the wageearners of the nation would be unable to educate their children because they would not have sufficient means with which to purchase schoolbooks and clothing for them from the atlantic to the pacific from the great lakes to the gulf in every city in every village in every hamlet his matchless voice sounded the note of loud alarm calling upon bewildered democrats and bewhiskered populists to storm the citadel of our financial honor and to overthrow the iations credit but the republican party met the attack boldly and fearlessly we pointed out the dangers of an inflated and debased currency and proved by the experience of mankind that free silver and fiat money meant national dishonor and national disaster to the eternal credit of the american people be it said that they awoke to a full realization of the impending danger and buried this democratic financial fallacy so deep that it will never hear the blast of gabriels trumpet on the morning of the resurrection i would like to know why it is that the mere mention of free coinage of silver at the ratio of 16 to 1 or at any other old ratio today throws the democratic party into convulsions i would like to know what has become of the crown of thorns and the cross of gold the peerless leader said in 1s6 that no question is ever settled until it is settled right if he still believes that he was right in 1896 and in his recent speech at freeport ill he maintains that he was why is it that the democratic party seems so anxious to abandon the silver question without waiting for its settlement in accordance with the declaration contained in the democratic platform of that year i leave this for them to ponder over now mr chairmau in the campaign of 1900 our democratic friends maintained a discreet and dignified silence on thq question of free trade and free silver in that year they discovered another paramount issue the thought has occurred to me that perhaps after all the democratic party was created for a good purpose it seems to be their special mission on earth to make original discoveries and if perchance they should ever start out in search of the north pole that elusive and muchsoughtfor place might just as well make up its mind to allow itself to be discovered in 1900 the democratic party found the issue of imperialism in that year they made the startling discovery that the foundations of the republic were slipping away they said that william mckinleythe gentle loving gracious mckinley who in the dark days that tried mens souls gave practical proof of his patriotic love of country and whose every heartbeat was in sympathy with the oppressed of all mankindthey said that he was a tyrant a despoiler of human liberty an oppressor of his fellowman they accused him of trying to establish a monarchy on the rains of our once glorious republic they talked about the man on horseback the modern napoleon about dynasties and kingdoms and empires they said that the american flag in the philippines was an emblem of tyranny and oppression in the frenzy of their hypocritical fears they heard the death knell of human liberty and beheld the downfall of the republic they even surrounded the retreating brow of aguinaldo with a halo of imperishable glory and but for the vigilance of the gentleman from tennessee mr john wesley gaines the holy trinity of democracy would certainly have been recast and remodeled brave old andrew jackson would have been compelled to surrender his timehonored place between thomas jefferson and william jennings bryan to make way for the little filipino but the republican party true to its magnificent record of courageous performance of every public duty was not dismayed with full confidence in the righteousness of our cause we appealed again to the conscience of the nation and we did not appeal in vain we showed that the philippines had come into our possession as the result of a war that was sanctioned by every aimerican citizen a war that was waged for humanity and christianity and that having supplanted the sovereignty of spain in the islands it was a duty we owed to civilization itself to establish a government there that was fully capable of enforcing the fundamental guaranties of every civilized governmentthe protection of life liberty and property this we proceeded to do and thank god this we have done when the impartial historian of the future shall record the achievements of the republican party among the brightest and most inspiring pages of that history will be the record of our great and benevolent work in the philippines the bolo has been beaten into a plowshare the blockhouse and the fort have been supplanted by the schoolhouse and the church anarchy has made way for law and order and the american flag whose stars and stripes have been baptized in the best blood of american patriotism is still the emblem of liberty and equality wherever it floats whether from the dome of the nations capitol or over the humblest hut in faroff luzon ah my democratic brethren you can not stop the wheels of progress you might just as well attempt to stem the resistless tide of the mighty mississippi at high flood as the river rolls on majestically to the sea as to try to interfere with the manifest destiny of the american republic in the great work of the worlds civilization you may carp and you may criticise you may fret and you may fume you may prate in ponderous platitudes about invasion and usurpation but the fact confronts you nevertheless that our occupation of the philippines is in full accord with that splendid spirit of progress that has characterized the history of the anglosaxon race the world over and before whose victorious advance the idols of paganism fall and lie shattered in the dust ignorance must give way to intelligence superstition to enlightenment lawlessness to ordered liberty and now we come to the nevertobeforgotten campaign of 1904 in the beginning of this campaign it looked very much as though our democratic friends had at last run short of paramount issues experience had taught them that it was the part of political wisdom carefully to eschew all reference to the tariff finance and imperialism and whatever other mistakes the democratic party has made in the past no one can ever truthfully accuse its leaders of failing to show at all times a quick appreciation of the exigencies of party expediency a new paramount issue had to be discovered at any cost and so after calling into conference those four great champions of the rights of the plain people those brave and valiant knights who had always eagerly welcomed every opportunity to engage the octopus in mortal combatthose four pure and undefiled patriots thomas ryan august belmont augustus van wyck and blueeyed billy sheehan it was unanimously decided that the question of the trusts and their regulation should be the paramount issue every democrat at once became infused with the zeal and enthusiasm that inspired the brave young knights of scotland who followed the black douglas as he carried the casket containing the heart of bruce to the sacred sepulcher of the savior he buckled on his shield drew his sword and swore by all the patron saints of democracy never to sheath his trusty blade until he had lopped off at least a dozen of the tentacles of the octopus oh it was to be a battle royal the country was to be freed for all time to come from the cold and cruel grasp of monopoly and predatory wealth the american people were to be redeemed rejuvenated and sent on their way rejoicing but just as enthusiasm was running highest somebody made a discovery that sent the cold shivers down the back of every democratic knight who had enlisted in the holy war and caused this latest crusade to end much the same way as don quixotes famous and heroic attack on the windmill some one pointed out that the republican party had years before provided the people with an adequate remedy against corporate oppression in the shape of the sherman antitrust law a law that was framed by a republican senator passed by a republican congress and signed by a republican president it was also pointed out that during the democratic administration of grover cleveland this wise and salutary law which was designed to curb the power of corporate greed and to protect the consumer against the extortions of monopoly lay dormant upon our statute books because richard olney a democratic attorneygeneral by a peculiar process of reasoning which was satisfactory to himself and to the administration of which he was a part concluded that the law was unconstitutional and positively declined to bring any prosecutions under it it remained for that matchless champion of the rights of the people that great exponent of the enforcement of both the letter and the spirit of the law theodore roosevelt to carry to a successful conclusion the first prosecutions under that law prosecutions that were begun under the administration of his republican predecessor today the great combinations of capital realize as they never realized before that their power is not as great as the power of the government that their rights are not superior to the rights of the public and that they will not be permitted to show less regard for the majesty of the law than the humblest citizen of the land if theodore roosevelt had accomplished nothing more than the awakening of the public conscience to a realization of the dangers of corporate encroachment if he had done nothing more than to enforce without fear or favor the provisions of the sherman antitrust law he would still lead all of the men of his day and generation in the great work of practical and permanent reform and that work so vigorously prosecuted under his administration will be continued in 1909 under the administration of his republican successor the republican party was conceived in a spirit of justice and dedicated to the proposition of equality and a party so conceived and so dedicated and imbued as it has always been with the true spirit of progress and reform will never turn a deaf ear to the demands of the people and now we are about to enter upon another presidential campaign i do not know just what the paramount issue will be this year as i am not in the confidence of the democratic party but i am prepared for almost any old thing i would not be surprised to find in the democratic platform this year a declaration to the effect that the only clean legitimate untainted money in the united states is that which is derived from the lecture platform and from the publication of the commoner a newspaper which with a becoming sense of modesty seldom mentions the name of its editor oftener than one hundred times in any one issue i happen however to have here a copy of the issue of the commoner of february 28 and march 6 1008 in the first of which mr bryans name appears by actual count cxacty 135 times and in the latter 108 times and it isnt a very large paper at thatonly sixteen pages with one name ever present but so intent is the editor on keeping that name before the public that even the advertising column does not escape as is evidenced by the following notice for sale an excellent registered shorthorn bull 1 year old in fine condition color red w j bryan lincoln nebr the pedigree of this excellent registered shorthorn bull is not given but in all probability he is a lineal descendant of the fifteenhundreddollar blooded heifer which we are told mir bryan purchased shortly after he was overtaken by the prosperity that followed the election of his republican opponent in 1896 then of course we can expect in this years platform the usual stereotyped declaration in favor of adhering rigidly to the constitution as interpreted by the fathers and that too in face of the admitted fact that the only states in this union in which according to democratic authority the gentleman from new york the constitution has been lynched and where the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to that great sheet anchor of our liberties are violated with absolute impunity are the states that habitually give their electoral votes to the democratic candidate for the presidency much stress will no doubt be laid on democ racys pretended friendship for labor crocodile tears will be shed in great abundance by the democratic spellbinder of 1908 as he tells of the heroic efforts of the minority in this house to enact legislation in behalf of the hornyhanded sons of toil and yet an examination of the record will disclose the fact that the only place in this country where labor is underpaid where the efforts of workingmen to organize themselves into unions meet with determined opposition and where few laws favorable to the cause of toil have been incorporated into the statutes are the states that have never given an electoral vote to the republican party organized labor today has a membership of approximately three million and while i have no statistics at hand i undertake to say that less than 5 per cent of this great army of workers is to be found in the democratic states of the south we will be told in this campaign that the republican party has appropriated democracys ideas and that theodore roosevelt is masquerading in the garments of william jennings bryan the claim will be put forth that roosevelt stands for the same principles of government that bryan stands for but when this claim is made we will ask for a bill of particulars for instance we will ask them to show when and where theodore roosevelt ever advocated the destruction of the protective policy of the republican party we will ask them to show when and where he ever favored the heresy of free and unlimited coinage of silver we will ask them to show when and where he ever expressed contempt for the supreme court of the united states we will ask them to show when and where he so far forgot his americanism as to question the integrity of the flag of his country we will ask them to show when and where he became inoculated with the populistic virus of initiative and referendum we will ask them to show when and where he ever advocated a government guaranty of bank deposits we will ask them to show when and where he became a convert to the damnable and socialistic doctrine of government ownership of railroads no no my friends theodore roosevelt and william jennings bryan are not one and identical they have nothing whatever in common one is the direct antithesis of the other one is a practical statesman the other an impractical dreamer one is patriotic the other is platitudinous one is constructive the other destructive one believes in intelligent action the other in unintelligible agitation the republican party has now been in continuous control of the destinies of this nation for eleven years this is not a long period of time in the life of a nation it is not a long period of time in the life of a political party that has the courage of initiative and the genius of constructive statesmanship it has been long enough however for the republican party to present to the people a record of achievement unparalleled in all the annals of political history in that time we have settled forever the question of our monetary standard and have strengthened and securely fortified the national credit we have raised the standard of freedom and independence in the little island of cuba and have banished forever from the western continent the last vestige of monarchial misrule and oppression we have carried the blessings of american civilization with its christianizing harmonizing and elevating influence to the people of the philippines and have pointed out to the filipinos the path that leads to constitutional selfgovernment we have repealed the democratic wilson tariff law that debtproducing measure of odious memory and have dispelled the clouds of doubt and disaster that for four long years obscured our industrial horizon we have strengthened the hands and enlarged the powers of the interstate commerce commission by enacting a railroadrate bill which does away forever with unjust and unfair discriminations in the matter of freight rates we have given life and force and effect to the sherman antitrust law and made it a power for good in the land we have passed a national purefood law to protect the lives and the health of our citizens we have established the most cordial relations with the republics of south america and have placed our trade with them on a firm and lasting foundation under the masterful genius of the republican party the dream of a century will soon be an actual living reality the work of constructing the panama canal is being pushed forward with vigor and enthusiasm and when this the greatest of all modern undertakings shall have been completed there will follow as its natural and logical sequence the deepening of our waterways from the great lakes to the gulf and the multiplied products of the valleys of the ohio and the mississippi will soon be transported by water to the teeming millions of the orient before this congress shall have concluded its labors other great measures of progress and reform will be laced upon the statute books by the republican party an employers liability law which will bear the test of constitutionality and which effectually destroys the barbarous doctrine of fellowservant has already been enacted the other demhands of labor will be given full and fair recognition and a system of finance will be inaugurated that will make impossible all future speculative panics this is our record it is a record of patriotic achievement and true americanism on this record we stand and ask a continuation of republican control we do not go into this campaign with an apology on our lips unlike our opponents we have nothing to apologize for nothing to explain nothing to take back the republican party today stands as it has always stood for home and fireside for law and order for the dignity of labor for the elevation of citizenship for the extension of commerce for the development and protection of industry for america against all the world"], [0.9503227472305298, 0.9503227472305298, 0, "i congratulate myself upon the opportunity to address the house upon st patricks day in the morning i presume the honor is accorded me because i so seldom trespass upon the patience of the house by talking from the floor i have rarely in my service in this house claimed the privilege of talking upon this floor and if you wil indulge me briefly i wish to express some of the thoughts that have come to me touching the general good i feel profoundly the respbsibility of being a member of the congress of the united states at a time so fraught with tremendous consequence both to our nation and to civilization i listened with very great interest to the eloquent panegyric pronounced the other day by the gentleman from new york on the president of the united states and his wonderful message i concur with him fully in many of the things he said it is gratifying to bear such unqualified approval of the attitude of this republican administration come from the other side of this house i can not refrain at this time from expressing my indignation at the criticism that has been heaped upon the presidents head by the press and by certain public speakers who have attempted to characterize roosevelt as the destroyer of prosperity the cause of the recent financial troubles it is said that he should have proceeded to work the wonderful revolution and reformation that is already assured in our business and political life in a quieter gentler way i read one article that went forward at some length to describe how the gentle and lovable mckinley would have proceeded to have reformed and brought under supervision the pirates that have raided our interstate commerce and levied unjust tribute upon our iron highways of trade and travel between the cities it is said that lie should have called them together and had a conference with them remonstrated with them showed them that it was inevitable that these reforms would have to come and that they would have seen the wisdom of his advice and that all this mighty revolution would under him have been accomplished without any injury to business this could all have been done quietly it is said without angering anybody and that the strenuous president now in tile white house with his big stick has frightened business and terrified legitimate interests and is the cause of the panic and every reactionary statesman in america every advocate of graft every defender of the old regime has become a calamity howler predicting disaster to business if we do not abandon the clear line of duty so plainly indicated in his message by this heroic fearless champion of justice and honesty the mere statement of such unreasoning criticism brings a smile of derision to the face of every member of this house who was a member of the house when the rate bill was first proposed and while it progressed by slow stages toward its completion no one appreciates as does a member of the legislature himself the absolute necessity of the big stick and of tile streanous clmpion the dauntless and fearless leader in the inauguration of this wonderful work which our president has commenced no one has a more profound adlniratiof nor a deeper feeling of respect for the sainted mckinley than i he was the most universally beloved and respected of all the citizens living or dead of my native state his fame is the brightest jewel in the crown of the great district whose representative upon the floor of this house i now have the honor to be while admirably adapted to do the work that he did he would have been uttemly unable to accomplish what roosevelt has achieved he had his work to do and he did it well he has established forever and firmly fixed to endure i trust the great principle of american protection but the work of this addmit stration required a big stick 1 big stick that could not have been wielded by his gentle hands why his best endeavors would not have produced even a ripple upon the seething pool of business and political corruption which the eloquent gentleman from new york so graphically described it is fresh in the memory of all of us when the debates in the house were in progress how many eloquent eulogies were paid to the efficiency of railroadrate makers how it was insisted that they had a monopoly of all the intelligence that was capable of fixing a rate upon the railroads and what pathetic appeals were made to the house not to confiscate the stocks of widows and orphans invested in the railroads by members of that house who must have known that the money of widows and orphans was invested in the minority stocks of the roads while in many instances the entire earnings of the railroads were given away in rebates to the interests which held the majority of the stock yet if i remember aright every member of this house except seven after that provision had been pending for some time was compelled by the big stick which had been transferred to their constituents at home to vote for that bill the president has not been polite enough he has been too strenuous he has dared to speak the words predatory wealth and rich malefactors and the very utterance of these words has disturbed the trade of this country and brought on a panic if his critics had lived two thousand years ago what a storm of indignation they would have expressed when the christ of nazareth lashed the money changers indignantly from gods own temple these money changers were business men men of great consequence in old jerusalem doubtless they had concessions from those high in the government and should have been treated with more consideration and courtesy the record does not disclose whether this conduct on the part of the saviour produced a panic or not but it undoubtedly did occasion some disturbance of business but the world has not much cared neither do the american people care whether the struggle for commercial and industrial libertythis great spontaneous movement in the direction of buginess honesty and fairer competition caused the panic or not they have set their faces toward its complete accomplishment did ever the anglosaxon race when roused in the cause of justice and freedom pause to count the cost they will not now this work must go on no power on this earth can stop it the victory is already assured the organized forces of opposition to the policies of the president are falling into disorder and confusion and will soon be in full retreat before the next presidential election the battle will be substantially over the eloquent gentleman from new york advocates the selection for president of a crusader to use his own words yes he wants a crusader he saysthe peerless leader i am reminded of a talk i once had with all old civil war veteran whose service had been with the infantry and he was greatly prejudiced in favor of that branch of the service the cavalrysaid heare held away back out of danger while the battle rages until the lines of the enemy are broken and they are flying from the field then the cavalry charge with bugles blowing sabers flashing all yelling likelike fury they throw the enemy into hysterics and wind the whole performance up in a blaze of glory the crusade was the most stupendous exhibition of organized foolery recounted in all the annals of history as a display of enthusiasin although insanely misdirected it was sublime and in this regard the peerless leader would be indeed a crusader i congratulate the gentleman from new york on his simile his candidate is not wholly without experience in the crusading business it is scarcely eight years since his peerless crusader showed to the world what he could do in that line you all remember the splendid enthusiasm the wonderful concerted action of his first crusade he followed by over six million of the weakminded charged and yelled and crusaded over the country for free silver coined at a ratio of 16 to 1 the esprit de corps of that crusade was as perfect as was that of the crusade which went in quest of the holy sepulcher whatever the peerless leader did they all did when he charged they all charged when he yelled they yelled when he shouted for free silver at the ratio of 16 to 1 they said sixteen to one for enthusiasm and concert of action that demonstration has never been surpassed we have in sacred writ however the story of a like devotion to a single idea a like concert of multitudinous action on the part of that herd of swine also possessed of the devil that went charging and squealing down into the sea and were drowned why my democratic friends for enthusiasm and devotion you can never beat that they were all drowned every mothers pig of them do the gentlemen think the country would appreciate another exhibition we all know that the peerless leader the star performer is now ready if we may believe the current press he is out himself billing the principal cities for the show let us be serious and inquire where in the procession of events we are now we have been engaged in a tremendous struggle against a commercial feudalism that has grown almost supreme in its imperial power but look about you the strongest of its embattled castles have already capitulated the white flag is flying over many of those strongholds where once they took tribute from our interstate commerce in their council chambers a mighty change has come the shipper walks in standing straight up as an american citizen should he is not today cringing and begging for the same rate as the mostfavored shipper he no longer leaves that presence with tears flowing down his face while some insolent baron says sell out or be ruined he goes forth with a feeling akin to pity for the anxious men who are there soberly studying the constitution and the rate bill the last authoritative utterance that comes to us from the standard oil company the strongest and oldest and of all the great corporations the most persistent offender is an announcement to the public that it is ready to be good mr archbold in his speech at the banquet in new york advocated a national license for corporations clearly conceding and declaring the legislative power and duty to control great interstate traders in a former article he said that he favored complete publicity on the part of that company what more does the public want graft duress and every form of extortion flees before the blazing light of publicity now what are we going to do with the standard oil company and kindred organizations we are nearing a reconstruction period and everyone who soberly considers the signs of the times knows that the war is over the president has transferred the big stick from his own mighty grasp to many millions of hands over this country and has taught them how to use it if there is any doubt about this gentlemen i would point to ohio and there you may see with what relentless zeal that head is clubbed which opposes the presidents policies in opposition to the peoples will no difference how that head may be crowned with past honors and dignities past service to the public no matter how great eloquence and ability universally recognized can not interpose or save nowhere in this great laud of ours can criticism of the president inspired by hate and spleen win applause save in the shadow of the stock exchange in wall street from this time on no political party can formulate a platform looking toward any recession any reactionary movement any going backward the work of the next administration will necessarily be a work of business reconstruction and in determining what shall be done with the standard oil company we should bear in mind that that great organization is one of the most splendidly devised business institutions that the world has ever known capable of doing enormous good in the future to destroy it utterly while it might give amusement and passing delight to a charging crusader would be an economic crime against society at this time it seems to me not inappropriate to glance backward to an almost complete analogy in history and i trust the american people will be able to profit by the wisdom of their fathers many chapters back in the great epic of civil liberty civil government rose from the ruins of the feudal system after a fierce struggle when the power of the barons was broken no doubt there were many who advocated their utter destruction but soberer counsel prevailed and they were not killed they were spanked well and when they manifested a disposition to be good they were given place in the new state and became honored and useful pillars in libertys reconstructed temple such should now be the treatment accorded the predatory trusts we must spank them until they consent to be good formulate and enact such laws as will insure performance on their part this will be the work of the next administration and it cant be done by the democrats charging and yelling under the leadership of a crusader we have reached the time when it is more important to go right than to go fast there is no danger that more seriously menaces the public good than misdirected zeal the president in nearly all of his public utterances has said this it is as important to have a firm hand upon the brake as to wield the whip lie has iterated and reiterated this warning to the american people until it appears that that marvelous comprehensive mind must have had a premonition that the democratic party would get full of enthusiasm and start to crusading again there is danger at any moment mr bryan may promulgate some idea that has got crosswise in his brain and stampede the whole democratic herd we must now address ourselves to the enactment of conservative legislation under the constitutional power to regulate commerce having in view the establishment by law of the doctrine of the square deal comprehending absolute freedom of trade in our interstate commerce and the reestablishment of oldfashioned generous competition among business men having these things in view the american people would do well to choose for their next president the great constructive statesman the profound constitutional lawyer he must bring to the public service ability and training for the task of the highest order it is not an erratic enthusiast talking of government possession of railroads that we need to lead us into untried paths of experiment but an executive of judgment and discrimination to advise legislation that will bring the railroads back to first principles make them again to be public highways public property under the control of public trustees serving all the people alike the new legislation imperatively demanded to make competition fair and restrain certain interstate traders called trusts must be formulated by those who at least are able to discriminate between the good and the bad between the rich corporation which does right and the rich corporation which does wrong this being admitted we may eliminate every democrat from the presidential problem for on that side of the house have you not railed against the tobacco trust and the united states steel company with equal virulence with a like fury you would charge on both because forsooth both are rich the one is a pirate sandbagging its competitors driving them to the wall and ruining them by every species of crime against competition that wicked avarice and cunning have been able to invent the other has competed fairly and generously with every competitor in the same business i know whereof i speak the independent iron and steel works have prospered equally with those of the great corporation i know how strenuously you on that side of the house will combat this declaration of mine that this great company has been fair in its dealings with all others in the iron business it seems almost a party necessity for you to do so for have you not in your party platforms declared for the destruction of the trusts and promised the country to destroy them by administering to them free trade when you should come into power you all know full well that your specific remedy your trusticide will not hurt the tobacco trust nor the beef trust nor the standard oil company nor the sugar trust nor any of the monopolies except by impoverishing the whole country and thereby rendering them less prosperous it is very very important that the next president must be one who will not deem it his duty to be unfriendly to any great corporation merely because it is rich our next president should be a republican there are many names of great republicans eminently qualified for the responsibility before the country we republicans are divided in our choice for president but not divided in our admiration for or appreciation of those great statesmen who are now being loyally supported by their respective states for this great place in this spirit of enthusiastic appreciation for the splendid merits of all his rivals my native state ohio at the recent convention brought forward her favorite son and presented his name proudly to the nation she unanimously urges him as the logical candidate to carry forward in unbroken sequence the great work of this administration he is a great jurist deeply learned in the science of the law an accomplished statesman knowing the needs of society and the legitimate scope and functions of civil government and he has shown himself to be a great administrative officer if he is nominated he will inspire the american people with a confidence that they have rarely ever felt in any candidate he will carry his native state by the largest majority ever there polled save only that marvelous vote given to president roosevelt he was an able and a just judge an efficient governorgeneral of the philippines a great war secretary and if nominated and

democratic side of this house will support to the full extent the democratic members of the committee will take pleasure in reporting out the speakers resolution and the democratic members of this house will take pleasure in voting for it when it gets here upon the other day the gentleman from new york referred to the tactics that we were pursuing upon this side as puerile and hypocritical i have sometimes thought and i say it in all good humor that there is a large degree of comparison although some degree of contrast between my friend the honorable serieno e payne of new york and that distinguished knight of the days of prince hal who was known to his friends as honest jack falstaff and to strangers as sir john falstaff in breadth of girth there is much of comparison they both lard the lean earth as they walk across it in adopting sir jacks maxim that discretion is the better part of valor there is much of comparison because the gentleman the other day and generally indeed manages to make the last speech when he is engaged in debate w henever he can so that he can not be easily and immediately replied to they are alike in this too that prince hal described sir jack as being brave in coming on and halting in coming off from the various enterprises which he undertook in another part of shakespeares play jack speaks of himself as being not only witty in himself but the cause of wit in others so far as the latter part of this descriptionautobiographical descriptionof sir jack is concerned the gentleman from new york resembles him closely so far as the first paragraph of the description is concerned it is with sincere regret and pain that i am compelled to say that there is a contrast and not a comparison because whenever the gentleman from new york attempts to be witty in himself he is generally simply rude and awkwardly offensive it was not quite parliamentary to speak of the tactics which we were pursuing as puerile or hypocritical the gentlemlan should have selected some better word however the gentleman did not intend to be offensive in the slightest degree he thought that he was being funny and there is nothing funnier in the world than the gentleman from new york when he thinks he is being funny now this morning the gentleman from pennsylvania who now occupies the chair said the object of introducing this rule was to expedite the public business the real object of introducing that rule was to prevent us from forcing you to expedite public business every time anybody wants to pass any of this reform legislation so much of which is desired by honest men in your own party you cry out after the election after the election after the election you remind me a little bit of a piece of poetry my boy picked up the other daf somewhere at the public school and brought home and recited to me and his grandmother and of which when he got through his giandmother said kit you ought never to repeat that any more because that is just about the same as telling anybody to go to the bad place that poetry ran after this wise when i asked my girl to marry me she said go to father she knew that i knew her father was dead she knew that i knew the life he had led she knew that i knew what she meant when she said go to father and you are going back to your people you republicans over therei am not talking of those now who represent standpat districts of one sort and anotherbut for example gentlemen from minnesota one of whose laws was held up not long ago by a mere temporary restraining order of a subordinate court upon ex parte testimony and some of you gentlemen who live in districts where the people want the tariff revised and do not want it revised by being told to go to father are you going back home and say to those people we were in favor of these things but in voting against them as we have done we were merely following our leaders in the house of representatives and we are still going to do them after the election i am afraid some of them will respond in the words of my motherinlaw and say boy do not say that any more that sounds like telling me to wait until i go to the bad place you have practiced this deception upon the american people so long that it would seem that a fool who runneth could now read it every time before an election you gay to the people that you propose that after the election to do this that or the other thing and then after the election you say the people have indorsed our not having done it and the people stand with us on our inactivity now this session when mr herman ridder on the outside and many people on the inside of congress have urged this congress to pass a bill putting wood pulp upon the free list and print paper there also or at least to reduce the duty upon the latter what has been the reply of the republican leaders they say we can not do it because if we bring a measure into the house putting wood pulp upon the free list it will open up the whole tariff question and the democrats will make all sorts of amendments i have finally succeeded in driving the majority to a demonstration of the falsity of that pretense and i hold the demonstration in my hand as a palpable legible visible thing in the shape of the rule which you adopted this morning it illustrates it demonstrates that you could by action of your committee on rules under your peculiar general rules conferring the power which that committee has bring into the house a bill accompanied by a rule from the comnittee on rules and put that bill through if you wanted it done with three minutes general debate and no time or opportunity for amendment under the fiveminute rule at all bring in your rule let a special rule for once bring some benefit to the people this whole country will know before this session is over that if remedial legislation can not be secured from this congress it will be because the minority under the general rules and under the special rule are as helpless for legislative purposes as a child shooting peas out of a muzzleloaded shotgun at gibraltar is impotent in an attempt to destroy the rock one thing we propose to demonstrate and we are going to demonstrate it is that we shall exhaust in our effort to obtain remedial legislation every power which the minority has under the rules no man of honor or sense shall claim that we have failed to do that this rule is the first squeal my democratic friends upon the republican side this rule is the first squeal from the other side but it will not be the last talk about hypocrisy and puerility what of the hypocrisy and puerility of this pretense that the majority in enacting desired legislation can not protect itself from the minority they have more rules up their sleeves which they will bring in later but as far as i am concerned i have enlisted for the war and i will stay with you here until the dog days some of you think that you will intimidate or bribe members of the democratic party by cutting men off from speeches that they want to make because of course when i refuse you unanimous consent upon that side you will refuse it here or by cutting them off from bills that they want to pass for their districts i do not believe there is a man on this side of this chamber ready to sell his fidelity to a general policy of substantive and beneficent legislation for the sake of a petty speech or a petty local bill if there be i shall be much astonished i have heard that you have bruited it about that we should get nothing this session why we are so in the habit of getting nothing and having nothing that it does not hurt us much wherever one of us will be hurt one and a fraction of you will be injured and we can stand it better than you can most of us who are upon this floor now are from districts where somebody may beat us for the nomination but where no republican is going to beat us at the election even when a man sacrifices a seat he sacrifices only himself he does not sacrifice his party but he will not by doing his duty here even sacrifice a nomination the people will understand it will be long before the dog days that you will be anxious you republicans to be turning your way homeward to mend your fences and to take care of the live new democrats with progressive spirits who are not letting any grass grow under their feet out west and in the middle states you can not intimidate me for one with any special rules or with any threat of any rules you might pass a general resolution in these words r esolv ed that no motion or resolution or bill of the lion joan sharp williams of mississippi shall be granted or become a law for nineteen months or until the end of this congress and you might bring in a special rule from the rules committee to put that resolution upon passage and pass it without amendment in ten minutes and i might know beforehand that you were going to do it and it would have just about as much effect upon meoh oh well as the manner of the gentleman from new york when he is on his feet making a speech and that is another respect in which he resembles sir john falstaff he has a bullying verbality or verbosity whichever it may be that does intimidate an ordinary unaccustomed human being and long ago it would have intimidated me too before i got used to the noise but i have been standing in the hearing of it for fifteen years when i was a boy dressed in homemade clothes made upon the plantation during the war out of wool off of our own sheep and cotton grown in our own field spun and woven on our hand spindles and looms when the war had just closed they were carrying me to memphis to put me in school i had never seen anything but a plantation and the things that grew upon a plantationlive stock and vegetables of various sorts we finally got to a little town by the name of grand junction i never knew why it was called grand except perhaps that it was grand for that little particular place to be a junction at all it was at that time populated by some 340 billy goats some 4 saloons and a few private residences it also had one of those oldfashioned eating hotels where the railroad trains stopped for meals you had to get off there in order to change cars for memphis while we were waiting the most unearthly noise iever heard in all my life broke out upon my ears out in front of the piazza of the hotel the railroad tracks were running parallel and crisscrossing the switch engines were going up and down but i could not stand that noise behind me and i made right out in front of the hotel my old nurse lucy took after me caught me after a while amidst the railroad tracks and not far from some of the locomotives and said my god mars johnny what is the matter with you i said why lucy didnt you hear that noise judgment day is coming everything is going to pieces why she said mars johnny that aint nothin but a newfangled dinner horn i afterwards found out it was a chinese gong it was the first one i had ever gotten acquainted with but not the last whether mechanical or human since that time i have never been intimidated by mere swell of breast or rotundity of sound nor by mereoh i do not like to say because i know it is unconscious it is not intended i would not like to say insolence of manner shall i say unconscious arrogation of superiority to common mortals i would not like to say that either because i think that even is unconscious a mere oozing out at the pores like bob acress courage i shall call it the absolute unpreventability of manner and voice of the gentleman from new york now you brought in a rule here and this rule reads that the first reading of this bill shall be dispensed with that after two hours of general debate the time to be equally divided etc a vote is to be taken the other day you made an agreement in this house for eight hours upon this special bill now by this rule you say two hours not eight the chair very correctly ruled this morning of coumse the gentleman from missouri was merely trying to show the lack of moral conduct the lack of ethics on the republican situation when he made the point of order that you have the legal power under~a rule or without a rule by a majority vote to break an agreement there is no doubt you have the power to pass one thing in congiess one day and repeal it the next day for that matter but we have driven you to where you are not only changing your rules to suit your hand but where you break your plighted word that you have the legal right to do it nobody doubts nobody anywhere but to repeal a law is one thing and to repeal an agreement amongst men is another thing to take advantage of your power as lawmakers to get out of the attitude of an agreement between one another as men is a totally different thing however i do not want to dwell upon that neither will you hereafter now a few words to thisthe democraticside of the house and i shall conclude we have not much power the gentleman from new york has taken the trouble to tell us that this congress would be run without any reference to us by that side of the chamber we have however some rights one of them is a right inherent to each member on this side to object to unanimous consent it causes some inconvenience another is a right luckily secured by the constitution itself and not destructible by the committee on rules to call for the yeas and nays upon every affirmative proposition of legislation that passes through the house then we have some power in a different way whenever you darewhenever you dare let the house consider any of these special bills to which i have referred we have the power of adding ourselves as a minority to a fraction of the majority and thereby to make a majority of this house i have not very much hope that an opportunity will present itself to exercise that power and to show our utility to the country in that respect because if there ever was anybodyand apri 3 i say it as you all know with all due regard and affection for i have a feeling toward him almost like a son who has been kindly treated has toward his father or unclebut if there ever was a man bestriding a situation of which he was afraid and so much afraid that he fully deserved to be named after an indian chief out in the west oldmanafraidofhishorses that man is the present

condemned performance of jumping out of the frying pan into the fire the gentleman from new york is a learned man and can be precise when he chooses in the use of words i submit in all candor that because in both his propositions touching the tariff he used equivocal terms one may fairly conclude that there is a largesized senegambian concealed in the wood pile a mammoth rodent in the meal tub the gentlemans position seems to be this tariff revision and a maximum and minimum tariff should be brought about the republicans have had absolute control of all branches of the government for eleven years and have left undone in this regard that which they ought to have done but if the people will only overlook past omissions and give them a new lease of power they will revise the tariff either up or down and establish a maximum and minimum tariff with the dingley rates for either the maximum or minimum he isnt exactly certain which and american voters are asked to go to the polls and buy these two tariff pigs in a poke the gentleman from new york was hardly fair in his treatment of certain bills introduced by the gentleman from mississippi he seemed to think that the gentleman from mississippi did not know that white print paper is a more comprehensive term than white paper which is preposterous for whatever the gentleman from new york may think of the political opinions of the gentleman from mississippi he must admit that the latter is possessed of much erudition and is widely read not only in political literature but in general literaturefacts of which this house is proud writing white paper for white print paper was a slip of the penmerely that and nothing more but suppose that the gentleman from mississippi had actually proposed to put all white paper on the free list or to cut down the tariff thereon what then he would have been simply pushing a good thing a little further the effort the gentleman put forth to make merry as to that small item shows to what sore straits the republican floor leader is reduced in a tariff debate with the gentleman from mississippi the gentleman from new york seems to be flatly opposed to removing the tariff on wood pulp and white print paper lie was kindly furnished by the gentleman from pennsylvania with a letter from the census bureau showing that prices for white print paper are getting lower instead of higher we should not forget that a certain commissioner of labor hon carroll d wright now president of a new england college two or three years ago to help the republican campaign along prepared lengthy tables of figures to show that the cost of living was lower then than in the years immediately preceding when every housewife knew by sad experience that it was much higher no doubt this year some republican statistician will prove that times were better since september last than ever before in the entire history of the human race thereby once more illustrating the proposition that while figures will not lie liars will figure the gentleman from new york appears to think that the publishers of the land do not know what is the matter with themselves i have not time today to go into an argument about removing the tariff on wood pulp and print paper i may do so at some future day but one thing is certain either the publishers of the land are a lot of consummate liarswhich i do not believeor the price of news paper has gone up and is higher than it ought to be for with almost unanimous voice without regard to politics they declare that the price is cruelly high and demand that wood pulp and news paper be put upon the free list republican papers have it in their power to drive republicans here into giving them relief or to drive the republicans out of congress and if they do not do the one thing or the other they should forever hold their peace for every democrat here stands ready to vote for their relief the gentleman from mississippi properly characterized the tariff on wood pulp and news paper and on art as a tax on intelligence which should therefore be removed the gentleman from new york vas muddled as to the bill of the gentleman from mississippi to cut the tariff when above 100 per cent down to 100 per cent he talked exclusively about tobacco and alcohol on which there is a large internalrevenue tax the history of that transaction is that in the commitee on ways and means mr willias amended his bill so that where there was an internalrevenue tax on any article the tariff should be left high enough to compensate for the internalrevenue tax even though the tariff on that article should be more than 100 per cent as amended it was voted down in committee all the democrats voting for it and all the republicans voting against it i have here a long list of articles on which the tariff is more than 100 per cent in some cases much more at some convenient season i will go into that matter in extenso just one more thought about the tariff and then i am through with that today some time during the session i will take a day off and make a sureenough tariff speech not long since my distinguished friend from maine in a runningfire debate with the gentleman from kentucky about ship subsidies wanted to know if it was not true that our shipping shrank more under freetrade legislation than under protective legislation i take it that was a slip of the tongue the gentleman from maine is a great figure in this house he understands the use of the english language too and he knows none better that there never has been a time that this country was under freetrade legislation under the constitution except a few days between washingtons inauguration and the enactment of the first tariff law i submit that a man with the standing of the gentleman

charge against the president in the same column we find this paragraph which needs a diagram to explain it go softly and carry a big stick is a phrase that has attracted much attention the advice contained in the first two words should not be slighted it seems to mean that the president is traveling at too rapid a gait and should use the soft pedal hereafter in making music for republicans to

a partisan or personal purpose no creditis given to the president by his partys legislative leaders for motives aside from those of a political nature while opinion continued to vary as to the

say that i have not been able to give its provisions much consideration i have not been a legislative drone this session of congress but after reading it and listening to the explanation of its

such combination an action for damages and he can recover three times the damages sustained with costs including a reasonable attorneys fee third it invokes the equity sidethe great restraining power of the courtand makes it the duty of the united states district attorneys under the direction of the attorneygeneral to go upon the equity side of the court and invoke the strong hand of the

the act there was one trust in existence there is at the present time a hundred fattening themselves on the production of the people of this great nation while it seems it was not possible to reach combinations of capital through this legislation no such difficulty has been experienced in applying its provisions to organizations of labor the labor unions of this country or the organized workingmen of this country demanding as they do a fair share of that which they produce have many and powerful enemies in high places throughout this land but up to this time the bitterest of these has never contended that any legal barrier should be placed between the workingman and his right in combination with his fellows to withdraw from employment in order to enforce his demands it seems now however according to the decision of the supreme court of the united states in what for convenience i will call the danbury hat case this right is not only to be questioned but denied it seems

the supreme court plaintiffs were manufacturers of hats in danbury conn having a factory there and engaged in trade in other states that they were dependent upon interstate trade to consume the product of their factory the defendants were members of the united hatters of north america that defendants were engaged in a scheme to force the manufacturers of this class of hats including the plaintiffs to unionize their factory that out of eightytwo manufacturers of this country seventy had so organized their factories that plaintiffs refused the demands of defendants and defendants thereupon to enforce said demands caused its members to simultaneously withdraw from the employment of defendants and that defendants thereupon gave notice to its members and friends throughout the country that it had done so this conduct on the part of the hatters union the supreme court says brings it within the provisions of this act this suit was started in the united states circuit court for the district of connecticut and i am informed is of such a character that the property of every individual member of that union is involved in the present suit so much for the legislation and the decisions of the court on the subject now the millions of laboring people of this country every one of whom is more or less involved in this legislation and in this decision are looking to this congress for relief and they have a right to expect relief from us they have a right to expect relief from this administration the republican party has been able to convince them in nearly all the elections of recent years that it was a sincere friend of the producing masses of this country you have told them in season and out of season on the stump throughout this country and on the floor of this house that your one great object and one care wasto look after the welfare of the workingmen of this nation you have excused the oppressive tariff on the plea that its exactions were necessary in order that good wages and satisfactory conditions might be secured to the laboring men of this country i have seen gentlemen on the other side of the house almost in tears at the thought of what would ensue should any desecrating hand touch these sacred tariff schedules and thus interfere with your special wards and prothg~s in addressing myself to this subject at this time i am exercising one of the few prerogatives that is left to a member of this onetime deliberative body things have come to a pass and the rules of this house are such that we deliberate when we are told and we stop deliberating when we are told to stop deliberating i introduced this amendment shortly after the decision of the supreme court in this case and it was referred to the committee on the judiciary that veritable golgotha bristling with the bones of bills embodying the wishes and desires of the people the rules of the house provide no way in which i a member of this body representing a sovereign constituency can have an opportunity to lay this matter before the house for action like any other legislator who has confidence in his measure i would regard it a privilege to be permitted to bring this matter before the house and discuss it with the other members of this body this privilege is denied to me and therefore i am exercising one of the few prerogatives that is left and am attempting to call the attention of the committee the house and the country in the hope that the powers that be may be influenced to move in the matter i can not leave this phase of the subject without calling the attention of the house to the fact that when the criminal cede bill was under consideration in this body it then had an opportunity to pass similar legislation to this section 19 of the criminal code bill provided that if two or more men should conspire to injure oppress threaten or intimidate any citizen in the free exercise of a right or privilege secured to him by the constitution or laws of the united states they should be subject to a fine of 5 000 and imprisoned not more than two years and be ineligible to office the members will remember that i at that time offered an amendment to that section providing in general language that it should not apply to combinations of persons agreeing to leave or enter the employment of another the same arguments were advanced against this amendment as were advanced in favor of the sherman bill it was held that the section could not possibly apply to the kind of combinations that the section dealt with vainly dlid the members on this side of the house beg the majority to make assurance doubly sure by stating in unqualified language that the section did not apply but the amendment was defeated and shortly afterwards the decision of the supreme court in the danbury hat case showed that the provisions of the said section did apply you have posed for years as the shield and buckler of the laboring class and it looks to you now to make good your pretensions and to relieve them from this oppressive legislation for which you so proudly claim the credit they are perhaps beginning to realize that there is some slight inconsistency in your avowed friendliness for them which has hitherto nanifested itself in compelling them to purchase the commodities of life from the trusts in a protected market while forcing them to sell their labor in a market that is open to the competition of the world they are perhaps beginning to notice the inconsistency that shuts out from them what they eat and wear and overwhelms them with what they selltheir labor they are beginning to ask perhaps how it is that in the operations of an administration so friendly to them a satisfactory eighthour law can not be passed they are beginning to wonder about the mysterious end of various and sundry bills to limit traffic in convictmade articles they are even demanding to know why it is that from a government republican in all its branches they can not get antiinjunction legislation the gentleman from pennsylvania a few days ago at the beginning of his very able speech took occasion to classify himself as one of those who believed in the policy of the president and in the next breath he said as though by an uncontrollable association of ideas we are about to enter on a presidential campaign i submit that fact to you gentlemen and in connection with this legislation that i have been speaking about i submit it to the speaker whose power and influence is admitted from one end of this land to the other i submit it to his friend from illinois fmr boutelle who put him in nomination here the other day for the presidency and i respectfully say to him that the fervent speech by the gentleman from illinois from which he quoted demanding the publication and distribution of public documents to the farmers and workingmen of this country did great credit to that gentleman but there are matters of much more moment to the farmers and workingmen of this country than the distribution of horse books and poultry bulletins can ever be and i assert that more benefit can be done to these people whom every candidate for the presidency is now so anxious to aid by the passage of this legislation than by the distribution of all the public documents that have been sent out in the last thirtytwo years friends of the people are known by acts and measures and not by words these words were uttered by demosthenes three hundred and twentyeight years before the birtl of christ and were quoted with approval by a distinguished gentleman of our own time who took occasion to remark that words were good when backed by deeds and only so so far as those who toil are concerned we have reached a crisis in the affairs of this nation the working people of this country are law loving lawabiding and peaceful no man who has not had the experience knows how they shrink from the thought of entering upon that last resortthe strike they fully realize the consequences thereof they know that the issue is always doubtful and the result to them is bound to be trouble privation and perhaps suffering for themselves and those whom they love but they know as you know that it is their only effective weapon when all peaceful efforts have failed and that without it they can not fail to sink to the level of those unhappy people who flocked to our shores to escape similar conditions in my judgment the american workingman in the coming campaign is going to demand of this administration and of the republican party an account of its stewardship he is going to demand to be told who it is that has betrayed him he is going to ask how it is that with a flood of litigation threatening him on one hand and a flood of immigration overpowering him on the other the weapons on which he relies to fight this unequal battle have been stricken from his hands that the shield of his organization which is interposed to protect him from these evils has been torn away and he will perhaps become at last aware of the fact that a great party which has used him as a cloak behind which to hide the plunder of the people has stabbed him in the back to prevent him from claiming his share of that which he produced"], [0.88720703125, 0.88720703125, 0, "i will go on record when it comes up regularly and in order the change in the cars now owned by the railway companies operating in this city and the number of new ones required to comply with the terms and conditions of this proposed amendment would impose a very large and unnecessary burden on those companies the money better be expended in other important and muchneeded improvements but this is not my chief objection to it jim crow cars are not necessary in order to avoid friction and irritation between blacks and whites which is the main argument urged in its favor by the gentleman who proposed it many passengers are required to stand in the washington cars and there is much strap hanging i have been here during four congresses and always ride in the cars when i do not walk and have never observed any indication of the friction here spoken of at length by the gentleman from alabama however if there is any friction it is not the fault of our colored citizens there is no law or ironclad rule of propriety requiring one passenger to surrender his seat to another but it is the part of good manners for a man to yield his seat to a woman and especially for a young and vigorous man to extend this courtesy to an elderly lady this courtesy prevails more generally in this city than in other places where i have been in the country the rule quite generally observed here is for white men to surrender their seats to white women who would otherwise be obliged to stand in this regard they manifest much politeness i have observed but very few instances where white men have given their seats to black women while black men are quite prompt in extending this courtesy to white women my notion is that this statement is borne out by the experience and observation of every man on the floor of this housethat in this particular bit of gallantry the advantage is decidedly in favor of the negroes i am persuaded that the friction of which the gentleman from alabama complains consists in the fact that he must sit on the same seat or ride in the same compartment with negroes that goes against the grain and in that is the irritation talk of friction it strikes me there would be some real friction in the enforcement of this proposed law in this city there are people of all shades of color from pureblooded caucasians to pureblooded africans and but very few of the latter class there are mulattoes quadroons octoroons and those of even lighter shades of african blood there are people with blue eyes light hair and as white skinned as southern europeans and yet to the experienced ethnologist they may betray a strain of ethiopian blood and by an inexorable social law established and enforced in the south all people in whose veins flows the slightest strain of african blood are forced into the negro class those mixtures and amalgamations between the races bear witness of more intimate social relations between white men and black women than is possible by riding in the same cars or compartments through the streets of washington and that too when those women were slaves the property of white owners and had no alternative but to yield when their masters desired to possess them you say we do not and can not understand the race question as you do we admit it it is very difficult for us to appreciate your consistency in permitting such intimate social relations in some respects when you enforce ironclad social ostracism in others those mixed bloods are here they are not to blame because their remote ancestors were brought to this country as slaves by your remote ancestors nor are they responsible for their light coloring produced by the unholy miscegenation by white planters this amendment was manifestly suggested by and is a modification of the alabama statutes establishing jim crow cars in that state and in the code of that state is the following definition of the term negro the term negro within the meaning of this code includes mulatto the term mulatto or person of color within the meaning of this code is a person of mixed blood descended on the part of the father or mother from negro ancestors to the third generation in clusive though one ancestor of each generation may have been a white person according to my construction of this definition a man seveneighths white may be a negro and would be obliged to herd in the same compartment or car with blacks the gentlemen favoring this amendment from observation and experience may be able in all instances to detect racial differences but conductors and motormen are not experts of the same experience and ability this is a cosmopolitan city where hawaiians filipinos east indians cubans turks and armenians reside ambassadors ministers and consuls are here from south american and asiatic nations with their retinues and servants but few of them are as white as northern europeans who constitute the basis of our population the rigid enforcement of this jim crow car amendment might lead to mistakes and international complications and then there would be friction i make no pretensions as an expounder of the federal constitution and yet i venture the opinion that this amendment is repugnant to that instrument it provides that no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the united states and what states con not do certainly the national government can not do negroes aro citizens of the united states and this proposed law would abridge their privileges and immunities our st eet car companies were created by congress and are governed and regulated by this body they are publicservice corporations and common carriers of passengers and all people who pay the fare and behave themselves properly should be given equal consideration and the same kind of treatment and there should be no discrimination against them but the gentlenen who favor this amendment promptly inquire who can say that this is not discrimination against the whites and in favor of the blacks oh this is not open to argument you make the same argument in defense of your constitutions election laws and regulations and say that on their face they do not discriminate against negroes who are entitled to vote lut you know and we know and the whole country knows that your constitutions and election laws and your social code and your jim crow cars are all designed and enforced for the purpose of discriminating against the blacks in order to make them feel at every turn that they are an inferior people and subject race and that they must recognize this discrimination at every point where they meet with white people in the ordinary relations of life there is only one interpretation which can be put upon this amendment and that is that it discriminates against the colored people and humiliates and degrades them ave the colored people appealed or petitioned for this amendment have they demanded separate cars or separate compartments no only white people from the south and their representatives in congress are urging the adoption of this amendment and they demand it not because of any danger to be apprehended from the negroes or because of irritation or friction but because they do not want to ride side by side or even in the same compartment with their colored brethren this amendment would mean another insult and reflection on the negroes by drawing the color line against them in the public cars in the city of washington and it is difficult to believe that the advocates of this measure have not that express purpose in mind your states accepted and adopted the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments on their rehabilitation during the reconstruction period and immediately their white people conspired to defy and nullify those articles first by the agency of the kuklux klans and other organizatiois which terrorized the negroes and killed them if necessary to keep them from the polls you prefer to accomplish these ends if possible under color of law and regularity and your states adopted constitutions with grandfather clauses and other provisions for the disfranchisemeat of the negroes and you have passed election laws and enforced them in such a manner as to practically disfranchise all the negroes in the southern states you have refined and elaborated those laws until the ingenuity of lawlessness is exhausted to evade the force and effect of those amendments and deprive the negroes of a fair vote and honest count and you have succeeded you now count them for representation in this house and in the electoral college but you will not permit them to vote they are citizens for one purpose but not for the other and you are permitted to do this by the good nature and forbearance of the people throughout the balance of the country intrenched behind those bulwarks of fraud and violence you have become so bold and defiant as to taunt the republican party with not keeping its pledges to enforce the fifteenth amendment to the constitution by compelling you to let the negroes vote or by reducing your representation in the congress and electoral college in accordance with the provisions of the fourteenth amendment common prudence would suggest that you remain quiet on this delicate question you should be grateful for being let alone in the enjoyment of your illgotten advantages but yoll are not the old prejudice and determination to enforce your views on the rest of the country manifest themselves whenever occasion occurs early in this session when the revision of the penal statutes was under consideration you tried to repeal or amend the sections which were enacted by congress for the execution and enforcement of the fifteenth amendment and you failed now you presume to cross the potomac and introduce jim crow cars into the capital of the nation should you succeed in this you would not stop you would endeavor to establish the same rule and the same discrimination against the colored people with reference to all railroads doing interstate commerce throughout the country you are making a grievous mistake if we do not understand you or your view point on the race question you do not understand us or appreciate the sentiment and temper of the people throughout the north and west you may be able to terrorize intimidate and subdue the negroes but you can not cajole or intimidate the overwhelming nmass of the white people in our country they are patient and longsuffering and have much sympathy for you in your efforts to solve this race problein but there are limitations to their patience you charge us with opposing this proposition for purely political reasons and that we are grasping at it in order to make political capital and you say that on a secret ballot there would be but very few votes in this house against it let me assure you that you are in error that we oppose it in good faith because it is unjust and unfair we do not believe in caste or class distinctions of this kind you assert that you are the negros best friends then why do you wish to humiliate and degrade him why do you treat him in all political and social matters as an inferior and keep constantly before his mind that lie is practically without tile pale of the law why do you close against him all avenues of developmeilt and advancement his condition and status in society is hard enough at best he is excluded from many labor unions and from industrial and social organizations lhe is not permitted to engage in high grade or responsible employments which tend to develop character and ability and he is driven by necessity if not from choice into memial service do not deprive him of his rights before the law and under the constitution give him some chance and encouragement that he may develop the best that is in him do not shock the

would have been right to prohibit a corporation from contributing money or anything else of value to a campaign fund why it is not right now to make such prohibition when we are revising the statutes

to be continued and perpetuated with the plain common people of the fields and workshops who have always and do still regard the president as the champion of their rights and interests there is the fear that they will not be with many who have heretofore and many who continue to enjoy special privileges or freedom from restraint in the furtherance of their enterprises to enrich themselves at the expense of the people there is the fear that they may e a distinguished gentleman closed an eloquent speech on the floor of this house a short time ago with the statement that just what niche theodore roosevelt is to occupy in the temple of his countrys history god and the future alone can tell the gentleman was correct for the subject of his remarks is still a comparatively yotmg man whose career in the natural order lacks much of being closed and the history of no man can be written until he is dead but if today that career was to suddenly close many of the gentlemen in congress and out who have exhausted their vocabularies in depicting him as a usurper of power a menace to the constitutional rights and liberties of his fellowcitizens an insincere and dishonest executive would be saying of him that he enjoyed the confidence and affection of his countrymen as no man has since the days of lincoln and that he was entitled to and would live ini history as a great tribune of the people in the history of america there are two great names that will always tower above the names of the other great men of this country as does a great mountain peak stand out in bold relief against the horizon above the surrounding mountains dwarfing them majestic though they may be in comparison with the surrounding foothills by the grandeur of its magnificent proportions they were men appointed by providence to meet the two greatest occasions that ever occurred in our historywashington and lincoln both performed their divinely appointed tasks in such manner that their names and memories belong not alone to us but to all the world each recognized the magnitude of the task that was set before him when the day came for abraham lincoln to leave the little illinois town where he had lived for years and whose people knew and loved him as no other people could when the time of parting came and they crowded about him as he stood on the rear platform of his car in the rain that was falling from a murky sky of late winter he said to them i now go not knowing when if ever i may return with a task resting upon me greater than that which rested on washington without the assistance of that divine providence which ever attended him i can not succeed with it i can not fail commending you to him who can go with me and remain with you and be everywhere for good as i trust you will in your prayers commend me i bid you an affectionate farewell yet when that task was heaviest when the treasury of the nation was depleted and its credit was almost gone and its bonds were being hawked about the markets of the world below par when the great resources of the north seemed almost exhausted when the homes of the country wore being appealed to for more of their boys to carry on the war for the preservation of the government of which lincoln was the responsible head a great political party met in convention and explicitly declared in its platform that that government had disregarded the constitution in every part and had trodden down both public liberty and private rights and essentially impaired the prosperity of the country its whole platforn was in fact an indictment of abraham lincoln and his administration as unjust inhuman and tyrannical it was a supposed political exigency that called forth that denunciation no portion of our citizenship render greater praise to the personal character and public acts of abraham lincoln today than do the members of the same party that so fiercely condemned him in 1864 it is just as inopportune and almost as criminal to condemn theodore roosevelt and to endeavor to destroy the faith and confidence the american people have in him and the work he is doing as it was to condemn abraham lincoln in 1864 each conceived in his youth the purpose of combating the evils of his day and time that existed in his country and from which its people were suffering and each conscientiously applied himself to the task when the opportunity that goes with high place came to him president roosevelt is engaged in the performance of that task and the american people who believe in him in his courage his sincerity and high purposes are demanding of us as their representatives and as they have a right to demand that we shall not condemn and embarrass him but that we shall aid him in its performance the attempts that have been made by speeches in the congress and elsewhere andby attacks through the press to discredit the president have met with no echoing response from the great middle class that composes the great mass of our people and whose sober judgment controls the selection of the nations rulers and determines its destiny they know his history they know the high ideals of his youth of his consistent work then for reform and good government in municipal and state affairs and no one can convince them at this late day that he ever forsook those ideals or abandoned that work in his first message to congress he wrote it should be as much the aim of those who seek for social betterment to rid the business world of crimes of cunning as to rid the entire body politic of crime of violence great corporations exist only because they are created and safeguarded by our institutions it is therefore our right and our duty to see that they work in harmony with these institutions artificial bodies depending upon statutory law for their existence or privileges should be subject to proper governmental supervision and they can not be convinced that the man who wrote these things and who from that time to this through more than six longyears filled with some of the greatest events in the worlds history has earnestly and by all the means within his power labored to maintain these principles and write them into the law of the land is not consistent and sincere it is futile to attempt to make them believe that the chief magistratewho has insisted not alone by word but by official acts that the law should be enforced against the criminal of all classes that the imposing of great burdens upon the many to enrich the few must stop that the door of opportunity should not be shut in the face of any man but that it is the highest duty of government to protect all men in the exercise of their natural and inalienable rightsis dangerous to the republic when a person or party attempts to prove for political or other selfish purpose that any given individual in high place is a menace to the public welfare they must choose some one who has less of the human qualities that draw men to him than has the president the american people admire the man who earnestly and aggressively does things and they hate a quitter they admire the man who stands up and fights for what he conceives to be right who fights in the open and gives and receives blows who takes the side of the weak against the strong of the oppressed against the oppressor who loves his fellowmen and lives with and among them and not above them the human qualities of theodore roosevelt have appealed to them and all the ridicule and denunciation of political opponents all the criticism of an unfriendly press all the speeches of the advocates of those who see their special privileges being wrested from them will not avail to convince them that he is inimical to the welfare of the state and history will record that the great heart of the american was right in this instance as it has always been when it has bestowed its affection upon a public servant and in future days the men who denounced roosevelt upon the floor of this house will join those who denounced lincoln as a tyrant grant as a butcher garfield as a thief and mckinley as a weak tool of combines and trusts in thanking god that the american people in such matters are prone to forgetfulness and are at all times generous users of the mantle of charity the things that have been referred to here by those who seek to destroy the influence of the president are things that because of their insignificance even if they contained an element of truth even if they in some measure would bear out the inferences sought to be drawn from them which they do not even by the most forced and strained construction are the passing events of a day which the historian of the future will not even give a casual notice but he will judge this administration by those

man of the future with his cargoes of american goods made in american mills by american workmen as he floats those cargoes on their way to the markets of the orient through the great canal that is destined to forever unite the waters of the two greatest oceans on the globe will not forget that it was the quick decisive action of a man who did things that ended the procrastinating efforts of more than fifty years and brought about the speedy realization of the dream of centuries those of our people who have removed from homes in the east or middle west to the great treeless plains of the eastern slope of the cordilleras and who have settled upon a great wide expanse of prairie and whose eyes have hungered for the sight of a tree those who have watched the growth of the cottonwood the pioneer tree of the west from cutting or seed and tenderly cared for it because of tree hunger know the value of a tree as no other people can and the inhabitants of those regions where the government is now growing forests where they were never dreamed of will join in the future with the inhabitants of other sections where the hand of the ruthless destroyer was checked in the destruction of their natural forests in praising the policy of this administration in the conservation of our forests in the great meetings of the representatives of the nations of the world to devise means and to form agreements to hasten the time when the disputes arising between nations shall be settled by appeals to judicial tribunals instead of the sword and whenever and wherever men meet and plan for the establishment of universal peace the part that was played by the president of the united states in bringing about peace between the two great nations who were engaged in the orient in one of the most gigantic struggles of modern times will act as an inspiration and serve as an example that will redound to the incalculable benefit of humanity and the advancement of civilization but a few years ago the door of opportunity was closed to practically every man who would start a factory or establish a new business to produce or trade in the things consumed by the american people unless he was a man of large means for his wealthy and oldestablished competitor by means of the railroad rebate could undersell him in every market he entered and bankruptcy and ruin were inevitable the day of the railroad rebate is ended and if this administration had no other mark to its credit but that for all the years of its existence that one alone would entitle it to the esteem and gratitude of the american people the abolishing of railroad rebates however was but an ineldent in the great epochmaking policy of this administrationthe governmental regulation and control of the great corporations engaged in interstate commerce all men recognize the great change that has occurred in economic conditions in this country in the last thirty years the age of combination has come in the industries the competitive system may not be entirely a thing of the past in everything but in some it seems almost ended the day of the shortline railroad even of the small system is a thing of the past a few men control the great transportation lines of the country these railroads are the highways of the nation over which the products of the farm and shop must move to the markets and over which the people must pass in the transactions of the affairs of life the human mind can not conceive of a greater power than that of the control of the principal highways of the greatest country on this earth the tendency to abuse unrestricted power is universal it will not do to entrust a few men with unrestricted control over the transportation agencies of a nation or the manufacture or production of any of the necessities of life the conditions extant here make governmental regulation and coiftrol of interstate corporations in some degree imperative and that era in our national life has in fact been inaugurated during this administration by its responsible head and mir chairman it is no longer a question in america as to whether these creatures of the law are higher than the law no longer will men exclaim that the great burning issue in america is whether the state is to control the corporations or the corporations control the state that question is settled forever and settledas all questions are ultimately settled under our system of governmentin the interest of the people there will be other battles to fight for those who believe in governmental control and regulation of corporations but the great decisive battle was fought and won in the fiftyninth congress and we have entered upon the new era from which we will never recede by the things i have mentioned and others of almost equal importance will the administration of theodore roosevelt be judged in history they indicate the statesmanship of the president and his advisers as one representative having in common with the other members of the house the burden of responsibility cast on me i feel that it is the duty of the congress as soon as may be to enact into law many of the suggestions the president has subnitted in his recent messages and in the brief space of time remaining i want to refer briefly to some of them too long have the people suffered from the evils of overcapitalization of carrying and industrial corporations every one of those corporations is organized for the purpose of trade with the public and every dollar of watered stock issued is an unjust burden upon the public which it has a right to protest against it is a familiar story how railroads have been built in this country with money secured from the investing public by the sale of the mortgage bonds of the company and in addition there have been issued to the incorporators and promoters the stock of the company equal to or greater than the amount of the bonds for which the holders paid little if anything but their patrons have been called on through unreasonable rates to pay the interest on the bonds provide a sinking fund for their payment and pay dividends on the stock it is a familiar story how both the carrying and industrial combinations are formed and the property of the former firms and corporations exchanged for vast sums in excess of their actual value measured in the stock of the new concern and the people who must eat and must be clothed and housed are in fact taxed upon the necessities of life to fill the gap between the actual and fictitious values of the property and make the stock dividend paying and worth a hundred cents on the dollar why should congress hesitate to enact legislation to prevent such practice in the future by all corporations engaged or to engage in interstate commerce with some of the greatest lawyers in the country among its membership it can if it will devise and pass effective legislation along these lines within a reasonable time and it can not escape responsibility if it does not the government having of necessity under existing conditions entered upon the task of regulation and control of common carriers engaged in interstate commerce can not now stop in the middle of the stream it must go on wherever there is actual need for further extension of regulation within the constitutional power of congress to provide it not in a spirit of destructiveness and not by hasty or illconsidered action but certainly and surely sanely and conservatively in the interest of the people who look to the government for the exercise of its proper powers for their protection as the railroads are highways of the nation every person is entitled to use them upon equal terms with every other person and also upon reasonable terms and the latter can not be secured in fact until the interstate commerce commission has the power to initiate proceedings for the reduction of rates the benefits of the present law can not be obtained without great expense shippers and communities are today suffering from the imposition of unreasonable and discriminatory rates because of the expense and hardship of commencing and prosecuting a proceeding before the commission the state of kansas realizing the need of assisting its local communities to obtain just rates has appropriated money from its treasury to assist its people in maintaining proceedings of that character before the interstate commerce commission there should be an attorney for the interstate commerce commission with a competent corps of assistants whose duty it should be to examine into all the complaints of unreasonable rates for interstate shipments made informally by shippers and communities and in cases where the rates appear unreasonable he should initiate proceedings for their reduction before the commission and maintain them at the expense of the public the state of kansas has adopted this plan as to its local commission with marked success and without great expense to the state the matter should not be and can not be fairly thrown u on the shoulders of individual persons communities or states it is essentially a matter of public duty to secure for all the public at all points just and reasonable interstate rates it will not do to give the people the shadow while withholding from them the substance it is folly to enter upon rate making unless the power to secure evidence and the best evidence obtainable is made possible making the physical valuation of all the railroads of the country at one time and stopping there would be of but little evidentiary value for the value of today of any given road may be wide of its value a year from now but we should not hesitate to give the commission power to make a physical valuation of a road whenever in its judgment it is deemed necessary in the exercise of its ratemaking function the president has recommended the passage of an act requiring notice to be given before the issuance of injunctiont orders by the federal courts and to thus change the rule of practice that it is within the discretion of the court or judge whether or not notice will be given i yield to no man in rez spect and admiration for the courts of this land every student of the law and of public affairs knows that in the chambers of the great judges away from the turmoil and strife of both business and political warfare the great principles of american jurisprudence have been formulated and i assert without fear of successful contradiction that the courts have been the most watchful of the rights and liberties of the people and that they have been their most effective guardians they have guarded them both against the assaults of the demagogue and the seeker after special privileges time and again they have stood between the people and the results of their own inflamed and misguided passions and the most dangerous and despicable demagogue is the man who would seek to destroy the confidence of the public in them but there is no man so great nor so good learned and wise who can adjust the differences that arise between men upon the written affidavits of only one side to the controversy as every lawyer is well aware there are three kinds of injunction ordersrestraining orders temporary injunctions and permanent injunctions the first is issued only for the time being and to preserve the status quo until a hearing can be had to determine whether a temporary injunction should be granted the second is issued for the purpose of restraining the commission of the act threatened to be committed during the pendency of the litigation in the court and continues during the entire litigation unless dissolved the third is the final judgment of the court forever prohibiting the threatened action it is a wellsettled principle of equity that no temporary injunction will be granted if the effect of granting it is to determine the ultimate rights of the parties but this principle often falls in practical operation if but one side is heard on the application for the temporary order for the applicant is always convinced that he is right and will generally be able in affidavits drawn by skillful attorneys to make a strong showing that he is although he may not be in fact if the other party has no opportunity to meet the allegations of the applicant no opportunity to crossexamine the witnesses against him it is apparent that no matter how just and upright the judge may be no matter how desirous he is of doing right the opposite party will in many instances be wrong the evil of granting injunctions without hearings is not confined to labor disputes there have been instances of injustice being done by both federal and state judges by the issuance of ex parte writs in every class of cases under the jurisdiction of courts of equity once a temporary injunction is granted to continue during the litigation it is often a long and expensive process to secure its dissolution and in many instances great hardships and loss have been imposed upon the party enjoined before its dissolution is obtained there are instances in which restraining orders must be granted without notice otherwise a threatened injury could be and often would be effected pending the hearing for the temporary injunction while in a few instances the granting of a restraining order for a few days without notice would work a hardship on the party enjoined yet the instances are very few i can recall none and i am certain it is the experience of every lawyer in this house that there are many occasions where the prompt action of a court of equity by the issuance of a restraining order without notice and hearing is absolutely indispensable to protect the rights of litigants from irreparable injury but there have been abuses in the issuance of restraining orders in the length of time which they have been allowed to be effective in these days of quick transportation and ready means of communication there is absolutely no need for the life of a restraining order to be extended over one week and the congress ought in the case of federal courts restrict the effectiveness to that or some other short period and provide also that it should not issue except upon giving bond to secure the party enjoined against loss not long after the establishment of this govermuent the leaders of political thought and action in this country divided into two distinct schools upon the question of levying a tax upon imports one advocated the theory of levying a tax upon imports sufficient to pay the expenses of the government and for revenue only it being the idea of its members that the people of this country should buy their goods of every kind needed by them where they could buy cheapest no matter where that might be they utterly disregarded and held in contempt any attempt upon the part of the government through a tax on imports to foster and build up manufacturing industries on our own soil with the cheap labor of europe already in possession to a large degree of the american markets that theory meant if carried into practice that this country would have always remained a purely agricultural country with no great cities and no great manufacturing industries the other school believed in the principle of building manufacturing industries on americn soil for the benefit of american business men american laborers and incidentally of american agriculturists by providing for them a stable and handy market for the products of their farms plantations and ranches the object sought by the latter school was to build up american industries to the point where they could compete with the industries of every country in the world it was never intended by any of the fathers of this school that the duty levied should be other than in truth and fact protective they did not believe that it should be prohibitive or even so high as to enable the american manufacturer to make more than a reasonable profit the republican party at its organization espoused the principle of protection as one of its cardinal principles and it adhered to the ideas of the founders of the school that protection and protection alone was the purpose of the protective tariff and that it should never be used as a means for extortion or the conferring of special privileges or unfair advantage there has grown up among the people of this country a feeling that is so general that it can not be long disregarded by congress if it would do so that the rates of the dingley law are at this time so high in many particulars that they give to some industries the opportunity of extorting unreasonable prices for their products from the public there is a demand that the tariff be revised and it is universally conceded that a revision is to be made so that the question has changed from will there be a revision to what kind of a revision will there be i have the honor to represent a people who will demand that it be a revision that actually revises a mere juggling with words that works no change of the law in fact where rates are excessive will not suffice in such cases they will ask that there be actual reduction or removal of duty entirely according to whether the industry is in actual need of protection the great majority of the people of the west in common with a great majority of the people of the entire country believe just as strongly today as they ever did in the past in the principle of protection although strongly protesting against its use to enable the extortion of unreasonable profits the greatest calamity that could occur to the country in comparison with which all previous financial disasters would sink into insignificance would follow the repeal of all protective duties the person is not yet born who will see the adoption of free trade or tariff for revenue only as the settled policy of this government the democratic party if given absolute power would not commit that crime against the interests of every business man workingman and farmer in this country it would doubtless threaten to do so and after the business of the country was prostrated by the unsettlement of conditions would do as it did the last time it had unrestricted control wind up with the passage of an act recognizing the principle of protection we can not make it too strongly understood that if the republican party revises the tariff it will retain the protective principle that no industry that needs protection need fear for one moment and that only those who behind a tariff wall that shuts out foreign competition have been able to extort unreasonable prices need prepare for a change james a garfield on the floor of this house said of the congress that in 1870 was engaged in a revision of the tariff the great want of industry is a stable policy and it is a significant comment on the character of our legislation that congress has become a terror to the business men of the country and this congress and all succeeding ones should emphasize the fact that the settled policy of this governmeat toward american industries is protection without graft or unfair advantage when we come to the enactment of new tariff laws it is to be hoped that provision will be made to extend the foreign markets for the products of the farms and ranches of the country the american beef steer is today excluded from every european market except the united kingdom and belgium there isno question but wvhat he makes the finest meat of any animal offhis kind and that millions of the hungry of europe who are dining upon the flesh of ancient goats and brokendown horses are anxious for the opportunity to feed upon the juicy steaks and delicious roasts that his carcass produces the american cattle raiser when he takes his cattle to market finds there just two customers the beef trust and the exporter the old days when competitive buyers crowded around him in the stock yards are past if after he sells his cattle to one whom he supposes to be a single purchaser he drops around to the packing houses he sees part of them in the pens of armour co a part in those of swift co and so on he has learned that the only competitor of the beef trust is the export buyer and he is looking to the american congress to provide the means to compel the removal of the barriers that keep his cattle from german french and other european markets when this governmentenacted the dingley law it placed its rates into effect at once as to every country but provided for the negotiation of reciprocal commercial agreements whereby certain concessions might be made to nations with nhich an agreement could be effected the expected has happened every industry receiving the benefits of the dingley tariff and threatened with a reduction of rate by a reciprocity treaty has been able to defeat the ratication of the treaty germany enacted a new tariff law in 1902 but did not put it into effect and with a view of negotiating reciprocal agreements with other nations provided that discretion should be granted the executive as to when it should be enforced the commercial treaty existing until recently between this country and germany was denounced by her in 1905 and notice was given that the high rates of the 1902 law would be enforced against this country on march 1 1006 this has been avoided however by a temporary arrangement that was succeeded by another which will doubtless continue until after the revision of our tariff as is well known germany not alone prohibits the shipment of live cattle from this country but also by unfair sanitary restrictions and customs regulations keeps out of her market a great many of our other meat products and practically all the countries of europe in some manner effect the same result the western livestock producer cries out against these things and he will ask of the next congress when it comes to the revision of the tariff that if it enacts a maximum and minimum tariff it give to the executive the power to use the maximum rate to compel justice to him in the markets of the world and the farmer will join him in the demand that no matter what the form of the tariff act it be of such a kind and character as can be employed to extend the markets for the grain live stock and other products of american farms greater economic changes have occurred in this country in the last thirty years than have occurred since english civilization was planted on this continent these changes have brought great problems for solution they can not all be worked out in a day or a month they are so vast so complicated and so vitally affect the material and political welfare of the nation that haste must be made slowly and they call not alone for the most exalted wisdom but they also demand the exercise of the highest statesmanship and loftiest patriotism the great burden of responsibility for the conduct of the affairs of this nation has rested upon the republican party practically all the time for half a century and that half century of american history is the grandest page in the history of any nation in the world each changing condition has been met by that party under the leadership of abraham lincoln charles sumner f dwin m stanton ulysses s grant james g blaine james a garfield john sherman and william mckinley and other great leaders and they have been met squarely and settled in the ways conducive to the best interests of the american people the old party has not lost either its patriotism or its statesmanship it is still the one single active vital moving force in american politics that has coherence sufficient among its members to enable it to carry out its pledges to the people when the responsibility of government rests upon it it will in its next national convention mark out its programme for the ensuing four years its platform will be one upon which every patriotic american who loves his country and would advance its interests can stand it will pledge justice to capital and labor and it will do it without demagoguery and without attempt to set one clqss against another it will promise a revision of the tariff along protective lines but a revision that will mean a thorough examination into every rate and schedule it will indorso the administration of theodore roosevelt and pledge itself to maintain and continue its policies and as in the past it will keep faith with the american people"], [0.8673887401819229, 0.1326112598180771, 1, "the postmaster in the

has taken a great interest in the matter and has really prepared the resolution which is now pending i might mention other members but i shall not take the time the resolution has for its purpose making the chamber of the house of representatives suitable for a deliberative body it is only necessary to say that the extreme dimensions of this house are 139 feet over the galleries by 93 feet containing an area of nearly 13 000 square feet by all odds the largest legislative hall existing anywhere in the worldthree times as large as the house of commons in england with its 673 members more than twice as large as the chamber of deputies of the french repbblic with its 558 members now it is proposed to put a partition across just this side the door upon the side leading to the cloakrooms and at the corresponding door on the other side that will leave this chamber very much larger than that of the house of coinmons in great britain and larger than the hall of the chamber of deputies in france desks were put in the house originally because of the necessity that members were under of conducting their correspondence while they were in attendance upon the house by a very close vote in 1859 those desks were ordered removed and then by a very close vote the size of the hall not having been changed they were at the session next following again restored mr asher hinds in the forthcoming edition of his book on parliamentary precedents says that the reason given for the restoration of the desks really was the strongest reason for their abolition and that was that the members could frank their documents and write their letters while in attendance upon the house that was an excuse of some validity at that time when they had no private secretaries and were compelled to do a great amount of clerical work themselves and when they had no rooms in close proximity to the house where they might conduct their correspondence today air speaker we have our private secretaries and each member has very near to the house an office where his files and his letters are kept a place to do his corre pondence and there is no reason and no excuse why a member whose duty

can entirely fill the hall we have often had the experience of taking people to the galleries possibly constituents of ours possibly people from other countries who are studying the workings of american institutions and who are ready to look sympathetically upon the workings of the great representative body of the american people and it is almost the invariable rule that they look down upon a scene of noise and confusion and are able to hear nothing that is going on they look down upon a scene similar to that which the imagination of milton pictured in another assembly very different where the noise was so great that it frightened the reign of chaos and old night it is unnecessary to argue that we can not deliberate under such conditions as these nature aims to distribute her
