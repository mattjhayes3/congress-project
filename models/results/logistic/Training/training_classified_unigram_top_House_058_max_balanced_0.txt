to the relief of the tobacco growers of the country by allowing them to stem twist and sell their own products without being required to pay any tax or license thereon this bill though limited in scope was then thought to be the best we should be likely to accomplish in view of its direct influence on the public revenues which were falling below our largely increased expenditures and over the opposition of the tobacco trust which is today reaping such rich harvests from present conditions which they will vigorously oppose any change in on the 17th day of the same month my colleague mr trimble introduced a similar bill and two days thereafter my friend mr ga1ines from tennessee introduced a similar bill and on the 21st of january 1904 my worthy colleague mr stanley introduced a bill going still further on you see we now have four measures pending before this body all looking to the same end and having for their purpose the widening of our markets and the opening up of new fields of competition in the sale and handling of this great aud important crop i will say right here that none of us are wedded to our particular measures and each will gladly support any bill which will offer any sort of relief from existing conditions at the same time we favor the entire repeal of all laws imposing any tax or license on the sale or manufacture of tobacco because it is unjust and an unfair discrimination against one class of our farming and laboring people it being the only direct product of the soil upon which the government lays the hand of tribute although this unjust tax was born of the necessities of war which have long since assed away its burdens and hardships have been patiently borne y an uncomplaining people who begrudge not the support they were paying to the government as long as they had an open and free market with fair and legitimate competition in which to dispose of their products and as long as the taxes gathered from them were used by the government for the just enforcement of the laws and the equal protection of all its citizens but sir new dangers and conditions confront them anew enemy has arisen in their pathway even more greedy and rapacious than the revenue agent and the taxgatherer and this is none other than the tobacco trust which stalks into the market brazen and barefaced saying to the farmer i will fix the prices of your labor and the products of your soil you must sell your tobacco to me at the prices i offer for there is none other in the market to whom you can sell thus having dictated the price at which the farmer must give up the fruits of his toil sweat and labor it turns to the public with equal affrontery and says to the consumer you must pay the price we ask for no one else can supply your wants presenting the spectacle of this heartless creature of the law robbing the farmer when he arbitrarily fixes the prices of his product at less than the cost of production and an unprotected public when it turns to sell it at extortionate rates of profit a very short experience has proven there can be but one solution of this problem if left to work itself out and that is plain and none other than the absolute annihilation of the tobacco industry in this country and the unjust and unwilling transfer of the already meager living of the farmers and laborers in its fields from their hands to the vaults of this monster of human genius the tobacco trust with its 180 000 000 of capital stock it requires no effort to discover the true condition of the tobacco industry of this country just now for the very atmosphere is ladened with petitions from these already longneglected and suffering people beseeching that something be done to enable them to live and support their families by honest toil the fruit of which they may be allowed to gather and enjoy they ask not for alms not for charity not that they be given any special privileges over any other class of men but for simple justice and that they be treated as the farmer who raises corn wheat oats and rye in order that this body may know what the people in the tobacco districts are having to contend with and how hard they are striving to live i want to produce some newspaper clippings giving reports of the condition of the tobacco industry of the different states and ask that they be made part of my remarks first i will read from the courierjournal under date of october 22 1903 shelbyville ky oetobcr2 the burley tobacco growers of shelby county held an enthusiastic meeting here today and perected the county organization of the burley tobacco rowers association which is formed to control the burley tobacco market in the interest of the growers mr leonard drane was elected chairman and mr john c crawford secretary the board of control iscomposed of messrs w l brown john sullivan anda v weakley the county inspector will be elected by the members of the association on october 81 almost every one of the great number of growers present subscribed to the stock of the organization and the association starts off with the brightest prospects in shelby county which is the largest burleytobacco producing county in the world the following resolution was unanimously adopted the shelby county tobacco growers association in mass meeting assembled pledge this organization and its members to stand together for the purpose of widening the doors of competition for the sale of manufactured tobacco we demand a change in the laws or such different construction of them so as to permit the producer to stem and twist his crop without being subjected to any license or tax and also that all taxes on such twisted or other manufactured tobacco be repealed we request all members of congress and all other officers of the government to aid in this work here we have a few honest fearless farmers who like all true kentuckians are not willing to surrender without at least giving battle to the enemy organizing themselves together and risking their fortunes upon the result of the contest which they are forced to fight out alone and single handed can have but one ending and that will be the triumph of wrong and robbery of brute force and avarice over manhood justice and right for in the end in the light of past history i am forced to predict that the shelby county tobacco growers association will have to succumb to the overpowering influence of its dreaded enemythe tobacco trust this conviction is strengthened by reading a letter written me by mr leonard drain who was chosen chairman of that association which i will ask the clerk to read and that it be made a part of my remarks box 161 emixtece ky november 19 1903 hen f a hop~is dear sir i notice with pleasure that you have introduced a bill in congres looking to the relief of the tobacco growers which we most heartily iadorse some of the reasons for which i desire to state the white burley erop sold at an average price for the entire crop in the burley district of 10 to 15 per hundred pounds before the continental and american tobacco companies bought up nearly all the manufacturing plants thereby getting almost comp1eto control of the tobacco manufactur ing industry of the world which enables them without competition to set their own price on leaf tobacco because they use 70 per cent of the crop and also to set their own price on the manufactured product for instance star plug that was made by liggett myers of st louis mo out of tobacco costing twice as much as it does now liggett myers sold at 39 cents per pound now it is sold by continental at 43 cents par pound all other grades of plug etc sold now while the leaf that makes them cost about onethird as much as it used to cost manufacturers yet it is sold at higher prices with bean soup white clay salt and common molasses sea island sugar licorice etc put m it at the rate of about 30 per cent to the weight of the leaf etc bean soup and the white clay have very recently come into the manufacture of tobacco the several rulings prevent the grower from stemming and twisting natural leaf and selling it without paying tax on twist to do which is wrong nor can we make cigars without paying tax which is wrong in fact if there was no tax on manufactured tobacco the trust could not have a monopoly on manufacturing industries of the country if there was no tax on manufactured tobacco the small manufacturers could do business anywhere and we would have more competition for leaf tobacco it would help to remedy present evils if manufacturers were required to pay a graded tax according to amount of business until the grad nal increase of taxes would make it unprofitable to do business beyond a certain amount of business something will have to be done or the tobacco grower will starve to death raising tobacco at the present prices averaging less than 6 per hundred pounds for white burley crop can not be raised so as to make any profit for less than 9 for the entire crop see g g gilbert congressman from shelby county ky he understands the whole situation and i know will gladly help you in this good work i am respectfully"], [0.012617290019989014,

following questions 1 you ask did the fiftysixth or fiftyseventh congress relieve tobacco growers of taxes on tobacco raised by them and if so under what statute and section thereof 2 does the law taxand if so how muchtobacco growers when they stem or twist theirtobacco for their own use or to sell the same 3 can tobacco growers stem or twist their tobacco for their own personal use without paying a tax 4 can tobacco growers stem or twist their tobacco for the purpose of giving it away without paying a tax 5 you ask for the departmental or judicial definition of the term dealer in tobacco 6 you ask for the definition of the term manufacturer of tobacco 7 you ask whether a tobacco grower who stems or twists his tobacco grown on his own farm or purchased from a neighbor is a manufacturer or in other words whether stemming or twisting tobacco is manufacturing mr yerkes replies to these questions as follows from the foregoing premises i am constrained to answer your questions categorically as follows 1 that congress has never imposed a tax on naturalleaf tobacco in the hands of farmers but only upon leaf tobacco which they may have sold directly to consumers 2 under the present law a tax of 6 cents per pound is imposed upon all tobacco stemmed or twisted by a farmer not intended for his own personal use 3 a farmer may stem and twist tobacco for his own use without incurring liability to tax on such tobacco 4 stemming or twisting tobacco is regarded as manufacturing and a grower or planter can not lawfully stem or twist his tobacco for sale or for the purpose of giving it away without payment of tax if he should engage in that business he would be regarded as a manufacturer of tobacco and e required to qualify as such by registering with the collector of the district filing statement and bond and to pack label and stamp his product as provided by regulations no 8 pages 5 and 6 5 every person whose businessit is to sell or offer for sale manufactured tobacco snuff or cigars shall be regarded as a dealer in tobacco 6 my answer to question 4 is an answer to question 7 7 the term manufacturer of tobacco is defined in the first and second paragraphs of section 695 act of august 241 154 amending revised statutes 224 which section 69 provides that every parson whose businessrit is to manufacture tobacco or snuff for himself or who employs others to manufacture tobacco or snuff whether such manufacture be by cutting pressing grinding crushing or ruhhing of any raw or leaf tobacco or otherwise preparing raw or leaf tobacco or manufactured or partially manufactured tobacco or snuff or the putting up for use or consumption of scraps waste clippings stems or deposits of tobacco resulting from any process of handling tobacco or by the working or preparation of leaf tobacco tobacco stems scraps clippings or waste by sifting twisting screening or any other process shall be regarded as a manufacturer of tobacco the second paragraph of that section provides thatevery person shaalso be regarded as a manufacturer of tobaco whose business it is to sell leaf tobacco in quantities less than a hogshead ease or bale or who sells directly to consumers or to persons other than duly registered dealers in leaf tobacco or duly registered manufacturers of tobacco snuff or cigars or to persons who purchase in packages for export and all tobacco so sold by such persons shall be regarded as manufactured tobacco and such manfactured tobacco shall be put up and prepared bv such manufacturer in such packagcs only as the commissioner ofnteirnal mvenuc with the approval of the secretary of the treasury shall prescribe provided that farmers and growers of tobacco who sell leaf tobacco of their own growth and raising shall not be regarded as manufacturers of tobacco and so much of section 3244 of the revised statutes of the united states and nets amendatory thereof as are in conflict with this act are hereby repealed commenting on these sections the commissioner says in the first paragraph every person is regarded as a manufacturer of tobacco who in any manner prepares his leaf tobacco for consumption by crushing twisting stemming grinding or otherwise changing the tobacco from its natural condition in the second paragraph every person is regarded as a manufacturer of tobacco who sells and dlivers his leaf tobacco in its natural condition to consumers or to persons other than registered dealers in leaf tobacco manufacturers of tobacco or cigars or persons who buy leaf tobacco in packages for export and all leaf tobacco so sold by such person is regarded as a manufactured tobacco subject to tax but there is this exception that farmers and growers are not to be regarded as manufacturers for selling leaf tobacco of their own growth and raising by even changing the tobacco from its natural condition except by curingi it in the usual way the producer becomes a manufacturer and liable for a tax as a manufacturer the first tax on cigars chewing and smoking tobacco was levied in july 1862 on cigarettes in 1864 pndon dealers manufacturers and producers in 1868 you will all remember particularly some of you gentlemen who are a little more grayhaired than i that this internalrevenue tax on tobacco is a war tax possibly the distinguished gentleman now occupying the chair is perfectly familiar with these enactments it will be remembered that congress passed or undertook to pass in 1861 or 1862 a tax on both cotton and tobacco for the purpose of providing means for crushing the confederate states out of that spirit of legislation out of the desire as it were to crush the confederacy and the civil war of forty years ago this tax was firstlevied on tobacco and that tax gentlemen has remained upon the statute books in different forms down to the present hour of this year of our lord 1903 we allow any person to shell his corn and sack it and take it to town and sell it as i have done we allow a man to gin his cotton and separate the seed from the cotton take the cotton to town and sell itseed and all but we do not tax the manwho shells or sacks his corn we do not tax the cotton grower who gins and sells his cotton why in the name of heaven is the tobacco man the tobacco grower required to pay the burdensome tax of 6 cents for stemming and twisting his tobacco to sell or give away when today that same tobacco is selling in the leaf at 4 and 5 cents a pound hence it is that the farmers in tennessee and kentucky and virginia north carolina missouri and i dare say the farmers of connecticut pennsylvania and new york indeed throughout the united states are crying out against such an unnecessary and oppressive lawa war tax in time of peace if you please it is not simply a tax or a burden but it has gotten to the point where the farmer must raise something else if he can in his tobadco fields because he can not raise 4cent tobacco and sell it in the leaf or twist it and pay 6 cents tax on it and make a living there is this much about the tobacco soil and my handsome able and eloquent friend from kentucky who does me the honor to listen to me and who knows more about the tobacco soil than i can correct me if i am in error in this that is the farsher can not raise anything else profitably on tobacco soil except tobacco isnotthatso the gentleman from kentucky is doubtless versed in tobacco and tobacco soil and is thoroughly familiar with all the pains the tobacco farmer undergoes in taking care of his crop in killing the worms and doing various other things looking after it daily as lie would a sick infant yet that farmer has to pay a tax of 6 cents a pound if he undertakes to twist that tobacco for anybody except himself when his tobacco is selling and was selling the other day in louisville and in clarksville a tobacco market in my own district at 4 and 5 cents a pound here in a time of peace when we have to take our tax money out of the overflowing treasury and place it in the banks of the country in order that it may be put in circulation and prevent panics we have an oppressive civilwar taxnot simply a tax levied for revenuebut a war tax vigorously enforced forty years after the law was first enacted and the civil war ended the secretary of the treasury in his able report makes a most remarkable statement which i do not undertake for a moment to dispute he says that notwithstanding the fact that we repealed in 1902 what is lmown as the spanishwar tax for the purpose of reducing the internal taxation nevertheless last year 1903 the internal revenue amounted to sixty millions more than it did in 1898 before we enacted the spanishwar tax here is his language the total receipts for the fiscal year which ended june 30 1898 were 170 866 819 36 for the fiscal year ending june 30 1903 230 740 925 22 i will read all secretary shaw says on the subject at page 29 of his last report"],

ahead are you going to stand pat on the currency i want you to tell me that now there seems to be a whole lot of you who want the passage of the fowler bill there seems to be a whole lot of you who want the passage of the aldrich bill and some of you want a 6 per cent tax on bank currency for an emergency circulation now i am a fellow of a modest mind and i introduced a bill and sent it to the proper committee the chairman of which is one man that i am looking to more for relief than anybody else and that bill simply says that where the government puts united states money in banks and lets them use it to make them pay some interest on it that is all that instead of choosing united states government depositories by a rule that nobody understands a rule within the sense of equity of the secretary of the treasury or the comptroller you should fix by law a rule of common sense and under it get interest on such of the peoples money as is being used by rich capitalists you all remember that a long time ago old judge coke said equity was an uncertainty that it depended upon the length of the boot or shoe of the chancellor because depending on his discretion in each case was no better so this principle of selecting united states depositories is so uncertain that it might as well depend upon the boot of the officer or the shoe of the officer who is to select the depository it is a system of absolute favoritism or at any rate there is nothing in the written law to prevent its becoming such a system a system of absolute favoritism now i do not mean to say that it is always absolute favoritism in practice because i am free to admit that there has been generally a considerable degree of fairnessmore than was perhaps ordinarily to be expected but i do mean to say that the power is theirs to select friends and to put the money into the banks of friends without a cent of interest now why not let those banks have the money which have firstfirst mind you deposited selfsufficing and absolutely selfsufficing and independent security for the repayment of the principalso that no matter whether the bank continues in business or fails the principal will be certainly repaid to the united states government and then with the different banks bidding upon that sort of prerequisite proposition wi h that sort of security deposited beforehand give it to those banks under certain limitations of amounts which bid the highest rate of interest what would be the advantage of that why the advantage would be instead of the money going to the great congested money centers to be lent to speculators for booming industrials or exploiting windswollen swindling trusts or for bearing and bulling agricultural produce on change it would go to the parts of the country that need money most and could therefore afford to pay the highest rate of interest for it i have not a doubt that you could get from 2 to 3 per cent on call for every dollar that is lying in the treasury with banks that would deposit as security outside of their capital stock outside of their credit as banks ample collateral to secure it beyond all peradventure of a doubt are you going to stand pat on that too are you going to continue forever to lend the peoples money to the banks of the country with no rate of interest at all by the way what is there democratic or republican in the idea that the only banksthat can borrow money free from the government of the united states if any are to be helped for nothing in that way or if you change it and make it more just and right and charge them interest what is there democratic or republican or american or fair in restricting the individuals so favored to the class of national banks it would seem that anybody who gives equal interest ought to have an equal chance for security or for a loan are you going to stand pat on lending millionaires millions without interest now my friends another subject are you going to stand pat on the trusts why it begins to look like you were there is not anything i can find in the presidents message in any way about the trusts except he says that publidity will cure it all now i appeal to my frienda fairerminded man never existedappeal to my friend from connecticut and other people of that sort do you believe that allowing a corporationto fix up its assets and liabilities and make a public statement of them will particularly hurt a dishonest corporation will it not on the contrary frequently give them the advantage of seeming to have the fiat of public approval did you ever know a national bank to fail that had not published shortly before a magnificent statement and the statement had been indorsed and approved by its officers and some bank examiner publicity is all rightwe ought to have it light is always good light does more to prevent crime than policemen do in all the cities in this country but to rely upon it solely to prevent the enormous extortion of these trusts to prevent what is worse than extortion regular public swindles organized under the laws of new jersey or some other state for the purpose of taking in the unco guid the unwary and innocent people the lambs publishing immense prospectuses that they have two millions or two billions of capital when they have not thirty thousand dollars in their vaults when they have not cash enough to furnish operating expenses for a year as was the case with the shipping trust are you going to do nothing about that are you going to stand pat on that now i have introduced a bill the bill is not perfect and since introducing it i would like to amend it in several particulars but the idea of the bill is this to punish public swindling and public cheats engaged in interstate commerce for if the immense overcapitalization enabling lying prospectuses amounts to a swindle to the people to whom they sell stock then it is a swindle upon the people generally all over this country gentlemen may say that it would only protect stockholders but i tell you this government armed with the power to regulate interstate commerce ought to protect even the stockholders from these miserable exploiters of wall street or elsewhere who make up these combinations who float bonds and securities freely at the expense of the public upon a public lie are you going to stand pat on that are you going to stand pat again against all the recommendations of the interstate commerce commission on december 15 1903 i introduced a bill to accomplish an ther recommendation of that commission and this seems to me reasonable enough now i want the country to know whether you are going to stand pat against it or some legislation calculated to accomplish the same end here is the bill be it enacted etc that no person firm or corporation or association of individuals or association of corporations engaged in interstate commerce shall make it a condition of the sale of goods wares or merchandise that the purchaser shall not sell or deal in the goods wares or merchandise of any other person firm corporation or association of natural or artificial persons p~rovided that this act shall not he construed to prohibit the appointment of agents or sole agents for the sale of goods wares or merchandise m assachusetts statutes june 7 1l90t any v iolationof the provision of this act shall he held to he a contract in restraint of trade among the several states under the provisions of section 1 of the act entitled an act to protect trade and commerce against unlawful restraints and monopolies approved july 2 1850 and every person who shall be a partyto said contract in violation of thisact shall on conviction thereof be adjudged guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished by fine not exceeding 5 1500 or by imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or by both said puishments in the discretion of the court and shall be subject to snch other penalties forfeitures and suits in equity and actions at law as are prescribed in sections 4 5 6 and 7 of an act entitled an act to protect trade and commerce against unlawful restraints and monopolies approved july 2 18930 the bill is simply to forbid and to penalize a faorite system of the trusts of refusing to sell to a person firm or corporation unless the former will promise and stand bound not to deal in like goods sold by anyone other than the trust or not to sell to certain person obnoxious to the trust as competitors of theirs the bill simply forbids trusts to use an industrial bludgeon to kill competitors are you going to stand pat against this measure or something like it and thereby stand pat in favor of a continuance of the interstate commercial method now pursued by the sugar trust standard oil trust and steel trust this bill introduced by me after consultation on this side is almost literally a copy of a massachusetts statute and therefore has a republican origin dare you deny the justice equity or necessity underlying it what a poor card to stand pat on is the evil it strikes at here is another bill introduced after much consultation with colleagues on this side let me read it a bill to empower the interstate commerce commission to fix transportation rates in certain contingencies be it enacted etc that when hereafter the interstate commerce commission shall declare a given rate for transportation of freight or passengers unreasonable it shall be the duty of the commission and it is hereby authorized to perform that duty to declare at the same time what would be a reasonable rate in lieu of the rate declared unreasonable sec 2 that whenever in consequence of the decision of the interstate commercce commission a rate has been established and declared as reasonable and litigation shall ensue because of such decision the rate fixed by the interstate commerce commission shall continue as the rate to be charged by the transportation company during the pendency of the litigation and until the decision of the interstate commerce commission shall be held to be error on a final judgment of the questions involved by the united states court having proper jurisdiction that is h r 6768 introduced december 10 1903 it merely asks that the present absurd condition of things in connection with the interstate commerce commission be done away with i refer to this condition the interstate commerce commission has power to declare a given rate when the question concerning what it ought to be is before the commission to be unreasonable and to forbid the railroads from collecting that rate say it is 50 cents the railroad changes it to 49 cents the commission declares 49 cents unreasonable and the railroad changes it to 48 cents each time the shipper or a new shipper must lodge a new complaint and so on if the railroad chooses ad infinitum there stands that interstate commerce commission acting under a law so puerile and childish that the commission has the power to declare a given rate or charge unreasonable but is without any legal power to declare what rate would in its stead be reasonable that is not all as a consequence of the puerility of the law when the commission declares 50 cents unreasonable let us say then the railroad can immediately have it reviewed in another court or otherwise they instigate litigation and motions demurrers bills crossbills etc go on and on and on and in the interim the railroad is benefited by being permitted to continue charging the rate declared unreasonable the railroad receives the benefit of the doubt of what the final judgment may be and not this tribunal erected by this great government the shipper must pay in pendente lite to the railroad paying what the interstate commerce commission has denounced as unreasonable we propose upon this side to say this that whenever the interstate commerce commission pronounces a given rate unreasonable they shall have then and there the power to fix in its stead a reasonable rate and this rate shall be operative until on final judgments by proper proceedings in the proper federal court the finding of the commission shall be overruled it is not arming them with the power to make an omnibus schedule all over the country but wherever on question raised by complaint or otherwise they declare a given rate to be unreasonable they shall then have the power to state what is a reasonable rate and furthermore that that rate shall be operative until it is set aside by due process of law that is all i do not think myself that any small body of men could arrange or ought to be empowered to arrange an omnibus schedule for so vast a country with such divergent sectional interests as ours are you going to stand pat against this plainly just demand of the interstate commerce commission too my friend mr adamson of georgia the senior democratic member of the committee on interstate and foreign commerce has introduced a bill simply embodying all the recommendations of the interstate commerce commission that and nothing else you need not adopt all of them but some of them surely are worthy of adoption some of them ought to be indorsed will you stand pat against all of them now i see before me a manthe sledge hammer of the republican party a man of weight in every way a man in my opinion of justice mr hepburn of iowa chairman of the committee on interstate and foreign commerce and i do not believe that he is going to allow his committee to be held back by purely partisan considerations with the idea of standing pat without doing some of the things that the interstate commerce commission recommend iwant to see what you are going to stand pat on are you going to stand pat upon the executive investigation of the admitted rottenness in the postoffice department are you going to abdicate your functions as a congress to supervise and correct and check and clean the executive departments and see that their work is honestly carried on now do not misunderstand me i shall never be the sewer of any anonymous charges or quasianonymous charges or confidential charges against the character and good name of any man i do not believe that republicans as a class are any more dishonest than democrats but i do believe this that when a party has been in power as long as has been the republican party then unless it is awfully particular and careful and goes beyond expected lines even in punishing corruption and rottenness in its ranks the natural judgment of mankind will be that its members have been in so long and are so coherent in illegalities that they can not reform themselves are you going to leave the question of punishing postoffice thieves and robbers to their friends as well as the revision of the tariff to its friends the other day i was talking to one of my friends over there on that side and he said john arent you afraid if they get to looking into that thing too closely they will hit somebody on your own side i said if they look into it deep enough and they find a man on my side that ought to be hit i hope they will do it and when they do i will not wait for you to lead the attack i will lead the charge and when we have pitched him out of the windows of this body metaphorically we will have broken every miserable political bone he has in his body now gentlemen i do not charge you with trying to cover up this thing but i do charge you with lack of sufficient energy you seem to be threatened with premonitory symptoms of investigation paresis why was it otherwise that you

before yesterday by the distinguished gentleman from pennsylvania with the following statement in the course of his speech i congratulate the democratic party that since november last it has discovered that the man in the white house is a good man not only for the republicans but for the democrats to follow it very naturally becomes my duty as well as my pleasure to inquire who is leading and who is following it is not sir so much a question of who leads as an inquiry does he lead right is roosevelt leading the democracy or has he come to understand from the mutterings of discontent throughout the republic that the democratic party was right and has gone to the head of its columns and is leading its troopers we know a party by its declarations in national convention and i shall now divert to the declarations of the democratic party in its national councils and see what faith it held upon this great question of the proper and just regulation of railroad rates by law in 1896 the democracy announced its faith upon this question in these words the absorption of wealth by the few the consolidation of our leading railroad systems the formation of trusts and pools require a stricter control bv the federal government of these arteries of commerce we demand the enlargement of the powers of the interstate commerce commission and such rectrictions and guaranties in the control of railroads as will protect the people from robbery and oppression what did the republican party say in 1806 upon this great question you will search their platform in vain to find one single sentence in this direction but they were as quiet as the tomb and offered to the people no relief along these lines again in 1900 the same democracy met in national convention and its belief upon this question was as follows we favor such an enlargement of the scope of the interstatecommerce law as will enable the commission to protect individuals and communities from discriminations and the public from unjust and unfair transportation rates again i ask the question what position did the republican party take in its national convention you will read again in unrewarded and hopeless effort to discover a single utterance upon this allimportant subject in 1904 the democratic party again in national convention proclaimed its belief upon this issue in the following language we demand an enlargement of the powers of the interstate commerce commission to the end that the traveling public and shippers of this country may have prompt and adequate relief for the abuses to which they are subjected in the matter of transportation we demand a strict enforcement of existing civil and criminal statutes against all such trusts combinations and monopolies and we demand the enactment of such further legislation as may be necessary to effectually suppress them any trust or unlawful combination engaged in interstate commerce which is monopolizing any branch of business or production should not be permitted to transact business outside of the state of its origin whenever it shall be established in any court of competent jurisdiction that such monopolization exists such prohibition should be enforced through comprehensive laws to be enacted on the subject i come again and inquire what declaration the republican party made in its convention which nominated president roosevelt here you will read again in futile effort to discover a single word upon this subject therefore i ask who is leading and who is following the truth is that roosevelt is leading this fight but he is wearing the uniform of democracy wielding its trenchant sword and bearing its color lance for history tells mehistory whose moving finger writes and having writ moves on nor all your piety nor wit shall lure it back to cancel half a line nor all your tears blot out one word of itthat in three great contests the democracy was agitating this great question throughout the length and breadth of the republic bold fearless and aggressive daring to invite the enmity of the railroads with their twelve billions of capital by declaring for equal protection for 80 000 000 of her people and in 1896 we beheld the unmatched and brilliant bryan standing in the wilderness crying out to the people through his platform for this regulation by law for this control of these great arteries of commerce and i charge today that roosevelt has taken this plank out of the democratic platform that bears the bloody stain of bryans faithful feet and is holding it up to this congress as a panacea for existing woes and i come now asking that you shall render unto coesar the things that are coesars we all recall how fiercely how mercilessly the railroads of this country fought bryan and the democratic party in these last campaigns they saw at a glance the purpose of the democratic party to demand of them just and fair rates and as the president has so happily put it an equal chance for every man and they triumphed or caused the republican party to triumph in 1896 and in 1900 but while we went down in defeat this great issue for which we fought and fell still lives and rises with renewed strength advocated by an unexpected champion why did not the republican platform contain some declaration in 1904 upon this issue were the railroads too strong in that great convention we all know the president is a brave man and a strenuous man why did he not call your republican national conventions attention to it in that year then you were standing pat upon existing legislation you feared the wrath of this great foe but i beg you to imagine the courage of the democracy of this country as it has written it in three great campaigns this question has not burst upon the people like a meteor it has been a constant burning red light of danger in the political firmament the democratic party saw it and quickly and fearlessly called attention to it how time does change conditions what bryan contended for in this regard was denominated by every carping critic in the land as anarchism but in roosevelt the same declaration is greeted as patriotism of the highest type we do not intend to desert our ground we are delighted if i may be permitted to appropriate the presidents own vernacular with the accession of such a bold and fearless leader as theodore roosevelt we welcome him to the head of the column and behind him the democracy will walk with unfaltering step whether the band plays dixie or yankee doodle that the railroads should be regulated none familiar with the facts can safely deny they are the worlds great commercial highways and with their more than 200 000 miles of steel belting the republic reaching into every part and parcel of the land having their life given to them by law franchised into existence aided by gift to millions upon millions of acres of the peoples land with millions upon millions of dollars of the peoples money by subscription given the right of eminent domain the right to bridge our rivers and cross our plains they can not now deny the right of the government to ask them that they deal in mercy with its children charging them for transportation a fair just and reasonable rate more than thirty states in this union so far as possible which is only within their own borders have passed laws regulating the transportation charges of railroads our courts have uniformly held that such right was inherent in government the constitution of the united states itself declares that congress shall have the right to regulate commerce between the states we hear considerable said about a commission to pass upon the reasonableness of a rate i submit that it is better for the government to take a hand in saying what is a reasonable rate than to leave it to the scant charity of the railroads themselves it is a fact of common knowledge and of current history that the railroads of this country have divided off the united states so far as the classification of rates is concerned into four parts the first contains the territory north of the ohio river and east of chicago and the mississippi river the second the territory south of the ohio and potomac rivers and east of the mississippi third the territory west of chicago and the mississippi river fourth competitive traffic to and from the pacific coast and the representatives of the various railroads in these respective parts have their meetings each year and agree upon various charges for the various kinds of freight while of course they sternly disavow any pooling or trust along this line yet it is a fact worthy of comment that they all issue a schedule or tariff of the same rate for the same class of freight to and from the same points and all are effective on the same day of the same year yet of course these meetings are purely advisory and nothing intended if they are to be believed in agreeing upon the charges to be made upon the public and i bubmit sir that it is better for the law to take a hand in these matters than to leave it to such combinations who have it iii their power to destroy communities destroy cities destroy farms or to build up communities and cities at their pleasure by such pools or combinations they deny to the farmer the business man or the shipper the benefit of competition among themselves such competition as the farmer has to meet when he sells his corn wheat or other product of the soil this illegal combination or pooling of railroads in a trust places every shipper in the country at their mercy the soil may yield abundantly providence may be bounteous with sunshine and rain the farmer may toil without ceasing yet the fruition of his labor when it is gathered depends upon the charity of the railroads to reach the market they can blast his hopes as effectually and as thoroughly as an untimely frost or a blighting drought they can raise the rates and gather into their overflowing coffers as much as their unsatisfied maw may desire i believe that when a rate is once established by the interstate commerce commission as just and reasonable it ought to be placed in effect immediately becauge if you do not do this many kinds of perishable products would spoil before the question could be finally determined not only should this rate go into effect at the earliest practicable moment but it should not be suspended by a temporary restraining order which is ex parte in its hearing but it should only be suspended if at all by injunction issued after notice to the commission and full hearings upon the facts the bill of the majority in my judgment is fatally defective here because we all know that an injunction or temporary restraining order is the common resort always used by the corporations in proceedings in court and they would be quite ready to make showing upon ex parte hearings that would ordinarily give a restraining order but let notice be given let all the facts be heard and then let the restraining order issue if at all this will tend to accelerate the hearing of these complaints the railroads will not undertake to rest with their restraining orders charging an exorbitant rate but they will be quick to the courts and the justice of the matter swiftly determined in another particular in my judgment the bill of the majority commonly known as the eschtownsend bill is defective and that is in not providing an imprisonment penalty you provide in this law only a penalty by fine i say we ought to go back to the old idea in this country that the rich ought not to be permitted to purchase immunity from punishment by the payment of a fine you amended this law with the elkins bill and the only amendment in reality that was effective was the one that took from it the penalty of imprisonment in the penitentiary or the placing of stripes upon these great violators of the law let these big violators of the law see niside of the penitentiary and observe its dissimilarity from the seashore resorts and they will have some respect for the law of this land let a picture be taken of one or two of them in stripes instead of in automobiles and then sir we will have the poor of the country telling us that the law is administered alike upon every citizen suppose you fine themwhats done they can raise the rate and let it be paid back by the people but when you put stripes on them they can not make the people take their place if a farmer breaks into one of their offices and robs them of their money he has violated the law and ought to be punished yet without any ceremony and with very little discussion the stripes are placed upon him but when these millionaires violate the law by confiscating virtually the products of his farm the fine is all you will impose upon them and it wont do to say that if the penitentiary penalty is placed in this law it is ineffectual because you can not convict on account of the enormity of the penalty that is simply to saythat you are dealing with a class of criminals so hardened and conscienceless that if the penalty is great they will add to their already violation of the law the great crime of perjury and shield themselves from punishment but if the penalty is minimum its an inducement to them not to resort to perjury to escape but to tell the truth and pay off the fine if this argument is carried to its finality the same logic applied would make us place the penalty for murder at a 50 fine because it would be more easily inflicted than the death penalty and less resorts to perjury would be taken even with these defects i regard the bill known as the eschtownsend bill presented by the majority a great improvement over the laws now existing because it empowers the interstate commerce commission not only to declare a rate unreasonable but to declare what is a reasonable rate it gives them power to act and enforce their findings i think it creates an unnecessary court to which appeals from their judgment are taken i think the railroads should go from the interstate commerce i commission only upon the constitutionality of their action and then to the same court that the humblest citizen in the republic has to resort to i think the bill offered by the democratic minority is a far better measure than the eschtownsend bill and i shall vote for the bill which was indorsed by the democratic caucus but failing in its adoption i intend to support the bill presented by the majority as a step in the right direction as half a loaf offered if we can get no more i say that we are glad to welcome the president to the democratic platform many good planks are in it and as he is now securely fixed in the presidential chair for the term for which he was elected no more to be a candidate as he himself has declared let him become the tribune of the poor let him wield the righteous sword of the common people i look forward to the time when he will send a message to congress saying that he wants this house to reform the tariff and put all trustmade articles on the free list that he will go further and say that all articles manufactured in this country that are protected by a tariff and sold to foreigners cheaper than to citizens of this country shall be placed upon the free list that he will ask us to effectually destroy the trusts by denying them the right of interstate commerce and saying that when the fact is ascertained in any court of competent jurisdiction that an article is trustized it shall not be sold outside of the state of its production and that he will ask us to deny them the use of the united states malls that he will take a fearless stand for the suppression of private monopolies all these planks are in the democratic platform we are willing to follow him along these lines let him send a message to this house saying that we ought to go back to the pristine days when the immense fortunes of this country did not escape taxation when the tax gatherer visited the palaces of the rich as well as the hovels and cottages of the poor and let him ask us to rehabilitate the incometax law and place it upon the statute book and see if the supreme court with its change of personnel has not changed its position upon this most equitable of all ways to defray the burdens of government we know that the soldiers of the united states followed roosevelt gallantly when he charged san juan hill but no more bravely sir than the democrats will follow him when he charges the vanderbiltmforgancassattharrimanhills of wealth and greed in this republic with

right that ought to be preserved intact for very important occasions when it is well and necessary perhaps to rivet the attention of the country upon some great legislative wrong and that it ought not to be frittered away on small occasions as far as the present interesting fight between the republican senate and the republican house is concerned we upon this side have not much to say except to say that it is not our fight it illustrates better than anything else great as the arena is how much can be made out of tweedledum and tweedledee as to which one of these great bodiesyour senate and your house of representativesis excelling the other in the inutility of results of dictation i am not prepared now to say although i feel somewhat impelled to give the benefit of the doubt to the higher housethat american house of lords i have as a representative on this floor a good deal of sympathy with the rebellion of the house at all times against the dictation of the senate but the management of this particular rebellion is not our affair now if it be admitted that the senate is right or if it be admitted that the house is right and if we are going to stay here until the regular session comes about by the action of either or both then to use the words of a great former speaker of this house mr reedi the house ought to do business of some sort and when the republican party stands here legislatively inactive i protest against it from this side of the chamber as a confession of their unwillingness or their incompetency to do the business of the country if they can not ride or dare not ride let them get out of the saddle the country can find somebody who can ride now i am not complaining about general business i know that the speaker has not had the opportunity to appoint all the committees but some few have been appointed and those are ready for business now the ways and means committee for example is ready right now important propositions are pending before that committee these two houses in session are costing this country a good deal of money some slight compensation for the waste of time and expense of money which is being incurred might be made by having the ways and means committee do business and by having this house do business well do i remember how in the fiftythird congress the gentleman from new york backed by the then representative from maine mr reed was constantly ringing the changes upon democratic business incompetency upon the idea that the democratic house was afraid to trust a democratic senate and that both were afraid to trust a democratic president my friends the poisoned chalice commends itself to your own lips today you are afraid to trust a republican senate a republican senate is afraid to trust you and you are both afraid to trust a republican president the country stands here demanding that legislation progress demanding that great evils be swept out of existence demanding with a voice almost unanimous from republicans as well as democrats that the tariff shall be revised at least to the extent of ceasing to be a shelter for extortionate trusts and yet you stand here with the ways and means committee organized for that especial sort of business and yet doing nothing you come here upon a great reciprocity idea you boast that it is the idea of mckinley and roosevelt yet reciprocity with cuba is as nothing in importance compared with reciprocity with canada there is now lying in the room of the committee on ways and means a resolution saying that this house would view with pleasure and would indorse initiative steps taken by the president to reconvene the joint high commission in order that we may have amicable freer and less trammeled trade relations with our great neighbor to the north all over new england the people republicans as well as democrats are demanding this the people are tired of the absurd position where upon one part of the border we are importing products from canada and the american consumer is being taxed in order that we shall do it and on another part of the same imaginary line canada is importing from us exactly the same things and the canadian consumer is being taxed in order that he may get those products there is another thing while we are sleeping this world is going on chamberlain with his propaganda in great britain is advancing step by step he ought not to succeed but i am afraid he will succeed because he is appealing to the most active and aggressive passion in the human breast the passion of hatred once evokedretaliation the feeling that we have done injustied to great britainthat we have inaugurated a tariff war and that she ought to enter the listshas been appealed to there is but one way to break down chamberlains propaganda of preferential rates for the colonies that is to give all countries in this world which are now admitting or may hereafter admit free of tariff duty the natural products of the united states a differential to pay them for doing this in order that they may continue to do it and that others may undertake the same policy our trade is of more importance to great britain than that of her colonies if the western farmer and the southern farmer findas they will after a whilethat they have been cut off by legislative inactivity from the british marketto which we export 50 per cent of all our products that are exported at allthey will wake up to the idea that a blind standpat prohibitiveduty policy has two ends to it not only the end of taxation of the american consumer here but the other end the end of narrowing and restiicting the volume of exports practicable or possible for the american exporter into the british market wait until the people feel it as they are beginning to feel it when all these natural products of the west shall feel it when the products of my state and the other parts of the south will feel it i appeal to you and i appeal to the republican side of

as i have had these last few weeks and i know that it has been almost impossible for me to work out the chinese puzzle which we have had presented to us ovdr here i know that he could not have done any better or gone any faster about committee assignments and house organization for general business but the ways and means committee is here and has been appointed two weeks let us do sich business as we can do and that business is of the most important character i appeal to you and i appeal to the republicans of the rouse in the very memorable words of thomas b reed in a democratic congress for

you afraid bf are you afraid of the ways and means committee what are the individual members of the ways and means committee afraid of are they afraid of one another why there never was so compactly organized a republican body since the world began as the majority in that committee they need not be afraid of one another of course i know that now and then they pass one another as the ancient roman augurs did and quietly wink or smile one u ntleman intending to convey the idea to the other that while they are fooling the world they are not fooling one another but at the same time they are true to every republican precept of prohibitive tariff legislation surely they might move forward in the line of another great policy which i claim to be the policy of democracy and of jefferso but which you claim to be the policy of mr mckinley and of mr roosevelt the policy of using the 20 per cent margin in your own tariff billthe dingley billfor the purpose of procuring wider and more extensive

administration or legislation is claimed for it and to hear its representatives prate of prosperity and progress one might imagine that the world would stop moving and the sun and moon stand still and the stars grow dim should the republican party cease to exist or loose its hold on the reins of the government not satisfied with being the source and fountain from which has sprung all our other monopolies it claims a monopoly in all the virtues in all that is true and beautiful and useful in life if our farmers who work from early dawn until the dim twilight of the evening are blessed by sunshine and shower and thereby produce bqlnteens crops credit for the resulting prosperity is claimed by the republican party if our laborers in the workshops and mines and on our railroads by the use of brain and grit and energy keep the wheels of industry moving no credit is given them but all is claimed by the republican party if there are new inventions which benefit mankind and if there are new discoveries and the mountains are made to yield up their wealth the republican party claims the credit but there is one thing that has happened since i have teen here that republicans are not boasting of and which they are not inclined to set up on a high pinnacle in full view of the public gazethat is the fraud and corruption under this administration though they speak the word of praise and boasting yet will they be judged by their record we have an intelligent people and they are beginning to inquire why it is that more than 70 per cent of the wealth of the united states is owned by 9 per cent of the people while 29 per cent of the wealth is all that is left for 91 per cent of the population our farmers and laborers are inquiring why it is that after unremitting toil they go on from year to year and from administration to administration without bettering their condition they are waking up to their rights and interests they are beginning to discover the fallacy of the republican pretenses and they are preparing to tear away the hypocritical and deceptive mask under which the republican party has heretofore taken shelter the administration of our national affairs presents a condition of things of which the country has no reason to be proudone great department of the government reeking with corruption and in another great frauds and crimes involving millions of acres of land worth vast sums of money at first the people stood aghast amazed at the stupendousness of official debauchery now they are demanding a thorough searching and unsparing investigation i

concerning the public service is of more importance than ever before in our history the country is called upon now if ever it will be to reset the standards of official conduct at least to hold them up impressively and imperatively the principle of representative public servicepublic service for the peoples sake public service in the public interest as against private interestis at stake the

cleaned out the postal scandals lifted it revealing smoke and smell and then it fell back again what answer are you going to make to the people when they ask you why the lid was not pried off at washington what response will you make when they ask you why it was that every democrat voted in favor of an investigation and every republican against it what reason can you give for drawing around the guilty the mantle of secrecy you can not say that corruption does not exist in the postoffice department you have no evidence that all the frauds in that department have been exposed you know and the country knows that there has been corruption and crime there of the grossest character the president in his annual message which he sent to us at the beginning of this congress said through frauds forgeries and per juries and by shameless briberies the aws relating to the proper conduct of the public service in general and to the due administration of the postoffice department have been notoriously violated that message reached us in the early part of november and notwithstanding the president tells you that frauds forgeries and shameless briberies exist in the postoffice department you have prevented the investigation of that department demanded by the country efnd demanded by every democrat on the floor of this house when the bristow report came in many of you joined with the democrats in denouncing the officials in that department they were charged with being thieves grafters corruptionists liars and coldblooded and malicious libelers it was charged that the administration of that department of the government had been such as was calculated to encourage fraud and corruption and the establishment of a system of graft while providing at the same time the means for securing immunity for the boodler and yet you vote against resolutions for an investigation you invoke technical points of order against an amendment to the postoffice appropriation bill providing for the appointment of a committee to investigat6 and report to this house you rise up in righteous indignation in denunciation of the corruptionist but you close the door against hi exposure i am not one who is ready to condemn a party for every wrong done by a member of that party if a man is a thief or a rogue being a democrat will not make him respectable and if he is a bribe giver or bribe taker or boodler being a republican should be no protection to him in his iniquity i believe an honest man will be an honest man under all circumstances and environments but whenever a party undertakes to cover up wrongdoing whenever a party seeks to shield the criminal or to condone or mitigate his offense that moment the party becomes and should be held accountable i believe that the massesthe great majority of our people in both partiesare thoroughly honest and believe in an honest administration of public affairs in the sincerity and earnestness of their convictions they place such a high estimate upon integrity that they are unwilling that any of the technicalities and niceties of parliamentary procedure should be allowed to stand in the way of the exposure of the wrongdoer and they are right whenever corruption exists in a municipal assembly or in the legislature of a state or in congress or in any department of the government or anywhere it should be brought to light and the guilty punished no quarter should be shown the official who betrays the people and who proves faithless to the trust confided in him he should be exposed that the odium of his guilt may be made to rest upon him he should be brought to justice and made to suffer the consequences of his evil acts every attempt made by this side of the house to secure an investigation every resolution and every amendment asking for the appointment of a committee for that purpose having been voted down i have introduced a bill which i trust may become a law providing that whenever there is any fraud or crime or official misconduct in any department of the government a committee shall be appointed to investigate that department i will insert the bill in my remarks a bill providing for

probed to a little extent but seemingly the surgeons thought it cruel to probe further but let us probe it all and do not let us probe it from a partisan standpoint such is my confidence in the speaker that i would be willing to let him appoint a committee of five republicans provided all the other republicans inthe united states let him alone and let him appoint them on his own hook and on his own say so let us have it lo and behold my friends there is one other thing that i had almost forgotten you are so fond of class legislation that when you can not build up particular class interests at the general expense in an indirect way by giving them what you call protection which by the way is not much protection to the balance of the people but a burden to them then you want to vote money directly out of the treasury to build them up thus by bounty your peekaboo has proposed to hothouse the shipbuilding class 98f now i want to know what you mean on this ship subsidy question the country wants to know i am a chiel asking questions that is all do you mean merely to tide this thing over until after the election and then bring in something like the hanna subsidy bill because you are afraid to indorse it before election is that what you mean do you really want to build up the american merchant marine i do do you really want to build it up without making its prosperity a burden on the balance of the country i do why the old democratic party has blazed a way in the past and put upon the statute books the only legislation that ever successfully built up an american merchant marine and we propose to build it up as jefferson and madison did not by burdening the people with taxation but by relieving the people from taxation the gentleman from michigan has filed as i am informed in this house a minority report to the bill which relegates the entire ship subsidy question to a commission in which he recommends that instead of waiting we proceed now and in which he says that the commission fixed by the constitution to deal with this question is a committee in this house and a committee in the other house he says that we have enough government by commission or rather enough of nongovernment by commission the few reports commissions have made were laughed at or voted down by the house and the senate the gentleman from new york will remember the commission of 1883 he will remember how they labored and how they brought in after a while a recommendation of a bill and he will remember with what absolute ridicule it met and remember also that afterwards the bill that was passedthe tariff bill of 1883was a bill virtually originated in the senate and indorsed by the house and not the bill recommended by the commission the gentleman from michigan i say has brought in a report citing the ineffectiveness of these commissions asking congress not to abdicate its functions asking us not towait until after election but to proceed now to build up the american merchant marine and he has suggested the plan which was tried early in the history of the country and which succeeded namely the plan of giving to goods imported in american bottoms a reduction upon the import duty how long do you think it would take to build up an american merchant marine if each article of goods that was shipped into the harbors of new york boston baltimore new orleans etc and sent in foreign bottoms had to pay 20 per cent more duty than if shipped in an american bottom if the very fact of its being shipped in an american bottom would give an advantage to the consignee of 20 per cent reduction of the duty as to conflicting treaties every one contains the right expressly reserved on behalf of each government to abrogate on due notice and the act should contain the required notice while that doctrine is democratic it is not unrepublican you will remember that in 1896 when you nominated mr mckinley in your platform you then advocated building up an american merchant marine by discriminating import duties ah but perhaps you meant by discrimination of duties to burden the people yet further by taxation that is to say to raise the import duties upon goods imported in foreign bottoms 20 per cent above present rates instead of doing as we want to do relieving the consumer from taxation and building up a merchant marine at one and the same time by making the discrimination fall on the other side of the linenamely by reducing import duties on goods imported in american bott6ms 20 per cent from the present rates now i do not mean 20 per cent absolutely i do not know what percentage would be right i named 20 per cent merely because that is the limit to which you could go under the dingley bill perhaps 10 per cent might be sufficient the old discriminating duty was 10 per cent and it was found sufficient we democrats do not like senators hanna and frye recommend an experiment our plan has been tried its success never denied and we are ready to try it again why not then go ahead right now before your committee investigate now have hearings to find out just what percentage of tariff reduction would make up the difference between the pay of labor employed upon american ships and the pay of labor on foreign ships send subcommittees to other points if needful let us progress go forward build up dont let everything even your eternal salvation wait until after the election i want to say one thing more in this connection i would not go even so far us i do in favoring legislation to build up a special industry but for one fact our legislation here in congress has been such as to make labor employed on american ships necessarily cost more as compared with the labor on foreign ships and therefore if we could make up for this legislation by enabling the shipbuilder to get back the amount we have virtually taxed him by our laws and our regulation concerning americanbuilt ships and in that way not only benefit him but benefit the american people the general consumers by relieving them somewhat of taxation i am willing to do it at the same time we would not be doing anything which the dingley bill itself does not concede can be done even from a republican and protectionist standpoint and still leave duties high enough i am not willing that any special industry shall be built up by taxing all the people but i am willing that it may be done by untaxing some or all the people do you want to stand pat or do you want to do something else oh my friends on the other side do you know what you are getting to be you are getting to be the party of negation and obstruction to progress in this country you are getting to be the party of standstillism you are standing in the way of every reform you have become by long use and abuse of power ultra conservativeultra stand pat by the way governor cummins says a very good thing he says these people talk about letting well enough alone as if anything ever was well enough who ever heard of anything in the political or industrial world being well enough who hopes to see things well enough until we enter into that final state of bliss which all good democrats expect to enjoy oh my friends whenever we ask you to do anything you respond as my friend the gentleman from iowa did the other day by prating about prosperity why my friend champ clark of missouri i am informed though he never told me so himself was making a speech down in missouri one day in a republican section of that otherwise good democratic state and he delineated the horrors of war carried on against a defenseless people guilty only of first trusting us and afterwards loving their native land and wanting to be free and independent he delineated the horrors of colonialism and he showed how the very birth principle of the republic had been opposition to colonialism and how we were now going into the george iii business ourselves he dwelt upon the desolated fields and the ruined harvests in the philippines he said that if immediately after the war of the revolution the french had turned around and made war upon us and denied that we had ever had an alliance with them about the only difference would have been that we had a paper alliance with france and we never had had a paper alliance with the filipinos but that we did fight side by side with them and shoot side by side with them he went into all the horrors of colonialism and the dangers of it as retroactive on our institutions and our morals discussing it as a great moral question and then he said finally fellowcitizens can you stand for that and you know when caa np said it it was heard everywhere and he said it well but one fellow said well i reckon we kin as long as steers is worth 6 cents a pound in missouri that is just about the moral and mental measure of average republicanism why we used to think that it was so funny we never could persuade the ordinary plantation darky that prosperity did not depend entirely upon government or persuade him out of the idea that he would get more money for his cotton provided the republican ticket won as the carpet baggers told him he would but we never drealned that we had to meet that sort of an argument before white people we never dreamed that any man alive who would count up the sum total of human happiness and human prosperity and give due credit to ancestry and give due credit to environment due credit to soil due credit to climate due credit to sunshine and rain due credit to frugality selfcontrol and perseverance and due credit to the constant foresight of god and his prescience from the beginning when he built it all would then tell us that all the policies of a great government ought to depend upon the price of beef in missouri the price of beefi a thing that we are exporting every day that we are selling abroad dressed and raw and on foot and in every other form that nobody outside of a lunatic asylum ever pretended could be helped in price by a tariff if the duty on beef was 17 000 per cent now my republican friends mark the day the populists just before you and you now have taught the american people that industrial and farm prosperity depend upon washington you absolutely went before all these people and taught them that a worlds panic that existed in australia and the argentine and austria and england was due to four lines upon the american statute books some of you and some of the balance of you said it was due to the anticipation of the gormanwilson bill you have taught the people that way it is harder to unteach a man than it is to teach him ah this world goes on like the tide coming in up a little back a little up a little farther back a little until it reaches the height of the tide and then the ebb sets in and we three hundred and eightyodd politicians here can not stop the course of nature and the operation of gods laws when men are in a state of prosperity they become careless about debt they are willing to borrow and they are willing to go into new ventures and they do it recklessly and carelessly some day somebody wants to collect and they begin to collect all along the line everybody crying cash bubbles burst and then business drops to the bedrock bottom when nothing answers but cash when property itself has to be sold under the hammer at half its value and then when things get down to the true basis again people begin to gather courage they begin to do business upon a sound basis because they have not the credit to do it on any other basis and then more confidence coming they run in debt just a little carefully then a little more then a great deal despising as an old fogy him who wont run in debt and then again the ominous cry cash and then all over again some of your bubbles have burst already and when they shall have all burst my friends then the poisoned chalice will return it will be commended to your own lips the very lessons you have taught will come back to scourge you you might get up on every stump in this country and try to preach common sense but the fools you have misled will say you are the very fellows that taught us that

decline to be interrupted until i shall have concluded what i have prepared to say and then i shall be very glad to attempt to answer any reasonable questions that may be propounded the republican party was at the outset not a political organization at all it was a party of wildeyed religious fanatics who despised the constitution and evaded the laws they emphasized certain glittering generalities in the declaration of independence and denounced the express provisions of the constitution of the united states theywere almost as frenzied and unreasoning in their determination to free the negroes and give them political and social equality as were the crusaders in their deteriination to rescue the holy sepulcher from the hands of the moslem the first republican platform adopted in 1856 upon which frmont was nominated for the presidency demanded the immediate admission of kansas as a state of the union kansas then had a sparse population of only a few thousand spreading over a vast wilderness now when three great territories with a half milln of people each demand admission as states this party continues in its platforms to promise admission and continues to violate the promise for example the platform you adopted in 1892 contained among other things this promise to the american people we favor the admission of the remaining territories at the earliest practicable day having due regard to the interest of the people of the territories and of the united states you repeated this promise in 1896 and then again in the platform of 1900 you proclaimed we favor home rule for and the early admission to statehood of the territories of new mexico arizona and oklahoma how many more times are you going to write these falsehoods in your platforms and how many more years will these people in the territories be denied the right of local selfgovernment has your fondness for holding crown colonies in the orient tempted you to hold thcs3 neighbors and kindred of our own country in subjection also do the people who inhabit the poor hillsides of new england dread to see the seat of political empire drift away to the south and west you wanted kansas to come in immediately because she would have strengthened your political power you oppose the admission of these three great territories because you fear six more democratic senators and quite an additional number of democratic congressmen this is the state of the union upon that matter and speaking of promises in the republican national platforms which have never been redeemed it would afford amusement if the matter were not so serious and important to review this highway leading to your political perdition next november paved with good resolutions and see how it is strewn with wrecks and betrayals of the peoples confidence in the platform of 1868 this republican party announced that suffrage in all the loyal states properly belonged to the people of those states but that in the disloyal states it was a matter under the control of congres this absurd doctrine was carried out with all its hideous enormity in the reconstruction of the south no civilized people in modern times though subjugated by war were ever subjected to more outrage and cruelty by a conquering enemy than were the people of the southern states at the close of the war not content with disfranchising the white people they placed the ballot into the hands of the ignorant and illiterate negroes who were fresh from the cornfields and cotton plantations and these negroes were guided and controlled by unscrupulous carpetbaggers from the north these illiterate negroes mounted the bench as judges of the courts they filled the halls of the state legislatures and inaugurated such a carnival of crime and corruption as were hideous to contemplate such pollution of society ensued such misery followed as no other people endured yes these issues are dead but these historical facts arenot and should not be forgotten if when england conquered the republic of south africa she had disfranchised the white population of those countries and had placed the right to vote exclusively in the hands of the negro slaves the case would still not have been as great an outrage as was heaped upon the southern people of our own land the outrage would not have been so great because negro slaves of soth africa were as intelligent as the negro slaves of the southern states whereas the boers of south africa were a different race of people from the english conquerors they were strangers separated by wide oceans speaking a different tongue with different manners and customs while the southern white people were of the same blood descended from the same sires speaking the same language and inheriting the same laws literature and traditions as the people of the north the day is long in the life of a people but time will hardly efface from our memories the needless cruelties and frightful devastations that were visited even upon the smoking ruins of the fairest of all the lands of the world coming now to the platform of 1872i want to try and hasten on to get down to some of these modern issues so that i can entertain the young gentleman from minnesota who hopes to laugh and giggle the doctrines of jefferson and jackson out of the country and i want to get down to the days that are in the recollection of my distinguished friend from connecticut in the platform of 1872 this party declared this astounding statement it suppressed a gigantic rebellion emancipating four million of slaves derreeing the equal citizenship of all and established universal suffrage exhibiting unparalleled magnanimity it criminally punished no man for political o fenses there is not a single truthful statement in that whole paragraph the republican party did not suppress any rebellion the democrats north and south who voted for douglas and the whigs and union men north and south who voted for john bell were as much opposed to secession as were the republicans who voted for lincoln more votes were cast for douglas and bell than were cast for lincoln they were as patriotic as devoted to the union and made as good soldiers and did as much in every way to suppress the rebellion as did those republicans who claimed the sole credit the republican party never saved the union at all and never freed a negro slave missouri voted for douglas and she put more than 100 000 soldiers in the union army tennesseevoted for bell and that state furnished 31 092 union soldiers kentucky voted for john bell and yet she furnished 85 860 soldiers to the union army maryland furnished 46 638 soldiers to the union army west virginia furnished 32 068 union soldiers i have heard no less an authority than judge harlan of the supreme court say that the union was saved in a great measure by the southern meh who refused to join the secession but who with equal heroism and greater love for the union stood out against their brethren of the south and fought to maintain and perpetuate the government of their fathers think of this declaration in the platform exhibiting unparalleled magnanimity it crininally punished no man for political offenses when the german army conquered the turks at poltawa the turks were permitted to return home and to maintain their local laws and institutions when the french army was destroyed at sedan the frenchmen were allowed to return to their own country and exercise all the rights of citizenship so when the army of the sultan conquered the greeks these people retained their local laws and institutions and were allowed to rule their own country as if no war had been waged even when russia germany and austria despoiled poland her citizens were still left permission to control their local affairs forced only to acknowledge the paramount allegiance to the conqueror in this south land of ours alone of all the conquered countries of modern times the white citizens the property owners the intelligent part of the population were disfranchised and the local government placed in the hands of former slaves coming now to the platform of 1876 let us read this paragraph we rejoice in the quickening conscience of the ncople concerning political affairs think of this when tilden received 4 284 757 votes while hayes received only 4 033 950 votes and yet by the utter lack of any political conscience whatever the returning boards and the electoral commission found a devious way by fraud to either go behind the returns or to refuse to go behind them or do whatever else was necessary to vote into the high office of president a man who had been defeated at the polls and to count out a manwhom all honest men now admit was duly elected so having perpetrated the greatest election fraud in our history and having forcibly canceled the certificate of the people at the polls this party in the next platform of 1880 with great impudence declared the honest voter must be protected against terrorism violence and fraud but let us hasten on to 1884 when that party began its series of promises to reduce the tariff promises which it never intended to fulfill instead of redeeming this pledge that party has constantly pursued the opposite plan and the surplus has grown to such proportions that certain favorite national banks are made depositories of this surplus and are collecting millions of dollars annually in the way of interest by lending this surplus back to the people the net profits made every year by these national banks in this way would furnish many millions for campaign funds to be expended to perpetuate the outrage and still leave the bankers time and leisure to praise the glories of the republican party in newspapers and magazines of the country then look at this siren song which was sung in that same platform the republican party has gained its strength by quick and faithful response to the demands of the people for the freedom and equality of all men the freedom and equality of the ten millions in the philippines in porto rico in alaska and in the sandwich islands are meant of course the only freedom and equality furnished since this platform was written was such as was shown to a colored woman mrs cox at indianola when the administration undertook to force her services as postmaster upon the white people of that city another instance of freedom and equality is to be found when the president disregarded the recommendations of both white republicans and democrats in south carolina and forced upon the people a black odoriferous geranium by the name of doctor crum as collector of the port of charleston still another instance of freedom and equality to all men was perhaps shown when a certain other darky by the name of booker washington came to lunch at the white house and the president expressed his regrets that his family were away and insisted that mr washington return to dinner so this negro did come back to dinner with the president of the united states at one end of the table mrs roosevelt at the other miss alice and theodore jr on either side and booker washington seated at the seat of honor at the right hand of the president eating out of the same dish and sopping out of the same bowl freedom and equality to all men what rot and nonsense in the light of recent history have you read the address delivered the other day by exsecretary of war root at the law school banquet here is what he says in part it has been my province during the last four and a half years to deal with arbitrary government it has been necessary for me to not only make laws and pronounce judgment without any occasion for discussion except in so far as i would choose to weigh the question involved in my own mind affecting 10 000 000 of people and not only to make laws and p ronounce judgment but to execute judgment with overwhelming force and great swiftness think of this for one moment and think how rapidly we have degenerated from the institutions founded by the fathers of this republic think of one arbitrary despot holding the destinies of 10 000 000 of human beings in the hollow of his hand without any restraint of constitution or law execute judgment with overwhelming force and great swiftness the time was when such an utterance would have demanded and received universal condemnation but now it is the strenuosity of a popular administration a military satrap burning cities devastating provinces torturing prisoners and noncombatants has become the hero and idol of a republican party that has the unspeakable impudence to talk about liberty and equality but hastening on to the platform of 1888 we find this ebullition of patriotism from the swelling bosom of the republican party the republican party would accept all needed reductions in the national revenues by repealing the tax upon tobacco which is an annoyance and a burden to agriculture then why dont you repeal the tax on tobacco and relieve the farmers of this annoyance and burden to agriculture you elected your candidate to the presidency in 1888 you have controlled congress ever since time and again the democrats have urged you to redeem this promise to repeal this tobacco tax there are four or five bills now pending in this house one introduced by my distinguished friend who sits in front of me mr stanley one by my colleague from kentucky mr trimble still another by my distinguished friend from tennessee mr gaines and another by i think mr hopkinsall of them democrats they have all been referred to that magnificent committee on ways and means and there they will be permitted to sleep i hate to discourage you gentlemen but those tobacco bills are as dead today as the seven sleepers of

with the birth foreseen and aided as i believe aided from paris and aided from washington as i believe i may be mistakenthat if colombia dares land a soldier within the confines of the newborn republic the united states will treat it as an act of war that confession involves a confession of the fact that we have for the first time taken the hitherto unprecedented step of interfering in the domestic broils of central and south american countries you interfere just as much by saying to the parent country if you dare to land a soldier it is an act of war as you would if you had said to the insurgent country we will put you down the things are exactly the same the gentleman can not change these facts i know how that is i once served on the foreign affairs committee myself we get mysterious when we get over there and when we come here somehow or other we build things up and then we knock them down and build them up again and expect people to follow us because you know we are experts on diplomacy but there is one thing that even a diplomat like me can not doand i have been an expert diplomat in some respects not as expert as the gentleman from illinoisi never could sink jump or walk over a fact and this is a fact the gentleman says we have not been greedy and then refers to the manner in which we treated cuba if the democratic party and a few republicans had not hedged up and bound this government in the two clauses which compelled us to give cuba her freedom and independence you would have treated cuba just as you treated the philippines and you know it nothing else restrained you why the idea that you go before the world saying that this is my administration this is my government and therefore all that it does is right that idea is tyranny that idea is despotism that idea is the stopping place of analysis and criticism upon the part of citizens of their public officers the amenities of life what have the amenities of life to do with it why you might just as well say that the gentleman from iowa was guilty of violating the amenities of life when he thinks my views on the tariff are absurd and i might just as well be accused of violating the amenities of life because i think his opinions upon the subject equally absurd men meet to discuss political questions according to their views as they understand them and nobody ever takes as personal if he looks at things from a proper standpoint criticism of his official conduct and his official opinion now i have been convinced by the gentleman from illinois that there was no haste in our conduct down in panama i want to read something now just to show what i thought before i heard him speak since he has spoken i am satisfied that the most deliberate longreviewed wellthoughtout project ever completed or ever thought of since the world began is the birth of panama and our connection with it as some gentleman may have had ideas like these that i had let me read to the

attributed to the gentleman from mississippi in a morning paper because he can point fish as well as birds you are going to nominate him so that you can say in one part of the country that he is a safe man and in other parts of the country that he is an original and rantankerous trust buster but putting this aside and returning to the line of my argument i wish to repeat that in allowing these remarbs to take the direction they have i have not been actuated by any vish to excite sectional animosities in addressing myself to this subject i have had in mind four principal purposes and to these i ask your attention first i am strongly disposed to believe that the people of this nation north as well as south dislike extremely to have this race problem brought up for discussion on this flor and i want to call the attention of the country and 1articularly i want to call the attention of the south to the fact that this discu sion has been initiated by speeches made on the other side of the chamber and not on this second i want to suggest the idea that negro domination as commonly understood is a mere political bugaboo entitled to no more consideration than the bogy man of militarism with which the democratic party tried to frighten the people of this country in the last campaign third i want to remind the south that it has been nearly thirty years since the federal government has attempted any interference with their solution of the race problem that it has been ten years since any coercive measure was brought forward in either house of congress and i want to call their attention to the fact that tllis congress notwithstanding the fact that it was brought face to face with the question through means of contested seats has absolutely refused aprm 12 to take it up and consider it and finally i want to speak a word of simple justice for a race which in the face of mountainous difficulties has achieved much which in the face of bitter provocation has shown marvelous forbearance and which whateverits limitations and when all has been said that can be said against it has been and must always continue to be an important if not an absolutely essential factor in the industrial life of this nation i make no plea for social equality for the social intermingling of the two races what god has put asunder no wise man of either race will attempt to join the republican attitude on that phase of the question has never i believe been more clearly expressed than it was by thaddeus stevens in his speech on this floor on the 8d of january 1867 in the following words but it will be said as it has been said this is negro equality what is negro equality about which so much is said by knaves and some of which is befieved by men who are not fools it mean as understood by honest republicans just this much and no more every man no matter what his race or color every ear thly being who has an immortal soul has an equal right to justice honesty and fair play with every other man and the law should secure him those rights the same law which condemns or acquits an african should condemn or acquit a white man the same law which gives a verdict in a white mans favor should give a verdict in a black mans favor on the same state of facts such is the law of god and such ought to be the law of man this doctrine does not mean that a negro shall sit on the same seat or eat at the same table with a white man that is a matter of taste which every man must decide for himself the law has nothing to d6 with it if there be any who are afraid of the rivalry of the black man in office or in business i have only to advise them to try and beat their competitor in knowledge and business capacity and there is no danger that his white neighbors will prefer his african rival to himself that was the republican doctrine then and it is the republican doctrine now is there any honest man is there any fair man is there any brave man anywhere who can not subscribe to it is not the negro handicapped enough in heavens name by the prejudice of color and cate by the litations of his race without tying his hands and shackling his feet by denying him the protection which the law gives to the meanest of his white competitors we have heard it stated on this floor that the negro is unfit for citizenship and incapable of rising above the level of serfdom and yet the records show that in forty years starting with nothing this race has accumulated 800 000 000 of property it shows that starting in almost total ignorance more than half of them over the age of ten years can read and write the census shows that nearly 25 per cent of them own their own homes while here and there individuals have amassed fortunes hero and there also individuals have acquired education and culture and developed intellectual power which would do credit to the men of aiy race in the face of such a record as that is it not the acme of ef frontery to declare that there is nothing for the negro to do but peaceably and quietly in the language of a member of this house to assume that inferior position for which nature and training have fitted him nature and training have fitted the great majority of the caucasian race for an inferior position but does it follow therefore that no individual of that race who is capable of reaching a higher position shall be allowed to aspire to it a fair field and no favor is all the anglosaxon has ever asked for himself but he has always demanded that can he not give to others and especially to his inferiors that which he demands for himself i know the answer that always comes up from the representatives of southern sentiment when a member on this side of the aisle ventures to express an opinion on this question we are met always with the impatient declaration oh you dont know anything about the conditions that confront us in the south you can not put yourselves in our place i freely grant that my point of view mustof necessity be different from yours but the philosophy of human history teaches certain truths that are the same from every point of view an the most fundamental of those truths is that in a republic all classes of the people must rise or fall together this great truth was put with great force by a southern negro speaking to a southern audience when he said there is no defense or security for any of us except in the highest intellience and development of all nearly li000 000 of hands will aid you in pullag the load upward or they will pull against you the load downward we shall constitute onethird and more of the ignorance and crime of the south or onethird its intelligence and progress we shall contribute onethird to the business and industrial prosperity of the south or we shall prove a veritable body of death stagnating depressing retarding every effort to advance the body politic i may not be able to look at this race question from the southern point of view but i put these strong luminous words of booker washington over against the preposterous argument we have heard on this floor from gentlemen who contend that the wiso thing for the south to do is to shut the door of hope forever in the face of the whole negro race and i appeal to the lesson of all history for the verdict to me the argument that the welfare and progress of this republic will be best promoted by holding oneeighth of its population in rayless ignorance by stifling in the hearts of all these people every manly hope and aspiration and ambition is little less than monstrous from an ethical standpoint and little less than madness from a political standpoint"], [0.8972122147679329, 0.10278778523206711, 1, "it is true that bridges have been constructed across the kaw river and the plans were not submitted to the secretary of war as is done in the case of navigable streams and this is true notwithstanding congress in 1888 passed an act providing for the construction of a bridge and recognizing the river as a navigable stream providing for the submission of plans to the secretary of war for his approval and the people engaged in the construction paid no attention to the provision of the law and went ahead and built the bridge i burton there is no question but that the construction of these bridges has been inconsistent with navigation and it has not been claimed by anyone that it is a navigable stream the reason that is urged on congress to provide for it is simply because of the great damage by the flood if that is a proper ground upon which we should appropriate we could also be asked to make an appropriation for baltimore because of the great loss recently suffered there by fire i can not too earnestly impress on this house the desirability of rejecting any appropriation of that nature i say that with the utmost regard for those who have suffered so severely from this great calamity the most perplexing question in regard to river and harbor improvements now before congress and the country is the extent to which internal navigation should be developed we have numerous projects before us for these improvements the most expensive perhaps is that for inland waterways along the atlantic and gulf coasts the peculiar configuration of the coast makes it possible for threefourths of the distance on the atlantic border and on the gulf to develop inland waterways protected by islands or by reefs from the waves of the ocean the arguments in favor of these inland routes are the greater safety to the mariner which may be gained if he may leave the open ocean and be protected against the sea by islands or other barriers and the development of that portion of the country which is tributary to them this is particularly true of the region around cape hatteras where the shore is strewn with wrecks and where ever since the early days of navigation the passage in the open sea has been regarded as one of the most dangerous nature a recent estimate recommended by a local board advocated the expenditure of 10 000 000 for an inland waterway in north carolina and while the total cost of inland routes can not be accurately estimated partly because no sufficient information is available and as the expense must depend very largely upon the depth secured by the channels which might be constructed yet the aggregate cost of routes which are strenuously urged would certainly be somewhere between one hundred and two hundred millions of dollars the question alses whether this work should be commenced at present it is evident that the adoption of any one of these great inland waterways furnishes a precedent for the adoption of all and if congress is consistent the appropriation of 10 000 000 for one great project of this nature means the appropriation of the whole amount in the course of years great pressure has been brought to bear for the improvement of the ohio river at a cost amounting to not less than 70 000 000 according to the best available estimates with a view to securing a 9foot stage for 965 miles from pittsburg to cairo this river is one of the most important navigable streams in the world there are certain distinct characteristics however in the first place the commerce in the upper portion is almost exclusively downstream and it is almost exclusively of coal there is a very large packet trade on the river which does not depend upon this improvement which is advocated very considerable progress has been made in securing a 6foot stage in the river and with material benefits i think it may be safely said that if the river is to be improved for the whole length by locks and dams and navigation is provided for the whole season the additional cost of 9 feet as compared with 6 feet is not so great but that it would be desirable to choose the greater depth but the decision of this question like that of most other questions before us must depend upon the scale of expenditure which we shall adopt i have said that the total cost would aggregate 70 000 000 this waterway has received since the foundation of the government about one twentyfourth or one tweatythird part of the total appropriation a proportion which would seem to be its full share it is desired that this improvement of 9 feet be entered upon and completed within ten years and this presents to us a mathematical problem seventy million dollars is one twentythird of 1 610 000 000 approximately four times as much as the total amount expended on rivers and harbors from the foundation of the government to june 30 1902 the total amount expended to that time was 431 000 000 if this improvement is to be completed in ten years that means 161 000 000 a year the members living in the valley have been censured because they have not been more active on behalf of the ohio it is but fair that those who blame them or blame anyone else should meet this question do they favor an appropriation of 8161 000 000 a year for rivers and harbors it may be said in this connection that the ability of the committee and of congress to meet the enormous demands upon us is not promoted by special pressure for any one particular project those who wisely seek to secure appropriations in their locality would do better first to educate public sentiment in favor of larger and more liberal appropriations for the whole country and then specific projects will take care of themselves there is also a demand for 15 000 000 for the upper mississippithat is between the mouth of the missouri and st paul and for 20 000 000 between st louis and cairo it goes without saying that it is very desirable that there should be an impr8vement in any event between st louis and cairo below cairo there is ample depth for barge navigation and it is especially desirable that the two great cities on the mississippi river should have a channel convenient for communication between them and that the unfinished portion between cairo and st louis for a length of 180 miles or thereabouts should have the early attention of congress on the columbia river there is a project on the upper portion which involves the expenditure of 19 005 000 it has not been strenuously pressed of late on the lower portion also there are considerable improvements contemplated it is an interstate stream it flows through a rapidly developing country where there is the greatest possibility for agricultural growth and also for the shipment of timber it is one of the finest wheatgrowing regions in the world on the other hand it presents very great difficulties in the way of construction particularly at the dalles rapids where a considerable appropriation has already been made there is another project that has been brought to the attention of congress this winter for a canal between the delaware and chesapeake bays the estimated cost of which in 1883 for a 27foot waterway was 18 000 000 it is probable however that the expense would be very considerably greater than that it is perfectly obvious that the construction of this canal would shorten the route between important terminal points and between some places the saving would be so great as to almost annihilate the distance there is also a proposed canal around niagara falls to cost 29 000 000 numerous requests have been made for harbors of refuge to provide safe resorts against severe weather on stormy or exposed coasts added pressure is brought to bear on behalf of these both on the ocean and on the lakes because of the veryconsiderable loss of life which has occurred in the neighborhood of their proposed localities during severe storms among them are the sandy bay harbor of refuge on the easterly coast of massachusetts north of boston the estimated cost to complete it is 5 891 000 an earlier project provided for a harbor of refuge at vineyard haven to cost about 4 000 000 another for cape lookout in north carolina has been recommended the cost of which would be nearly 4 000 000 no one expenditure has been more earnestly sought from the committee than the completion of the harbor of refuge at point judith on long island sound the frequent loss of ships near this point attended by occasional loss of life would seem to demand early attention similar requests have been made upon the great lakes and upon the pacific coast unfortunately the propositions pending for harbors of refuge in oregon and other points in the northwest portion of the country have been shown to be so expensive that their commencement does not seem to be practicable at present in looking over the report of expenditures for maintenance during the last fiscal year there are certain striking features there is one lesson to be derived from them that congress should be especially careful of projects for the construction of locks and dams certainly unless it be in streams which promise a very great traffic the statement furnished me is necessarily somewhat incomplete because it does not include the cost of maintenance where improvements under continuing contracts have been in progress as at philadelphia baltimore cleveland and i believe at chicago but it appears that the total amount expended including permanent appropriations which are expended without action of congress under the act of 1884 especially for the maintenance of streams or canals in which there are locks and dams is 2 592 000 of this there was devoted to harbors 489 262 to rivers 772 000 for rivers or canals having locks and dams 1 089 250 it appears from the above that the cost of maintaining the rivers and canals having locks and dams is fivesixths as much as the total amount for all other rivers and for all harbors it is nearly onehalf more than for all other rivers it is more than twice as much as for all harbors the amount expended on the monongahela river pennsylvania 238 000 is nearly half as much as for all the harbors of the country except those named above this it should be borne in mind relates only to maintenance the amount expended for maintenance of muscle shoals canal paralleling the tennessee river and affording a channel around rapids was 85 000 the freight carried through this canal was 7 712 tons this amount is more than fifteen times as great as the amount expended for the maintenance for milwaukee harbor wisconsin which had a tonnage in the calendar year of 1902 of 3 600 000 tons it is more than four times as great as the amount expended for the maintenance of new york harbor notwithstanding the tonnage is only 7 712 tons in the list of rivers and canals having locks and so forth there are included several which have a very large trafficas for instance the st clair flats canal the st marys falls canal the monongahela river davis island dam in the ohio river keewenaw waterway michigan sturgeon bay and lake michigan ship canal in wisconsin as for the rest the traffic is insignificant there are two or three comparisons which may be of value the cost of maintenance of the kentucky river in the year 1903 was 119 000 the total cost of improving and maintaining this river from 1879 to date including the construction of new locks and dams and the reconstruction of locks and dams turned over by the state of kentucky has been 4 000 000 the largest amount of tonnage going through any one lock in 1902 was that passing through lock no 8 132 000 tons the principal share of which was timber the amount expended upon this river is a larger sum than has been expended upon any harbor upon the pacific coast with the exception of three harborsthose of duluth superior chicago including calumet and buffaloit is a larger sum than has been expended upon any harbor upon the great lakes only six harbors on the atlantic coast exceed it in expense as i recallboston new york philadelphia baltimore savannah and charlestonalso one harbor on the gulfgalveston these locks and dams were transferred to the united states government as a gift it would seem desirable in the future to be very guarded in the matter of accepting gifts from states or private individuals of waterways improved by locks and dams"], [0.8932879492640495,

is safe to place this amount at 4 900 000 000 after excluding the value of farm crops fed to live stock in order to avoid duplication of values a similar estimate made for 1903 gives 4 480 000 000 and

as a main thoroughfare of the section of the district through which it extends being that section of the district of columbia across the anacostia river as shown by the extract from the bill authorizing the opening of the street it was required to be on a straight line of extension and of the same width as the street now is in the city it will readily appear therefore that this is the widest street and certainly in many respects if not in all the most important street in that section of the district of columbia perhaps i should speak of it as a highway or road as it lies in what is called the county or rural portion of the district from the time it was opened down to the present time very little money has been expended upon it the only work thus far has been as far as branch avenue a very short distance from the end of the pennsylvania avenue bridge the question it seems to me might occur right here why was it that congress a few years ago appropriated several hundred thousand dollars for the construction of a bridge over the route of this street extended if it did not intend thereafter to continue the roadway there is no reason why we should build an expensive bridge merely to open to the people of the district the farther bank of the anacostia river it was built because it was seen then that there was a great necessity for a highway as is stated in the report to give access to the city to the people in that part of the district as well as those in the contiguous sectibn of maryland now i understand that the local authorities of prince george county in maryland lying along the district line at that point are anxious to build a road to connect with thisproposed extension gentlemen may say that the district of columbia has nothing to do with the access to this city of people living in the contiguobs portions of maryland but a moments consideration will show that that is an erroneous view to take of the matter these people just beyond the district line in maryland make washington city their market they bring all their produce here and they buy practically everything that they have to buy and in that way they contribute almost as much to the volume of business and grow th of washington city as those do who are just outside the city but inside the district as i say again this is a straight extension it is i think the only straight street on that side of the anacostia river it is the widest roadway there will be there and it will accommodate in time a much greater number of people than any other roadway acrossthe anacostia river
