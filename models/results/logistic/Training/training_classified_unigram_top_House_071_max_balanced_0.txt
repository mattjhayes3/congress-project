the dams may i say that this provision follows the precedent set in the payment of money by the federal government to the publicland states of the west in view of the fact that the public lands are not subject to taxation by those states this conference report is not all that i would have it i take it that it is not all that any member of this house would have it it is a compromise and i am sure that it does not fully meet the views of any of us we know however that practically all great legislation is a compromise for 10 years the republican party has had the control of the government and has failed to make disposition of muscle shoals for 10 years this party has delayed and dawdled with this great project until today this failure to make proper disposition of muscle shoals stands as an indictment against the party a legislative crime and a national disgrace i believe that if this conference report be enacted into law it will mean mass production of nitrates at muscle shoals for the defense of the country and for the benefit of agriculture i believe that a sincere administration of this conference report if it be enacted into law will carry out the purposes for which muscle shoals was built and will mean real relief to the farmers of our country in the matter of the cost of their fertilizers before the world war all of the great nations of the world were importing their nitrogen from chile in the form of chilean nitrate today all of the great nations of the world with the notable exception of the united states and russia are taking the nitrogen from the air and fixing it in mass production they have freed themselves from any dependence upon chile or any other foreign nation for their nitrogen and they have done it by their respective governments aiding and helping their nitrogen industry last year while the united states was forced to import 239 500 tons of nitrogen and while she imported over 1 000 000 tons of chilean nitrate from chile great britain belgium germany france czechoslovakia italy the netherlands chile norway and poland entered into a world cartel or world monopoly to control the price of nitrogen throughout the world and to force the united states and particularly the farmers of the united states to pay whatever price for nitrogen this cartel might see fit to fix mr c j brand the secretary of the national fertilizer association of the united states in a letter written to members of congress on january 3 1931 tells of the formation of this cartel in this letter mr brand states the cartel is empowered at intervals of from 6 to 10 months to fix prices under this cartel we find the chilean government paying this year approximately 2 500 000 to germany and great britain to get them to reduce their output of nitrogen so that chile can continue to charge the farmers of the south an exorbitant price for their nitrogen and of course the farmers of the south are paying the 2 500 000 the nations of europe recognize that there are only two great forces that destroy national lifethe one an invading army and the other the depletion of the soil strange as it may seem by divine ordinance the element which is used to destroy life is the element which gives life the nitrogen which makes the gunpowder also brings forth the products of the field these nations recognizing this fact have made themselves independent of any other nation for their supply of nitrogen we hear much talk today and there are a number of bills pending in congress to provide new and additional battleships to modernize old battleships and to greatly augment the strength of our navy there is not a battleship a fort an airplane or a gun that is worth anything at all to us unless we have the nitrogen to make the ammunition to fire the gun if we were to go to war today we would have to send our ships over 3 000 miles to chile to secure the nitrogen absolutely necessary to wage war if we were unable to keep our lines of communication open with chile or if chile were to assume a neutral attitude and refuse to sell us nitrogen we would stand helpless before the enemy muscle shoals was built that we might have nitrogen for our army and navy in time of war and for fertilizers for our farmers in time of peace it stands idle today while we stand unprepared to defend our country against a foe it stands idle while the farmers of the south are forced to pay an export tax of 12 53 for every ton of chilean nitrate imported from chile and to contribute thereby 25 per cent of the annual cost of the operation of the chilean government it stands idle while the farmers of the south pay 20 cents a pound for their nitrogen when they should be able to buy it for not over 10 cents per pound it stands idle while the farmers of the south must pay a fertilizer bill of 1 93 cents for every pound of cotton they produce it stands idle while the farmers of the country pay out each year over 300 000 000 for their fertilizers when these same fertilizers should be bought for not over 150 000 000 it stands idle while germany sends to florida gets phosphate rock ships it from florida to germany across the atlantic ocean then 150 miles up a canal then carries it 100 miles over a small railroad then crushes it mixes it with nitrogen and potash and sends it back for the farmers of this country to pay for it whatever price the world nitrogen monopoly sees fit to

the house january 30 in passing h r 26 by the overwhelming vote of 199 to 24 is greatly appreciated by all those who are working so earnestly for the preservation of the natural scenic beauties of the national capital aild its environs we are particularly appreciative that the unrivaled beauty of great falls and the unique scenic interest of the gorge of the potomac so near at hand seem certain of preservation through enactment of h r 26 into law the amendments adopted by the house are of importance but generally speaking are not destructive of the purposes of the bill of particular interest is the dempsey amendment as follows provided that the acquisition of any land in the potomac river valley for park purposes shall not debar or limit or abridge its use for such works as congress may in the future authorize for the improvement and the extension of navigation including the connecting of the upper potomac river with the ohio river or for flood control or irrigation or drainage or for the development of hydroelectric power as i stated at the time this amendment was under consideragion i consulted those in whose judgment i have great confidence and was advised that the adoption of the dempsey amendment did not alter in any way the effect of the bill that it did not declare any priority for power and navigation to which of course i could not have agreed it does make it clear that congress shall have power in the future to determine what power or navigation development shall be permitted if any as stated in the resolution of the national capital park and planning commission adopted december 15 1928 which urged immediate acquisition of the lands at great falls for park purposes it leavesit open for congress at any future time to authorize the development of the river flood control and power potentialities of the area should such development become of great importance and be justified in the public interest as a matter of fact i am entirely confident that when once this parkway is established hundreds will visit the area and enjoy it and appreciate it where one goes now and i can not conceive that any congress will ever permit any commercial development to take place in the gorge of the potomac that will materially obliterate its present natural beauties the schaferlaguardia bridge amendments specifically include a free bridge across the potomac at or near great falls as a part of the george washington memorial parkway and also provide that no private toll bridge shall be built within the confines of the george washington memorial parkway these amendments are desirable making definite provision for a very necessary bridge at great falls as a part of the parkway project and insuring that such a bridge shall not be a toll bridge while congress has heretofore by special act authorized the permit for the construction of a privately owned toll bridge at this point there is of course no guarantee that such toll bridge will be constructed within the time limit in fact the time for its construction has already been extended once under h r 26 as it now stands if the bridge is not built by the private company within the present time limit of their permit there remains definite provision in the parkway law for the building of the bridge if the privately owned bridge is constructed within the time limit of their permit and before the george washington memorial parkway comes into existence the way is open for us to take over such bridge and make it a free bridge such private toll bridge if not built before the george washington memorial parkway comes into existence can not be built at all i would have been very sorry to see the first schafer amendment providing for repeal of the private bridge act go into the bill repealing the right granted that company without any hearing such repeal would not have been proper as a part of h r 26 the schaferlaguardia amendments which did become part of the bill properly care for this situation as the bill now stands while construction of a free bridge at or near great falls is specifically authorized as a part of the george washington memorial parkway cooperation by the states affected or by subdivisions thereof in financing such construction is not provided for and so far as h r 26 is concerned the bridge would be chargeable entirely to the federal treasury the proviso in the bill requiring cooperation in the acquisition of lands and construction of highways was not amended to include and does not include the bridge of course the government would not think of erecting a bridge at great falls until the acquisition of the lands necessary for the parkway is assured the expense of that program is considerable and if maryland and virginia or interested persons give us such cooperation as to make it possible to bring the parkway into being i would advocate construction of the bridge at great falls without contribution by those states further any productive expense which has been incurred by the private company in engineering studies preparation of plans and so forth might be reimbursed in that event by the federal government to the extent that such studies and plans should prove of use in our project in the senate the bill has been referred to the senate committee on the district of columbia of which senator capper is chairman and senator capper will have charge of the handling of the bill in the senate the companion bill of h r 26 having been introduced by him in the last session of congress and again in this i am assured that hearings will be had upon the bill as early as possible in the senate and i am much encouraged at the prospects for favorable action in the committee and in the senate the wonderful possibilities of the george washington memorial parkway were eloquently emphasized by the dean of this house the gentleman from wisconsin when at the close of the debate on h r 26 he said one of the most instructive beautiful drives in the world when these contemplated improvements have all been perfected will be the drive from the capitol through the mall past the great monument to washington past the memorial to lincoln up the river to the falls across that bridge and down on the other side past arlington to mount vernon more than any other road in all the world it will teach patriotism and thrill the hearts of lovers of liberty i quote the following extract from the leading editorial of the washington star of yesterday january 31"], [0.0072994232177734375, 0.9927005767822266, 1, "when the drought relief bill was up for consideration i offered an amendment proposing to give the secretary of agriculture the power to make loans wherever an emergency exists regardless of the cause of the emergency but it was voted down on page 3 lines 3 and 4 of the bill as it now stands the secretary will not be able to give any relief to farmers in any section or state regardless of how grave the emergency might be unless the emergency was brought about by a drought or storm my amendment proposed to strike out on lines 3 and 4 after the word areas the following phrase of the united states and insert in lieu thereof and in line 5 insert after the word exists the phrase in the united states thus amended this part of section 1 of the bill would read as follows that the secretary of agriculture is hereby authorized for the crop of 1931 to make advances or loans to farmers in the drought and or storm stricken areas and where he shall find that an emergency for such assistance exists in the united states for the purchase of seed of suitable crops fertilizer feed for work stock and or fuel and oil for tractors used for crop production i am satisfied that as far as my state is concerned which is in a serious condition as far as production credit for farmers in 1931 goes that our farmers will not receive any benefits under this bill without this amendment i was very sorry to see the house vote down the amendment of my colleague which proposed to increase the appropriation from 30 000 000 to 60 000 000 i am satisfied that you will find after congress shall have adjourned march 4 that there will be a much greater need and demand for these funds than can be supplied with a 30 000 000 appropriation i want to state to the house that one of the real reasons for the great need of this type of legislation at this time is because of the bad financial condition of agriculture everywhere and also because of the lack of credit facilities in the agricultural sections if the farmers of my state and other agricultural states were to blame for this condition it would be very unfair on their part to request through their representative this type of legislation i hope to show you later on in my discussion that the party in power is largely to blame for these conditions i want to challenge the statement made by the republican floor leader as well as others who have stated that this legislation proposing a loan of 60 000 000 to farmers is a dole i have the credit of starting the fight in the fall of 1928 for a similar loan for the stormstricken areas of the southeast we succeeded in securing 6 000 000 for this section of the country with the loan office located in columbia my district i am glad to be able to report that our people paid 85 per cent of these loans back to the government our farmers accepted same as a loan and not a dole from their government and although they had a very bad year because of continued heavy rains they were able to pay back this percentage of the amount loaned to them one of the reasons these loans were not paid in full was because of the lost motion on the part of congress in passing the bill so that farmers could get the money in time to properly plant their crops since the coming of the boll weevil in the south we have had to plant cotton very early so as to get a crop of bolls before the weevils get so bad even then if we have a rainy spell during july or august the weevils not only get all of the top crop but much of the early crop of bolls ordinarily i would be against this type of legislation and asked for it in 1929 for my section only because it seemedi to be a fixed policy of this government inasmuch as several bills had been passed by congress previous to 1929 for other sections i contend that if agriculture were getting a square deal from the administration in power that we would not need this type of legislation if you want to give relief and bring prosperity to this country you should undertake to undo some of the things you have done in the past 10 years that have absolutely paralyzed agriculture which disease is fast extending to industry this will mean millions of unemployment and under your present policies it will not be long before you will stand here on this floor passing legislation in the way of a dole to take care of suffering and hungry humanity if this type loan to farmers wherein you take a mortgage over all his crops which includes his garden his labor and that of his wife and children millions of them slaving in the fields hungryand half clad is a dole what about government loans to railroads made in 1918 is it not a fact that you have also given to the railroads of the country by special legislation through the interstate commerce commission the right to fix exorbitant freight rates thereby robbing agriculture out of millions especially on short hauls this is one of the disastrous evils to agriculture that you could remedy but when i mention the plan whereby you could reduce freight rates on agricultural products on a fair basis according to the value of the products i am called a radical farm products moving into the channels of trade and to the factory are bulky and heavy yet freight rates are based on bulkspaceand weight you can ship a suit of clothes that would sell for 50 as cheap or cheaper than a bushel of corn that would sell for 75 cents for the same distance this will apply to practically all farm products in comparison with practically all manufactured products i understand even with these special privileges the railroads of this country or a great many of them are getting in bad shape and are asking the cancellation of their obligation to the government who is to blame for the condition of these railroads today certainly not the farmer or the local cotton buyer who has to pay these extremely high freight rates because of the tremendous savings by hauling cotton in the south by trucks farmers cotton merchants and cotton factors have been forced to go into the business of trucking their cotton for the past two years this has meant thousands of dollars to farmers the railroads because of excessive freight rates have driven these people into trucking cotton and now they want legislation passed placing truck lines under the interstate commerce commission i have a bill pending before the interstate commerce committee of the house that would bring about high density gin compression of the farmers cotton wherein railroads would be able to load 100 bales in a box car whereas with the type of bale that we now have being the same type we have had for the past hundred years the railroads can only put about 35 bales in a box car with the passage of this bill it would enable the railroads to cut freight rates on cotton onethird or more in the meantime i can not even get my bill considered by the committee why because the interstate commerce commission seems to think morq of the railroads who have been receiving fixed high rates and the wellorganized large compress owners located in the cotton centers and at the ports who now have a monopoly in compressing cotton at the expense of the cotton farmer and the local shipper than they do farmers the department of agriculture says this is good legislation the farm board says it would mean millions to farmers but many of you like myself interested in your people and who would like to do things that would mean relief know that it is almost impossible to pass legislation in congress or even get consideration of same by a committee unless you can go over to some departmentthathas to do with the legislation and get a favorable report on same i again ask mr tilson and his administration the question if this droughtrelief legislation is simply a dole to farmers what would you call the tariff bills passed in 1922 and last year that are robbing farmers out of millions for the benefit of special manufacturing interests these bills were passed with the excuse that they were for the purpose of saving agriculture and keeping labor working and prosperous in the united states certainly you have millions of unemployed and more poverty and misery with agriculture today than ever before in the history of this country therefore you have absolutely fallen through on the excuse offered for the passage of this legislation oh yes you say that manufacturers are also getting in bad shape financially i agree with you and your tariff legislation is one of the chief causes and before you will be able to bring prosperity to this country you are going to have to reduce the uncalledfor high rates placed in the tariff bill for the manufacturer at the expense of agriculture and the consuming public by these unreasonable rates contained in these tariff acts you have paralyzed and robbed farmers out of what little purchasing power was left them and of course when merchants can not sell to these millions of farmers there are no orders going from them to the manufacturer this means the closing down or parttime operation on the part of the manufacturers and it further means the laying off of labor and the reducing of wages which is unjust and not in line with your tariff theory it also means the paralyzing of the purchasing power of the millions of unemployed people in the united states no my friends these loans are not doles on the part of the government to farmers neither is the bad condition of agriculture caused from overproduction which we here on the floor of this house term surplus these conditions are brought about because of underconsumption which was brought about by the paralyzing of the purchasing power of the farmer labor and the consuming public you can pass your various socalled relief bills but it is my belief that this type of relief will only be temporary eventually you are going to have to cut out special privileges and doles to big business and the well organized and put agriculture and labor on a square fair and equal basis with other groups for the past 10 years you have given to at least 52 industries another dole at the expense of agriculture and the consuming public by allowing the antitrust laws to become inactive and thereby allowing industries to combine merge monopolize and fix prices not only on what they sell but for the raw materials the farmers products not only has the department of justice gone to sleep on the job but the federal trade commission whose business it is to keep real competition in business active and alive has actually joined in with industry by holding for and with them trade practice conferences and indorsing fixed rules and trade practices whereby competing industries cah get together and fix prices for the past 10 years under the republican rule there has been more merging combining monopolizing and price fixing without regard to antitrust laws thereby robbing farmers and the consuming public than any other period of the history of this country we have also had the wildest orgy of speculation and robbing of the public on unreasonable paper prices on the stock market in many instances selling absolutely worthless stock this gang of robbers were rivileged to use without a protest the names of president coolidge and president hoover in giving propaganda to the press in boosting their unhampered scheme as the coolidge boom and the hoover boom in the meantime farmers could not borrow money to carry on because of fancy interest rates on call money in new york which was as high as 15 and 20 per cent thereby draining every section of the country of funds that should have been used for agriculture and other purposes every paper that you would pick up was full of coolidge prosperity every time you would listen in on the radio you would hear a republican broadcasting prosperity and promising a continuation of same if the people would keep the republican party in power what about the automobile trust that fixes the prices all the way down the line even to the purchaser with a contract stating that if any dealer or agent at any time cuts prices his head is immediately cut off what about the bread trust flour that sells for 6 per barrel when made into bread sells for 30 senator capper is calling for an investigation at this minute and says that we have the largest bread trust in the face of starving millions of american citizens that we have ever had we have had this trust with us for some time and it seems to be satisfactory to the federal trade commission and the department of justice most of you know that my colleague mr patman and i have been fighting the cottonseed oil mill trust for the past 12 months and if there is a member of congress or anybody else who believes that this industry is not enjoying the most hogtied trust ever formed indorsed by the federal trade commission he should read the hearings now being conducted by the federal trade commission of this industry we have caught them right in the middle of the road with the goods you might say what are you going to do about it i say that it is up to the department of justice and the federal trade commission both of them operating under a republican administration and seemingly satisfied with these doles to this industry when your party for the past 10 years has been promising relief for farmers and talking loud what you have done and are going to do for farmers and labor you have brought bankruptcy poverty and unemployment to millions with actual suffering because of what you have done to them and allowed special interest to do to them i was in the office of the comptroller of the currency the other day on special business and several times while there one of the office force would come in and stick a bunch of papers in the hands of the comptroller the comptroller remarked can not you come in here for anything else except to give me notice of more closed banks yet when i offered my amendment to the drought relief bill proposing to give the secretary of agriculture power to make loans anywhere in the united states where he found an emergency the republican side of the house promptly voted it down what about thousands of farmers good honest farmers living in sections even in counties where they have not a single bank left no corporations functioning under the intermediate credit bank therefore no place to go and get money to run their farms this is one of the emergencies that i am talking about very few of the banks left will furnish money to farmers yet under this bill there is no relief for these sections or farmers and you refuse to extend it by voting down my amendment in 1918 the railroad interests came to congress and said we havent anywhere to go and get funds to carry on in the meantime we have very little collateral to offer investors will not buy our obligations therefore we want uncle sam to make us a loan we find these railroads were in the same condition at that time that hundreds of sections and thousands of farmers are in today farmers offer you their all in the way of a mortgage over their crops and their labor including the labor of their wives and children yet you call it a dole and refuse to do it with a sufficient amount to bring relief the railroads on their request were loaned 985 000 000 yet this congress refuses a 60 000 000 loan to farmers who find themselves in similar circumstances listen to what andrew mellon says about the loans to railroads and what he wants congress to do about it at this time at the time the government made loans to the railroads we had just emerged from the world war the state of the money market and the financial condition of the railroads did not permit them to borrow sufficient funds in the market to carry them through the reconstruction period mr mellon further states the railroads owe the government a balance of 55 000 000 and perhaps the government will be able to collect about half of this amount and the balance will be a loss he also requests that congress pass legislation at this time giving him the right to make settlements for balance due by the railroads so as to accept compromises cancel any part of this amount that can not be collected and the privilege of reducing interest rates from 6 per cent to 31 2 per cent while considering the drought relief bill judge brand of georgia one of the ablest members in congress a man who is always trying to assist farmers offered an amendment providing that interest rates on loans to farmers should not exceed 4 per cent a republican the only negro congressman in congress objected to the amendment out of the loans made in the southeast during the past two years thousands of negroes received loans yet de priest would refvse to let his government do unto his race what mellon would have the government do for the railroads you talk about radicalism and communism in this country even to the extent that you have a special committee investigating so as to see what progress is being made by these people just keep up the unfair tactics toward the great masses and continue to hand out tariff doles special legislation and special favors and privileges to big business at the expense of the masses and you will not have to have a committee to look around to be able to ascertain the fact that you have thousands of bolsheviks in this country how can you expect farmers to be in a position to pay their debts or borrow money when on december 1 prices of 21 principal crops averaged 31 per cent below 1929 and 1929 was bad enough you added a tariff of 45 cents to wheat and this years crop although smaller than 1929 is selling for 39 per cent below last year cotton production is smaller than 1929 yet cotton is selling for 8 and 9 cents or 50 per cent below 1929 if this cotton cost farmers 25 to 35 per bale more to produce it than they actually receive for it would you not think that emergencies exist in many of the cotton states even though they did not have a storm or drought i am hoping that in 1932 the democratic party will come in power then we can put tariff rates on a competitive basis thereby giving american industry a fair chance and not a dole in the meantime we can bring back friendly relations with foreign nations and trade relations that we ought to be enjoying now this would mean the exportation of our surplus cotton and many other surplus farm products i have a bill proposing to extend credit to 5 000 000 farmers now owning homes in drainage districts who because of what has been done to them find themselves in the positions of the railroads that came to uncle sam in 1918 and received a blessing i am wondering what the congress is going to do about giving this relief i tell you my friends that unless uncle sam extends a line of credit to farmers in drainage districts now in distress with a very small rate of interest or no interest at all and take them out of the hands of private holders of drainage bonds thousands of perfectly good farmers who now own their homes wood lots pastures and farming implements will be driven into tenantry or to the increasing ranks of the unemployed what will happen then these lands will be farmed by corporations chain farming ask the gentleman from illinois what has happened in his state in cases where thousands of acres of land have already been taken over and he will paint you a sad picture as far as independent farming is concerned i have a bill now pending that would pay exservice men the face value of their adjustedservice certificates but we are unable to get consideration thereon even from the committee because of the administration with its leader mr mellon against it again mr mellon says the treasury and the taxpayers of the country can not stand for the amount that would be needed to pay these boys what uncle sam owes them no these boys are borrowing from year to year on their certificates small dribs of their own money and paying the government for the privilege of doing so at a rate of 6 per cent interest oh no you do not see a statement coming up from mr mellon even asking that interest rates be reduced to 3 or 4 per cent on these loans but he has sent in a request for the railroads yet you wonder why there is so much unrest and so many dissatisfied citizens there are thousands of these boys today who have not enough bread and meat to feed their wives and children for 30 days many of them are out of work and need to be in hospitals and as far as south carolina is concerned we have hundreds on the waiting list that can not find a vacant bed it would be a real relief to turn this money loose in every nook and corner of the united states i advocate the building of suitable postoffice buildings for second and third class post offices in the united states at present there are thousands of localities that do not have decent quarters certainly this government could float bonds for 2 to 3 per cent and give this relief work to the country as well as proper buildings and save millions in exorbitant rents now paid in nearly every case i have a bill pending without any consideration because i can not get the farm board to give me its approval to transfer the intermediate credit bank and its operations over to the federal farm board so that they might work out some plan whereby the intermediate credit bank might function and furnish production credit to farmers i have had several conferences this fall requesting that the federal farm board furnish through the cooperatives the capital to organize corporations to furnish loans to farmers at reasonable interest rates which they can do under the powers given them by the marketing act however the board refuses stating that they might lose some money i tried hard during the first of the cotton season to have the board announce a policy through the cooperatives that they would take all farmers cotton offered on the market at market price as offered from day to day and hold same for a profit in the meantime having the farmers sign up for a reduction in acreage for 1931 no they preferred to offer a 90 per cent loan and if cotton advanced to 11 or 12 cents a 75 per cent loan on cotton that was at that time selling from 25 to 35 per bale below the cost of production and at a time when farmers could not pay their obligations even at full market price by offering a loan scheme as stated rather than give the full price for cotton the board lost a wonderful opportunity to have farmers come into the cooperative association if the board is ever to be successful farmers will have to organize in the meantime they have let the bulk of this cheap cotton go into the hands of cotton factors speculators and mills i would like to see the board at this time when cotton is selling for 8 and 9 cents step into the market and buy 5 000 000 bales of cotton and allot same to farmers who would be glad to accept same on a basis of the number of bales made during this year or an average for the past five years if the board would do this farmers would be glad to sign a contract not to plant an acre of cotton in 1931 certainly farmers would be glad to do this because it would save a large fertilizer bill and the borrowing of money that they will need in planting cotton next year which will be very hard to get why would farmers want to plant cotton at these prices which is 25 to 35 per bale below the cost of producing same if the board would carry this cotton for them i am a cotton planter and i will gladly sign up on these bases now what would this scheme mean all these farmers would come into the cotton coops and i mean the best cotton farmers of the south it will bring about the proper reduction in acreage that never has nor never will be by voluntary reduction no the board will not do this because it would mean prosperity to cotton farmers and the whipping of the cotton interest that has orgarrized pooling millions to fight the farm board so as to keep the cotton farmer at their mercy where they have had him for the past 50 years practically every middleman many of them real parasites that have been sapping the life blood out of producers and consumers along with the united states chamber of commerce is fighting the farm board to the last ditch they are doing everything possible to keep farmers from organizing and in the meantime it looks as if every time the farm board moves they spend more money do the wrong thing and get in a worse position in closing my friends i know of no better evidence that can be offered to sustain my charges concerning the actions and policies of the republican administration than a statement made by expresident calvin coolidge in the washington post this morning wherein he stated it is an axiomatic policy of government that it be conducted for the benefit of the people the question always is how this best can be done more and more our people are becoming interdependent a few practically independentbut the mass are connected with large producing organizations their welfare depends not only on their own efforts and skill but on the ability and success of the management of large concerns only if the concern prospers are they secure that is why the government encourages industry it is difficult to assist the wage earner directly but he can be benefited by making it profitable to employ him mr coolidge plainly states that the government should be deeply concerned in giving the mass a square deal but the republican way of doing it is to hand out doles special privileges and legislation to industry and the few believing that industry and big business generally will divide with the masses and thereby make them prosperous i am glad to state that the great common mass of people who have thus been treated by the party in power spoke with no unspeakable words in the last election and i am predicting democratic victory in 1932 whereby we may be able to restore the government to the people and extend prosperity to the masses mr sproulof illinois i call for the regular order"], [0.007860720157623291,

worse i would like also to have the bureau ascertain why it is and why it has been that though your committee has reported measures designed to relieve the situation by checking the incoming of alien

tomatoes are overproduced and without a profitable market so are onions and citrus fruits cotton is down wheat prices are at the bottom reports from the border tell of hundreds of carloads of lettuce

american labor lately reciting our widespread unemployment situation americans out of work wandering to the doors of other countries and having those doors slammed in their faces i wonder when the time came when uncle sam got afraid to do anything to the other fellow not first but after the other fellow did it to him canada has restricted american labor and yet labor importers ruling the powers of congress at the dictates of speculative and corporate interests which are so shortsighted selfish and unpatriotic that they do not recognize or care for the general welfare have suppressed this legislation and the country ought to know the facts farmers farm workers and other working people must suffer ruinous consequences in order that the speculative farmers and mainly the sugar interests railway companies and other powerful groups may increase their profits by employing mexican peons at lower wages to live under harder conditions then the men who do these things talk pharisaically about farm relief and relieving unemnloyment somebody ought to tell the truth about it and that is what i am trying to do you know it is true and the country knows it is true"], [0.009534597396850586,

there goes into the avenues of monopoly yet they let onethird of a sentence keep us out of an agreement if that onethird of a sentence were not for the interests of the power monopoly do you believe

who is afraid to trust congress i know some people have been afraid of congress there are some people who have been around congress for years getting as thin as a bean pole who had some claim before congress and those are the men who are afraid to trust congress i want you to understand that the same men who are opposing the little language in this bill voted to give 500 000 000 to the farm board to go out here and buy wheat and cottonto gamble they made no cry against that now understand me we have to trust the farm board i would not be fool enough to require the farm board to come to congress every time they wanted to buy 100 bales of cotton or 1 000 bushels of wheat then why should we ask this commission to come to congress every time they wanted a few dollars to do their duty toward muscle shoals these same gentlemen who oppose this little language in the bill voted for the shipping board to throw away money they gave the shipping board authority to go out and sell 100 shipsgave them authority to go out and repair ships and spend millions of dollars i have not heard a single one complain about that there is another thing my friends that same crowd of gentlemen are voting to let the president of the united states have all this money in this drought relief and i am for all of that we let the president have it to spend it just as he pleases to help out in this awful distress they are not complaining about that yet they complain and say that we ought not to let that muscle shoals board use the money that might come from the sale of power for the purpose of constructing a transmission line somewhere what is the objection they say that they think that board ought to come to congress for that money listen to the inconsistency of that in this same bill we give the power to that board to expend 10 000 000 to go down there and remodel the plant to make fertilizer and do everything they please but when it comes to letting a little money that might be used for surplus power through the sale of that power be used in the construction of a transmission line then they say that the board ought to come to congress to get that privilege i do not know whether any of you gentlemen have ever served in the state legislatures in the first place if the state of tennessee wanted to get a transmission line built down to muscle shoals it would have to go before the state legislature and what would happen there would be the attorneys there of the power trust and their newspaper henchmen and their lobbyists of every kind and they would be around there pulling bill jones and john smith here and there to keep that transmission line from being built go to georgia and the same thing would happen go to my state of mississippi and the same thing would happen go to alabama and the same thing would happen come to congress and the same thing would happen that is the reason why this language ought to be left in this bill do you mean to believe that senator norris does not know what he is talking about when he put that language in that bill i was on the conference committee that agreed to that bill that went up to president coolidge i helped put that

considered in the senate for more than nine months there were 1 253 amendments adopted by the senate after this long consideration of it and many more should have been adopted that were not offered let alone adopted many of the amendments adopted raised the tariff rates higher than those proposed in the house and many of those adopted only reduced the rates slightly and will be of little help to the consumer there were some very important amendments adopted which i shall discuss further on in my address legislation drafted as this bill was and brought into the house and considered under gag rule as this bill was considered in the house always carries provisions that no man however intelligent he may be can justify or defend this house at one time was a deliberative body but can it be said in the way this bill has been forced through under the lash of the leaders on the republican side of this chamber that it is now that kind of a deliberative body i answer as you must answer no the country ought to know just how this bill was written and how it has been l handled in the house by the republican party now in control of the house by 102 majority and if they know it in the next congressional elections as we know it here there will be many of you that will remain at home in the next session and your places will be filled by men who believe that this is a government of the people for the people and by the people and who have the courage to act on that conviction this bill being a revenue measure had to originate with the ways and means committee which is composed of 25 men10 democrats and 15 republicans a hearing was had before that committee as a whole and the 10 democrats were permitted to sit with the 15 republicans in the hearing but when the hearings were over the 10 democrats were not permitted to help draft the bill or even to be in the room when it was written they were not permitted to offer an amendment to it in the house even no member of the house of 435 members was permitted to offer an amendment to the bill in the house unless he was one of the big 15 if every voter who goes to the polls in the next election knew this i say to you that they would repudiate any man that helped or participated in it you in the majority party who voted for this gag rule were warned by the democratic leader john garner of texas before you voted to adopt the gag rule just what you were going to do and just what you did do that prevented the members of congress from properly representing their people and to offer such amendments as would take care of their interest in this bill the tariff bill of 1922 was the highest tariff bill that was ever written up to that time there is no justification in the light of reason and fairness to all the people for the high rates carried in it and which has given the already rich the right to exploit the poor and further to pile up riches under it the rich have grown richer and the poor poorer not satisfied with that they came to this congress and not only requested but also demanded that their rates be raised to the high level fixed in this bill which can not be defended as either just or equitable it was claimed by the advocates of revision of the tariff that it was to put agriculture on an equality with industry to have done this would have required the high tariff rates on manufactured goods to be reduced and the tariff rates on agriculture raised instead of doing this they have given in this bill the highest rates ever proposed on manufactured products and a slight increase on agricultural products i would be glad to support the rates on agriculture and to vote for a reduction on the rates now enforced on manufactured products where this tariff bill helps a farmer to the amount of 1 it takes away from him 5 on the increased prices he has to pay on the manufactured products he has to buy and his dollar has further lost its purchasing power that is the trouble now with the farming class he gets but few dollars for what he produces and when he goes to buy the necessities for the family the prices are so high his dollar will buy but little the senate has placed the debenture amendment on this bill which will materially help the cotton grower if it is put into effect the amendment giving a debenture of 2 cents per pound on lint cotton would be 10 per bale weighing 500 pounds if you would give cotton farmers 10 more per bale on his cotton than he is now getting it would materially help the debenture is not a bounty as some try to contend but it is defined by webster as a drawback let us if we can illustrate how it would work there is now a tariff on wheat of 42 cents per bushel when collected the debenture on all articles of agriculture except cotton on which there is no tariff is onehalf of the tariff and the farmer who grew the wheat would get back on his debenture certificate 21 cents per bushel or the same amount the government gets the farmer grew it and sold it and made it possible for the government to get its 21 cents per bushel then why not let him have at least half of what he produced for the government if you call that a bounty for the farmer the other is bounty for the government another amendment put on by the senate should be retained and that is doing away with the flexible provision which gives the president the right to raise or lower the tariff 50 per cent this is a dangerous power and should never be delegated to one man the power to tax is the power to destroy with this power given to the president he could make or break any corporation at his will he could impoverish the people at his will congress alone under the united states constitution has a right to levy and collect taxes and god knows it has abused this privilege enough without delegating it to some one else to further abuse it president hoover opposes the debenture which is in the interest of the farmer and wants to retain this power to raise a tariff why let him answer to the people the tariff commission has prepared estimates of the cost of the debenture to the government if the norrissimmons amendment is retained in the tariff bill the burden on the treasury would be a direct benefit to farmers the certificates the commission says would be distributed as follows on agricultural commodities and manufactured food products 89 063 140 tobacco and tobacco manufactures 103 952 368 cotton and cotton manufactures 86 741 393 it is pointed out by the commission that if exports of farm products should increase the amount that would be paid in certificates would also increase similarly a reduction of exports would mean a corresponding reduction of the certificates this tariff bill will add at least an extra billion of dollars that

feet in the eastern half of the country they covered approximately 675 000 000 acres with 3 400 000 000 000 board feet of saw timber from the earliest days of settlement forests have been indispensable to our economic life the colonists not only drew upon them for their buildings their fuel and the material for fashioning the most varied articles of everyday use they derived from them a large part of the products that sustained their foreign trade the first cargo sent back from jamestown in 1608 included pitch tar soap ashes wainscoting and clapboards the first from plymouth in 1621 was made up of clapboards and beaver skins ships masts and spars staves lumber naval stores pearlash and potash and furs constituted important items of commerce throughout the eighteenth century but the forests also stood in the settlers way to conquer the continent for civilization it was necessary to drive back the forest to open room for the plow and so began the long story of antagonism and destruction our eastern forest area has it is true not quite been cut in half for despite three centuries of abuse neglect and wasteful exploitation the tree cover has clung stubbornly to the land not wrested from it by the plow but from its remaining 350 000 000 acres has been mined or burned nearly all the original forest wealth through destructive lumbering and the hand of indifference or hostility although remedial measures are being resorted to in limited regions each year sees the process of depletion carried further we are still abusing and devastating still converting what might be productive land for all time into virtually idle waste this l hysical and economic tragedy of forest neglect and forest abuse touches our life upon every hand the need of an adequate national policy of forestry has long been recognized but progress in its attainment has been slow and halting the reservation of the western publicdomain timberlands began after years of agitation nearly 40 years since in 1911 the weeks act inaugurated the purchase by the federal government of eastern forest lands at the headwaters of our principal rivers deforesration of the mountains menaced navigation therefore commerce impaired beauty laid waste the haunts of wild life the paradise of hunters and recreation seekers needlessly curtailed tle supplies of timber for the use of industry diminished power resources placed on washing hillsides temporary and unprofitable farms that add to our agricultural problem before these fields were shorn and lilled full to the brims our rivers flowed the melody of waters filled the fresh and boundless wood a nd torrents dashed and rivulets played and fentains spouted in the shade for 13 years the weeks law alone governed the federal acquisition policy at the outset it was an experimental venture into a new field entered upon by congress with hesitancy and misgivings to what extent its continuamce would be sanctioned was for a time uncertain with various ups and dowvns however the work went on it was handicapped by inability to plan ahead with greater certainty and by the necessity to adjust its organization to fluctuating supplies of funds but at the close of the fiscal year 1924 the area acquired under the weeks law totaled 2 123 000 acres of which the cost had been slightly less than 10 889 000 the purchased lands lay within 19 socalled purchase areas in 11 eastern states from maine to georgia and in arkansas the purchase program under the weeks law was confined to the acquisition of mountain lands at the headwaters of navigable streams and its ultimate goal had been fixed at a total of 1 000 000 acres in the white mountains of northern new england and 5 000 000 acres in the southern appalachian region but in 1924 following an extensive inquiry into the whole forestry situation and needs a new policy was established by congress thlrough enactment of the clarkealenary act its objectives were comprehensive and designed to bring about a solution of the national problem of forestry in as large a degree as possible by public aid and encouragement to private timber growing this was sought through provisions for greatly enlarged cooperative activities of the federal government and the states in fire protection aid to forest planting and other mensures promotive of private forest management but the law recognized also the need for a broader policy of federal acquisition and administration of forest lands in the east private forestry needs the help of public example to demonstrate sound practices there is need too of public ownership to make productive forest areas that will not under present conditions attract private forestry the forest problem of the country can not be solved solely through private forestry it is too big and too urgent it is of deepest national concern the national forest reservation commission has studied the problem with a view to applying to it most effectively the policy of acquisition enacted by congress in the clarkemcnary law that law removed the limitation which under the weeks law confined purchases to lands on the headwaters of navigable streams and necessary to regulate their flow the national forest reservation commission is composed of three members of the cabinet two senators and two congressmen it has formulated a program the execution of that program of course is contingent upon the approval of congress through appropriations to enable the purchases called for under the program to be made the purpose of the program it should be remembered is to carry out the policy already laid down by congress in the weeks law the proposed program in substance contemplates four general proposals the first is to consolidate federal ownership within the 16 purchase units in 12 states hitherto established under the weeks law primarily to protect navigable streams roughly this will involve the further purchase of 4 000 000 acres of land the second is to further extend the protection of the headwaters of navigable streams by the establishment of five additional purchase areas in three states primarily for watershed protection this involving the eventual purchase of an additional 1 100 000 acres of land so much for watershed protection as a major or dominant purpose of the program the clarkemenary act of june 7 1924 however gave this federal movement a new purpose and a broader field by prescribing timber production as a major objective still limiting the purchases to the watersheds of navigable streams but removing the requirement that they be confined to the headwaters and definitely related to the maintenance of navigability since its enactment 13 additional purchase units have been established in the lake states and southern pine regions many of these contain lands reserved from the public domain in addition to which the purchase of 500 000 acres already has been authorized by the national forest reservation commission the third step therefore is to complete the consolidation of these approved units by the further purchase of approximately 1 500 000 acres of land but there is need for still further units some 22 or so in 10 states containing about 3 000 000 acres consequently the fourth step is the eventual acquisition of so much as may be necessary of that acreage the most or probably all of it this in brief is the program the national forest reservation commission has indicated the need for authorization of a purchase program that can be prosecuted in an orderly manner as a definitely approvel plan it has recommended authorization of a rate of purchase that will complete the program in 10 years through an outlay of 5 000 000 annually the director of the budget has recognized the desirability of authorization of an orderly program covering a period of years subject however to the condition that the program is subject to readjustment should a future financial situation of the government make advisable a retrenchment of the expenditures and a slackening of the pace a new authorization is a necessity for any continuance of the work beyond the end of the fiscal year when the present authorization expires that authorization was given by congress in 1928 it provided for acquisition appropriations over a 3year period beginning in the fiscal year 1929 with 2 000 000 and increasing to 3 000 000 for the fiscal years 1930 and 1931 the high purpose of h r 10877 that i introduced in the house of representatives march 18 1930 is to provide for the continuance of this important work without retraction from the present rate it does not authorize the 10year program that the national forest reservation commission has recommended nor does it authorize prosecution of that program at the recommended rate in the soundness of the commissions proposed program and the desirability of proiding for its execution i heartily concur but with the present financial requirements of the government as they are and in order to cooperate with the bureau of the budget i have compromised by introducing a bill that authorizes only continuance of the work at the present rate of 3 000 000 a year for two years instead of at the recommended rate ot 5 000 000 a year for 10 years this bill has the unanimous support of the great agricultural committee it is your high

of fulfillment is here senate joint resolution 211 is identical with house joint resolution 403 offered by the gentleman from louisiana doctor aswell both provide for advances or loans to farmers in

000 000 instead of 25 000 000 as originally provided as i understand the procedure before the house today is to suspend the rules and pass the senate bill or resolution after amending it by striking out all the senate measure after the enacting clause and substituting the house resolution in plain english it means gag rule done intentionally to limit debate to 20 minutes to each side and so that no amendment can be offered to the bill it means that the drought relief bill will be limited to 30 000 000 instead of 60 000 000 as provided by the senate bill it means that none of this fund can be spent for human food but must be used for seed for planting fertilizer feed for livestock or fuel and oil for tractors this is a relief measure it gives the helpless farmer the privilege and aid to feed his work mulebut he must withhold food from his hungry child by governmental aid the farmer may have a fat work mule but this help will be denied the farmers lean and hungry family somehow i believe my farmers are humane enough to feed the hungry people first and then turn to the animal fold my people prize the human equation as taking precedence over the beast of the lower kingdom the secretary of agriculture has tried faithfully to solve the questions of the farmer and overproduction the approval of the haugen bill was by the acting secretary the secretary certainly was not at home when that department sent its letter to chairman haugen it was only a few months ago that secretary hyde made an illuminating speech on overproduction in substance he said if we would destroy the dieticians of the united states and let the people eat what they want our cribs would soon be empty and overproduction would be solvedand now his acting secretary declares for rations for the work horse and mule but no food for the plowman the secretary of agriculture and the acting secretary probably have not enough experience in farming to know it takes food to give the farmer strength to guide the plow just as well as it takes food to give old beck the strength to pull the plow i represent one of the greatest agricultural districts in americarich and great in production and versatility in production our people were bowed under the financial depression heretofore called panic of 1929 and the spring and early summer of 1930 then came the drought from the middle of may to the middle of september there was scarcely any waterfall in tennesseeat least in middle tennessee we had an unprecedcnted drought in the early spring of 1930 in my section we have not exceeding 35 per cent of a crop especially grain oats wheat and rye were failures the hill corn did not make it burned up our valley and bottom corn was light nearly all of it late and the early frost and freezes destroyed the larger part of this i speak not only in a general way of conditions but personally i know what i am talking about our pastures in august were dead and dry enough to burn near the railroads many of them did burn prices of farm products and grain and livestock are on the rocks my country is usually a land of plenty now without fault on their part a large part of my people are in the direst distress never before have my people needed help they have heretofore met every problem without a murmur the 11 counties in my district are in the stricken section seventynine counties of the 95 counties in the state of tennessee are in this area if i remember correctly every county in middle tennessee is in the stricken district five thousand families in tennessee are in need of assistance hardworking honest people heretofore making a comfortable living they labored this year but the fruits of their labor never ripened the drought took all from them the story of the drought in my country is the same picture as in many other sections and states relief of this kind is not new to congress money from the public treasury has been donated or given in a large number of cases to fire flood and earthquake sufferers i venture the public treasury has been called on to aid the unfortunate more than a hundred times the amounts have ranged from small to large some years ago the world citizen now the president fed the hungry people of europe with american moneys 107 000 000 was appropriated at one time it was spent to ease human misery and hunger it was a donation that gift from the united states treasury distributed by the president then was right but the advance or loan to the american farmer in his distress must be pared down to the pittance of 30 000 000 to take care of the people in distress in 21 statesin whole or part1 016 counties are within the territory needing this aid the states affected have approximately 50 000 000 people the loan or advancement is but a pittance measured by the drought calamity then too it is limited to seed feed fertilizer fuelno human food and in order to put over the presidents policy in the parliamentary situation the gag rule is applied to cut off full debate and to prevent all amendments so as to eliminate an increase in amount if the president is to take credit by and have the glory of feeding the hungry hordes of europe from our treasury he must take the responsibility of denying reasonable loans to the worthy american farmer rendered hungry and helpless in part by the drought aid to the droughtstricken area is not a party question it is an appeal to the humane side of congress the gentleman from connecticut mr tilsoni says the planters of the south and southwest are not the only ones who will be hungry before the winter is over others will need food i believe him we were promised a marvelous prosperity by the administration of today but instead prosperity is on a long long strike the laborer can not get employment to earn his wage his savings are spent and necessarily hunger is turning the corner coming toward him but to relieve this man surely we should not buy him a pick and shovel or a set of tools he is hungry what he wants is bread let us either lend or give him the money to get it"], [0.011620521545410156, 0.9883794784545898, 1, "i thank the gentleman general hines administrator of veterans affairs states that the veterans bill passed last year will cost approximately 25 000 000 this year and will cost approximately 50 000 000 next year this bill takes care this year of some 70 000 exservice men and next year some 150 000 who aim suffering from tuberculosis and various diseases in most instances these are men who went overseas and who when they came back were so anxious to get home that when they were discharged they said that their physical cbndition was good they did not want to be detained in camps and hospitals for the war being over they felt their services were needed at home this appropriation has put these men in a much better attitude toward our government these soldiers who risked their lives for this nation who went abroad to fight and came back and could not even get consideration for their just claims these soldiers who had families dependent upon them very naturally felt resentment against the government particularly when they knew that many soldiers who did not go overseas had been able to get their claims allowed by the veterans bureau in regard to the cash payment of the bonus i think it would be one of the best business moves that this congress could make today what if war were declared tomorrow would we hesitate to float bonds for four billion or eight billion or twelve billion dollars if the war continued no and mr mellon and the president and you and i would all favor it the bonus will have to be paid in 1945 and there will doubtless never be a time when the soldiers will need money more than now besides the government can borrow money at around 3 per cent interest at this time and it will be good business to pay this debt and place this money in circulation i came to congress with the idea of reducing governmental expenses and have voted against hundreds of measures carrying millions and millions of dollars of appropriations i am sad to say that in most instances these measures became laws and increased our national expenditures from 3 697 400 000 in 1923 when i came to congress to 3 994 152 000 in 1930 this makes an increase of more than 700 000 000 for the past year this enormous expenditure and increase of governmental expenses has taken place under republican rule two years ago when the republican party in a giantlike stride swept into power carrying all of the states except eight and when 40 able and loyal democratic congressmen from former democratic strongholds were defeated it seemed to be the opinion of the republican leaders that they had annihilated the democratic party for all time they seemed to think that the word republican had magic in it republican leaders had preached through so many campaigns that republican rule meant a full dinner pail a living wage for every man and prosperity for all and that it was impossible for disaster to come upon this nation while they were in power that millions came to believe it with this feeling of security president hoover called an extra session of congress saying that it was for the purpose of passing farmrelief measures and a modified revision of the tariff this step led to the downfall and disaster of the republican party it soon became evident to the country that the extra session of congress had not been called to give relief to the distressed farmers of the nation but that it was a republican move to increase the tariff upon thousands of manufactured articles produced in the big factories of the east it developed that the great industrial leaders who had been paying millions of dollars as campaign contributions to the republican party were not satisfied with the enormous profits they were making i was before the ways and means committee of the house when hearings were held for months and months during the extra session on the present tariff law manufacturers were continually day after day demanding higher and higher rates and they were successful in their demands the republicans passed the smoothawley tariff bill during these many months of the extra session of congress foreign nations began to realize that we were building higher tariff walls against them in an effort to offset our exorbitant tariff rates 33 foreign nations banded together to boycott american products and agreed to trade with each other with the result that our foreign trade has fallen off more than 100 000 000 per month and some seven millions of our people are now out of employment if this nation is to endure we must have a change in governmental policies laws must be enacted to give to the farmers the small banker the individual merchant those engaged in small business and the ordinary laborer a fairer distribution of the wealth of the nation today some 23 000 millionaires own approximately 320 000 000 000 of the wealth of the united states and while 120 000 000 people only own 80 000 000 000 there is more distress among the farmers today than ever before the prices of agricultural products are lower than at any time since the beginning of the world war while the prices of manufactured products are much higher than they were prior to the war the cotton farmers in my section made plenty of cotton last year but after paying for fertilizer ginning expenses and taxes they have nothing left conditions are so bad that banks and merchants in most instances have not been able to extend credit and it has been necessary for us to pass legislation here providing for the lending of money to farmers in the droughtstricken sections who are not able to obtain credit elsewhere thousands of bank failures have left a trail of despair and want throughout the nation i consider the present loose banking laws a national disgrace and congress should take the matter in hand and pass legislation that will make the depositors free from loss the wealth of the nation is not only unequally distributed as between individuals but is also unequally distributed as between the different sections of the country the annual report of the comptroller of the currency for 1930 shows the per capita demand and time deposits in the banks in the new england states to be 803 as against 135 in the southern states the per capita savings deposits in the new england states are 579 as against 53 in the southern states in other words each person in the new england states has been able to save on the average 579 while each person in the southern states has been able to save on the average only 53 in a lifetime the people in the new england states have had special national legislation protecting their property rights and this legislation has discriminated against the people of the south and been unfair to them the comparison just made shows why the money panic is so much more severe in our section of the country where money is scarce at all times than in other sections that are more favorably situated financially there should be a fair distribution of the wealth of this country and in order to procure this i know of no more just way than for this congress to pass an oldage and dependency pension law we have never failed to pension those who fought our battles in time of war while i was not a soldier i have year by year met with the exservice men of my district and assisted them personally with their claims and i have supported every veterans measure that has been passed by congress since i became a member but the soldiers are not the only people to whom this nation is indebted we became a nation 150 years ago and since that time we have spent only 10 years in 5 wars and have had 140 years of peace warfare not only brings loss and distress to the soldiers who engage in the conflict but leaves a trail of debt want woe and distress at the fireside of millions of our people today there are many men in this nation who have grown old and while they have never been called upon to fight in defense of their country in time of war they have lived as upright citizens reared families paid their debts and done everything in their power to make this the land of the free and the home of the brave there are thousands of these good men with their precious wives who have grown old and are not physically able to fight the battle of life and carry on as heretofore it behooves the rich the brave the young and the patriotic of this nation to pass a pension law that will reward these good citizens who have fought our countrys battles through the years of peace and who are now helpless and in need i also hold that the corporations and companies throughout this nation should be required to safeguard their employees by pensions which will take care of them in their old age and in times of depression such as we are passing through now i have noticed that most of these corporations are continuing to pay dividends to their stockholders during this depression and in many cases these dividends are being paid out of the earnings that were accumulated during prosperoils times the same principle that applies to the stockholders should apply to the laborers who make so much of the profits for the stockholders part of the earnings of the laborers should be reserved by the companies as a special fund and a percentage of the net earnings of the companies should be added to this fund to accumulate a pension fund for the employees there are approximately 7 000 000 people who are out of gainful employment in the towns and cities of this country at this time and we do not know how many millions of people there are on the farms today who can not pay their debts and who have no source of income there have been more business failures especially of small merchants in the last 12 months than ever known before in the same period of time in our history i for one contend that something must be done to bring about a change in our business affairs the capitalist the millionaire and the great corporations in our nation should realize that human nature is practically the same the world around we know that the communist party is in control of russia today because the masses under the government of the czar were hungry cold and desolate it was this condition that made it possible for the bolsheviks to set up their government may god forbid such a condition ever arising within our borders i have lived to see that period in my life when the greatest interest that i have is to make it possible for my people to educate their children to be able to pay their debts to become home owners and for the youth of our section to have as good opportunities to succeed as if they were born in new england or any other section of the union"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.9462423920631409, 0.9462423920631409, 0, "and mr crowthermpaint it in gold and

extremely definite that is the question as to whether or not we will tomply with the presidents request and authorize him to appoint a conmission for the purposes indicated in this resolution the president has full powe in dealing with international matters to appoint commissions without being authorized by congress but as was explained during the discussion of the resolution itself he is unable to incur any expenditure for the work of commissions of that sort so it becomes necessary for him if he is to employ the services of a commission to have money put at his disposal that is the reason he is asking congress to act i take it for granted the president is moving with great candor and great honesty in this matter it is his duty to recommend legislation to congress he recognizes there is a problem or a series of problems presented by haiti we must infer l believes that he is now without the information which enables him to reach conclusions satisfactory to himself elative to those problems and so he suggests that he be put in the way of securing additional information by making use of a commission so the only question we have here is as to whether we will respond to his request or whether we will decline i do not think there is any question involved as to the historical evolution of haiti a man might stand here and talk for hours about tlme history of haiti frrom the time columbus went to the island there is no question involved as to whether the administration of mr wilson was wise or unwise in negotiating and the senate wise or unwise in ratifying the treaty now in effect there is no question involved as to whether that treaty ought to be continued or discontinued or whether it ought to be modified and if so in what particular there is no question whatever as to whether under our supervision of the affairs of haiti injustice has been done or not or as to what advantages or disadvantages have accrued all of that as i say is irrelevant to the real issue with which we are confronted that is as to whether or not we will do what the president requests although i have been to haiti and read a good deal about haiti i would not venture now to offer any views to the house or any preconceptions as to what the commission ought to do or as to the findings which it ought to make i do not think that is called for at this time so far at least as i am concerned i would hope and expect that the president seeing that the haitian situation is a matter of very great importance which he has got to deal with sooner or later in a very specific way will form as strong a commission as it is possible for him to create and which will bring him data secured by an impartial unprejudiced patriotic and capable inquiry with reference to all the sources from which the information may be expected i am very sorry that the gentleman from new york mr fish has done what i would not venture to do by bringing in the race question and suggesting to the president what should be the composition of this commission if he is allowed to appoint one my friend from alabama has suggested that he intends to offer amendments one of his amendments would provide that the report of this commission if it be appointed shall be made as well to congress as to the president and i hope very much that the acting chairman of the committee on foreign affairs the gentleman from pennsylvania will have no hesitation in accepting that amendment he is to offer another amendment to the effect that not more than four men of the same political party shall be put on the commission we have provided that with respect to other commissions and to various tribunals and i do not think that the results have been extremely satisfactory it is not necessary to elaborate but i may be permitted this one remark if i were in the office of president and were placed under a provision of that character that is to say that four of seven men designated for a particular work should be republicans and three democrats or three republicans and four democrats i would perhaps be a little embarrassed since there are several varieties of democrats and several varieties of republicans i am
