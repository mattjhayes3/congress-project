yasser lrafat raised the palestine liberation crganization flag in the now liberated nicaragua in what was described as an emotional ceremony the marxist sandinistas announced the establishment of formal diplomatic relations with the plo the first such mission in central america one by one the sandinista leaders took turns in praising their good plo friends and colleagues in the international terrorist movement their enthusiasm in delivering rabidly antisemitic statements condemning israel and the jewish people overshadowed their teacher arafats words which were described as mild in comparison while confirming that the sandinistas had received training and arms from the plo daniel ortega a member of the junta and sandinista directorate revealed that palestinians had taken part in the fighting during the nicaraguan revolution furthermore he admitted that the blood of nicaraguans had been shed in the name of the palestinian cause it would appear that this confession reveals a serious violation of the conditions set forth by the congress in providing assistance to nicaragua under the terms of h r 6081 the special nicaraguan aid bill no assistance can be provided if it is shown that the sandinistas are aiding abetting or collaborating with interantional terrorists while not unexpected this open slap at israel and the united states unfortunately confirms my earlier

today the granting of mostfavorednation status to communist china negates all the rhetoric of the last few weeks regarding how america has awakened to the danger of communism obviously the point that is being made today is that communism is somehow good and wholesome in china and that pekings brand of marxistleninism is less aggressive or less dangerous than the brand used in the kremlin this is a mistake of epic proportions i share the deep and sincere concern of my colleagues over the events in afghanistan and the recognition that major steps must be taken to counter the armored thrusts of the soviet war machine however the last thing this congress should do is to embrace one communist menace to counter another the lesson that should have been learned from afghanistan is that communism is by its very nature aggressive totalitarian and militaristic whether in the unitedstatess r in cuba or in mainland china the doctrine of marxistleninism ultimately leads to expansionism via guns and tanks the spector of soviet might rolling over the people of afghanistan only proves that the soviets are more advanced in the tools of adventurism than other communist powers this advance being at least in part fueled by western technology transfers the american people are demanding firm action to counter the soviets after being lulled to sleep by the rhetoric of ddtente the nation is realizing that it has been deluded into aiding an aggressor this congress owes it to the nation to not embark on yet another flight to appeasement the only difference between the communist chinese and the soviets is that the soviets took kabul first if we do not stop and reflect before we vote on this measure we may find ourselves standing in this same chamber 10 or 15 years from now trying to fathom how we allowed ourselves to fuel the arming of china with western technology the chinese like other communists take an opportunistic stance toward world events they want their brand of communism to prevail and view the unitedstatess r as their chief rival it is in their own best interest to capitalize on the united states current need for allies and to open their doors to the west they need industrialization and western automation to compete with the soviets for this longrange need they will foresake any number of shortterm acts of aggression for them time is on their side and the continued inability of the west to understand their ultimate goal buys them even more time the bill we have before us today fits perfectly with the chinese scenario for countering the soviets and

seen that further efforts are underway to cover up what is really going on in this house a vote switching machine has been installed and just yesterday i heard one of my colleagues introduce a bill to stop considering policy in funding bills today we have the cornerstone of the neoisolationists before us this bill is being brought up with an audacious rule that allows for the sealing off of grassroots outrage to what is going on up here this centerpiece of contempt for the american system of government should never have seen the light of day yet the rules committee saw fit to allow this monstrosity to come to the floor i hope my colleagues will join me in voting down this rule before we further damage what little credibility this congress has left there is no rationale for approving this hybrid rule other than to circumvent the process we all supposedly support the reason we have standing committees is to consider legislation in detail and to filter out spurious measures before they waste the congress time the house administration committee wisely saw that the amendments allowed under this rule were a dangerous addition to the already crippling load of regulations on free expression in the american political system that committee defeated efforts to railroad the obeyrailsback bill however the committee was circumvented by some backroom maneuvers and now we have the prospect of obeyrailsback being brought up on the floor of the house why does the leadership of this house persist in pressing the issue of limiting grassroots activity in the political process i think part of the reason is that this congress has consistently delivered exactly the opposite of what this nations voters have demanded last year the election was marked by a revolt against higher taxes this congress has raised taxes last year people said they were fed up with big government this congress has voted massive increases in federal spending including the creation of a new bureaucratic monster in the department of education this nation expressed concern over the decline of american influence in the world the 96th congress has been a willing partner in helping mr carter dismantle unitedstates defenses and abandon unitedstates allies the american public has cried out for strong leadership this congress has offered nothing but empty slogans and cosmetic votes on several major issues on every major question from energy to inflation this congress has done more to aggravate the problem than to solve it the american voter is not as stupid as a number of people in this city would like to think the grassroots of america realize that the only way to stop inflation solve our energy crisis and get the government off their backs is throw the rascals out political

of people can be in electing truly representative officials this has startled the entrenched bureaucrats and incumbents in this city and scared the establishment to fight back instead of meeting the pac challenge by becoming more responsive to the needs of this nation the only tool being used is to destroy this new avenue of free expression this is a contemptible posture and should be unmasked

point in the struggle of blacks and other minorities for equality in the united states to insure that the rights and protections set forth in our constitution and laws are not diminished and are vigorously enforced these groups must participate fully in the political process a massive voter registration and education drive is the method to achieve that end the purpose of such an effort is to enable these constituencies to pierce the political rhetoric and to measure realistically an incumbents or challengers true commitment to equal rights the cardinal political rule is that one who fails to represent adequately his or her constituents needs runs the risk of not being reelected as members of the national legislature we are keenly aware of the voting records of our colleagues and of the enforcement efforts by the executive agencies on issues critical to minority communities furthermore we are aware that many of our colleagues in the house represent districts with substantial numbers of blacks and other minorities this is especially true in the south and in the major urban centers we urge constituent organizations to share the records of representatives with their members before the 1980 elections peter w rodino jr dean of the new jersey congressional delegation represents a large urban area with a substantial minority population this outstanding leader and statesman can proudly point to a distinguished career as a defender of human rights he has consistently demonstrated his personal commitment to human rights since first being elected to the unitedstates house of representatives in 1948 we would like to note some highlights of mr rodinos record in support of human rights and to commend him for his continuing efforts the distinguished gentleman from new jersey has remained steadfast in this commitment even when it was politically expedient to vote the other way prior to 1954 and the unanimous supreme court decision in brown against board of education mr rodino voted against the dehumanizing doctrine of separatebutequal at a point in this countrys history1949when it was socially morally and politically safe to support the status quo he voted to integrate spars the womens auxiliary of the coast guard when in 1952 representative rankin offered a bill to establish a jim crow veterans hospital peter w rodino voted no to such segregation since 1950 mr rodino has served on the house committee on the judiciary this great committee has shaped the civil rights acts of 1957 1960 1964 1968 and the voting rights act of 1965 this legislation has sought to fulfill the fundamental constitutional right of equal opportunity and protection of our laws these laws were enacted because of first the contradictions between this nations stated principles as set forth in the constitution and its practices and second the personal commitment and leadership of representative rodino and others to the principles of equal rights each succeeding civil rights act has sought to extend the scope of protected rights defining these rights with greater clarity and securing them for all through more effective enforcement techniques the civil rights act of 1957 created the unitedstates commission on civil rights an independent nonpartisan factfinding agency within the executive branch whose mandate is to report to the congress and the president on discriminatory practices and to recommend solutions the commission and its 51 voluntary state advisory committees has become our national conscience and has made us more sensitive to discrimination on the basis of race national origin color religion sex age and handicap status the 1957 act also established within the department of justice the civil rights division to assure that civil rights violations could be effectively challenged by our chief law enforcer the attorney general against the backdrop of freedom riders and nonviolent resistance the 1964 civil rights act prohibited discrimination in public accommodations that and other provisions of the act are as vital today as they were in 1964 title vi prohibits the use of federal financial assistance to discriminatory programs and activities title vii which established the equal employment opportunity commission prohibits employment discrimination title x established the community relations service within the department of justice to provide assistance to communities to resolve disputes or difficulties arising from discriminatory practices and conflicts over such issues as public school desegregation and charges of excessive use of force by the police the civil rights act of 1968 addresses the rights and protections of native americans title viii of that act prohibits discrimination in housing enforcement of its provisions is the responsibility of the department of housing and urban development mr rodino has played a critical role in guiding such legislation through the committee process and to final debate and action on the floor at each stage in the legislative process he has fought against amendments to gut or water down the provisions of civil rights legislation the right and the need for citizens to participate in the electoral process have long been advocated by the distinguished gentleman from new jersey as early as 1949 mr rodino voted for a bill to abolish the poll tax this tax as well as other devices were used to preclude blacks and hispanics from full participation in the political process fortunately the poll tax and other discriminatory practices were abolished by the voting rights act of 1965 perhaps the most important civil rights bill of this century its coverage has been extended in 1970 and again in in addition to a 7year extension the 1975 amendments broadened the acts coverage to extend the franchise to certain language minorities these amendments were added after it became clear in extensive hearings before the house judiciary committee that language minorities especially hispanics had been denied the right to full political participation since 1973 mr rodino has served as chairman of the house judiciary committee carrying out his responsibilities thoughtfully and effectively he has helped shape committee policy and he has appointed a competent committee staff to address the myriad issues encompassed by the committees jurisdiction during mr rodinos tenure as chairman the committee has continued to generate legislation with important civil rights implications and has conducted effective oversight hearings on civil rights enforcement in our governmental system of checks and balances oversight hearings enable the congress to review the executive branchs successes or failures in carrying out and enforcing our laws the judiciary committee in meeting its oversight function has reported to the congress on some of the following issues fair employment practices of american corporations doing business in south africa the civil rights implications of revenue sharing equal employment opportunities within the various bureaus of the department of justice including the fbi unitedstates marshals and drug enforcement agency and equal opportunities in housing during the 95th congress two important judiciary committee measures with civil rights implications were approved by the congressa proposed constitutional amendment granting full congressional voting representation to the district of columbia and the omnibus judgeship act as noted earlier chairman rodino has always fought to extend the franchise to all american citizens in most instances obstacles have been removed through statutory enactments such as the voting rights act for the 700 000 persons now residing in the district of columbia the obstacle is best removed by constitutional mandate as approved by congress the district of columbia amendment would give the district two senators and the number of representatives it would be entitled to if it were a state with the leadership of the judiciary committee chairman the proposed amendment was enacted by twothirds of the house as required by the constitution efforts to diminish the amendments purpose and intent were defeated both in committee and on the floor enactment in the house spurred senate action indeed hearings had not even been scheduled in the senate until final passage of the district of columbia amendment in the house as dean of the new jersey congressional delegation mr rodino has played a crucial role protecting the rights of new jersey citizens in legislation enacted at the federal level his senior status has also enabled him to work cooperatively with the leadership of his states legislature it is this cooperation which explains in part why new jersey was the first state to pass the district of columbia voting rights amendment the 95th congress also produced the omnibus judgeship act both the house and senate held hearings on legislation to increase the number of federal judges to handle the escalating caseload of the federal courts thanks to the strong leadership of mr rodino the house version provided for greater civil rights protections by urging the president to appoint more minorities and women this provision was accepted by the senate in addition mr rodino and other house conferees convinced the senate to adopt compromise language to modify a provision contained in the senate bill and supported by the then senate judiciary committee chairman james 0 eastland that provision would have split the 5th circuit of appeals alabama florida georgia louisiana and texas into a deep south alabama florida and georgia and south louisiana and texas circuits reports by civil rights groups such as the naacp legal defense fund predicted that such a split would have had a devastating impact on civil rights litigation in that circuit mr rodino recognized the danger and firmly opposed the repugnant language no discussion of chairman rodinos

members of this house nearly every piece of authorizing legislation that we pass goes through the committee on appropriations we do not allow the army to spend money without going through appropriations we do not allow school districts to spend it without the committee on appropriations having the final say that is part of the checks and balances of this house but now some of the very same people who oppose entitlements because they circumvent the appropriations committee want to make an end run around that committee in order to look like they are terribly concerned about the problem but they do not want to put their money where their mouths are this problem requires money to solve it costs a great deal of money to detect and to remove and to replace and repair the asbestos let us look closely at the committee bill because it is fiscally very restrained in this age of tight budgets in this age of concern over federal expenditures we have told these school districts that we will make a loan to them a loan which they must match 5050 if they can show that it is an imminent asbestos hazard they must repay 100 percent of that money to the federal government i think that is a reasonable approach i think it is very clear that if you want to take care of the problem you must go with the committee bill to do otherwise is to confuse local agencies you must understand there is no rhyme or reason how the socalled money under the goodling substitute could ever get to those schools or those school districts which are in need i have a potential in a number of schools which i represent which may have an asbestos problem and other members undoubtedly have the same problem they get no title i money they get very little vocational money the libraries are already being closed down now what does that have to do with their asbestos money other districts may get a great amount of title i but have no asbestos problem the goodling approach would just not direct the money to the problem as a matter of fact nothing would be available under the goodling substitute because no school district is going to cut down their already stark education programs by diverting funds to asbestos control and the congress ought not ask them to make that choice the committee spent months taking medical evidence holding evidentiary hearings with the agencies like epa hew and the national institute for environmental health sciences which are involved in this program and from others concerned with the health risks it is true that other programs have been started epa has started a voluntary program for which very few people volunteered now epa is contemplating a mandated inspection program most of the people who have written back on those proposed epa regulations have said that they could not do it because the money simply is not available to correct whatever hazards they discover i want to point out that there is no mandate in the program established in h r 3282 if the school district wants to ignore the problem we do not intervene the gentleman from pennsylvania"], [8.767843246459961e-05, 0.4999123215675354, 0, "today a broadcasting legend in iowa comes
