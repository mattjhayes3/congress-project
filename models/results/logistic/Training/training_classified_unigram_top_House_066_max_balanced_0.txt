banks of rivers to get any benefit from river improvement from the money taken out of the common treasury to improve the rivers is to forbid the interstate commerce commission to give these preferential rates and thereby prevent river transportation and then levy an additional tax upon the citizens who live off of these rivers in the form of higher rail rates the people who do not live on the banks of the rivers or where they can get the river transportation would be better off if the government refused absolutely to appropriate any money to improve any navigable waters because they

act to increase the revenue and for other purposes having had the same under consideration report it back to the house without amendment and recommend that the bill be passed this bill amends the present law in four important particulars in its technical details it follows substantially the recommendations of the tariff commission in bringing the phraseology of the law up to date so as to prevent evasions of its provisions through undervaluation or false designation of articles sought to be imported experience in the administration of the existing law has made it clear that it is not so worded as to completely give effect to the intent of congress and it is believed that these technical changes will fulfill that purpose in the second place it repeals that provision under which the specific duties shall be reduced at the rate of 20 per cent a year for five years it increases the rates of duty from 15 per cent ad valorem and 2 cents a pound on the intermediates to 40 per cent ad valorem and 6 cents a pound and upon the finished product from 30 per cent ad valorem and 5 cents a pound to 45 per cent ad valorem and 7 cents a pound expert chemical opinion was unanimous that the rates of duty on the intermediates should be substantially the same as those upon the finished product in the fourth place the bill provides that for two years li foreign dyes can be imported except under a license granted by a board created in the bill the bill subdivides as does the present law the materials used in the lye industry into three classes the crudes the intermediates and the finished product the process of producing the crudes is comparatively simple they being actually present in coal tar and only an isolation aiiy country which like this has an abundant supply of cheap coal and a great steel industry requiring much coke has an unlimited supply of the raw material and the rules therefore require no protection but with regard to the intermediates the situation is entirely different their production requires the most elaborate chemical processes which can be carried out without the waste of a large proportion of the raw materials used only by men of the most profound chemical knowledge and long experience and such men are not yet available in suflicient luniber3 in this country under these circumstances therefore it is apparent that this industry requires for the present at least a very high degree of protection all this is still more true of the finished product which may take one of six different forms by firther chemical processes in some cases very simple these iutermiediates may be converted into dyes perfumes pharmaceuticals tanning materials high explosives like t n t and picric acid or into poison gas as a class these finished products requiring as they do further labor and skill of a class plentiful in gerinany but still very scarce in this country need a greater though not much greater measure of protection than do the socalled intermediates the remarkable interdependence of the dye and the explosive industry is well illustrated by the fact that once having obtained by a long series of elaborate chemical operations a certain intermediate that intermiediate may be converted by one very simple chemical change into sulphur black one of the most widely used dyes or into picric acid one of the most important of high explosives the technical knowledge and skill the materials and the apparatus necessary to make high explosives as well as poison gases and their antidotes are precisely what are to be found in any wellequipped dye works and nowhere else a nation therefore which hats a thoroughly complete dye industry capable of supplying its lye needs is always ready for a defensive or offensive war so far as the production of explosives and chemical gases are concerned if as seems likely we are entering upon a period of international disarmament the possession of such an industry becomes of infinite importance in a world disarmed a nation possessing such a potential arsenal would lie in a position to overwhelm any nation which had none and would be practically immune from attack an important if not the most important phase of this industry is its bearing upon the advancement of medical and industrial chemistry it is the one industry which deals on a colossal scale with organic chemistry and it is upon organic chemistry that the progress of modern medicine rests salvarsan for instance was developed in a dyeworks laboratory and is the first known certain cure forone of the most terrible scourges of humanity it is confidently predicted that upon the further development of organic chemistry will rest the discovery of other cures for such devastating diseases as tuberculosis and even cancer this development rests upon the further development in this country of skilled research chemists and it is only in a dye laboratory that large numbers of such chenisets can find a livelihood accordingly a welldeveloped dye industry in this country will furnish a tremendous reservoir of technically trained men and of scientific knowledge upon which the most important industries of the country may draw in time of peace and the nation itself in time of war or of threatened war the economic importance of the industrial side of this question is illustrated by the fact that industries in this country producing nearly 3 000 000 000 worth of goods each year are absolutely dependent upon coaltar dyes and industries producing as much more annually are indirectly dependent upon coaltar dyes and kindred materials for muany years before the war we had practically no dye industry in this country such dye works as we had were merely assembling plants for german materials and supplied only about onetenth of the amerloan imfwket accordingly all the huge industries requiring dyestuffs were absolutely at the mercy of germany and could have been dealt a crushing blow by germany at any time the german trust saw fit that germany realized this is illustrated by a dispatch sent on march 13 1915 1by count vo bernstorff to his own government as follows serial no 432 of march 13 1915 it is reported to me by hossenfolder telegram no 4 that the stock of dyes in this country is so small that by a german cmbargo about 4 000 000 american workmen might be thrown out of employment as a matter of fact germany early in 1915 by the withdrawal of her supplies of dyes attempted to force this government into hostile action against great britain and if she had had the power to send her own textiles into this country she would have inflicted a blow upon our textile industry from which probably it would have never recovered the war forced upon america the building up of the dye industry for a situation arose under which many industries came to a practical standstill and even the government itself was in danger of having to cease to function in many important branches for instance the difficulty of securing printers ink which was entirely dependent upon dyes brought about a situation under which the closing of the government printing office seemed imminent and the bureau of engraving and printing was in most serious embarassment the dyes necessary for even cheap and necessary clothing jumped in price in some cases 5 000 per cent and in other cases were not prociral le at all fortinately we had in this country an unlimited supply of the raw materials and patriotic americans in all branches of industry set to work to remedy the situation by making their own dyes vast amounts of capital were risked without any assurance that it would not in the end be a total loss as no one could guess how long the war would last and as a result today we have in this country a dye industry which although it is a mere baby is able tosupply the countrys needs in most essentials and will undoubtedly be able to supply the missing colors if given a reasonable time to get surely on its feet under such conditions it would seem impossible that any loyal american would not realize the absolute necessity of saving and fostering such an industry as this only three methods of legislative assistance have been suggesteda tariffa tariff supplemented by an antidumping provision and a tariff supplemented by a licensing systen your committee believes that only the last of these methods would be effective and has accordingly recommended its adoption tlhe plan as provided in this bill is to form a licensing commission its members to he designated by associations engaged in and repre entalie of both the producing and consuming industries this commission will have power to grant licenses for the importation of foreign dyes under certain conditions it is positively commanded to grant licenses to any applicant to import any foreign dye which is not obtainable in this country from domestic sources and any dye which while made in this country is not obtainable at a reasonable price of good quality and within a reasonable time thus absolute assurance is given any american consumer of dyes that he can at any time obtain the foreign product where the american industry is unable to supply on favorable terms conversely it will absolutely exclude transportation of dyes which are made in this country of satisfactory quality and at fair prices and insure the development and extension of the manufacture of those dyes furthermore the applications for the importation of such dyes as are not made here will promptly stimulate our manufacturers to make the same dyes by showing that a strong demand exists for them and will thus guide the industry into the development which is really required during the life of this system a substantial number of dyes not made in this country will no doubt be imported and as they will be subject to the rates of duty provided in this bill will produce a very substantial revenue for the government your committee does not suggest a license system as a permanent governmental policy but feels that nothing else can meet the present emergency accordingly your committee recommends the license plan together with an increased tariff because as soon as the peace treaty is ratified the new american dye industry will be exposed to comptition from an adversary so powerful and so desperate that no practical rate of duty can offer any real defense the whole huge german dye industry capable at the time of supplying the entire demand of the world was combined in 1916 into a single immense trust organized on purpose to fight its way back to the former german world monopoly the combination is even now enormously prosperous starting with assets of nearly half a billion dollars invested in the empires most remunerative industry plants of the trust have been busy throughout the war making all germanys poison gases many of her munitions and at the same time enough dyes to accumulate a reserve capable of flooding the market of this or any other country recent observers report that the working forces have been held together complete and intact throughout the war and since its cessation and that one at least of the component companies has made large additions to plants since the armistice the resources of the trust are therefore colossal its plants are so huge and organized for such vast production that unless it can regain most of its former world market half its equipment must lie idle and the other half run at low efficiency it must then recover its world market or cease to exist as a profitable business even before the war when its supremacy was uncontested the german industrys competition was utterly unscrupulous it practiced ruthlessly every form of corrupt and unfair competition known to commerce what can be more certain then than that in the almost immediate future when instead of a comfortable and safe supremacy it faces possible destruction it will attack all competitors with reckless disregard of all considerations of business decency this attack unless congress acts very speedily will be concentrated upon us great britain france and japan have protected their own governmentaided dye industries by license laws essentially similar to the one herein recommended the market of the united states is therefore except that of china germanys last opening to penetrate it and destroy our domestic producers the trust will surely be glad to spend millions of its surplus not many millions would be needed a very few adroitly used in practically giving away selected dyes would kill the business of even the strongest of our companies and leave us once more at the trusts nercy such an onslaught would be dangerous even if german costs of production were as high as ours but they are not even if the prices of labor and material are equal an old dye industry can always undersell a new one in making textiles or typewriters or paper or almost any other article that could be mentioned the maker gets practically all of his raw material back in finished product in making dyes however some is lost in each of the many steps in the manufacture how great each of these successive losses is depends on the experience of the manufacturer the total of his successive losses when the work is done by an inexperienced man is enormous we new at the job lose half our raw material as the work goes on the germans who have been at it for 40 years lose but a trifling proportion their costs are thus far below ours and are likely to remain so though in a decreasing degree for a long time an attempt to meet under such conditions such an assault from such an adversary would require unheardof tariff rates and it is highly probable that by undervaluation rebates and concessions coupled with the old german method of fullline forcing and bribery the german trust could nullify their effect no antidumping law yet suggested seems at all likely to meet the conditions in this particular industry on account of its immense complexity and the ease with which imports can be camouflaged by the skilled and unscrupulous german chemist it is apparent then that any tariff bill which could possibly become law might and indeed probably would fail to insure the development of this industry which is so essential to our national defense and wellbeing it is equally clear that the proposed license plan faithfully administered will certainly frnish the necessary protection and that too without sacrificing revenue your committee believes that the industry is too important to be risked and therefore recommends the adoption of this certain though unusual means of defense your committee makes this recommendation also as the only suitable answer to the similar british french and japanese license laws those laws keep the competition of our dyes out of great britain france and japan your committee does not believe that we should aid in building up their new subsidized industries by giving them at the expense of our producers unlimited access to our market when by this simple expedient we can at the same time make sure of obtaining every foreign product we need and of building up our own vitally important industry we feel that congress ought not to hesitate or rest content with any doubtful remedy"], [0.9248096346855164, 0.9248096346855164, 0, "alr chairman i detantd a division the
