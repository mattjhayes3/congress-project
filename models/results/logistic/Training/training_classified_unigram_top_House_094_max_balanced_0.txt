resolution it is truly unconscionable that the congress would attempt to target 50 million for the costs of national health insurance a program which has not even been approved by the congress indeed the budgetary impact of a full national health insurance system has not been analyzed or seriously considered by the budget committee it has been noted that the costs of a full nationalized health insurance program would exceed 100 billion each year perhaps reaching the level of 125 billion or 150 billion per year i concur completely with the remarks of the eight members of the budget committee who dissented from the budget committee report arguing this budget resolution is not the proper place to attempt to make a major farreaching decision such as whether national health insurance should be enacted the budget resolution is definitely not the place for consideration of legislation which would significantly alter the medical profession in this country and seriously threaten the status of american health one need only look at the absolute collapse of the british health service to note the very serious effect that nationalized health has had on the british medical profession not to mention the negative effect it has had on the british economy the examples of sweden and canada further magnify the potential difficulties our nation would face if it were to adopt a system of nationalized health care the tremendous cost of national health insurance is one serious matter which requires further analysis certainly the very serious objections which have been raised about confidentiality the increased demand for medical services under nationalized health systems and the observed deterioration in the quality of medical care in those countries which have nationalized health care are other problems which demand additional study before this nation decides to adopt a system of national health insurance let us not permit a program as serious and far reaching as

for the purpose of helping to combat violent crime in those areas which have the highest incidence of such crome burglarly rape murder and so on it seems to me that the effort of the federal government today is very very puny as a matter of fact we put in about 5 percent or less of the total funds to fight crime in america it certainly is a very minor contribution which the federal government is making not that we want to take over the problem of crime in america but we should be making larger contributions to enable the local communities to undertake a better effort against crime now the mitre corp report while it does show that the impact area program has not had the effect of reducing crime in the areas studied there are some areas where certain crimes did show a reduction the evaluation report is very valuable in establishing what kinds of programs seem to be the best in the large cities where we have a high incidence of crime this modest amendment is an initiative which has been recommended by the attorneys general to try to get at this problem of street crime and violent crime in our cities and other areas where crime is increasing it seems to me we should support this this is in a sense a separate program it has been separately funded it is independent of the discretionary and the block grant programs it is an additional effort it is a new
