years served his state and his nation in the united states senate and served them well i refer to the honorable james couzens now deceased jim couzens was a fine type of honest courageous highminded legislator but it is not of that phase of his life and activities i desire to speak today senator couzens was an outstanding financial genius who helped to build one of the most magnificent and important industries in this nation but it is not of that phase of his life and character that i desire to speak today history will write as an epitaph to senator james couzens this fact he was the friend and benefactor of poor crippled children a more noble and beautiful tribute could not be paid to the memory of any man out of his store of wealth senator couzens in april 1929 created a trust fund of 10 000 000 that trust fund was to be expended over a period of 25 years in november 1934 senator couzens supplemented his 10 000 000 gift to cripl~led children by another sum of 2 100 000 making the total of his contribution 12 100 000 not only did senator couzens donate this vast sum of money to the purpose of promoting the health welfare happiness and development of the children of michigan and of those elsewhere in the world but the senator himself acted as chairman of the board which administered the funds he therefore gave not only of his money but of his time strength and his genius in order that his money might achieve the greatest good for the greatest number of poor crippled children whom he so desired to help another distinguished member of the congress from my state the honorable albert j engel has in a beautiful tribute delivered on this floor to the memory of senator couzens placed in the record many facts figures and details concerning senator couzens philanthropy i therefore will not consume the time of this house to repeat those facts figures and details i think senator couzens himself gave the finest and most succinct statement of the purpose which motivated him when he wrote in part as follows a nation which survives in this struggling world must be made up of citizens strong in body seasoned in spirit and supple in mind capacity to meet competition strongly with intelligence and zest determines the destinies of peoples as well as of individuals if this is true then it is equally true that the welfare of the republic 30 years hence depends upon how well we adults of the present foster upbuild and train the myriads of children who throng our homes these frail little folks who romp and weep and laugh about our knees today will be the masters of america in that time to come the good parent consecrates himself to this task every father and every mother worthy of the name has a tender and undying love for his children each of them works valiantly to open for his children better opportunities than he possessed himselfopportunities for good health for bettertrained minds and for welladjusted personalities but the job is bigger than the resources of the average parent the obligation leaps beyond the confines of the home and offers a constant challenge to government and to wealth to join hands with parents in enlarging opportunities for childhood to my mind the necessity of meeting this challenge fairly and squarely is simple and clear the importance of child rearing overshadows all the more spectacular problems that receive attention in those tumultuous times the childrens fund of michigan was founded 7 years ago with exactly this purpose to open wider the gates of opportunity to michigans children it has been said and i think truly that more than a million children have already been helped by the philanthropy of senator couzens and no one can estimate the vast amount of human happiness human usefulness good citizenship and good service which will be achieved by this magnificent philanthropy established by james couzens i think it is not too much to say that in all probability some of our finest executives in state and perhaps in national government may come from the ranks of those who have been rescued from a life of misery suffering and futility by the operation of the money donated to this great humanitarian cause by the late distinguished michigan senator i think it is not too much to say that in all probability there may come from the ranks of these children who are being and who will be rescued from a life of suffering and frustration some of the most able and noted scientists teachers writers and medical practitioners perhaps that the world has ever known as i have said there is no way in which we can foresee or estimate what vast contributions to the good of humanity in the world will flow from the operation of this 12 000 000 humanitarian trust fund in a world torn by strife growing cynical in an era of gross materialism worn by the fear and adversities of war it is a beautiful thing to contemplate that this man who has passed on into the great unknown has left behind him an active agency which for years will continue to bring to countless children salvation from pain and suffering deformity and futility children who otherwise would be a burden to civilization instead of an asset it is a beautiful thing to contemplate the marvelous legacy which jim couzens left to his state and to his nation and to the world not a legacy of mere dollars but a legacy of rescued released and healthy children to grow up into useful citizens to live lives filled with human service and to have in their conscience the benediction of a memorylegendary perhaps for many of themof a man who so loved his fellow men that he gave generously of himself and his worldy possessions in order that they might have life and happiness more abundantly iin closing let me again

the various representatives from the old cotton belt have risen each in his turn to defend the philosophy of this bill on the virtuous grounds of equality fairness and justice i have read this bill from cover to cover thumbed its pages hour upon hour ever since it was handed to the public printer for dissemination amongst the members of this congress and to this day i have failed to find a single item a single subject dealt with in the bill which will operate with equality anywhere in the united states fairly in any of the cottonraising areas or justly in any section of our common country a more unfair a more unjust a more completely indefensible measure has never been proposed in respect of cotton the very selection of acres as the basis of reduction is eloquent proof of the purposed inequalities contained in this act when you reduce an acre in california you compel the withdrawal from production of 580 pounds when you reduce an acre in texas you merely require the withdrawal from production in that state of only 191 pounds where is the justice where is the equality where is the fairness when you say to california as a matter of law you shall reduce 580 pounds and texas shall reduce but 191 pounds this whole bill was conceived drafted and offered to this congress for consideration for the sole and only purpose of destroying cotton cultivation in the three great western states to which i have already referred that is the only reason the bill is offered when the reduction formula was released for publication and i first read it i naturally enough wanted to know just what its operation in the various states was going to be so i called the department of agriculture and asked them to tell me what it meant and what its effect would be insofar as the cultivation of cotton in my own state and the other states with which we are in association in the cultivation of cotton was concerned they said we have figured it all out for you we know how it is going to work then they sent me a lot of charts which i hold in my hand i found to my astonishment they had not only figured upon the 5year average the figures which the bill adopts but the chart lxxx65 presents the figures in respect to the 1937 acreage plus the diverted acres the figures for 2 years for 3 years and for 5 years i found out that the committee had selected as the formula to be set forth in this bill the estimates of the department of agriculture which would hurt california the most they did not take the 1937 acres plus diverted or undiverted acres they did not take the 2year average they did not take the 3year average they did not take the 4year average they took the 5year average because the formula based on a 5 years history would discriminate against california most i wonder if they realized they were throwing 100 000 californians on the dole it takes from those people the right to make a living the ability to provide for their families it takes from them the right to earn 2 83 a day picking cotton in order to give the employment to the states of the old south where the wage scale affords to cotton pickers an opportunity to earn only 1 08 a day and
