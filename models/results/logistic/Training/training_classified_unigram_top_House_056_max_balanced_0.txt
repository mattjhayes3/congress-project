a representative government must offer that safeguard to the personalities of those who voice its power and authority and to its own position amongst the nations of the world in what i shall have to say my remarks shall be addressed not to the president but to his policy which is the policy of his party than which he is neither better nor worse perhaps no president has ever more thoroughly represented or impersonated his party wheresoever it goes he goes whatsoever it thinks he thinks when in doubt as to what it thinks he goes west there is never a shadow of variance between his sentiments and those of the national chairman of his party they live and move and have their being together when he speaks his party speaks except were subsequent developments disclose that he spoke too soon in which event he follows in the wake of his party as in the measure now under discussion he will never veto the action of his party his party will never do more than gently restrain him from falling into the pit that is the political status of the government what the president and his leaders will to be done will be done the minority in congress is powerless except to register their protest and appeal to the countrythe people who are the source of government we are here met with the bold assertion of the administration and of the majority that criticism of their course while war is on is treasonable as lending aid and comfort to the enemy no greater advance toward imperialism and monarchical government will ever be made than will follow from the concession of that postulate the king can do no wrong sounds strangely and harshly to american ears the people are the rulers and they are entitled to have the full light of truth thrown upon the administration of public affairs it is one thing to support the army wherever sent by the president as its commander in chief it is another thing to condemn the policy of the president who sends it the sublime duty of the soldier is to obey orders the country honors and cherishes him for his valor and devotion to duty the minority has cheerfully voted for every dollar of appropriation asked for his maintenance though protesting against the policy and the administration which made it necessary we shall continue to protest yes more we say to the world that never was there a more useless sacrifice of life than of the 2 000 brave boys who sleep in philippine soil since the conclusion of the spanish war and of the 20 000 filipinos who have died fighting for their liberty against our flag of freedom until this war is ended it is perhaps better that we do not pass judgment upon the righteousness of the cause of those against whom our soldiers are now contending in the field it is however not only proper but necessary that the attention and sentiment of the country be aroused to an appreciation of the extent to which we have departed from our safe mooring in the constitution and of the untried sea of imperialism to which we are heading of what this administration has done is doing and will do it has brought us to the parting of the ways and is ready and anxious to take the decisive step which will place this republic and its destiny alongside of great britain his excellency the president of the united states and emperor of the philippines and sulu hand in hand with her majesty the queen of great britain and empress of india when at our doors the crycame to us from starving cuba to come to the rescue the minority fruitlessly sought to obtain for her recognition wherewith she might liberate herself when 266 of our sailor boys asleep under the flag in habana harbor were foully murdered by treacherous spain nothing but war could mote the full measure of a peoples wrath and of infinite justice never was war more justifiable or necessary it was for humanity for liberty and for justice no mercenary or commercial motive controlled us we pledged the world when we went to war that it was for liberation not for conquest the war ended august 12 1898 the treaty of paris was signed december 10 1898 and ratified by the united states senate february 6 1899 its results were but beginning spain the great colonizer of history was driven from the american continent cuba was free subject to our temporary military control and protection puerto rico became ours with the glad consent of its people and the philippines what of them if the policy announced by the president is put into execution generations yet unborn must tell the story of what the philippines did for us they did not enter into the cause of the war they were as much without and beyond the horizon of our national life as is now madagascar new zealand or cape colony manila bay offered no greater attraction to our cupidity than did delagoa bay the wealth of the islands was no more alluring to us than were the countless millions in the mountains and valleys of the transvaal we were at peace and in amity with their people the empire virus had not yet entered our veins naboths vineyard was not yet within our vision the beauty of the wife of uriah the hittite had not dazzled our senses admiral dewey sailed into manila harbor for the purpose of destroying the spanish fleet that accomplished he remained there awaiting orders watching events till the spanish forces some 12 000 in number should be forced to surrender the city of manila their only possession on the island never in all that period did he assume an unfriendly attitude toward the filipinos on the contrary he remarked to clay macaulay rather than make war of conquest of these people i would up anchor and sail out of the harbor in his letter to senator lodge he states that he availed himself of the assistance of aguinaldo as an ally the records of the department of state conclusively show that dewey and the administration appreciated the importance of the filipino generals aid and that~they sought and obtained it on april 24 1898 secretary long telegraphed dewey at hongkong war has commenced between the united states and spain proceed at once to the philippine islands commence operations at once particularly against the spanish fleet you must capture vessels or destroy them use utmost endeavors on the same day united states consul pratt at singapore had a conference with aguinaldo the result of which he telegraphed that day to dewey aguinaldo insurgent leader here will come to hongkong to arrange with commodore for general cooperation of insurgents against manila if desired telegraph dewey immediately replied tell aguinaldo come soon as possible he went two days later taking 17 chiefs with him they were carried in a united states ship and landed at cavite where dewey furnished him with guns ammunition and stores to be used against the spanish aguinaldo issued his proclamation to the filipinos in these words compatriots divine providence is about to place independence within our reach the americans not from mercenary motives but for the sake of humanity and the lamentations of so many persecuted people have considered it opportune to extend their protecting mantle to our beloved country rather blow your brains out than fire a shot or treat as enemies those who are your liberators where you see the american flag flying assemble in numbers they are our redeemers on july 4 1898 the american commander general anderson wrote him i desire to have the most amicable relations with you and to have you and your people cooperate with us in military operations against the spanish forces two days later he wxote general i would like to have your excellencys advice and cooperation as you are best acquainted with the resources of this country he stated to consul pratt that his expectations for his people in consideration of their cooperation were that the united states would assume protection of the philippines for at least long enough to allow the inhabitants to establish a government of their own in the organization of which he would desire american advice and assistance and he declared his ability to establish a proper and responsible government on liberal principles and would be willing to accept the same terms for the country as the united states intended giving to cuba his people enthusiastically responded they rallied 30 000 strong they cleared the interior of the island of luzon of spaniards by capturing 7 000 of them and driving the remainder into manila where they surrounded them with an intrenched line 14 miles long extending from shore to shore leaving no avenue of escape and nothing but surrenderbefore them theywere herded ready to be delivered to general merritt as they were on 14th after a sham show of resistance the protocol with spain had been signed two days previously but merritt had not heard of it but for aguinaldos assistance possession of manila would not have been obtained prior to the arrival of information of the protocol and no plea of actual possession could have been presented by our commissioners at paris beyond question our war ships and soldiers would have eventually overcome the spaniards and forced surrender but the situation would have been different timely native assistance was of such value and importance to dewey and anderson as to be sought and welcomed by them our revolutionary forces would have accomplished the surrender of cornwallis even if the aid of rochambeaus fleet had not forced his surrender at yorktown but our obligations to france were not thereby diminished the country should know the truth as to the manner in which those services were requited by our government how the hopes of those 30 000 filipino soldiers and of the people for whom they fought were cruelly dashed to the earth how the party of greed and plunder turned the rejoicings of those simple earnest people who were then and always would have been our friends into the bitterness and desperation of a people maddened by what they regard as treachery and designed de struction of their liberties the world has seldom seen a greater tragedy than the rude blasting of those cherished yearnings for liberty the realization of which seemed already in their grasp and by the order of the president of a republic whose inspiration has always been and ever should be the cry for liberty the world will yet know that it was not the voice of the nation but of the party whose only idea of liberty is of that which adorns the almighty dollar the party of special privileges of monopoly of trusts of currency jugglers of exactions from the masses for the benefit of the favored few which will never hesitate to send the flag where spoils invite manila had scarcely surrendered with its 12 000 soldiers when general otis ordered aguinaldo and his men out of the city and away from its defenses under threat of forcible action if he did not comply by the 15th of september 1898 the order was obeyed under protest it was even then the purpose of the president to appropriate the entire island in august he had sent a special cablegram to admiral dewey inquiring which was the most valuable of the philippines and the most desirable to retain the answer was luzon our commissioners to paris were thereupon instructed by him to take luzon on december 81 1898 he sent to general otis this proclamation with the signature of the treaty of peace between the united states and spain by their respective plenipotentiaries at paris on the 10th instant and as a result of the victories of the american arms the future control disposition and government of the philippine islands are ceded to the united states in fulfillment of the rights of sovereignty thus acquired and the responsible obligations of government thus assumed the actual occupation and administration of the entire group of the philippine islands becomes immediately necessary and the military government heretofore maintained by the united states in the city harbor and bay of manila is to be extended with all possible dispatch to the whole of the ceded territory that was a declaration to the 30 000 philippine soldiers then around manila that their territory had been taken by the united states three days later he ordered general miller to bombard and take iloilo 400 miles south of manila that was immediately followed by his general order to otis that those who submitted to the authority of the united states would have protection and that those who should not would be forced to do so the two armies remained in and around manila the president had engendered feeling betwixt them the allies were by him estranged the battle of manila lasting from 8 p m of february 4 to 5 m of the 5th was a natural result of the conditions thus created y the presidents orders a nebraska soldier killed a lieutenant of a filipino patrol who did not understand or obey the command to halt and the war began it is not the spanish war which congress declared april 21 1898 that war ended six months before it is a war which congress did not declare it is the presidents warbegun even before the ratification of the treaty under which he claims title for let it not be forgotten that both he and secretary day assert and claim that our title to the philippines is not by conquest but by purchase from spain the following day aguinaldo sent an officer deploring the unfortunate incident asking for a truce and proposing to fix a neutral zone between the armies till the difficulty could be arranged the reply of otis was fighting having once begun it must go on to the grim end and upon the heels of that fateful reply has followed the sacrifice of the lives of more than 2 000 brave american soldiers it is a monumental refutation of the assertion by the administration that the war was unavoidable it has never been so from the day of its inauguration it is not so now one declaration from the president or from congress that local selfgovernment shall be accorded them under american protection will terminate it that is all they have ever asked the president has admitted that aguinaldo says you can have peace if you give us independence but otis was speaking ex cathedra when he sent back the bloody answer it must go on to the grim end the policy of the president is at one with that of joseph chamberlain in his unholy invasion of the dutch republic no peace till extermination or abject submission two years ago those islands and their inhabitants were scarcely known to us at no point did they touch the sphere of our existence for centuries they have sought the enjoyment of life and pursuit of happiness and liberty in their own way unvexed of western methods and systems for more than three hundred years they have waged war with spain for those rights which by our declarafion of independence are inherent in all men and have governed themselves to the worlds satisfaction their last war with spain terminated only as recently as 1896 on honorable and advantageous terms commander john d ford says the idea that the filipino is an uncivilized being is a mistaken one they have the intellect and the stamina to govern themselves and have done it for three hundred years although under the rule of spain admiral dewey stated to our peace commissioners in a telegram sent to the department on june 23 1m8 i expressed the opinion that these people are far superior in their intelligence and more capable of selfgovernment than the natives of cuba and i am familiar with both races further intercourse with them has confirmed me in this opinion general merritt says there are a number of filipinos whom i have met among them general aguinaldo and a few of his leaders whom i believe thoroughly trustworthy and fully capable of selfgovernment aguinaldo honest sincere and poor not well educated but a natural leader of men with considerable shrewdness and ability highly respected by all at the time our army set foot upon philippine soil the filipinos had an organized government with a president a parliament and a judiciary acting with intelligence decorum and efficiency and a military arm of 30 000 men which army as i have already stated swept the spanish army of luzon into manila except the portion they had captured now then what right had we to make war upon that people or that being an existing status of our country in which our government has placed us and into which it would now be useless even if advisable to inquire i will put it why shall we continue to make war upon them the position of the president is that they are in rebellion or insurrection against the government of the united states and that it is his duty as the chief executive to suppress it with the army and navy as they have never acknowledged allegiance to us he bases his contention upon the purchase by us of the islands from spain by the treaty of paris claiming that the people went with the territory rebellion or insurrection presupposes the existence of a personal relation as that of citizen or subject it does not and can not convey the idea of a mere inhabitant or occupant he says the philippines are ours by purchase under the treaty of paris that treaty did not undertake to sell the inhabitants section 10 is the civil rights and political status of the native inhabitants of the territories hereby ceded to the united states shall be determined by the congress congress has not been permitted to vote upon the subject the only approach to such action was the mcenery resolution which passed the senate february 14 1899 by the vote which had ratified the treaty the week before i shall read it resolved that by the ratification of the treaty of peace with spain it is not intended to incorporate the inhabitants of the philippine islands into citizenship of the united states nor is it intended to permanently annex said islands as an integral part of the united states by this resolution they attempted to nullify or avert the consequences of their conduct in ratifying the treaty without incorporating in it an amendment which would have fixed the status of those inhabitants so far as it lay in the power of the high contracting parties to do so it was the difference between before taking and after taking when about to enter upon war with spain in order to disarm the suspicions of europe we declared the united states disclaims any disposition or intention to exercise sovereignty jurisdiction or control over said island except for the pacification thereof and asserts its determination when that is accomplished to leave the government and control of the island to its people a most righteous resolution which has been a thorn in the flesh and a vexation of spirit to the republican party ever since the war because its hands are tied and prevented from subjecting the people of that island as they now purpose for the filipinos let us see how the president has kept the faith with the mcenery resolution which committed his party so far as it was possible to do so i shall read a few short extracts from his speeches delivered during his flying western tour last october the army and navy have brought us new territory there is no government in the philippines but ours we have been adding some territory to the united states in the providence of god who works in mysterious ways this great archipelago was put into our lap that they will be retained under the benign sovereignty of the united states i do not permit myself to doubt he is a stranger to the noble sentiment of daniel webster thatno matter how easy may be the yoke of a foreign power no matter how lightly it sits upon the shoulders if it is not imposed by the voice of his own nation and of his own country he will not he can not and he means not to be happy under its burden he was also forgetful of his own better self when ten years ago he uttered these words human rights and constitutional privileges must not be forgotten in the race for wealth and commercial supremacy the government of the people must be by the people and not by a few of the people it must rest upon the free consent of the governed and of all the governed power it must be remembered which is secured by oppression or usurpation or by any form of inijustice is soon dethroned we have no right in law or moralsto usurp that which belongs to another whether it is property or power from him during this war came too this sentiment i speak not of forcible annexation for that under our code of morals would be criminal aggression it is now clear to every one from his own statements that he has no other purpose than forcible annexation under the specious plea of purchase from spain what had spain to sell as against the filipinos nothing on earth except that which the filipinos at our request aided us in taking from spain to assert that by that title we can oust them from the possession they had which was practically the whole island is to defy every principle of law equity and common honesty and to invite the contempt of the world we certainly did acquire rights in the philippines from the destruction of the spanish power there and the release of the inhabitants from spains claim of dominion over them but for that war the status quo ante would doubtless now exist in those islands in the forum of the conscience of nations we undoubtedly acquired by our arms the right to enjoyment of a fair and just proportion of the results of the struggle yes more by our superior might and services we acquired the right to judge of the extent of our just demands but never at any moment or in any manner did we win by arms or obtain by purchase the right or power of disposition of the filipinos themselves without their consent or the right to declare them in rebellion or insurrection against a government to which they have never claimed or acknowledged allegiance they are entitled to their independence their rights of manhood they declare that is all they ask the president refuses to concede those rights and so the war goes on for what purpose mr chairman for the unmistakable purpose of reducing the archipelago and making of it a colony of the united states the spokesmen of the president in congress have not concealed it that brings us face to face with as serious a governmental crisis as ever confronted this nation have we under the constitution the power to establish and maintain colonies does the constitution clothe the government with imperialistic attributes and dominion if it does then for more than one hundred years our people have been in ignorance of the fact if so then the antagonistic policies of imperialism and of the monroe doctrine find abiding places in opur government according to thomas jeffersonour first and fundamental maxim should be never to entangle ourselves in the broils of europe our second never to suffer europe to intermeddle with cisatlantic affairs a sentiment which later on took definite shape and authority as the monroe doctrine imperialism reaches out from this continent lays hold of eu rope asia africa or oceania and establishes there the flag of the union the insignia of our constitution our laws and our government hitherto we have stood firmly to that position of jefferson and monroe central and south america are today secure under its unseen but potent protection within the past few years venezuela was by it shielded and delivered from the worlds great landgrabber it has been the faith of our fathers whose hope for their countrys future was in the faithful adherence to its principles washington wrote why forego the advantage of so peculiar a situation why quit our own to stand upon foreign grounds why entangle our peace and prosperity in the toils of european ambition rivalship interest humor or caprice the great calhoun spoke in these words that it would be contrary to the genius and character of our government and subversive of our free popular institutions to hold mexico as a subject province is a proposition too clear for argument before a body so enlightened as the enate you know the american constitution too wellyou have looked into history and are too well acquainted with the fatal effects which large provincial possessions have ever had on the institutions of free statesto need any proof to satisfy you how hostile it would be to the institutions of this country to hold mexico as a subject province there is not an example on record of any free state holding a province of the same extent and population without disastrous consequences the nations conquered and held as a province have in time retaliated by destroying the liberty of their conquerors through the corrupting effect of extended patronage and irresponsible power such certainly would be our case the conquest of mexico would add so vastly to the patronage of this government that it would absorb the whole powers of the state the union would become an imperial power and the states reduced to mere subordinate corporations but the evil would not end there the process would go on and the power transferred from the states to the union would be transferred from the legislative department to the executive all the immense patronage which holding it as a province would createthe maintenance of a large army to hold it in subjection and the appointment of a multitude of civil officers necessary to govern itwould be vested in him the great influence which it would give the president would be the means of controlling the legislative department and subjecting it to his dictation especially when combined with the principle of proscription which has now become the established practice of the government the struggle to obtain the presidential chair would become proportionably greatso great as to destroy the freedom of elections the end would be anarchy or despotism as certain as i am now addressing the senate the great webster said in the part which i have acted in public life it has been my purpose to maintain the people of the united states what the constitution designed to make themone people one in interest one in character and one in political feeling if we depart from that we break it all up arbitrary governments may have territories and distant possessions because arbitrary governments may rule them by different laws and different systems russia may rule in the ukrane and the provinces in the caucasus and kamchatka by different codes ordinances or ukases we can do no such thing they must be of us part of us or else strangers till this thirst for empire seized the present administration no one contended that any people could be rightfully governed by this republic except in such manner and for such period as should be necessary to prepare their territory for admission into the union till now we have grown and expanded legitimately grandly and constitutionally the country was singularly fortunate in being at those critical periods under democratic administrations jefferson saw that the mississippi could not and should not remain the western boundary of the republic beyond it from lake of the woods to balize floated the spanish flag our southern border was the thirtyfirst parallel between us and thegulf lay the spanish floridas this is the story of our expansion from napoleon we purchased the immense scarcely populated french possessions extending from the mouth of the mississippi to montana then oregon washington and idaho came to us by right of original discovery of columbia river by captain gray an american navigator in 1792 by original exploration in 1805 and 1806 by lewis and clarke by john jacob astors settlement in 1810 and by cession from spain by the treaty of florida in 1819 by the same treaty we secured the floridas though we paid dearly for it by agreeing to retire from the rio grande to the sabine thereby surrendering to mexico the domain of texas which we did not regain till her annexation with the consent of her people in 1845 this was followed by the cession from mexico of the remaining mexican territory california new mexico utah etc in 1848 and 1853 in 1867 alaska came to us by purchase from russia we went from the mississippi to the pacific with 52 000 000 and the mexican war in all that vast domain the inhabitants except tribal indians who have always been and still are foreigners became citizens of our republic it is but fair to state that those treaties contained provisions for the admission of the inhabitants of the ceded territory to citizenship of the united states but their right to citizenshili was not derived from the treaties but independently of them from the constitution according to our supreme court the final judge of the matter time will not permit me to do more than cite the leading authorities and state thei conclusions they are loughborough vs blake 5 wheaton the dred scott case 18 howard murphyvs ramsay 114 u s mormon church vs united states 136 u s slaughterhouse cases 161wallace shively vs bowlby 152 u s united states vs more 3 cranch and cooley on constitutional law 169 they establish these fundamental principles that a power in the general government to obtain and hold colonies as dependent territories would be inconsistent with the character of the government that the national government is one of delegated powers granted and fixed by the constitution and no such power is conferred upon it that new territory can be constitutionally acquired for but one purposethe erection from it of new states that the power granted congress by section 3 article iv of the constitution to make all needful rules and regulations for the government of territories must be so construed as not to conflict with other provisions of that instrument and that so construed it is but a power to prepare them for statehood that in legislating for them congress is subject to the fundamental limitations in favor of personal rights formulated in the constitution and its amendments that is they must govern according to and under the constitution that the power conferred by section 8 article i of the constitution upon congress to levy and collect taxes and imposts which shall be uniform throughout the united states is general and without limitation as to place and extends to the whole of american territory that inhabitants of territory of the united states are citizens of the united states and under the protection of the constitution with all their civil and political rights secured to them that when we annex a territory whether by cession treaty or discovery we annex its inhabitants not as subjects but as citizens that inhabitants of federal territories and new citizens made such by annexation of territory or naturalization though without any status as citizens of a state could nevertheless as citizens of the united states lay claim to every one of the privileges and immunities of citizens that it could never have been understood that any territory which should at any time come under control of the united states should permanently be held in a territorial condition so far as i have been able to find those cases have never been overruled or modified those principles stand today as judicial decision and authority to our supreme court when the status and rights of the native inhabitants shall be brought before it for final adjudication the treaty of paris by which spain ceded to the united states her claims to puerto rico and the philippines contained this provision the civil and political status of the native inhabitants of the territories hereby ceded to the united states shall be determined by congress the administration has already determined upon the status which it wishes congress to declare the resolution introduced by the junior senator from indiana announced it that the philippine islands are territory belonging to the united states that it is the intention of the united states to retain them as such and to establish and maintain such governmental control throughout the archipelago as the situation may demand i the adoption of that resolution if it is adopted will be defiance of the constitution as interpreted by the highest court of the union it will be the pronunciamento of imperialism it will mean for the filipinos a government such as the people of india have at the hands of empress victoria the senator fresh from his conferences with the president announced it the system proposed is this an american governorgeneral in manila an advisory council with no power except to discuss measures with him american lieutenantgovelnors in each province with a like council about them frequent unannouncedvisits of the lieutenantgovernors to the districts and reports by them to the governor an american board of visitors to the islands with no power of interference to report their observations to the secretary of state of the united states the establishment of a tariff discriminating in favor of our exports the granting of franchises and concessions american judges no franchise to the people and all backed by a sufficient united states army it is framed after the government of india by england and is very like it this war is being carried on in order that such government may be established by congress under the administration s treaty of paris till then the president will maintain a military government presumably upon that system with a governorcommissioner lieutenantcommissioners and various and sundry executive underlingsa military despotism pure and simple already he is selecting his officials for that purpose his party is willing to leave him in sole possession of the situation and this congress will conclude its labors without being permitted to pass judgment upon it in that imperial government there can be found no place for or recognition of that immortal truth in our declaration of independence governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed rights and liberties guaranteed by the constitution are denied by a president whose only power and authority are derived from that instrument such annexation is shameless unconstitutional spoliation and confiscation listen to benjamin franklin justice is as strictly due between nations as between citizens a highwayman is as much a robber when he plunders in a gang as when single and a nation that makes an unjust war is only a great gang if it be in the power of congress to deprive them of the rights saved to them by our constitution is there any cause or reason for the exercise of it why should they be denied local selfgovernment they are better educated and qualified than the cubans for centuries they have managed to progress under spanish oppression their persistence in struggling for liberty evidences their appreciation of its value a people with such determination and longing for independence certainly has the capacity to exercise and enjoy it or else history is all wrong the central and south american republics almost at our door are convincing exhibits such government would not be suitable to a nation of our advancement and development but it could be a structure far inferior to ours and still adequate for their aspirations but why should they be incorporated into the body politic of the union surely not upon the plea of necessity and yet any other plea is scarcely imaginable we do not need them in our citizenship they are not fit for it by blood and centuries of racial inferiority they are not worthy or qualified to assist in the government of this nation their incorporation with our republic would be to weaken and corrupt it the experiment of ingrafting the negro upon our citizenship presents a lesson so recent instructive and ever present that no one seriously contends that the filipino should become an american citizen with the rights and immunities pertaining to that high station the administration scouts any such purpose consequences are indifferent to purposes the moment those islands are by congress declared to be territory of the united states the rights and privileges of american citizenship will vest in their inhabitants and the supreme court must so hold there will be no power under the law to prevent them from becoming residents of any portion of the union our ports will be open to them american labor will be brought in direct competition with the cheapest on earth the corporations and trusts which are the foster fathers of the party in power and of the administration will not hesitate to import and employ it whenever they have grown sufficiently powerful to defy public sentiment they will be the beneficiaries at the expense of our labor and institutions as yet we are free from the curse of that affliction it is true the administration by its treaty did all in its power to annex the territory by buying the title of spain and the war appurtenant to it but spain did not and could not deliver the possession which was an essential part of the title it is yet possible for the calamity of annexation to be averted from our people even if it were possible under our constitution to establish and maintainin those islands a colonial or proconsular government it is not necessary to our commercial interests that we should do so spain fell from the pinnacle of power and glory amongst the nations of the earth to her present condition because of her colonial possessions which were a constant demand upon her resources and a drain pf the lifeblood of her sons england has not gathered wealth or glory or peace from hers colonial india is not an alluring type for us to imitate we surely shall not wish to add to the horrors of mans inhumanity to man by matching englands average annual record of a million starving subjects with a proportionate number of miserable filipinos in 1898 her expenditures for british india exceeded the revenues by 25 000 000 in the straits settlements the deficit was 100 000 her share of the total commerce of british india was but 50 per cent and of the straits settlements only 14 per cent an army of 200 000 men is required to hold the subjects under her dominion the tropical climate creates heavy mortality and pension rolls the net result to the empire is pecuniary loss the useless sacrifice of her soldiery and the sullen enmity of 300 000 000 people no nation has ever been strengthened or enriched by colonial empire is the statement of historian macaulay how can we hope that a government by us of the archipelago by our viceroy and his satraps will have different results there are other and more farreaching consequences of the empire experiment of leaving our own to stand upon foreign ground we will have left the path of government in which we have grown and prospered as has no other nation that ever peopled the earth to enter upon a career of insatiate quest for foreign territory which may ultimatelybring us into conflict in antipodal seaswith the great navies of the earth we will have magnified the power of the executive far beyond the intendment of the constitution and to the peril of our free institutions with the immense colonial patronage and power placed in his hands his position of absolutism will differ from that of the empress only in degree it will be a government within our government conducted wholly by the executive and entirely independent of the legislative and judicial departments a republic whose government is based upon the foundation stone of the consent of the governed is to undertake the government against their consent of 10 000 000 asiatics 7 000 miles distant that is the proposition not only the proposition but the declared purpose of the administration the people of this country will pay the cost already in the army item alone this war of subjugation has cost us over 100 000 000 our military expenses now are a half million dollars a day the annual taxes per capitabecause federal taxation is practically a poll taxhave been increased 3 for every man woman and child in the union and the end is not yet when onehalf of our armyshall be withdrawn from luzon and only 30 000 soldiers left to keep the natives in just and due allegiance the cost of their maintenance per annum mill be 50 000 000 in the light of englands experience in that tropical climate at least onethird of that number will annually die or be withdrawn and will go upon the pension rolls tier upon tier till that item will exceed the annual budget for maintenance the expenses of the civil government will mount into the millions militarism will become the dominant feature of our government the liability of our becoming engaged in foreign complications because of our eastern possessions will furnish the ground and excuse for increasing the army and navy far beyond the proper requirements of the home government the mailed hand which has accomplished the overthrow of the republics of the past will for the first time have thrown its shadow across our pathway one hundred thousand and more soldiersconsumers and not producerswill feed and fatten upon and imperil the liberties of the toilers of the nation force bills will reappear in congress the ballot box will be cordoned with bayonets the strong arm of the nation will be at the beck and call of the imperial president the constitution will be overridden by the man on horseback ah but we are told this course is in line with americas destiny that we must expand our commerce and enlarge the sphere of our national life to this the reply has been made that no one has shown that we have exhausted our opportunities and commercial capabilities on the western hemisphere but i am not inclined to so meet the proposition i believe that it is the part of statesmanship and for the best interests of this country that the trade of the eastbe courted gained held and developed our industries should there obtain all possible consumption of their products we should have the world for our customers and we shall have when we remove the trade restrictions which our prohibitive tariff has imposed with onehand we shut our ports against the products of the nations and with the other we appeal to them to open theirs to us that we may have the world for our market light has at last come into dark places and the republican partybas learned that while an exorbitant tariff will force our own people to buy from manufacturers at the manufacturers prices that very system pari passu limits the consumption the home market is not sufficient for them they begin to realize that the wall which shuts the world out shuts us in we are making progress and we may reasonably hope that a few more years of commercial necessity will compel the liberation of american commerce from the exactions of our tariff barons we want and must have all the trade that can possibly be acquired in the east we must clothe those teeming millionssuch of them as wear clothes their ability to purchase depends upon their production the philippines are a part of that vast area their population is estimated at from ten to twelve million accurate enumeration of them or of the islands has never been made their commerce is anywhere between thirty and forty million dollars in population and commerce they constitute about 2 per cent of the colonial systems in asia if china with its dependencies of manchuria mongolia thibet jungaria and east turkistan and the russian states of bokhara and khiva are taken into the calculation the philippine population and trade are each less than 14 per cent of the total the british colonies british india straits settlements ceylon aden perim and australasia have a commerce 1898 of 1 470 000 000 the french colonies french india cochin china cambodia annam tonkin and french oceania 42 000 000 the dutch colonies java sumatra celebes molucca archipelago and riaulingga archipelago 154 000 000a total of 1 666 000 000 so do not let your philippine fever mislead you as to the comparative value of the commerce of those islands the trade of the east is most important that of the philippines cuts but a trifling figure in it their entire gross commerce will not amount to our annual expense and outlay in keeping them in subjection our trade with the east can not be reduced to the mere question of ownership or suzerainty of the philippines our commerce with china and with the british dutch and french colonies can not be affected by the relations existing between us and the philippines it is impossible to conceive how we can add a dollar to our exports to those countries by making subjects of the filipines the sympathy of the east is not with us in that undertaking what we need is not possession of those islands of the sea but an open door to asia that is importantimmensely importantto us force or vast colonial possessions are not useful or necessary to open that door it is not necessary that we hold and govern an archipelago of 1 200 islands in order to have a sufficient number of naval stations properly fortified and garrisoned for the protection of our commerce the coaling of our ships and the rendezvous of our menofwar as against the fleets of other nations in event of war they will be as adequate as possession of all the islands far more so because there will not be a weak or defenseless point in them with normal peace conditions and with simple business methods of underselling our competitors we have within the past decade increased our commerce in the east more than threefold and we are but at the dawn of our commercial intercourse with those people they are our friends till this war of benevolent assimilation the peaceful victorious march of our commerce was not disturbed or arrested by our war drums our flag was the welcome messenger of the good will of our people to all the nations of the east we did not and we do not have to force the sale of our goods at the cannons mouth till their suspicions were last year aroused by our war of aggression against the people of the islands of the sea who were our friends the republics of central and south america were steadily improving their commercial relations with us they are not yet estranged and we have the right to expect that the nicaragua canal when completed will by the immutable laws of trade annex to our commerce the immeasurable trade of those states without the firing of a gun or the seizure of a foot of territory china is the great customer of the east she is our friend and will trade with us in everincreasing volume but one thing could have prevented her and that was the closing of her ports by england russia germany and france if we are to undertake to guard against that interference by our war ships our fortified harbors coaling stations and garrisons will be far more valuable and effective than the exposed coasts of hundreds of islands inhabited by an embittered and hostile people no power in europe wants war with us either in arms or in commerce our good will our grain and cotton are far preferable there would be nothing to gain and much to lose that is unmistakably evidenced by their ready assent to the recent request of our secretary of state that we shall forever have equal rights of trade with them in all chinese ports held or controlled by them no war could obtain for us greater concessions or privileges no american manufacturer could or does ask more than this free and open right of competition so far as those powers can concede it then why talk of the philippines in connection with the open door to china when within the past two years has it been closed the war was on before the powers made that agreement and the war still continues whether the filipinos are to be freemenor subjects was not considered and that is the precise issue upon which the war is now continuing it would end upon the day in which the president or congress should announce that their independence shall be guaranteed the powers have agreed that we shall have the same right of entry at the chinese ports controlled by them that we now have in the old ports by virtue of trade treaties absolute ownership of the philippines could not acquire more for us we have thus peacefully obtained the open door the acquisition of which the imperialists claimed would be a sufficient justification of their war of aggression thus early have their theories been confounded by the stern logic of fact now let us understand the trade situation in china and divest it of the vagueness and confusion with which it has been invested by glittering generalities in the first place free entry of chinese ports does not mean free enjoyment of chinese trade no nation has yet realized that great ambition of commerce the chefoo convention determined that the local authorities of china have the right to impose taxes upon all property outside the limits of foreign settlements upon goods passing by road river or canal through their several jurisdictions opium being the only commodity exempt those foreign settlements are the ports the old treaty portsthe english port of hongkong the portuguese port of macao and the ports recently leased to three of the great powers of europewei hai wei to england kiao chow to germany port arthur and talienwan to russia the great yangtze river for its 1 000 miles of navigability is also open and the port of ichang and other landing places along its course have been conceded everywhere outside of those settlements all commerce is subject to the taxes exacted by the mandarins the future as is the present development of our commerce in china must lie in the vast domain along its great rivers yangtze and hoangho and the pechili gulf the chief ports for our commerce are first shanghai at the mouth of the yangtze and hongkong no war can ever render them more open to our merchandise than they are today our success in that field will depend upon our thrift enterprise and ability to undersell the same causes that secure our vast trade in europe in competition with its own industries will obtain and hold for us the custom of the orientals the only law of trade is the best goods for the least money and it is universal in its application that is the explanation of the wonderful development of cotton and iron industries in the south which are capturing europe and asia and with the completion of the nicaragua canal will add central and south america to their victorious train that is the kind of expansion we wanthonest legitimate profitable and constitutional not of force but of superiority of american mind and american industry not of blood but of peace not at point of bayonet but in the good will of our customers and those customers all the nations and peoples of the earth never has this country had a more horrid front reared across its pathway than imperialism it is foreign to and destructive of our institutions its hope and reliance are the power of the sword the liberty of man is

be derived from the islands can be acquired by possession of harbors and coaling and military stations our duty to the inhabitants will be fully discharged by according them protection against foreign powers pacifying the islands and assisting them to the formation and conduct of their own government just as we assured the world we would do for cuba in the fulfillment of which promise we are now engaged admiral dewey vouches for their superiority to the cubans from the day of the surrender of manila by spain the filipinos have asked for nothing else today they are ready and anxious for the acceptance of any terms which will include the guaranty of ultimate selfgovernment speaking as i believe for my countrys best interests it is to me passing strange that the administration prefers war

south african patriots have been introduced in this house by myself and other members the speaker has referred these resolutions to the committee on foreign affairs and althoughample time has elapsed that committee has taken so far as we know no action and apparently does not intend to take any action in regard to the same for that reason and lest a more favorable opportunity shall not be available i desire at this time to express and to place on record my condemnation of the unjust the inhuman the predatory the cruel and the barbarous war the empire of great britain is ruthlessly and relentlessly conducting in south africa to destroy and exterminate two brave little republics sisters of our own and as free and as independent as this republic the patriotic people of this country take a deep and an abiding interbst in the life and death struggle between republic and empire now going on in south africa as an american citizen and a representative in this congress i am not ashamed to have it known that my sympathy is now always has been and always will be with the heroic boers in their magnificent struggle to maintain their freedom and their independence against the piracy of the corrupt oligarchy now controlling the policy of the british empire i am with the boers and i want to see them maintain their independence because they are right and because they are free and deserve to be free in a contest between liberty and monarchy i want to see liberty win the cause of the patriots of south africa is a just cause no one who impartially reads history can honestly dispute it they are defending their homes and repelling a tyrannical and a remorseless invader englands attempt to steal their country is the outrage of the century the culminating atrocity of criminal british aggression and should be condemned by this republic and by the christian powers of the world in my judgment it i mistake not public opinion ninetenths of the american people are against england in this bloody war of conquest for sordid gain and in sympathy with the boers the best thought of england condemns the conflict and the awakening conscience of the british empire demands peace with honor in the name of humanity christianity and civilization in 1776 the patriot fathers of this republic fought england to gain our independence the south african patriots today are fighting the same country to maintain their independence that is the only difference the courage of the boers in the face of tremendous odds has challenged the admiration of mankind and their heroism against almost insurmountable obstacles has won the respect of the civilized world they are entitled to our sympathy and we would be false to ourselves and to all our history if we did not give it to them the sacrifices they have thus far made and the gallantry heroism and bravery they have exhibited are unequaled and unparalleled in the history of the world the story of the struggles the hardships the trials and the tritimphs of these brave people in south africa is one of the saddest and one of the greatest pages in all historyan imperishable heritage to every lover of liberty and to their hardy and valorous descendants an incentive to maintain their freedom that can never be crushed no true american can impartially read the history of the boers without feeling a deep sympathy for them in their present struggle to uphold and defend their independence against english greed for gold english tyranny and criminal british aggression for land in regard to all the facts of the case there may besome honest difference of opinion but if there is it is based i believe to a large extent on misinformation or a lack of knowledge of all the circumstances english agencies have been sedulously at work for some time unceasingly disseminating misinformation in regard to the boers and the true situation in south africa let me ask you all to search out the truth ere you pass judgment on the brave republicans of south africa let us briefly review the situation we must not rely too much on the colored the doctored and the censored british reports from english sources in cape colony england is now and always has been unscrupulous in a war like thisawar against humanityshe has little regard for truth in south africa there are two free and independent countriesone called the south african republic the other called the orange free state they are duly organized governments republican in form patterned to a great extent after our own and recognized as free and independent throughout the world as a matter of law and as a matter of fact england has no more right to meddle with them or to interfere in their internal affairs than she has to meddle with mexico or interfere in the internal affairs of the united states these states are now and have been ever since the convention of 1884 free and independent states there can be no controversy about this these brave south african patriots are a good deal like the patriots of our own revolution they love their homes their freedom and their liberty they come from good old saxon ancestors from the north of europe they love free institutions the same as we do for the sake of personal liberty it comes to them naturally and by inheritance their love of liberty is not of a day or of a year but of centuries they arb a brave a fearless a patriotic a libertyloving and a godfearing people many years ago their ancestors emigrated from holland from france and from other places in the north of europe to cape colony in order to live under free institutions enjoy the blessings of liberty and worship their maker according to the dictates of their own conscience i the puritan the hollander the irishman the german and the cavalier came to this country for the same reason and for the same purpose these sturdy immigrants and their heroic descendants carved out unaided and alone their own destiny in the wilds of the dark continent amid unspeakable hardships and privations and gave to the world a civilization as good as our own fora century and more in sunshine and in storm these brave people toiled and plodded on and they builded like the fathers of this republic better than they knew surrounded by savages harassed by wild beasts visited by famine and scourged by disease in all the long weary and dreary years they never lost hope they prayed to god and never despaired they are a simple christian people as honest as they are brave they redeemed the wilderness turned the desert wastes into sweepin fields of grain made the jungle blpssom and bloom like a rose and dotted the hills with villages and towns notwithstanding all they had to contend with they grew they prospered and they were happy until perfidious albion came from that day to this england has made cruel war on the boers she has repeatedly robbed them of their lives their property and their lands but the spirit of their love of liberty has never been broken you can not conquer a brave people inspired by the love of freedom and battling on their own soil for their homes and their liberties they will never surrender their principles they will resist oppression and tyranny until they are exterminated by overwhelming and superior force they know like patrick henry that resistance to tyrants is obedience to god their love of liberty is stronger and motn tenacious than their love of life their history is an epic poem of one long heroic struggle against english greed english tyranny and english oppression these brave boers are now fighting perhaps for the last time of gold there is at the bottom of it all love of gold is the cause for republicanism against monarchy for democracy against plu of this cruel

finally recognized by great britain in 1884 and over since then it be enfranchised without abjuring or renouncing their allegiance has been as free and as independent as our own great republic to the british crown this proposition is and was preposterous prior to the year 1884 these brave and fearless men and their no government on earth would submit to it ancestors had struggled and struggled for a century and more to if the english aliens in the transvaal wanted to become citizens establish what they now possess and what they are at present so of the boer republic they had to comply with the law just the gallantly fighting to maintaia free and independent govern same as english aliens in this country in order to become citiment of their own once twice three times has england vie zens of the united states must comply with our law and renounce lated her solemn pledge to them and trespassed on their sacred forever their allegiance to the british crown the law there rerights she saw what they had wrought and her greedy sons garding naturalization is just about the same as the law here coveted it the boers were compelled by english greed and if anything it is more liberal tyranny and power to move farther and farther inland when but be these grievances of the foreigners in the south african ever they thought they were secure and had the right to enjoy the republic regarding franchise taxation and representation justor blessings of liberty and selfgovernment england encroached on unjust reasonable or unreasonable it was no cause for this santheir domain waged pitiless and savage war against them and guinary war as a matter of fact however the south african drove them farther and farther from the sea republic was willing to comply with every request of the english to their credit and their glory however be it said that every government regarding the franchise and all other alleged grievencroachment on their land their rights and their liberties has ances of the ijitlanders been manfully and stubbornly resisted they were forced to i think it can be safely stated that the boers were willing to armove on but they never gave up their freedom they never sur bitrate all questions of difference between the two governments rendered their independence but england declined and began a systematic concentration of prior to the present conflict majuba hill marks the place of the english troops on their frontier which in itself constituted a praclast contest with great britain of these valorous people for their tical declaration of war against them homes and their firesides majuba hill forever glorious in the and sir let me say right here that if the friends and sympaannals of the south african republics struggle to maintain its thizers of england urge as a reason for british interference and independence majuba hill to them is the same as banker hill as a justification of this war the alleged grievances of the uitlandto us and both will live in history to the end of time as an inspira ers in regard to the franchise taxation and representation in the tien to man transvaal the friends and sympathizers of the boers answer that after this disastrous blow to british arms the convention of 1884 englands rules laws and regulations regarding american aliens was entered into and all other and prior treaties were annulled in the british klondike are more severe more grievous and by this treaty the south african republic became free and inde more burdensome and yet does anyone here urge a war with endent and took its place among the nations of the wxrld and england on account of the grievances of american miners in ord derby then secretary of state for the colonies and a very the british klondike different man from joseph chamberlain distinctly stated in par from all the facts and circumstances in the case i am convinced liament that the south african republic was independent and free and clearly of the opinion that england has no right to interfere to govern itself the question of englands paramountcy in in the internal affairs of the boers her pretexts for doing so are south africa was notmnentioned and never a word was said about untenable and her entire course in the matter has been selfish british suzerainty cruel unjustifiable and dishonorable that great english statesman friend of the boers friend of lib the war she is waging against them today is the most crimierty and of irish home rule william e gladstone said the word nal the most defenseless and the most predatory war in all his suzerainty was dropped on purpose tory the boers at all times were willing to concede every fair even as late as may 1898 after the jameson raid mr chamber and just demand england made nothing would satisfy rhodes lain said in the house of commons and chamberlain they wanted the land of the boers because it a war in south africa would be one of the most serious wars that could contained gold and all the other incidental demands were merely possibly be waged it would be a long war a bitter war and a costly war pretexts as soon as one was conceded another and a harder one it would leave behind it the embers of a strife which i believe generations was made would hardly be long enough to extinguish to go to war with president the truth is and history wll so record it that england wanted krugerin order toentorce uponhim reformsin theinternalaffairs of his state in which secretaries of state standing in this place have repudiated all right the control of this country because it is the richest in gold in the of interferencethat would be a course of action as immoral as it would have world england always puts in a claim where gold is found been unwise england is now and always has been the aggressor against the now sir i say from the record that it must be clear and plain boers the concentration of british troops on the frontier of the to everyone who has reviewed the question from an english as orange free state and the south african republic was a virtual well as a boer standpoint that the south african republic is and declaration of war england forced the war england began it was since 1884 a sovereign and independent state in proof of the boers yielded everything but independence to satisfy england this i cite the additional fact that it was admitted to the inter if the boers had not struck for their rights their firesides and national postal union that it was a member of the convention of their independence when they did and as they did they would geneva and that our own government and all the other powers have been overwhelmed by superior british forces before thiey recognized it and appointed to it consuls the united states could have struck a blow and resistance would have been useless consul at pretoria today is acting in that capacity not only for they were right in stilking when they did us but for great britain as well i glory in the spunk of grand old paul kruger he is one of under all the circumstances it seems to me england is now pre the worlds great heroes he knew only too well how dangerous cluded from raisingthe question of the independence of the south was delay and everything that has occurred since he issued his african republic for england to raise this contention at this defiant ultimatum to the british crown has demonstrated his late day is a mere flimsy pretext an afterthought of cecil rhodes wisdom and his foresight he is a grand old man one of the and joseph chamberlain and constitutes a blunder worse than a worlds immortals and will al ways stand out on the pages of hiscrime tory as a friend of man a lover of liberty and a champion of thequestion of suzerainty was not raised at first in the differences freedom with the south african republic there never would have been the ultimatum he issued to england rang round the globe and trouble if gold had not been discovered in the land the rich find will live in the worlds history the boers will never surrender their love of liberty they can only be conquered by being exterminated and england must not be permitted to exterminate them and steal their homes her criminal march of devastation must and will be checked america should do its duty the great republic the beacon light of the world in the name of liberty humanity and justice must demand peace and make that demand good we have the right to insist on peace with honor we have the right to express our sympathy we have the right to aid the red cross society international law gives us these rights and we should exercise them why are we silent we sympathized with poland with hungary with greece with all the south american republics with armenia and with cuba in their struggles for freedom many we helped why i ask in the name of all that is just and honorable in the hame of our glorious past should we now refuse to lend our moral support our sympathy and our aid to the patriots of south africa is the great light of the republic going out is american sentiment dead a republic that has sunk so low that it glories in the downfall of a sister republic is in danger of destruction itself a republic that refuses sympathy to a sister republic struggling to maintain its independence against monarchical agression is unworthy the name and in danger of monarchy itself a republic that will secretly aid a monarchy to destroy a republic and blot out its free institutions is a republic rotten to the core and will soon fall like a decayed tree on the banks of a turbulent stream to be swept away forever in my opinion the defeat of the boers will be the severest blow to republican institutions that has been struck in more than a century and every friend of liberty the world over should fervently pray that oom paul may be successful how patriotic citizens of this country can sympathize with great britain in this cruel unjust and unholy war against our two sister republics is beyond my comprehension their defeat will be a terrible blow to free institutions on this hemisphere and give thrones and empires a renewed lease of life at the very dawn of the twentieth century the committee on foreign affairs this republican congress and this proenglish administration of william mckinley will do nothing for liberty nothing for the boers and secretly sympathize with great britain every libertyloving citizen of the republic should denounce and condemn these proenglish and imperialistic tendencies this republic should stand by republicsnot against them i want to see the right triumph and if it does the boers will maintain the independence of their country god bless the embattled farmers of south africa is my fervent prayer and from the ashes of the conflict may there

value of their bonds and you reduce their taxes fourteenth you permit national banks to organize in villages with 25 000 capital which will have the effect to destroy private banks mr chairmqn the financial notions and demands of the moneyed class have nearly all been incorporated in the bill before us the majority have as near as they dared followed the demands of the indianapolis monetary convention briefly stated this bill proposes to enact into law the payment of the entire bonded indebtedness of the government principal and interest in gold the permanent retirement of the greenbacks and treasury notes issued under the law of july 1890 by redeeming them in gold the redemption of silver with gold when demanded and the final substitution of nationalbank paper for every kind of paper money now in circulation in other words the scheme is to make gold the money of final payment for everything and to permit corporations to issue and control the entire paper circulation as the representative of a brave enlightened honest people i protest against this scheme i believe it to be unamerican unbusinesslike unconstitutional and hurtful to the wealth producers of our country it means the degradation of the silver money we now have and pledges the money world that we will coin no more it means the ultimate destruction of one of the constitutional coins of our government it means appreciation in the purchasing power of gold and the lowering of prices for the products of labor it means the contraction or expansion of the paper currency at the will and pleasure of the national banking corporations and consequent paralysis of the business men of small meansthe farmer miner and mechanic it means the weeding out of the middle classes the bone and sinew of free government and leaving us two classes the very poor and the very rich it means as i read it the enslavement of the farmer miner country merchant small banker mechanic and day laborer to the money power this last bringsa sneer to the face of the defender advocate and apologist of this class and we are asked who and what is the money power it is a combination of great hankers and bond owners of europe and the united states who are neither american english french belgian nor german in their real allegiance but must be regarded as a law unto themselves and a separate power gradually but steadily strengthening their remorseless grip upon the destiny of governments it is that power that permitted the turks to murder armenians that made terms of peace between greece and turkey so as to preserve the solvency of turkish bonds that is dismembering chinathat has forced this republican government in violation of every sentiment of liberty humanity and christianity to go into world politics spit on our great past and deny liberty to a struggling people and through it all has carried its bloodstained banner of per cent of profit without regard to the claims of justice or the cause of liberty and right for twentyfive years there has been slowly but surely developed a determined and unrelenting purpose on the part of the holders of our bonds in europe and the united states and of capitalists who control the national banks to make the bonds of this government payable in gold to circumscribe the legaltender power of silver and to destroy every kind of paper currency except that of national banks in spite of assertion to the contrary this bill is intended to and will contract the currency and history teaches that a contraction of capital invariably produces adverse and distressing times while an abundance of money creates prosperity but you insist that the payment of bonds and redemption of paper in silver would not be honest because silver is far below gold who is to blame for the price of silver the men who are demanding the present legislation you stopped the coinage of silver in 1873 you only permitted a crippled coinage under the law of 1878 you again killed coinage of silver by the law of july 1890 every administration for more than twentyfive years has tried to destroy the virility of silver the ofttold tale has been repeated in this debate that the secretary can not get silver to circulate the general stock of silver coined amounts to 482 622 376 the statement of the treasury department on december 1 1899 was that there was on that day in circulation in silver dollars 76 232 454 and of silver certificates 394 292 800 or a total of 472 525 250 nearly the whole amount of silver ever coined but we are told that there has been such an unexampled yield of silver during the last twentyfive years that a tremendous fall in its value has been forced upon the commercial world and has no reference to its not being coined this old wormeaten chestnut has been made to do duty in every debateon the financial question for more than twenty years in the debate in this house in the fiftyfifth congress on the teller resolutions it was dragged from its hiding place and paraded as the crowning reason why we should not return to coinage of silver but the facts do not bear gentlemen out in this contention the total product of gold and silver from the mines of the united states 1873 to 1897 inclusive is gold 970 751 327 silver coinage value 1 299 000 000 in that same period the worlds production of gold was 3 160 000 000 and of silver 3 281 000 000 coinage value and the gold production has wonderfully increased since then from 1801 to 1850 the total product of gold and silver in the world in each hundred dollars worth of coin was of gold 36 7 andof silver 63 3 i pass over the period when californian and australian gold discoveries made it so plentiful from 1874 to 1896 it was 48 per cent of gold and 52 per cent of silver is there any unexampled overproduction of silver in these figures gentlemen can satisfy themselves of the truth of these figures by looking at the reports of the director of the mint from year to year and silver has not had a friendly director of the mint since i have mixed in politics you propose by this bill to make 346 681 016 of united states notes greenbacks 89 026 280 of treasury notes 482 622 376 silver dollars and 1 037 049 690 of united states bonds payable in golda grand total of 1 955 379 362 made to depend on the everchanging home of gold and 918 329 672 to be mere token money the whole amount to depend on the good will of the gold gamblers of the world you have not been quite bold enough to declare outright for demonetization of silver and the cancellation of greenbacks but your bill does propose to have the treasury exchange gold for silver and to redeem the greenbacks and treasury notes in gold which means that every dollar so redeemed will pass out of circulation for all time if you continue in control of the government this bill proposes to shut up in the treasury in the division of issue and redemption at one fell swoop about 760 000 000 and 50 000 000 more must be kept in the general fund of this 260 000 000 must be in gold coin this will inevitably contract the circulating medium and in section 4 of this bill you extend the glad hand to the bondocrats by authorizing the secretary to issue united states bonds at his own sweet will you tear down all barriers that have heretofore protected the plain people against the d6mands of the holders of idle capital who want to escape taxation by investing in nontaxable bonds it appears at first glance that the majority intended to expand our money a little by coining the silver seigniorage into subsidiary coin but they carefully look after that by declaring that a like amount of treasury notes shall be canceled and not reissued again the bill before us strikes a deadly blow at all forms of paper currency issued by the government by giving authority to the secretary of the treasury to prescribe what sized bills of united states notes and treasury notes shall be issued and by declaring that silver certificates shall hereafter only be issued in bills of one two and five dollars the meaning of allthisis made plain by the reading of sections 8 9 10 and 11 of this bill which absolutely and without reserve turn over the supreme control of the paper currency of the united states to the national banks for seventy years the money power has worked and waited toiled and planned for the glad day which this bill promises the day is upon us for which nicholas biddle and his clan toiled and schemed prayed and bulldozed begged and demandedthe control of our monetary system by national banks you of the majority hope that the banks will buy bonds of the government and fill the vacant places of silver greenbacks and treasury notes with nationalbank paper and expand the currency to meet the demands of trade you will find that a hope long deferred which will make your heart sick i stand with the democratic party and with the populists as well in neverending opposition to granting further power to national banks we find here and there a man who affiliates with the democracy in favor of such banks and who is willing to see their power augmented but when you do find such a man he is either uninformed as to the history of our party or he is willing to forego party principles for the sake of gain to himself or his friends thomas jefferson is one of the worlds immortals here and there as we read the history and biography of the centuries we finda man of marvelous qualities standing out in advance of his fellows among them all no finite man outranks jefferson as an exponent of human liberty of individual rights of government by the people he is the colossus of the ages the honest the faithful the natural democrat goes to his teachings for inspiratiou to acts of integrity the declaration of independence and his first inaugural address are examples of his wond rous faith in the plain people and his whole life lessons were in the direction of giving every man an equal opportunity the keen foresight with which he had been gifted enabled him to see the dangers of acurrency which was controlled by the greed of corporate wealth and his knowledge of the constitution his intense desire to protect our country impelled him to say that congress has no power to charter a united states bank that such an institution is one of deadly hostility to the best interests of the country dangerous to our republican institutions and the liberties of the people and calculated to place the business of the country within the control of a concentrated money power and above the laws and will of the people sapplause aving faith in the immaculate democracy of the founder of our party another great exemplar of american democracy andrew jackson destroyed the old national bank of the thirties no less than eight times has the party in national convention indorsed the theory of jefferson and the action of jackson it is a cardinal principle of our party that the federal government should not surrender its sovereignty and farm out to corporations the making and control of our paper currency we are opposed to it because we find no warrant in the constitution for the government surrendering its own sovereignty to corporations made up of private individuals some vigilant champion of gold and national banks may demand of us why if we believe what we preach we do not carry the questions to the courts and have settlemeut alas we have learned by bitter experience that he who pleads for the plain people on these great questions rarely reaches the ear of the courts the power that is to make gold the unit of value and that demands that corporations shall make and control the paper currency has had much to do with making the personnel of the courts the recent decision of the highest court of our country on the income tax teaches us that judicial precedents and constitutional guaranties cut no large figure these latter days we oppose national banks because their charters are special privileges not given other classes of citizens it is now proposed to enlarge the power of the national banks by issuing to them their full 100 per cent of their bonds and to reduce the taxes on them retire the greenbacks and treasury notes as is suggested and this will give the control of the currency issue into the hands of the national banks with power to expand or contract the issue at will this is a surrender of sovereignty to corporate interests which has been damaging to the interests of the common people in the past that has helped to unsettle values and brought disaster to business of all kinds let it not be forgotten that in 1881 when congress attempted to reduce the interest on bonds these banks retired in one day without notice 18 000 000 of their currency it is too much power to give to corporations in this connection i may be pardoned for quoting from one who had some character and standing among the public men of sixty years ago in a speech in the united states senatein 1831 this language was used by a democratic senator referring to the united states bank the government itself ceases to be independent it ceases to be safe when the national currency is at the will of a company the government can undertake no great enterprise neither of war or peace without the consent and cooperation of that company it can not count its revenues for six months ahead without referring to the action of that companyits friendship or its enmity its concurrence or oppositionto see how far that company will permit money to be plentiful or make it scarce how far it will let the moneyed system go on regularly or throw it into disorder how far it will suit the interests or policy of that company to create a tempest or to suffer a calm in the moneyed ocean the people are not safe when a company has such power the temptation is too great the opportunity too easy to put up and put down prices to make and break fortunes to bring the whole community upon its knees to the neptunes who preside over the flux and reflux of paper all property is at their mercy the price of real estate of every growing crop of every staple article is at their command stocks are their playthings their gambling theater on which they gamble daily with as little secrecy and as little morality and far more mischief to fortunes than common gamblers carry on their operations it tends to aggravate the inequalities of fortunes to make the rich richer and the poor poorer to multiply nabobs and paupers and to deepen and widen the gulf which separates dives and lazarus if there was aught of truth in this picture made nearly seventy years ago when we had one united states bank how much more potent must be the influence of thousands of national banks which we now have and which are held together as a great trust by the cohesive power of public and private plunder as their charters expire they should ba compelled to go out of business as national banks instead of us enlarging their powers and becoming subject to their baleful influence gentlemen on the other side take party credit for the better times in the country you are persistently following the commands of your former leader mr blaine to claim everything the marvelous production of gold in the world during these years a great deal of which came from our mines the large demand for our meats and bread in europe together with the fact that our manufacturers have gone into the markets of the world with their wares and have successfully competed with foreigners has given us a mighty balance of trade which after paying our interest charges abroad has left us some hundreds of millions more money than we had three years ago it proves our contention that more money makes better prices but you can not expect this to continue always one extralarge foreign crop will glut our home market the balance of trade will be against us gold will flow from us and under the provisions of this bill we will be bound hand and foot with every debt made or to be made payable in gold who demands this legislation how manyraisers of wheat corn cattle cotton hogs tobacco and fruit appeared before your partisan committee to ask that this proposed bill become the law how many private bankers country merchants miners of coal lead and zinc came before you and pleaded for it how many of the millions of americans who earn their bread by honest labor have asked you to pay the bonds in gold and cancel treasury notes and strike down silver how great was the throng of old federal soldiers who saved the union that have begged you to impound and destroy the greenbacks who besides the money changers demand the retirement of the greenbacks what small country banker or merchant demands it who among the millions of farmers have asked it what great army of laborers want greenbacks redeemed in gold or in fact redeemed at all it is a safe a sound a stable currency and besides it was issued by our government in the exercise of its constitutional sovereign power it paid the soldiers who fought for and saved the union this money bought the bonds which by law are now to be payable in gold i assert that there is no general demand among the people for the present redemption of greenbacks but there is a general opposition to their being redeemed in gold and permanently retired i was trained and educated to believe that the only legaltender money authorized by the constitution was silver and gold but a supreme court dominated by your party declared that congress had the right to make paper money a legal tender as well therefore with that authority given congress i insist that the sovereignty of the government should be exercised when we need paper money and not given over to national banks when the leaders of gold monometallism bore down the young ajax from nebraska with threats predictions prophecies with unlimited money with desertions from ourparty and with sooth ing promises of international bimetallism they thought the battle over and the silver craze forever killed but they may learn from their own platform of 1892 that the american people from tradition and interest favor bimetallism we have seen the commission sent to treat with foreign countries backcapped from the treasury and by the president when he sent in his recommendation t6 congress on july 24 1897 the people now see clearly that they were buncoed in 1896 with false promises and now feeling bold the administration by its pliant congress dares to proclaim its purpose to more firmly establish the gold standard we welcome the gage of battle we believe this compact minority will come back to the fiftyseventh congress a compact majority and will so demean itself as to be a triumphant party on the democratic platform of 1896"], [0.011533975601196289, 0.9884660243988037, 1, "having listened attentively to this debate for the past five days i am firmly of the opinion that nothing has been said or will hereafter be said by any gentleman on this side that will cause any member of the majority party on this floor to change his action inviewof this conclusion i would under ordinary circumstances pursue the course i had marked out for myself and be content to remain in my seat in silence but when i contemplate the distressing consequences and conditions that must inevitably follow the passage of the pending bill believing as i do that it is laden with every phase of national and individual disaster and distress i can not refrain from entering my emphatic vigorous and solemn protest i have noted with surprise and astonishment the strangely inharmonious and wholly conflicting positions taken by some of the distinguished leaders who have spoken in advocacy of this harsh unjust oppressive and monstrous measure beginning with the presidents message and running through every speech made on that side we have had presented to us in the most gorgeoushues of word painting the assumed fact that the country is in a condition of unusual prosperity which the gentlemen with more arrogance than reason insist is due to the fact that we have had the single gold standard in practical operation for the past thirty years i would be glad if some one on that side would tell us what they mean by the country and point to the evidences of this phenomenal prosperity of which they speak as i understand it one is said to be in a prosperous condition when he can by faithful and energetic exertion earn something in excess of the amount required economically expended to support himself and his family a man may be prosperous and be in debt but when indebted he can in the course of time under prosperous conditions discharge or at least reduce his indebtedness this is also true of a nation and yet notwithstanding this unprecedented prosperity which we are told swept over the country like a tidal wave of the deep after confidence was restored in 1873 and which has abided with us during all the years since except during mr clevelands administration we have heard in this debate the startling and astounding admission of the distinguished gentleman from fllinois that the people of this highly favored land still have fastened upon them an indebtedness quoting his exact words on contracts made since 1870 amounting to fifty or seventyfive billions of dollars and contracted upon the present basis the gentleman who uttered these words has passed that period of life when the exuberance of youth might lead him to extravagance of speech and therefore his statement should cause you on that side of this chamber to pause and reflect provided you have not completely surrendered to the money power of the country the highest reliable estimate places our population at about 75 000 000 if the maximum indebtedness stated by the gentleman from illinois is reliable we are confronted with the alarming condition that the average indebtedness of every citizen of the united states regardless of age and sex is 1 000 at the general election held in 1896 the total vote cast for all the candidates for the presidency was 13 923 398 and if this colossal debt were prorated equally among them it would make an average indebtedness of 5 386 70 for every manwho voted at that electionfor every adult male citizen of the united states with these facts asserted and contended for gentlemen who advocate the enactment of this odious and infamous bill seek to chloroform the intelligent judgment of the masses of our country by their siren song of prosperity while the people are being further plundered and robbed of 800 000 000 in obedience to the arbitrary demands of the banks and trusts that furnished the republican party the sinews of war with which to wage the first battle the gentleman from ohio challenges us to refer to a single statement made by democrats in 1896 which subsequent events has proven to be true and without waiting for a reply satisfies himself and his admiring friends by saying we can not do so in this conclusion he is mistaken we said in 1896 that an increase of the volume of money in the channels of trade would cause rising prices and better wages and bring better times you conclusively admit this to be true by your repeated arguments on this floor based on the discovery of the klondike from which we have drawn large quantities of gold and the fact that gold has come to us from other nations by reason of trade balances being in our favor thus increasing the volume of our basic money your speeches are admissions that the quantitative theory of finance contended for by democrats is a correct principle again we took the position and announced it everywhere that your st louis platform was a snare a deception a delusion and a fraud by which you hoped to deceive the voter we said you would not make an honest effort to secure internationalbimetallism we charged that you were at heart in league and sympathy with and under the domination of the plutocrats and capitalists of the nation and that you would destroy th6 last hope of silver coinage if in your power to do so if you were intrusted with the reins of government i charge now that your attitude and conduct on this floor is a plea of guilty to each of the counts in the indictment the mantle of hypocrisy has been carefully laid away for future use and you now propose to more securely establish the single gold standard retire and practically cancel and destroy all the paper and silver money aggregating some 800 000 000 and make the whole business and commerce of the country dependent upon gold by taking out of circulation as this bill will do about 800 000 000 you in effect add just that sum to the already stupendous indebtedness of the toilers and producers of our nation reduce the level of prices of commodities and of labor and place that amount to the credit of the bondholders millionaires and trusts which have been fostered and created under the policies of your unhallowed administration with a record showing your every pledge violated your vows broken and the confidence of the people betrayed with a colossal indebtedness that stifles the comprehension of man hanging over us with all our great industries held in the grasp and control of the trusts you have inflicted upon us you unblushingly say in the american congress in the language used by the gentleman from ohio a few days ago and indorsed by the gentleman from new york today we intend to enact this law and make it impossible for you to repeal it for at least eight years to come unless death shall intervene in the senate thereby making it possible for the democratic party to gain control of that body ah gentlemen if the passage of this bill is rightif you believe you are doing the will of your constituentswhy hedge this measure about with such ironclad safeguards as to make it impossible for the american people if they see proper to do so to amend or repeal it if you are conscientious in this matter and feel that you are truly voicing the sentiments of your people then in the name of all that is right i ask you why are you afraid to submit your action to the sober judgment of an enlightened people for their approval why make it impossible for the plain people of the united states to pass in judgment upon the acts of their servants why burn the bridges behind you unless indeed your consciences have made cowards of you all and you fear you will be overtaken by a justly indignant and incensed people and amid the execrations and anathemas of an enraged nation you will be hurled from place and power forever you say you will pass this bill and we in the name of the debtburdened and oppressed producers and wageearners of our country defy you if you had had the courage to attempt its passage two years ago the majority would now be on this side of this hall pass it and i venture the statement that more democrats will vote in the next congress than will answer to the roll call at this session has the imperial policy of the present national adininistration so frenzied your brain and intoxicated your judgment that you dare hurl defiance at a free people whose servants you are do you feel so secure in your power and disposition to intimidate the american voter that you no longer respect that great tribunal of final resort the intelligent will of a free people i say to you that the shackles you are forging today and which you will fasten for a time upon us will be broken the people of this country will rise in the strength of their sovereign manhood break these fetters of gold and smite their oppressors the principle of bimetallism is a living principle no action of a mere partisan majority can smother it into lifelessness the republican party may thwart our desires and trample upon the sacred interests of the people for a season but time at last sets all things even it canmake no grave so deep or no sepulcher so strong as to permanently imprison the expressed will of thirteen and a half millions of people in 1900 the united forces of bimetallism will move forward in solid phalanx to avenge the grievous wrong you are now about to perpetrate back of us we will have the unqualified indorsement and approval of every prominent man in the republican party since the days of the immortal lincoln including the distinguished gentleman who assists mr hanna in administering the affairs of government to sustain us in our convictions and guide us aright we have the light of experience of more than a hundred years of our nations life we point with pride to the fact that for one hundred and eightysix years prior to 1873 the commercial ratio of silver to gold was never as high as 16 to 1 except during a part of three years in the early part of this century as will appear from an examination of tables contained in the annual report of the director of the mint for the year 1898 during all the years embraced in these tables the value of the bullion contained in a silver dollar as a mere commodity in the open markets of the world was worth more than 1 in gold as will appear from the following table taken from the report above referred to covering the period from 1837 to 1873 bullion value of 871 55 grains 0 pure silver at the annual average price of 8ilsjer bullion value of 371 25 grains of pure silver at the annual average price of silver each year from 18371898 year value year value year value year value 1837 1 009 153 1

100 total silver production 8 351 339 167 fine ounces of the coining value of 10 797 685 200 thus it will be seen that the ratio of production of silver and gold is practically the same as the legal ratio for which we contend indeed it seems that the creator in his wisdom has so deposited the precious metals in the hidden recesses of the mountain side that the genius and cupidity of man can only bring them forth in about the ratio of 16 to 1 that silver has depreciated since 1873 none will deny that this condition is due to hostile and unfriendly legislation an inspection of the tables referred to by me will make so clear that no sane person will controvert the proposition by destroying the demand for silver for monetary use you destroyed its value by again creating an unlimited demand for silver its value would be restored gentlemen say we dare not longer advocate 16 to 1 they mistake us we do advocate the free coinage of silver and gold at 16 to 1 and neverentertained a t houghtof changing from it we stand today on the platform and for the principles we advocated and supported in 1896 and gentlemen in 1900 8 000 000 voters of the united states will follow the banner of democracy upon which will be inscribed free coinage of silver and gold at 16 to 1 and with undimnished confidence in the wisdom of our declaration and with increased faith and trust in our peerless leader that banner will be borne aloft to victory by the gallant statesman of nebraska william j bryan"], [0.011757910251617432, 0.9882420897483826, 1, "i would not speak at this late hour were it not for the fact that you being in the chair there is a presumption that a quorum of the house is present and for the further fact that the distinguished gentleman from indiana mr overstreetj in charge of the pending bill is also here so that i shall assume that i am speaking to the entire body of republicans of this house this bill is not the product of this house or any of its committees though this republican house is going to adopt it a caucus of the republicans made a committee last winter who during the summer met at atlantic city under every influence calculated to induce them to approve the monetary views of the great national banks of the large cities and prepared this bill on the meeting of this congress the republican caucus decided to pass it without amendment its avowed purpose is to place the financial question so far as the retirement of the greenbacks and the enlargement of the powers and privileges of the national banks are concerned beyond thereach of the next administration should it be democratic as they hope the goldstandard national bank influence will predominate the senate for the next four years fearing our success they determine to yield to the demand to pay the debt their party owes to themoneyed shylocks of wall street while they have the power if the people are susceptible to the teachings of great lessons if they hate extravagance if they cherish liberty and revere the principles of our revolution if they love humanity and humanitys rights then it is more than probable that they will intrust this government again in the hands of the democratic party at the next election the republicans in the last thirty years have not carried the country in any two successive presidential elections in this bill they attempt to deprive the people of the country of the natural fruits of the next democratic success there is one consolation in this measure to the american people and that is that the republican party has thrown off the mask which it has so frequently worn in the last few years upon this great financial question no longer can they pretend to be the friends of bimetallism heretofore when we charged them with hostility to silver they replied by proclaiming great love for it two years ago in this hall i charged that the republican party was bound soul and body to the gold standard the secretary of the treasury had already outlined the policy the president of the united states at the rich manufacturers banquet in new york city had foreshadowed it and notwithstanding all that there were many republicans in this country who honestly believed because they were misled that there was friendship in the republican party to silver and to genuine bimetallism they were misled because the republican platform of 1888 had denounced efforts to demonetize silver the republican platform of 1892 said that the american people from tradition and interest favored bimetallism in 1890 major mckinley now president of the united states had spoken strongly and clearly in favor of silver in this house he had voted for silver in 1896 the republican party in its national platform had again expressed friendliness to silver no longer can they pretend it the gold standard and especially the bondholding interests have at last induced the republican party to come out from the entanglements of duplicity and boldly take its position against the best interests of mankind on the great question of bimetallism and the governments surrender to corporations of its sovereign power to issue paper currency it has listened to the sirens song and turned deaf ears to the peoples needs who is it that has demanded this bill who is it that has sent his petition here for its passage who was it that met in the indianapolis convention in its behalf who was it that lent the caucus committee his influence it was not the cotton grower and it was not the laborer that worked in the cotton fields it was not the tobacco grower nor the laborer that worked in the tobacco fields it was not the wheat grower nor the laborer who worked in the wheat fields it was not the blacksmith it was not the wood workman it was not the carpenter nor the brick mason it was not the mill man nor the operatives that work in the mill none of these demanded it none of these ask it it was the trust magnate it was the great banker the great bondholder it was the great national shylock his influence was in the last republican convention his influence surrounds this bill he rejoices that he controls the party now in power what is this bill it is a repudiation of the stanley matthews resolution it is a repudiation of the policieg of blaine and garfield it is a reversal of a national policy it is intended to be the final death blow to silver it is intended to diminish the volume of standard money the great principle for which we contend is an increase in the volume of standard mbney a republican majority may strike this principle to the ground but when it touches the people antmuslike it will rise with greater power the gentleman from north carolina has said that the southern members ought tovote for this bill not only ought not the southern members to vote for it but they and the western members and all men who love right and justice throughout the country ought to vote against the bill and in favor of common justice between the creditor and debtor between the people and the bondholders mr mckinley in his letter of acceptance in 1896 of the presidential nomination when he was going before the people for votes used this language itthe republican partyhas inaugurated no new policy it will keep in circulation and as good as gold all the silver and paper money now included in the currency of the country that is the promise he made to the american people when he was after their support here is the demand he sent to congress in his last message in this connection i repeat my former recommendation that a portion of the gold holdings shall be placed in a trust fund from which greenbacks shall be redeemed upon presentation but when once redeemed shall not thereafter be paid out except for gold then he promised to keep them in circulation now he demands that they be impounded if it is to be paid out only for gold then it is dead as a greenback for it will be but a gold certificate and the circulation will be decreased one can get a gold certificate at any time for his gold he proposes not only to destroy the greenback but to do it in such manner as to mislead the unthinking let me call attention to the fact that in regard to the establishing of the gold standard the president in his message made two distinct recommendations but when considering the trusts which are drinking the lifeblood of the industry of the countrys best people he has no recommendation but merely expresses a few indefinite hopes the first section of the pending bill declares the gold dollar shall be the standard of value no longer does the other side attempt to deceive the people with internationalagreement propositions it is now going to as secretary gage said commit the country more thoroughly to the gold standard having in the last congress given an argument against the gold standard and in favor of the free and unlimited coinage of silver 1 have not the time now to repeat it but i shall endeavor to show that this bill is freighted with disaster and oppression to the great body of the american people i admit that its first section is practically law now and is one of the laws against which the great silver forces of the country are at war this bill is intended to more thoroughly fortify it but all the battlements that can be raised around it can not protect it against the power of a free peoples will when once their understanding is thoroughly informed and that will thoroughly determined against it the second section declares that all interestbearing obligations of the government now over 1 000 000 009 and all united states notes and treasury notes now about 440 000 000 shall be payable in gold coin all these are now payable in coin gold or silver by their very terms they are so payable written in the face of every government bond it is declared they are redeemable in coin of the standard value of the united states on july 14 1870 at which date the silver dollar was a standard coin this bill further provides that all other obligations public and private for the payment of money shall be performed in conformity with the standard established by the bill a reading of the bonds and then a reading of section 2 by a simple honestminded man unused to the financial world untrained in republican politics would shock his moral sensibilities the bond contracts say they are payable in coin gold or silver this bill says they shall be payable in gold only it has heretofore been estimated by goldstandard advocates i believe that having the simple word coin instead of gold in those bonds cost the government 60 000 000 in other words that from their sale the government received that amount less than it would have received if gold had been the payment money if that be true it becomes dishonest to afterwards write the word igold in those bonds when it cost the people 60 000 000 to leave it out if some f riend of the people were to suggest that the word coin be stricken out of those bonds and in its stead write the word greenbacks a shout of indignation would be heard in every money center in all the land if we were to propose to amend the law so as to make all those bonds payable in greenbacks charges of dishonesty and anarchy would fill the air between this capitol and wall street until we could no longer hear a humble mans petition in the matter as it would be wrong to change the contract and make them payable in greenbacks it is wrong to change it to make them payable in gold no law ought to be passed by congress that would impair the obligation of a contract in this respect this bill violates a constithtional principle under the constitution no state can pass a law impairing the obligation of a contract congress should not violate the principle it is as morally wrong for congress to impair the obligation of a contract as it is for a state to do so the federalist says that laws impairing the obligation of a contract are contrary to the first principles of the social compact and to every principle qf sound legislation for these reasons i denounce this measure as subversive of the common principles of public integrity which should be preserved for the interests of taxpayers and to prevent extortion in the interests of bondholders lawmakers should even be more jealous of the rights of the masses for they require and deserve more protection than the fortunate few i hope i am not a pessimist i hope that i am not inclined to look on the dark side of all matters but in this age of greed for gold when so many men of wealth and influence lend themselves to great undertakings whose moral principle is bad whose effects are injurious to the people when so many corruptions are charged upon men in high places and these corruptions so frequently proven to a moral certainty without serious effect upon their standing in the public estimation i sometimes think that public fidelity and loyalty to the inflexible and eternal right in all things is not of that high character which we attribute to the fathers of our republic representatives i fear coming into this gay and magnificent city listening to the glorious tales of a full treasury hearing the shoutings of prosperity often from trust quarters are prone to forget not only in what manner the treasury is filled and from what sources it derives its revenue but also the struggling man at home in his district who is striving to make an honest living by the sweat of his face if one can forget that man then i can easily understand how he can vote for this bill i can then understand how he can vote to change the countrys contract in favor of its creditors and against its people this bill confers on the secretary of the treasury the unusual power to sell bonds when he thinks it necessary to preserve the gold reserve such power should not be given to any one man congress has the power to borrow money and its judgment should be exercised upon the necessity of each and every loan it should not have and in my judgment has no rightful authority to delegate to the secretary of the treasury this general and practically unlimited power to sell bonds it is not necessary to intrust to him the extraordinary power to issue bonds in time of peace and i enter the protest of as good constituency as exists in this union against giving him the power to sell bonds to get gold to exchange for silver dollars in order to perpetually imprison those silver dollars the power to borrow money conferred by the constitution was intended to be aid should be used only in case of necessity as for instance to carry on a just war or to pay current expenses or other necessary expenses no good lawyer on the other side will deny this no man can successfully contend that it is a necessary expense to swap gold for silver dollars to borrow money for the purpose of killing or retiring the silver dollar is a wrongful use of power the silver dollar under the constitution is the equal of the gold dollar and it is contrary to principle and the interests of the people to load them with debt to get gold to destroy silver although at present it will take more than twice as much of any of the great agricultural products such as cotton wheat and tobacco to pay off one of the governments 1 000 bonds as it would have taken in 1873 when the first stab was given to the white metal yet a great purpose of this bill is to render that bond more valuable and the result of it will be to make it harder to pay and under this bill as that bond becomes harder to pay so will all other indebtednesspublic and privatebecome harder to pay all this is to be done for the benefit of a few wealthy moneylenders and it is done under the name of national honor the highest honor to which any government can attain is to treat its great masses with absolute fairness and justice the greatest shame to a government should be placed upon it by every intelligent man of honesty when it deliberately writes into its statutes laws which militate against its masses in the interest of a few which place heavier burdens upon its poor that it may gratify the demands of the rich section 4 is intended to kill the greenbacks the united states notes and treasury notes are to be redeemed in gold and there in the treasury held securely until someone wants to give the government gold for them as i have said they are practically destroyed for thereafter they can be used only as a gold certificate and whether they are in existence or not the government would give anyone a gold certificate for his gold just as is now done so this section in reality gives the death blow to 440 000 000 of paper money and when in the judgment of the secretary it is necessary gives him the power to sell 440 000 000 of gold bonds thus changing four hundred and forty millions of money which serves the people well which facilitates their exchanges which has built the churches and schoolhouses and homes of this land into an interestbearing debt to be paid by us and our posterity more than that under this bill the secretary of the treasury is authorized to sell gold bonds if he sees fit to do so and the occasion presents itself to the additional sum of 490 000 000 and with this money impound the 490 000 000 of silver dollars which have been coined thus altogether withdrawing from circulation more than 900 000 000 and adding to our public interestbearing indebtedness that vast sum these silver dollars if the secretary of the treasury should see fit may be transferred to the fiscal department and paid out and give him the opportunity of selling more bonds for gold with which to again redeem them and thus the endless chain will continue to exist under this bill not a dollar of silver should ever be redeemed it is money itself it needs no redemption it is an outrage on the rights of the people to treat it as a promise to pay but this bill gives the rightno not right for nothing can make it right but gives the powerto retire it how does that accord with the presidents letter of acceptance my observation has taught me that the republican party is the only party and its leaders the only leaders who boast of their inconsistencies it is the juggler who glories in deceiving his spectators and congratulates himself that his trick is performed in their full view i venture to say that the political history of the world can not discover another example of a party of equal changes upon great and fundamental questions within a quarter of a century as today ornaments the republican party if these vast powers are ever exercised by the secretaryof the treasury if these greenbacks and silver dollars are retired from circulation if this vast increase of the public indebtedness shall be made ruin and disaster will overtake the farms and factories of this land and the dread specter of panic will again visit the industries of our people the dollar under the increased demand for gold will go up and prices will go down and as hard times touch the great consumers of our country their terrible influence soon affects all who toil and all whose happiness depends upon industry of any kind the republican party hopes to avert the evils to which i have alluded by bestowing greater favors and privileges upon the national banks i admit that the banks may under this bill if they see fit increase their circulation as the greenbacks and silver dollars are retired and thus in a large measure prevent these evils but it is supreme folly for the congress which ought to hold the interests of the people at heart to surrender those interests to the mercies of those whose object is to make private profit from money traffic the government should not delegate the sovereign right to issue currency for the benefit of the people to any man or set of men whatever paper money the business of the country requires and it requires more than we now have should be issued by the government and i know of no form of currency better than the existing greenbacks i would make them full legal tender for all debts and dues if there is no escape from the national banking system if we are to forever endure its possession of special privileges then i see no objection to allowing the banks to issue notes to the par value of the bonds deposited and i think small towns should have the privilege of having national banks and i do not think that whether such banks should be established in small towns or not should be left to the discretion of the secretary of the treasury but such power as is given in this bill to the national banks has never before been bestowed upon them it is a dangerous powerthe power to expand and contract the currency at will it is a power such as no monarch has such as the president himself does not today have how easy it will be for thenational banks to form an immense bank trust nothing in this bill will prevent it and the republicans will not allow an amendment to it to prevent the formation of a gigantic trust to control all banks bow certainly will a few of the larger banks control the entire banking business of the country allow the banks as is the purpose of this bill to put out and control our paper currency and they can create a panic at a days notice let a president be in the chair whom they wish to destroy let a bill be proposed in congress which they oppose let any measure be pending which they desire to force through and in order to accomplish their purposes they can under organization and the possibilities afforded by this bill cause such a panic as the world has never felt the head man of the banking trust could touch a button and immediately the circulation from the remotest corners of our land would contract loans would be called in business would be paralyzed products would be sacrificed on the altar of debt and every evil known to the lack of money would curse the people until they and their representatives should either in suppliance yield to the demands of the banks or else their lion nature assert itself in the destruction of their oppressors my countrymen of the republican side let me appeal to you to grant no such possible powers and privileges to the banks you may be turning loose upon your country a power that may curse your children and which your older age may regret but may not remedy let our government issue more greenbacks let it and it alone issue our national paper money it will not decrease its circulation for profit it will not hold a terrible power over the people and their representatives to constrain their wills and violate their judgments the gentleman from ohio asked what prophecies we made in the last campaign had come true we predicted that if the republicans elected mckinley they would make the bonds payable in gold this was denied by republican orators today you are doing it we predicted that you would retire the greenbacks this was denied today you are doing it we admit however that it is most difficult to foretell the conduct of a party which changes its position upon great questions so easily the only means by which we foretold these two things were that we knew from what sources it drew its sustenance throughout this debate republicans have talked of maintaining the parity of the silver dollar with gold the standard silver dollar has never been below par and further our aper money which was full legal tender never went below par refer to the 60 000 000 of greenbacks or united states notes issued in 1 62 which were full legal tender for all debts our other paper money which was not legal tender for customs dues and interest on the public debt did go below par it is the legaltender quality of the silver dollar that keeps and will forever keep it to hundredcents point let it retain this legaltender quality keep your laws intended to disgrace it from your statute books and never will it be begging for help in order to remain a hundredcents dollar as long as it retains its life as money unshackled and unpoisoned by republican policies just so long will it bear the fearless goddess of liberty throughout the land to make homes happy and be at par wherever in all the wide world it goes strike the life out of it by law and it falls to the earth 50 cents worth of silver place the life back into it by law and it rises to the hundredcents value at once open the mints of the greatest country the world has ever known give all silver these great rights to bless mankind and all silver rises and then will be fulfilled that purpose set out in the republican national platform from which the president in his late message quotedthat is the maintenance of the parity of the values of the two metals not coins will be attained the parity of the two coins has been maintained and will forever be under our existing laws under free coinage the parity of the metals will exist now a few words about prosperity and i am done in the last presidential campaign our cry was for more money and the especial means we advocated was free coinage of silver our opponents and our goldstandard friends all said the country had plenty of money you could not get any goldstandard advocate to admit that the country did not have money enough and yet now republican speakers are daily speaking of the increased money in circulation the gentleman from iowa says under this administration our circulation has increased more than 300 000 000 and every republican says behold the proslerity of the land yes the money has increased the present conditions prove that we were right in demanding more money and if our mints during this time had been freely opened to both gold and silver our prosperity would today be unrivaled in all the branches of our industry yes our people are better off take the country altogether than they were two three or four years ago the almighty has blessed this land our people compelled by hard times have learned to depend more upon themselves and not so much upon the merchant for their supplies a war authorized by congress took tens of thousands of men into our army it caused the purchase of millions of goods it caused the expenditure of tens of millions of dollars it created a 200 000 000 debt on the people borrowed that money and placed it again in circulation the presidents war in the philippines continues these vast expenditures a war is prevailing in south africa between a free people and a european monarchy that such conditions as i have just recited bring a degree of prosperity for the time being is familiar knowledge it followed our civil war as such conditions are not permanent the prosperity they cause is not permanent it may be that if the republican party can have its way in their imperialistic desires it will see to it that the expenditures shall be sufficient to uphold the prosperity for several years they have an idea it seems that you can tax a people into prosperity they forget that the people are today groaning under war taxes under the stamp taxes under the tobacco taxes has it occurred to you that tobacco a great agricultural product is taxed probably to twice its value to the farmer that tax ought to be reduced it adds 12 cents per pound to the manufactured article this lessensthe demand for it reduce the tax greatly and the demand will be stronger for tobacco and a large mass of our agricultural people will be benefited and especially will this be true if the power of the american and continental tobacco companies to control the trade and prices of so much of that great crop can be destroyed i would be glad to think that we are in the course of a long era of prosperity nothing can more thoroughly gratify one who loves his country than to know that the toilers of the land the tillers of the soil the workmen in the shops and all artisans and all professional men are happy and prosperous to know that manufacturers and traders are prosperous and happy and on a sure foundation is a source of happiness to every patriot with genuine safe prosperity on an enduring foundation civilization and progress will go forward the humble citizen will educate his children he will help build his church and schoolhouse he will withal be independent and selfrespecting he will not be dissatisfied i know and it is with great pleasure that i am able to say it that the manufacturing industries of the south are almost universally prosperous usually it is a superior class of business men who are in that industry and they are situated in the most advantageous position in all the world to prophesy that for many years they will remain prosperous and in a few years control the cotton goods world is not a rash but a pleasant prediction but let no one think that the farmers of this land are enjoying the same degree of prosperity or that theirs is upon so sure a foundation the republican candidate in the next campaign will find little consolation in the rural districts in proclaiming prosperity in support of this bill here are some plain figures all taken from the monthly summary of commerce and finance of the treasury department a copy of which was sent to each member of this house today except the quotations for yesterdays prices which i take from todays paper cotton our great export crop was selling on the 6th day of november 1896 the week of mckinleys election in new york for 8j cents per pound yesterday december 12 1899 it was there selling for 7 1 cents per pound in other words today cotton is about onehalf cent lower now than it was when mckinley was elected on november 5 1896 wheat was selling for 86 cents per bushel on march 4 1897 the day of mckinleys inauguration wheat was selling for 94 cents per bushel yesterday wheat was selling for 74 cents per bushel in the same market so wheat was 20 cents a bushel more when mr mckinley became president than it is today in this summary i find no tobacco prices farther back than october 1898 the average domestic value of our export tobacco for that month was 10 cents per pound since then there has been a general decline in price so that the average price of export tobacco for october 1899 the last price given was only 8 cents per pound or a decline of 19 per cent in the last year and while i have been unable to verify my opinion by departmental statistics i think that since march 4 1897 when the republicans took charge of the government tobacco prices have declined so that tobacco is not worth as much to the carolina and virginia farmers as it was three years ago each tobacco farmer must be his own judge as to the relative price of tobacco now and in former years it is universally conceded that the tobacco grown in north carolina and virginiadoes not sell for more than half what it brought ten and fifteen years ago no doubt much of this decline is due to trusts of which i shall probably speak hereafter so much for prices of farmers products let me quote from the same high authority prices at wholesale on some articles for which farmers have to exchange their produce directly or indirectly many of these articles are controlled by trusts which fact no doubt in a large measure accounts for the great rise in their prices manila hemp and jute have under their administration increased more than 100 per cent manila was worth 4 cents per pound on march 4 1897 on november 27 1899 the last price given it was worth 14 cents per pound since mckinleys inauguration common leather has risen from 20 cents to 25 cents per pound rubber has in that time risen from 80 cents to 1 04 per pound iron and steel have doubled in price since mckinleys inauguration kerosene oil has risen in price from 6 cents per gallon to 9j cents sugar on march 4 1897 was 3 98 per 100 pounds on november 16 1899 the last date given in the summary sugar was 4 821 per 100 pounds tin plate has advanced since mckinleys inauguration from 3 75 to 4 87j nails have increased in price in the last twelve months from 1 90 to 2 60 such are some of the prices disclosed by the treasury statistics i give them that gentlemen may have their benefit in discussing prosperity they deserve the careful consideration of the country but i did not intend to talk so much of prices i rose for the purpose of giving my reasons in brief for considering this bill a dangerous one having done so i must content myself with voting against it"], [0.012713730335235596, 0.9872862696647644, 1, "in the five minutes allowed me i can hope to do little more than voice the protest of the good people who sent me here against both the matter and the manner of the legislation proposed in this bill denied the privilege of considering its provisions in committee denied the right of offering in its stead an alternative proposition denied even a knowledge of its propositions until it was sprung upon this house and with a debate limited by castiron rules which were forced upon us by a compact caucusruled majority we on this side of the house can hope sir to do no more than indignantly protest however unavailing that protest may be gagged in this way as we are gentlemen on that side complain of us when we complain charging us with useless consumption of time reminding me of the little fellow who called to his father pap come here and make bud behave himself every time i hit him on the head with the hammer he hollers the distinguished gentleman from ohio derisively asks what predictions made by the democrats in 1896 have been fulfilled i had the honor sir of being a democratic electoral candidate in 1896 and in an active canvass i daily charged that the republican party was hypocritical in its platform pretense of favoring bimetallism that any effort of a republican administration to secure international bimetallism would be perfunctory and for political effect only and that if successful in electing william mckinley president that party would in defiance of its pledges force the single gold standard upon the people of this country my republican opponents indignantly denied these charges as did my distinguished colleague who sits upon the other side of this chamber and as did the distinguished republican senator from north carolina neither of whom would be here today but for their professed friendliness to bimetallism our people were assured that the republican party was honestly in favor of bimetallism and that they differed from us only as to the best and safest manner of securing it in the light of subsequent events and particularly in the light of this proposed legislation i can unhesitatingly point to these fulfilled charges and predictions in answer to the gentleman from ohio why is this legislation demanded at this time why in this year intermediate between presidential elections when neither party declared in favor of a permanent single gold standard in the last presidential campaign both declaring on the contrary in favor of bimetallism and when an era of unparalleled prosperity is claimed by our friends on the other side when it is boasted that we are already under the gold standard with all its alleged blessings when the people of this great country at the very latest opportunity have declared in favor of bimetallism by the election of william mckinley upon a professedly bimetallic platformwhy i ask should the serenity of the politicofinancial atmosphere be disturbed at this time by the attempted passage of this revolutionary measure i may be mistaken but in my opinion sir it is largely because in the results of the recent elections in the reduced republican majority in this house the forces behind the republican party see the handwriting on the wall and realize that if this legislation is not forced at this juncture the opportunity may never again present itself to that party to write the single gold standard into the laws of our land but gentlemen in your eager haste to falsify your past pretensions in your willingness to stultify yourselves to do the bidding of past and prospective campaign contributors let me warn you that this bill which carries in its belly a whole catalogue of woes though it may be forced upon us here by unusual and revolutionary methods is yet to pass under the consideration of an intelligent and indignant people when they learn as learn they will that you have been false to your professions and platforms that you have covertly but effectually destroyed the greenback that you have added silver to the endless chain for withdrawing gold from the treasury that you have changed every contract now in existence or hereafter to be made public and private in favor of the creditor and against the debtor by writing the cruel word gold into it that you have abdicated the constitutional right of controlling the currency of this country to the sole control of the national banks that you have renounced the right of congress to control the issue of interestbearing bonds and conferred that supreme and dangerous power upon the secretary of the treasury that you have stricken down at one fell swoop 900 000 000 of legaltender money and made gold the sole money of payment in the united states leaving in circulation only gold and nationalbank notes my word for it a political revolution such as this country has never seen will sweep as with a besom of destruction from place and power the party which could dare to force this infamous legislation upon a deceived and outraged

words ibe it enacted etc and substitute the words the secretary of the treasury be and he is hereby directed to open at once the mints of this country to the free and unlimited coinage of both gold and silver at the existing ratio of 16 to 1 and then add a resolution to suppress the explosions of the gentleman from ohio and curtail the expansion of the gentleman from iowa taking them in re verse order let me say that the eloquence of the gentleman from iowa always rivets my attention and commands my admiration i find much to commend in his gestures he has expanded from the respectable white dollar to be seen in every mart to a disreputable mulatto standard to coin which is a penitentiary offense his eloquence on expansion reminds me of an old man in my town who was called on to explain expansion alounting a goods box he said this greatrepublican bird has plumed its wings and soared aloft and taken a view of this little world and then lit wth one foot on the asiatic shore the other on the golden walls of california has flopped its tail in the arctic ocean and pecked filipinos off of the island of luzon a bird with such a stride must split somewhere or lose its footing on the one

bridled his horse and put on the saddle he put the saddle on hind part before a bystander said mister youve got that saddle on wrong end foremost he looked at the meddler and said to him how do you know sir which way im going as for my friend from ohioi call him friend because he is so friendly in his disposition generallyhe has again exploded and he has deposited his explosive prosperity all over this country on 25cent corn 20cent oats and the farm products generally and the other farming interestsa kind of nervous prosperity he reminds me of a stammerer who seeing aman with a parrot walked up to him and said saay misisteter cacacan thathathathat pppparrot tawtawtawk prosprosprosperity well says the man if he couldnt talk better than you id kill him now no one would suppose that we had a great financial measure before us judging by the remarks of the two distinguished gentlemen but that we were again in the campaign of 1896 before i have anything to say on the pending bill let me remind them and this house of a few salient points respecting that great campaign the white people of this country are composed of the german swede irish jew italian and anglosaxon they are caucasianall americans the anglosaxon predominates and this race in this country is increasing with more certainty and with more rapidity than any other race on earth it is not subject to the causes or has not hitherto been which check the growth of races elsewhere such as war famine and pestilence its inventive genius has lessened the devastation and destrubtion of war commerce reenforced by steam and electricity and our own natural resources has made famine impossible and medical science has minimized pestilence and disease we are the largest part of this great race and in another century no people will rival the american people if we but tempt not providence too far this country is to be the great home of the white race the principal seat of his power the center of his life and influence our nation in what comprises wealth viz lands mines timber horses cattle sheep hogs merchandise railroads etc stands ahead of the world mulhall places our wealth at 82 000 000 000 the united kingdom coming next with 59 000 000 000 the english have grown great by attending to and interfering with the business of others while we have outstripped her by attending to oar own business where does the intelligence the cultivation the genius the industry the integrity of character the tenacity of purpose and the bone and sinew reside i say in the white man of the united states you admit this and now for the benefit of the statistician from ohio i desire to call his attention to the fact that william jennings bryan whom he belittles and whom the gentleman from iowa ridicules received just a little over 1 000 000 more of the votes of these great people than did william mckinley yea the chicago platform received the approval of 1 000 000 more of these white citizens than did your st louis platform and i am slow to believe that the people of this country who think for themselves will run away with their sound judgment in the glamor of a little cheap john prosperity cry from the gentleman and join in the slogan of the other side of this house now i am opposed to this bill and shall vote against it first because its banking feature is a delusion and a snare one not demanded by the country and one which was originated for the benefit of the few to the injury of the many second because i believe the gold standard in this country is iniquitous contrary to the constitution of our country and certain to curtail the circulating medium of the country and hence certain to bring misery and suffering to the masses of the laboring people especially to the conservative farming element of this land i am not opposed to banks sir they are as necessary as railroads they are beneficial to communities they should be encouraged a nation of enlightened and advanced ideas can not do without them the limited time at my disposal does not admit of a lengthy discussion of this feature of the measure and yet to do so briefly would be to leave it undone i may advert however to a few of the effects of the workings under this bill should it become a law unamended it is proposed to make national banks the only source of issue it might be well to recall the fact that the greatest bank that ever existed was the bank of venice which lived for three hundred years and never issued a note in making the national bank the only source of issue you not only deprive the government of the sovereign right to issue money but you destroy 346 000 000 of the legaltender money familiarly known as the greenback and the 150 000 000 treasury notes all money which our people love the government surrenders its prerogative which no sovereign can relinquish with safety banks of discount and deposit are blessings to a community where are the thousands of state banks which today can not issue a note where are the thousands of bankers who can not issue a note we are told that the note holder is made secure true but was not the holder of a greenback of a treasury note of a silver certificate of a silver dollar secure the national bank depo3its a government bond as security for the note holder is not the note of an individual banker as secure when a deposit is made for the security of the note holder of the individual banker and if so why should not an individual banker be entitled to 100 000 of currency if he deposits 100 000 united states bonds as an association of gentlemen when they deposit 100 000 united states bonds indeed sir if a poor widow and a frugal farmer have each a 1 000 united states bond and the one is pinched with poverty and wants money and the other needs money with which to replenish his stock why tell me should not both be permitted to deposit these bonds with the united states treasury and receive currencygreenbacks if you pleaseand be thus favored as well as an association of business men his bonds are as good as the bonds of an association the note holder of neither can lose and do not banking associations fail as often as individual bankers i notice that the comptrollers report shows that since 1865 387 national banks alone have failed that is not quite 1 a month for thirtyfour years or 11 every twelve months during thirtyfour years it is a wellknown fact that no such number of private or individual bankers failed in the same period it is true that 17 of these 387 were found solvent and were permitted to resume business the claims proved against the remaining 370 amounted to 127 002 895 an average of about 350 000 each all of which even if eventually paid in dividendswhich was not the casecrippled individuals and associations widows and orphans irretrievably but it was never all paid for a deficiency of 44 000 000 existed 236 of the 370 had been wound up 134 still undergoing the process of being wound up so we are led to inquire is this great concession to associations in banking desirable do the existing institutions invite or invoke it will it inure to the benefit of their customers will it inure to their own benefit in the nature of things this bill must of necessity contract the circulating medium let us suppose that it is determined to start a national bank in a town the capital stock to be 150 000 the whole circulating medium in the town is 150 000 150 000 is paid in on the capital stock the bank proposes to issue 100 000 currency by reason of the goldstandard enactment into law united states bonds have risen to 50 per cent premium the bank pays 150 000 for united states bonds deposits them with the treasury and gets 100 000 circulatingnotes the circulatingmediumis reduced to 100 000 or 33j per cent in this little town by the operation it has 100 000 nationalbank notes now its only circulation whereas before it had 150 000 the stockholder it is true will get 4 per cent on its bonds equal to 4 000 and say 6 per cent on its circulation equal to 6 000 a total of 10 000 while 6 per cent on the 150 000 alone would have yielded only 9 000 but would this be a benefiffefice to the people of that community is the question i remember well when united states bonds reached the point that circulation was so little profitable that banks with 1 000 000 capital issued only 45 000 currency no more than a national bank of 100 000 issued now we all remember that when president cleveland issued his last the 62 400 000 bonds he sent a message to congress requesting congress to have the word gold inserted stating that if this were done he could get 16 000 000 more for the issue an increase of 25 per cent congress refused by a majority vote on both sides of this hous6 this bill proposes to insert the word gold in all past present and future united states bonds if the word gold inserted when mr cleveland suggested it would have increased the selling price of bonds 25 per cent will not the passage of this bill have a like effect on all the bonds now unpaid if so can banks afford either to purchase bonds at 25 per cent advance over present prices or to hold those they have with 25 per cent dead capital in order to issue currency even at the face value if banks find that they can not afford to issue circulation of course they will not do so and hence banks with over 150 000 capital will issue only 50 000 and banks fnder to an amount onefourth of the amount of their capital and we will have bank circulation to an amount of about 895 000 000 all told a contraction which would of necessity bring to the point of failure many customers of the banks do all banks demand this law let us see what other banking interests there are in this country and compare their standing there are 3 583 national banks in the country there are 6 349 other banks in the country united states bonds owned by national banks 346 114 413 united states bonds

system of taxation may be an inducement to banks to invoke the passage of the bill for the comptroller as shown by the gentleman from kentucky demonstrates that the burden of taxation will be less but however advocates of banking systems may want banks of issue however profitable it may be is it for the best interest of our people for the government to surrender to them that which is claimed to be a good and profitable thing for them and yet deprive itself or the people of the same benefit if good for the corporation then why not good for the government the gentleman from minnesota to whom i always listen with great pleasure a gentleman whose courtesy in debate is equaled only by the force with which he presents his viewsi refer to the hon mr mcclierysaid that credit was an easier method of settlement than cash that the vehicle of credit was the note that if he owed a man 100 what law said he should forbid him to give his note if the creditor would accept it so if two three or more owed a debt who was there or what law ought to step in and forbid the three joining in a note and giving it and so analyzing further he said the issue of a national bank was nothing but the association loaning its credit now i quote him from memory and while i have not his exact words i state in effect what he said i would like to ask himbut he is not in his seatwhy if your proposition is sound and i believe it is should not state banks be allowed to issue their notes too for the same reason given by you you will not say because the united states must protect the citizens of a state from wildcatmoney you stultify your own proposition if you do you know that state banks can and would be organized with all the light before us that would issue as good money as any national bank could issue you know that thenationalbank system is modeled after the banks of louisiana as they existed before the war but you also know that were you to permit such an amendment to this bill that it would break the backbone of the gold trust and the agency of the monster would be powerless banking ought to be free no more impediment should be placed in its path than in the unobstructed course of the merchant the artisan the professional man by one stroke of the pen after next monday william mckinley will destroy not only the money of the constitution but the money made constitutionally a legal tender by the edict of the supreme court talk of endless chain there never can be a more complete one than the one forged by this bill even standard silver dollars are made redeemable in a standard the coinage of which is today under our laws a felony there is no gold dollar known to our laws of coinage that banks are a benefit to us no one can deny that i make no war on them is my purpose not to conceal that they should have every encouragement and that the law should be so framed that humble individuals in the smallest villages should have the mantle of such benefits thrown over them by the agency of their own people in such associations as theymay deem proper regulated by wholesome laws i contend is right but to organize a giant monopoly by the government farming out its financial prerogative to a few giant institutions in a few of the large cities of this country is not only a dangerous experiment but one the exercise of whose power will shake the very foundation of our republic but even this power dwindles into insignificance when we contemplate the misery in store for the millions of our people when once the inexorable gold standard is fixed on us no country in the world has ever had such a drastic measure as the one contained in this bill and the only hope is that the people will rise up and demand its obliteration who is to suffer from the gold standard is it right that the bonds of the united states the debts of the people should be by legislation increased in value 25 per cent at one fell swoop is it honest is it just can such things be here lies old thirtythree per cent the more he got the more he lent the more he lent the more he craved good lord can such a soul be saved so it will be said of the republican congress of 18991900 the honorable gentleman from minnesota whose speech in reply to the hon charles a towne in the fiftyfourth congress was an effort worthy of his high standing and came nearer answering the incomparable argument of his great colleague than any speech on the republican side in that splendid debate is lacking i think in candor when he attempts to show that thomas jefferson was in favor of the gold standard because as he claims he stopped the coinage of the silver dollar he says not a single silver dollar was coined from 1805 tohis speech has not yet been put in printa certain time say 1834 i think i quote him correctly now to illustrate the want of frankness of the foremost advocate of the gold standard on the republican side i want to say that the bible says there is no god and i announce a truth indisputable as far as it goes just as his assertion is true thus limited but how uncandid do i appear when called to task and i say i omitted the context and should have said the fool in his heart hath said there is no god now i asked him was it not a fact that there never was a single gold dollar coined till 1849 he admitted this was true the inevitable inference from his assertion was that no legaltender silver was issued from 1805 to 1834 the inevitable inference followed from my question was that no legaltender gold was issued till 1849 both statements left out the fool in his heart hath said etc now what are the facts that from 1805 up to 1853 all the silver coined was legal tender but it did not happen to be in dollar pieces and all the gold coined up to the same time was legal tender but did not happen to be in dollar pieces and up to 1873 as much legaltender silver had been coined as legaltender gold i deny that jefferson stopped the coinage of legaltender silver and my friend knows that he did not but i pass on who are to be affected by this great wrong we are living in an age of mortgages why should the plow and the hoe be emblems of poverty my answer is mortgages why should the laboring man bow to the whim of the plutocrat because of mortgages why should the mechanic build the great edifice and live in a hut he is mortgaged why should the artisan build the carriages and go afoot he is mortgaged why should the miner delve in the mines and unearth the coal while his children shiver in the cold he is mortgaged why should the machinist erect the electric light and go to bed with a kerosene lamp he is mortgaged why should the builder construct the splendid organs and church edifices and go to an humble meeting house he is mortgaged the pick of the railroad laborer the tools of the carpenter the engine the cars the carriages the horses the farm the cabin and the huts are mortgaged will the gold standard help them the palace and incomes of the princes only are free the latest statistics that i can find show in the united states number of farms mortgaged 4 747 078 amount borrowed 4 896 771 112 number of acres so mortgaged 581 054 962 on lots number of mortgages 4 770 669 amount borrowed 7 198 106 681 number of lots so mortgaged 8 027 031 the total acreage of farm lands 623 218 619 this does not include railroad mortgages as you will see nor other semipublic mortgages as i may term them these will no doubt double the mortgages referred to now while our friends are boasting of prosperity i wish to invite their attention to the fact that whatever there may be of it it is all on borrowed money for we are told that we have some 2 000 000 000 in circulating medium in this country even if true which i neither believe nor admit it is every dollar borrowed not only do we owe it as a nation but wipe out all national state and corporation indebtedness and we have standing against farm lands alone double the amount of the alleged circulating medium and including mortgages on other lands five times the amount what does this mean does it not mean that the time is coming when the klondike and our own mines will fail to supply our wants measured by gold and does it not mean that our mountains swelling almost to bursting with the white metal must and will be utilized what if we have 400 000 000 more gold now than we had in 1896 what if this did produce prosperity has not the democratic party always contended for volume of money has it not always and was not that its slogan in 1806 demanded more money has not the republican party always claimed that there was a sufficiency and that low prices were an evidence of prosperityan evidence of sound finance and yet now do they not claim that more money has produced more prosperity what if 385 000 000 additional gold has produced some prosperity would not an addition in three years of 150 000 000 of silver dollars only have added to this prosperity the leaves of memory served to make a mournful rustling in the dark ways of republican finance the republican leaders the great men in the ranks have repudiated all such measures as this bill mr mckinley did it when a member of congress he did it when he accepted the nomination on the st louis platform he did it when he sent a commission to europe to secure international agreement there must be awful memories as the light of bygone days flashed from the graves of your great men take heed to yourselves my republican friends that your hearts be not deceived and go turn aside and serve other gods and worship them in the language of ezekiel i have given you up to the delusions of your own heart and justly left you to your own blindness that you shall not discern your own selfdeceivings you are perpetrating a wrong on your country that is now without remedy it will be corrected in time and that in the no distant future but i am one whom you have not deceived i began my service in congress by sounding the danger signal and i have kept it up without intermission and now that this bill marks the clinax of republican treachery to the people of this country i may feel at least some satisfaction in having attempted to avert this disaster in 1895 i published the following circular and sent it out to our people thousands of them were returned to me and the signatures to them were numbered by thousands and there is no surprise in my state at the exhibition of deception on the part of the republican party as evidenced by this bill the undersigned deprecating the combination of the money power of this country and england with the republican party to enforce the single gold standard and to further contract the currency believing that we voice the sentiments of the democratic party of the great west and south hereby declare i that we demand the free coinage of silver at the existing ratio of 16 to 1 if we oppose the efforts of this combination1 to retire the 347 0ow 000 legaltender notes greenbacks 2 to retire the 152 000 000 treasury notes issued under the sherman bill 3 to issue in their stead 5000 00 000 gold interestbearing bonds as an additional and unnecessary burden on our already overburdened taxpayers and especially iniquitous as against the best interests of the agricultural indust ry of our country 4 to destroy the existing volume of silver money by restricting it to a mere subsidiary or token money stripped of its legaltender functions ii that this combination conceals its determination to contract the currency by retiring 500 000 000 greenbacks and treasury notes in which if successful then to retire the 400 000 000 silver dollars and to prevent any further increase of currency by a continuance of the 10 per cent tax on state banks thus leaving the country with gold and nationalbank notes as the money of the realm and the only circulating media and we believe that the success of such action will cause a further reduction in prices and wages prove disastrous to our industrial interests and precipitate another panic the like of which this country has never experienced the currency or house bill no 1 completes the crimes charged in this indictment in 1895 i believed it was the purpose of the republican party to do just what this bill provides so i then predicted and so it is decreed no amendments will be permitted it must go through just as a solid shot examine the bill compare it with this circular and it will be seen that the bill provides virtually in the language of this circular that gold and nationalbank notes are to be the only money of the realm and that bonds are to be issued principal and interest payable in gold gold i gold but again is this country ready for contraction of the currency can even the republicans stand this we know that plutocrats are their masters and trusts are their prot6ges that expansion is their allurement and imperialism their poem but what of contraction to take out of circulation 346 000 000 of greenbacks money that all people want and that the supreme court said was good as the best to retire the treasury notes 157 000 000 redeem the silver dollars 500 000 000 is the country ready for this they will recall that there were twenty presidents beginning with george washington down to grover cleveland every one of whom was opposed to the singlegold standard they will recall that not a single illustrious man that this country has produced has advocated the single gold standard there was not one of them who did not believe in bimetallism and the free coinage of gold and silver not one who did not conform to our constitution which provides that congress shall have power to coin money and regulate the value thereof and that no state shall make anything but gold and silver coin a legal tender not one who did not believe that the power to tax was the power to destroy and hence opposed to discrimination in favor of gigantictrusts and corporations of which the gold trust now to be inaugurated in the beginning of the twentieth century is the most gigantic and dangerous of all not one of them who was not the friend of him who follows the plow and hoes the hill and ever endeavored to lift him up and not press him down you tell us of prosperity where is it do you find it in the humble home your eyes are fixed not on the hut but on the palace not on the laboring man but qn the banker not on the pinched and careworn face of the toiling mother with her hungry children but on the queens of society and the gifts of royalty a war was thrust upon us armies had to be fed armies had to be transported and clothed speculation became rife the great trusts took charge of william mckinley body and soul and of the government idle labor was employed money hitherto locked up was turned loose the great cotton fields of the south the grain of the farmers of the west the products of the fields were ut in motion and the agricultural exports brought in a golden axvest of tradebalance 385 000 000 added to our money spindles had to be started furnaces went into blast iron advanced more money was the mainspring that started the wheels of industry then sporadic prosperity ensued is it fait accompli for all time god grant that it is but must it be said that the cruel monster war accomplished that which thirty years of profound peace and abundant harvest failed to accomplish must we resort to war to produce prosperity when peaceable means are always within our grasp if we use those means which a kind providence has given us god forbid must we measure the flow of human blood by dollars and cents are you prepared to be anglicised is all this simply to be an ally of england it tends that way is our great farming interest to be sacrificed to the greed of conquest where is englands boasted agricultural interest of 1800 where the thrift of her farmer of 1816 when the gold standard was fastened partially on her people gone where the woodbine twineth in the language of a new york banker with the romans agriculture was the fundamental idea a tract of land was allotted to each citizen senator curias said i am not counted a good citizen but rather a dangerous one to the state because i can not content myself with 5 acres of land cato distinguished orator general and statesman was loudly commended for having written a book on farming the senate ordered the 28 books on agriculture of mago to be translated into latin for the use of the roman farmers and so in other nations of the world the farmers interest was considered and protected and yet in the congress of the united states he is forgotten neglectedaye despised the business man of the bank counter the industrial head of the trust is honored and worshiped the superstructure must be erected while the foundation is neglected can such an edifice stand it is not the per capita of circulation that tells the tale of the needs of a nation but it is the proportion of circulation to wealth and we must note the distinction between wealth and money what matters it about circulation in a country barren of wealth the per capita of 100 would matter little with no wealth to move on the other hand what matters wealth without an abundant medium of exchange we find from mulhall that our wealth is 82 000 000 000 on this basis we have in this most progressive and the wealthiest of all nations 1 of circulation to 40 of wealth in france 20 in england 15 now let us suppose our circulation was distributed here is a farmer whose farm is worth 10 000 this is his wealthhis proportion of the 82 000 000 000 what would his proportion of the circulation be if 40 wealth gives 1 circulation how much ought 10 000 be entitled to two hundred and fifty dollars to run a farm worth 10 000 he must make a start and he must borrow if thecirculatina medium was 1 for every 20 of wealth he could borrow 500 with as much ease and at the same cost as he could 250 when wealthwas 40 to 1 if the circulation was one dollar for every ten of wealth he could borrow 1 000 as easily as he could 250 under existing conditions four billion dollars of circulation today would about put us onapar with france if we had 5 000 000 000 we should be about on a par with england and when we remember that our circulation is congested in the cities and manufacturing districts how much more unjust to the farmer is our contraction of the currency if the bill goes into effect our circulating medium will be only 1 to every 80 of wealth and the pinching will be renewed the people of this great country are to silently submit to such nefarious schemes to advance the interests of trusts and there is a death struggle going on trusts will conquer the people and their manhood will be assassinated and their liberties will be gone or the people will kill and conquer the trusts which will it be it is for the intelligent industrious and courageous white american citizen to say at the ballot box which will they choose why should we model after england why should we not without waiting for precedent not only command the gold but the silver of our country to do duty we can pay with commodities every demand from foreign countries we have 70 000 000 people 8 600 000 square miles of territory on which the sun never sets for as it rises in maine its golden rays are just dying out in the twilight of alaska our trade between the states is greater than the whole foreign trade of great britain and this is free trade too and we need all the silver as well as gold of our own mines to continue our development and trade yet in their infancy texas at the one extreme the largest of our states an empire in itself would make 212 states the size of rhode island the smallest of our commonwealths rhode island wants the single gold standard texas wants bimetallism in the senate rhode island neutralizes the vote of this great empire of the south within whose confines the new england borough might be lost beyond the hope of discovery the cotton of the south the grain of the west furnish the balance of trade that gives the trade balance the gold on which the alleged prosperity so generally diffused is based yet these great producers of the south and west appeal in vain for the money guaranteed them by the constitution while new england and the trusts hold the conscience of the imperial power of a once free republic and decree goldl gold gold every man woman and child in the world could settle in texas and have each a lot 50 by 100 feet and not be crowded as much as new york city and she can raise all the food products and cotton needed in the world we have about as many miles of railroads as the rest of the world combined one of which alone transfers more tonnage annually than all the ships of england the tracks of our railroads if laid parallel would encircle the world seven times and trains run over them every year traverse a distance four times the distance from our earth to the moon onefourth of our area is still in virgin forests and our annual cut of lumber if measured in dollars is more than all the gold silver coal iron copper lead and zincmined in the united states and yet we are ahead in mining from 194 000 acres of coal lands we produce onethird of all the worlds output the product of 1898 would have taken a bin to hold it which would have measured 10 feet by 45

of that of all nations it is onefifth of our national wealth and yet stifled by financial legislation our boast has been that the classes in other nations rule the masses that in other nations the peasant is the slave of the landlord the mechanic and laborer are the tools of the taskmaster that both are shut out from aspirations no future lies before them but dependence or want but that heremy

congress i introduced a bill to repeal this law for two sound reasonsone that the government did not then need the money the other that the tax was unequal on the people taking the money out of their pockets and storing it in the vaults of the national banks of the country now the same reasons exist today that did then why the law should be repealed no just government will burden the people with high taxes thereby diverting the money from its real proper channels and ownership to concentrated centers and unnecessary requirements and demands the republican administration will say that this tax money is not taken from the people or from the channels of commerce as under the law it is deposited in the national banks and thereby kept in the ruts of trade and circulation but that is unfair and unjust to have the money of the people taken from them under the guise of taxation and then loaned back to them through the medium of bapks that charge interest on the peoples own money i admit this is good for the banks but on the other hand it is an outrage on the people who pay the taxes the secretary of the treasury reports today that we have on hand about 300 000 000 now half of this amount about 150 000 030 is deposited in the national banks of the country for which they pay no interest this revenue law was passed hurriedly to pay part of the expenses of the war declared against spain for the liberty of cuba that war has been fought and won it is past history then let us at once strike this obnoxious war tax from the statute books and let it be also past history now come out and relieve the people of this burden it is always the right time to do the right thing your request that the committee on ways and means be allowed to sit and take up this question during the coming vacation is an admission on your part that the matter needs attention but you think this promise of relief will tide you over until after the presidential election next fall will satisfy the people and so help to continue republican rule it does seem to me after reviewing the work of congress for the last three or four years that the republican party has the greatest tact for making promises to the country and letting them sleep ever afterwards or fulfilling them only when forced to do so that they may reap political advantage thereby let me ask what practical legislation the republican party has enacted in the fiftyfifth and fiftysixth congresses that they so boastingly claim has brought the country around to prosperity you did increase the tariff tax thereby stimulating and formulating the various trusts that affiict the country the dingley tariff lav did no good for the reason that our exports to the very countries against which the protective tariff was leveled have grown to large proportions thereby showing that this country has become great as an exporting country and thatinstead of barring out trade we must seek to extend our commerce to all parts of the world and now adopting the same tactics as you did at the last session of congress just prior to the elections you have enacted moneyed legislation that i say was not in accord with the platform on which president mckinley was elected with that you stop instead of enacting wholesome legislation that would be beneficial to the country you refuse consideration of all practical measures and consume the time and money of the country in passing sham resolutions which are strangers to sincerity just on the eve of the elections you are rushing through the house resolutions which you hope will catch the labor vote we are advised that you will in a few days rush through the house a resolution against trusts which you know wil never be enadted into effective law but all is done for the sole purpose of catching votes in the coming election why not do something that is of real practical benefit to and for the good of the people why not relieve them of this oppressive stamptaxact when we do not need the money arising from it why is it that the senate will not pass the nicaragua canal bill which legislation is so greatly desired by all the people unless it be the great transcontinental railroad corporations why have you failed to pass a bill giving the country public buildings why have you failed to pass a bill appropriating money to open up the rivers of the country and thereby build up and foster commerce you are not giving the people what they need nor are you willing to reduce their taxes where does the money arising from this unnecessary tax go i will tell you to continue a useless and uncalledfor war to keep up the extravagance of a republican administration of the affairs of the country and according to the statement of the secretary of the treasury some thirty million dollars have been used in exchange for refunding bonds and from twentyfive to thirty million dollars additional will be used this year for the same purpose who gets this money largely the national banks who are the bondholders the national banks who pays the war taxes the people where is this tax money deposited with these national banks the thinking people will not accept your promise to consider this important question of reducing the war tax in vacation after the presidential election but will want to know why you do not now while this congress is in session take up the question consider it and reduce the taxes if it can be done they will at the fall elections refute your promises and hold you responsible for your failure to enact this just legislation in this hour of their need and when you have the power to give them relief"], [0.016037046909332275, 0.9839629530906677, 1, "i thank my friend i have those authorities with my remarks the gentlemen of the majority as i understand them admit

enact any laws in these territories that may suit its will and pleasure i understand from them that they believe that no restriction fundamental or otherwise is put upon congress in legislating for these territories except the prohibition of slavery i understand from them that we can tax the people in these islands as much or as little as we please that we are not called upon or required to give them representation before we tax them that their consent is not necessary to any government we may choose to put upon them or to any laws that we may determine to enact for them as i understand further the position of the gentlemen of the majority of the committee they hold that the inhabitants of these islands can not be interfered with in the free exercise of their religion because the treaty with spain provides that this shall not be done but that they hold that the treaty not providing to the contrary congress is not bound by the limitations on its power fixed in the constitution i therefore understand that if the position of these gentlemen be correct congress may in time of peace suspend the writ of habeas corpus in these islands may pass bills of attainder and ex post facto laws may infringe the right to keep and bear arms may quarter soldiers in time of peace in any home without consulting the owner may institute unreasonable searches and seizures of the people and their houses and issue warrants without probable cause and without oath or affirmation and may deny the right of trial by jury it is enough to shock the moral conscience to know that in this day of enlightenment when we believe the principles of free government to be better understood than they have ever been before gentlemen claiming allegiance to a free government should assert the right and power of this congress to thus rule and govern a people who form a part of the united states and over whom float the stars and stripes which such people are expected to love and to reverence if we carry this position to a further conclusion we find that the constitution prohibits the granting of titles of nobility by the united states but if the constitution does not apply to puerto rico or the philippines and if the power of congress is plenary in dealing with these islands what is to hinder congress from enthroning a king upon these islands and creating the right of succession and providing for lords and dukes and all the court machinery necessary to create an ideal monarchy could anything be more repellant to the american mind is not the mere statement of the possibility of such a thing a sufficient argument itself against the proposition that is insisted upon i would beg to suggest that the argument of the majority of the committee that the constitution is for the states alone is not new it was first suggested by those who opposed the accession of louisiana these gentlemen were given to quoting the preamble to the constitution beginning we the people of the united states and saying it is we the people of the united states for ourselves and ourposterity not for the people of new orleans or of canada none of these enter into the scope of the instrument and yet those who in their day opposed the annexation of louisiana because they believed there was no warrant or authority under the constitution for it were overruled and louisiana was annexed those today who oppose the annexation of the philippines are pointed to this past history as an answer to their objections the answer however does not appear to be all that is claimed for it for we are now told that the opponents to the annexation of louisiana were wrong that the constitution provided for it and yet we are also told that this same constitution although providing for annexation does not provide that its sheltering protection shall extend over the territory annexed it would thus appear that we are involved in the unfortunate predicament where we must either deny the constitution in order to annex or deny it after annexation in order to govern it seems to be simply a question of where we will deny it for somewhere we must lay it aside or our schemes can not go through it seems to be a sorry dilemma in which we find ourselves no matter which way we turn in attempting to pass this bill the grievances of the american colonies are pushed into the background and forgotten we are asked to steel our hearts and close our ears to the remonstrances of our forefathers that through the cycles of time have ever rung in the ears of american patriots and that until now we have ever believed would ring in all the ages to come rapplause how soon are we asked to forget that it was a protest against taxation without representation and not a thirst for liberty that first provoked the revolutionary war how soon are we asked to forget those ringing and one time thought never to be forgotten words of the brave virginians of old when they declared no power on earth has a right to impose taxes on the people or take the smallest portion of their property without their consent given by their representatives this principle the virginians said is the chief pillar of the constitution without which no man can be said to have the least shadow of liberty since no man could be truly said to possess anything if other men could lawfully take away any portion of it i have no desire or intention to enter into a discussion of the legal authorities bearing on this question and shall refer to but few of them they have been so ably presented that there is nothing left for me to say in reference to them the constitution provides that all duties imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the united states it also provides that no tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any state it also provides that no preference shall be given by any regulation of commerce or revenue to the ports of one state over those of another nor shall vessels bound to or from one state be obliged to enter clear or pay duties in another these provisions of the constitution it seems to me are sufficiently clear in their meaning as to absolutely prohibit the passage of this bill i think the language used is too plain to admit of construction but if any is needed in my judgment the opinion of justice marshall in 5 wheaton 317 is all that is necessary in this case in construing the first provision of the constitution i have quoted he says the power then to lay and collect duties imposts and excises may be exercised and must be exercisedthroughout the united states does this term desigate the whole or any particular portion of the american empire certainly this question can admit of but one answer it is the name given to our great republic which is composed of states and territories the district of columbia or the territories west of the missouri is not less within the united states than maryland or pennsylvania and it is not less necessary on the principle of our constitution that uniformity in the imposition of imposts duties and excises shall be observed in the one than in the other in addition to this i would also cite the striking language employed by the supreme court in the dred scott decision in 19 howard 432 gentlemen may call this language a dictum or what not but none of them will ever successfully reply to the great truth that it so clearly states there is certainly no power given by the constitution to the federal government to establish or maintain colonies bordering on the united states or at a distance to be ruled and governed at its own pleasure nor to enlarge its territorial limits in any way except by the admission of new states that power is plainly given and if a new state is admitted it needs no further legislation by congress because the constitution itself defines the relative rights and powers and duties of the state and the citizens of the state and the federal government but no power is given to acquire a territory to be held and governed permanently in that character the power to expand the territory of the united states by the admission of new states is plainly given and in the construction of this power by all the departments of the government it has been held to authorize the acquisition of a territory not fit for admission at the time but to be admitted as soon as its population would entitle it to admission it is acquired to become a state and not be held as a colony and governed by congress with absolute authority this bill is squarely in conflict with two provisions of the constitution puerto rico being a part of the united states a duty upon articles imported into the states from puerto rico violates the uniformity of duties that the constitution says must exist throughout the united states in the next place the bill in proposing a duty at puerto rico on all goods imported from the states into puerto rico not only violates the principle of uniformity but further violates that other provision of the constitution that no tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any state for it can not be denied that this duty although collected in puerto rico is in fact an export duty on the goods sent out from any state all the ingenuity and all the sophistry of our friends on the other side can not refute a proposition that is as plain and manifest as this it is an interesting fact that when the ways and means committee first undertook an investigation of this subject they were not sure as to the meaning of the term the united states as found in the constitution and they appointed a subcommittee to make research and advise the full committee as to the exact meaning of this term as a result of this research the committee reached the conclusion that the term the united states does not include territories and they presented a most elaborate argument to sustain their conclusions and to further establish the proposition that the power of congress in legislating for the tertories is plenary now plenary means i full in all respects or requisites entire and complete and it seems to me that if the power of congress be plenary all discussion as to what the constitution means is superfluous so far as this question is concerned if the constitution does not extend to puerto rico and if the limitations prescribed in it are not binding upon congress in legislating for puerto rico of what interest is it to know what the term the united states means or of what necessity is it to construe the constitution at all i beg further to say that in my opinion all the authorities and all the precedents cited by those who uphold this bill are in vain they are not precedents they do not apply they do not present parallel cases because i submit that never before in the history of the congress has it ever been attempted to legislate for any people for whom there did not exist by treaty or declaration somewhere made an intention upon the part of the united states to incorporate these people into citizenship and statehood i realize the predicament of our friends upon the other side who favor this bill against their duty to obey the constitution comes the desire not to antagonize the agricultural or industrial or labor interests of this country by admitting free of duty the products of the several islands annexed and neither do they wish to antagonize any of these interests by removing all restrictions upon immigration from these islands the predicament in which they find themselves is serious upon the one side is the constitution and the rights of the puerto rican people now and the rights of all our other islands in the future none of which can vote upon the other side are american interests each one controlling votes i would not charge that the latter side have prevailed in the deliberations of the gentlemen of the committee because of their power but reading the present in the light of the past i am not surprised that they have done so i do not know and do not charge that such considerations have controlled the committee in thus departing from the constitution and fron the lead of the president whom they have been so blindly following throughout the discussion of these new questions and yet it is an interesting thing to note the report of the ways and mleans committee recommending this puerto rican tariff and then to note the recommendation of the president in his last annual message when he said our plain duty is to abolish all customs tariffs between the united states and puerto rico and give her products free access to our market and also to note the recommendation of the secretary of war who says i wish most strongly to urge that the customs duties between puerto rico and the united states be removed we note these things and wonder why the departure i am not unmindful that there are interests and perhaps large interests of this country that will be affected and possibly seriously affected by free trade between the united states and the islands recently acquired i would avoid such injury if i could but in my judgment if the american people make up their minds to hold these islands as a part of the united states they must likewise reach the conclusion to endure whatever hardships are thereby entailed i do not believe that we of the congress can keep unsullied the great trust reposed in us and shut up the constitution to protect any interest that now or hereafter may flourish in the united states so far as puerto rico is concerned no substantial injury could come to american industries by free trade with it the island is only about 40 miles wide and 80 miles long and all that it could produce would be but a small fraction of the production of this country the trouble with the gentlemen of the committee is not free trade with puerto rico it is free sugar from cuba and the philippines that they fear they are afraid of the precedent that free trade with puerto rico would establish and so with this fear which is a fear of the protected sugar barons they turn down the constitution and turn a deaf ear to the appeals of puerto rico for relief and propose this bill aside from all constitutional questions the bill should not pass because of its injustice to the puerto ricans they are entitled to our markets for we by our act have shut them out from all others the merchants association of new york city have investigated this question and they have declared for free trade with puerto rico in order that we may keep faith with its inhabitants and do but simple justice to them they quote approvingly from mr william r corwine whom their association sent to puerto rico to investigate trade conditions there mr corwine said place the inhabitants in the position where their trade can be extended and all will be well but if this policy which contracts trade and increases pauperism continues the questions which in prosperity would become minor ones will grow in importance and instead of a feeling of contentment which makes government easy a spirit of discontent will arise which may render governmenthard the spaniards ruled by force we can rule through the affections of the people shortened purses and empty stomachs however are not the bases upon which affection thrives as illustrating the distressing conditions which prevail in puerto ricoconditions that demand liberal treatment from us that demand free trade justice and equalityi quote a late dispatch that appeared in the associated press items san juan puerto rico february 17 1900 several of the largest merchants of san juan upon being interviewed unanimously expressed the opinion that immediate congressional action is absolutely essential to the interests of the island they say that the crops are immovable the proposed duty under the foraker bill on sugar and tobacco being prohibitive there are now 3 300 000 pounds of tobacco ready for shipment and by august there will be 5 000 000 pounds the best price obtainable for tobacco in now york under the halfdollar duty is about 1 85 there has been a small coffee crop owing to the hurricane and sugar can not pay the duty imposed the planters holding their products and awaiting tale action of congress there is no money toplant now cros or to naylaborers thousands of whom are on the point of starvation being unable to obtain work the estates are idle and bankers refuse to advance funds on account of the extension of mortgager the planters are desperate and the people discouraged and they demand absolute free trade and authority for the island to contract a loan to pay immediate expenses and for the relief of the planters the local press expresses the opinion that the conditions of the island were better during the darkest days of the spanish rdgime the foraker bill would be acceptable without the duty the merchants being willing to pay a revenue tax in lieu of the tariff which would relieve the planters undoubtedly if we are going to permanently retain the philippines we should so declare and should promptly make amends for the failure of the treaty to provide for their admission to statehood by solemnly declaring here that statehood will be given them when they are ready for it and yet i do not believe that this will be done for so far as i have ever read or heard there is no one in all this broad land who believes that these islands will ever become states in the union or who desires that they should so become the character the habits the interests and the civilization of the people inhabiting them are such that our anglosaxon civilization or better still our american civilization would never consent that these people should have equal voice and equal power with us in the management of our own affairs they are too far removed from us also for community of interest and action to ever exist between them and us it is manifest that those who brought about their annexation had no thought or purpose of making them citizens of the united states because in violation of all precedents in the treatymaking history of this government those who negotiated the treaty did not incorporate therein any provision looking to statehood for the islands or citizenship for their inhabitants gentlemen of the other side and as well those elsewhere who favor the permanent retention of the philippine islands are free to quote precedents and to say that they are but following in the tracks marked out by our forefathers in the beginning of this republic i wish to take issue with this position as i have already pointed out there is no parallel in all our past history to the proposition now pending to permanently retain the philippine islands without any declaration of intention to ever accord them statehood the parallel between the present case and our past history also fails in that all our past annexations have been in the main annexations of territory and not of people the annexation of the louisiana territory is most frequently cited as justifying the annexation of the philippines i wish to call attention to the fact that at the time of the annexation of louisiana that aside from the constitutional questions that were raised and to which i have already adverted the burning question at that time was the fear that this great territory after it became populated would become allpowerful in the union and would dominate the government to the exclusion of the east certainly no such question exists now as to the philippines texas was objected to among other grounds because it was claimed that its annexation was but a scheme to extend the slaveholding territory and increase the strength of the slaveholding states this objection might be somewhat pertinent now in the light of the treaty our government has consummated with the sultan of sulu by which treaty the united states not only agrees not to interfere with but to protect the people of the sultan in the free exercise of their religion and customs social and domestic which customs include slavery but also as an evidence of the good faith of this government in so agreeing general otis offered a present to the sultan and datos of 10 000 mexican money and agreed to regularly supply sums of money thereafter in accordance with the previous agreement of spain in reference to the louisiana purchase i would call attention to the fact that notwithstanding the assaults that were leveled at jefferson that great statesman before he ever treated with france for a cession of the louisiana territory transmitted to the congress on december 15 1802 his message calling attention to the cession of the spanish province of louisiana to france and again on january 11 1803 he transmitted his message to the senate nominating a minister plenipotentiary and a minister extraordinary and plenipotentiary to treat with both france and if necessary spain in reference to obtaining a cession of this territory it thus appears that his purpose whether held to be wise or unwise was not concealed in his own bosom the same was communicated to the lawmaking power and both the lawmaking and the treatymaking power of this government were in his full confidence in the very incipiency of the negotiations for this cession does that parallel exist in our negotiations for the philippines i would also remind our friends on the other side that jefferson convened the congress in extraordinary session on october 17 1803 after the treaty of cession was agreed upon and in his message to congress on that day used this american language with the wisdom of congress it will rest to take those ulterior measures which may be necessary for the immediate occupation and temporary government of the country for its incorporation into our union for rendering the change of government a blessing to our newly adopted brethren for securing to them the rights of conscience and of property for confirming to the indian inhabitants their occupancy and selfgovernment establishing friendly and commercial relations with them and for ascertaining the geography of the country acquired he thus announced in the outset that so far as his administration was concerned our newly acquired citizens were brethren that their territory was to be incorporated into our union and that selfgovernment would be continued to them it is unnecessary for me to remind gentlemen that the treaty with france itself stipulated that louisiana should eventually be incorporated as a state if we are going to cite the louisiana purchase as a precedent for annexing the philippines must not we in order to justify ourselves entirely go the length that jefferson did and announce statehood and selfgovernment for the filipinos i it may not be out of place for me to call attention to the fact that at the time of the annexation of louisiana it was vital to the young american republic to control the mississippi river time and again the right of deposit in new orleans had been denied them they were confronted with the fact that this great river and the vast territory of louisiana had been ceded by spain to napoleon and that the great emperor proposed to reorganize on a grand scale his french colonies the safety of the young republic to say nothing of its commerce demanded that this should not be done but that our republic in the interest of peace in the interest of its perpetuity and in the interest of its commerce should control this river and this territory such was the situation then and reading into the future jefferson with unfaltering wisdom acted is there a parallel between that situation and the present is not the philippine situation just the reverse of that then our fathers were welding together a compact territory on this continent now we are crossing a great ocean and invading another continent then our fathers acted in the interest of peace and sought to promote and preserve it now we throw peace to the winds and challenge war then our fathers sought to preserve that which they had now we to feed a thirst for glory and for greed imperil that which we have then our fathers sought to bestow liberty now we to deny it then our fathers sought to avoid european and eastern entanglements now we deliberately invite them then our fathers were humble worshipers at the shrine of liberty seeking to dedicate this country to the sacred cause of freedom now we feel that we have become a world power and are seeking to exhibit to the world our strength and our might it is an interesting fact that notwithstanding the potent arguments in favor of our obtaining louisiana jefferson doubted and hesitated as to the power of this government to annex it and it is written that he talked of calling for a constitutional amendment that would authorize and justify that which had already been done it was subsequently determined however that this was unnecessary no such qualms of conscience as this affect the expansionist of today starting from the standpoint of what jefferson did and ignoring what he thought they go beyond him beyond all the fathers and all the traditions and all the precedents and propose to centralize here in washington outside the pale of the constitution the control of the happiness the fortunes the aspirations and the government of more than 10 000 000 human souls and they situated thousands of miles away from our farthest western shore as illustrating the views and the opinions of the expansionists of old and to show the striking contrast between them and the expansionists of today i beg to call attention to what president polk said in his messageof december 2 1845 in reference to the annexation of texas this accession to our territory has been a bloodless achievement 1 o arm of force has been raised to produce the result the sword has had no part in the victory we have not sought to extend our territorial possessions by conquest or our republican institutions over a reluctant people it was the deliberate homage of each people to the great principle of our federative union when our president of today comes to write the history of the annexation of the philippines can he quote the language of president polk president polk further in his inaugural address in favoring the policy of expansion used this significant language it is confidently believed that our system may be safely extended to the utmost bounds of our territorial limits and that as it shall be exteided the bonds of our union so far from being weakened will become stronger the expansionist of today ridicules the idea of there being any limit to our expansion and yet the expansionist of old as shown in the address of president polk believed that there were limits to our expansion that the farthest extent of these limits were the limits fixed by the western hemisphere i do not suppose anyone doubts president polk is not the only statesman of old who believed that there were limits to our expansion for we find that in the second annual message of president monroe he said by extending our government on the principles of our constitution over the vast territory within our limits on the lakes and the mississippi and its numerous streams new life and vigor are infused into every part of our system the great daniel webster also said there must be some limit to the extent of our territory if we would make our institutions permanent the monroe doctrine so called because of its forcible presentation by president monroe although it had been the settled policy of this government from its organization is thus stated by president monroe in his message of december 2 1823 after referring to the struggle of the greeks for liberty and briefly to the affairs of spain and portugal he says the citizens of the united states cherish sentiments the most friendly in favor of the liberty and happiness of their fellowmen on that side of the atlantic ii the wars of the european powers in matters relating to themselves we have never taken any part nor does it comport with our policy so to do it is only when our rights are invaded or seriously menaced that we resent injuries or make preparation for our defense with the movements in this hemisphere we are of necessity more immediately connected and by causes which must be obvious to all enlightened and impartial observers the political system of the allied powers is essentially different in this respect from thatof america this difference proceeds from that which exists in their respective governments and to the defense of our own which has been achieved by the loss of so much blood and treasure and matured by the wisdom of their most enlightened citizens and under which we have enjoyed unexampled felicity this whole nation is devoted we owe it therefore to candor and to the amicable relations existing between the united states and those powers to declare that we should consider any attempt on their part to extend their system to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety with the existing colonies or dependencies of any european power we have not interfered and shall not interfere but with the governments who have declared their independence and maintained it and whose independence we have on great consideration and on just principles acknowledged we could not view any interposition for the purpose of oppressing them or controlling in any other manner their destiny by any european power in any other light than as the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the united states is not the justice and righteousness of the monroe doctrine based on the declared policy of this republic not to interfere in european affairs for a hundred years or more we did not seek to extend our system of government into the eastern hemisphere and the eastern and european countries have not extended theirs here but have held aloof out of respect to the monroe doctrine it is true that now and then foreign powers have pretended to sneer at the pretensions of this doctrine and yet none of them have dared to violate it upon what reason and upon what justice can we maintain it before the enlightened judgment of mankind if we deliberately remove our main justification and defense of it if we can invade asia and feel justified in so doing why can not germany or some other country invade some portion of the western hemisphere not occupied by us and feel justified in so doing if we pursue the course of planting our system of government in the eastern hemisphere will not the question of araintaining ourselves there and here be simply a question of power and of might and not a question of right will not the equity we now have be gone our defense be destroyed and we left to stand solely by the strength of our good right arm unsupported and unsustained by the righteousness and justice with which we have heretofore been armed there are those who talk about the annexation of florida as a precedent for annexing the philippines and yet it was president monroe who enunciated the famous monroe doctrine who negotiated this treaty at the time of that annexation the monroe doctrine was in full force and the annexation of florida so far from weakening it emphasized and strengthened it annexation of the philippines tends to destroy it we all know that at the time of the annexation of florida our country was harassed and disturbed by roving bands of savages and outlaws in the peninsulaof florida which spain could not or would not control to protect ourselves we had to control the peninsula and in addition to this imperative fact we needed the peninsula of florida for the national defense we needed to control its shores lapped as they are by the waters of the atlantic and the gulf of mexico our treaty of cession also provided that florida should have statehood do any of the arguments or any of these conditions applicable to florida apply to the philippines president monroe also had ideas about our general government that the expansionist of today will hardly approve he said the impracticability of one consolidated government for this great and gowing nation will be more apparent and will be universally admitted capable of exercising local authority except for general purposes the general government will no longer be dreaded will the expansionist of today admit the impracticability of a consolidated government when they propose to have such a government control and govern more than 10 000 000 people will the expansionist of today admit the incapacity of the general government to exercise local authority except for general purposes when they propose to have the general government exercise both general and local authority for millions of subject people there are other expressions from the fathers of old that accord with the position of those who oppose the permanent retention of the philippines but do not accord with those who favor such retention fillmore declared in his first annual message among the acknowledged rights of nations is that which each possesses of establishing that form of government which it may deem most conducive to the happiness and prosperity of its own citizens of changing that form as circumstances may require and of managing its internal affairs according to its own will the people of the united states claim this right for themselves and they readily concede it to others we make no wars to promote or to prevent successions to thrones to maintain any theory of a balance of power or to suppress the actual government which any country chooses to establish for itself the sentiments herein expressed met the approval of every american heart when they were uttered and i can not believe that such sentiments are not in accord with american feeling and american sentiment today and yet this government is engaged in refusing to the filipinos the right to their own form of government and with force of arms is engaged in suppressing the actual government which the filipinos chose to establish for themselves how the mighty have fallen from their high estate when our president of today comes to write of the filipinos will he quote with approval this message of president fillmore there are those who profess now to believe that the declaration of independence no longer exists for our guidance and control they profess to believe that we have passed the day when we should be moved by the sentiments and the principles enunciated in that immortal declaration they profess to believe that it has never been a part of our government but that for all practical purposes it perished with the creation of our constitution such thoughts and such sentiments have not always existed as late as the administration of president taylor the declaration of independence was alive as listen to his message referring to the proposal to qualify the terms of california as a state he said in attempting to deny to the people of this state the right of selfgovernment in a matter which peculiarly affects themselves will infallibly be regarded by them as an invasion of their rights and upon the principle laid down in our own declaration of independence they will certainly be sustained by the great mass of the american people he further asserted in this message another doctrine that i assume is totally repugnant to the expansionist of today he said to assert that they are a conquered people and must as a state submit to the will of their conquerors in this regard will meet with no cordial response among american freemen is not the position of our administration today in reference to the filipinos that until they admit that they are a conquered people we will not even deign to tell them what we intend to do with them where in all our history is there a parallel to such a position a distinguished gentleman who was elected to this house to sit on this side of the chamber but who as i understand him has voluntarily elected to be known as belonging to the other side has called our attention to the fact that mr buchanan whom he says is the last democratic president we have had was an expansionist and favored the purchase of cuba i am glad that our friend has referred us to this fact because it furnishes the opportunity to give to the house the benefit of the views entertained by mr buchanan and i commend these views to the careful consideration of the gentleman from pennsylvania and all his compatriots upon the other side mr buchanan said in a message it has been made known to the world by my predecessors that the united states have on several occasions endeavored to acquire cuba from spain by honorable negotiation if this were accomplished the last relic of the african slave trade would instantly disappear we would not if we could acquire cuba in any other manner this is due to our national character all the territory that we have acquired since the origin of the government has been by fair purchase from france spain and mexico or by the free and voluntary act of the independent state of texas in blending her destinies with our own in his inaugural address he said it is our glory that whilst other nations have extended their dominion by the sword we have never acquired any territory except by fair purchase or as in the case of texas by the voluntary determination of a brave kindred and independent people to blend their destinies with our own he also said our past history forbids that we shall in the future acquire territory unless this be sanctioned by the laws of justice and honor how will the record of our acquisitions stand when we are through putting the filipinos to the sword and have seized their land as our own alaska is sometimes referred to as a precedent for the annexation of the philippines but aside from the fact that alaska is not contiguous territory there is no parallel in the two cases in the first place alaska at the time of annexation was unpopulated and the annexation was of land and not of people even today the last estimated population of alaska as furnished in the last annual report of the secretary of the interior shows a population all told of only 55 064 and this thirtytwo years after annexation is there any parallel between this and the annexation of ten or twelve million human souls in the philippines a further and more striking difference lies in the fact that it is conceded that whenever alaska is prepared for it she will be admitted to statehood nobody disputes this congress has recognized alaska as a part of the united states by enacting legislation for it and congress can not legislate for any country that is not a part of the united states and no country can be a part of the united states and not be under the protection of its laws and constitution in the act of 1898 in reference to alaska congress distinctly recognized the right of statehood in alaska by declaring that this act should not be construed as impairing in any degree the title of any state that may hereafter be erected out of said district or any part thereof to tide lands and beds of any of its navigable waters etc in my opinion however alaska furnishes an object lesson against the permanent retention of the philippines and against a colonial policy our government of the territory of alaska demonstrates the inadequacy of our system to govern and care for a dependent and subject people the theory of our government is that there are no rulers but the people there is no provision and no place and no power to govern except by the people when we undertake to say that we the citizens will govern you the subjects we find no machinery at our disposal and the result is misgovernment it is worse it is anarchy as an illustration of how alaska is governed the secretary of the interior in his last annual report says attention is called to the anomalous condition of the land laws in the district there are no surveyed lands nor has any system of surveying been rovided rendering it next to impossible for a poor settler to acquire a omestead citizens who have resided in the district for thirtytwo years have as yet been unable to secure title to the lands they have occupied think of it for thirtytwo years we have owned alaska and yet today no citizen of that district has been able to acquire a title to the land that he has bought occupied and improved what greater commentary upon our incompetency to provide for a subject people could be suggested the people must provide for themselves or their wants and needs will never be satisfied but listen further the attorneygeneral in his last annual report says the administration of affairs in alaska and especially the administration of justice through the courts and court officers assigned to that territory is not satisfactory there has been during the past year a very great increase in the amount of legal business in alaska the report of the district attorney shows that the criminal buiness has doubled within a year and the civil business has multiplied five times over complaints of the inadequacy of the provision to establish law and order are almost universal the district judge advises me that because of a lack of time not onetenth of the business presented can be disposed of officers of the army exercising command in the territory report that the insufficient appropriations for the department of justice and the lack of a sufficient force of court officials render the administration of justice along the yukon abortive and that the average citizen dwelling in that region has but very little respect for it here we have it stated that after thirtytwo years of our administration we have not provided the means to dispose of onetenth of the business brought to our courts that complaints of the inadequacy of our provisions to establish law and order are almost universal and that our administration of justiceamerican justice if you please of which we boastis such that it inspires no respect among the natives can we wonder that the town of wrangell has asked to be transferred to canada has asked to be transplanted from underneath the sheltering folds of our glorious flag simply because that flag as it floats in alaska does not mean good government good laws and justice can we wonder that this state of affairs exists when governor bradley of the territory is quoted as saying there are 60 men in charge of the government of the territory they have no interest in alaska except to grab what they can and getaway they are like a hungry lot of codfish seven of these officials 11 per cent of the entire government are now under indictment for malfeasance in office is not this but a repetition of the worlds history that men can not be trusted to rule an alien people in an alien land where they have no interest to subserve save the emoluments of office what stronger argument can be offered against a colonial government than this statement of facts reveals as further illultrating our want of proper machinery to govern colonies we have immediately before us the deplorable condition of affairs in hawaii we annexed these islands more than a year and a half ago we have not yet given them a territorial form of government and in the formative period of thbir existence we have not provided them with any laws by which they can maintain themselves their legislature became extinguished with the ratification of the treaty of annexation and now with the bubonic plague devastating their land carrying suffering want and death in its wake there is no power to authorize the expenditure of money in providing treatment and in attempting to crush the disease we are told by the newspapers that the president and his cabinet have been anxiously consulting in reference to the condition of these people and have been seriously trying to devise some way for their immediate relief it must be apparent to everyone that in order to govern a subject people there must be arbitrary power lodged somewhere that can act quickly there is no place under our constitution where such power can be lodged and if congress undertakes to vest it anywhere it must do so without warrant or authority from the constitution and without regard for the first principles of freedom for it has been well said that the history of the world has been written in vain if it does not teach us that unrestrained authority can never be safely trusted in human hands alaska and hawaii are not the onlyinstances in the history of this republic that have demonstrated the folly and the wrong of a republic attempting to govern any people except by democratic methods here in this union the southern sti~tes have known the effect of such a government the people of the south know what it is to be governed without their consent they bitterly know the horror the injustice and the iniquity that such a government entails they know what it is to have no voice in their affairs to be taxed without representation to be governed by aliens and to have military rule supplant the civil law i mention these things not to awaken unpleasant memories or to reopen wounds or to scar afresh old sores that burrowed deep in the flesh the memory of these things is fast dying out and i would not revive it nor do my people desire that i should do so but i mention them to emphasize the statement that as a representative of these people i will never by my vote or voice consent to put such a government upon any of gods people in any clime beneath any sun in any part of this earth i would not do it as a matter of sentiment for the subject people but above and beyond this sentiment i would not do it for love of the american people and american institutions because i believe that to do so would be to set a precedent that in its effect would ultimately overthrow the liberties of our own people if there be no other way to govern the people of the philippines except through despotic and arbitrary government and if we are determined to govern them then let us amend the constitution before we undertake such a government for i believe with washington thatif in the opinion of the people the distribution or modification of the constitutionalpowers be in any particular wrong let it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the constitution designates but let there be no change by usurpation for it is the customary weapon by which free governments are destroyed i equally abhor with daniel webster a military republic and as applicable to the present discussion i recall his utterance of more than half a century ago when he pronounceda military republic a government founded on mock elections and supported only by the sword as a movement but as a retrograde and disastrous movement from the oldfashioned monarchical systems and i recall that at the same time he declared above all the military must be kept according to the language of our bill of rights in strict subordination to our civil authority wherever this lesson is not both learned and practiced there can be no practical freedom absurd preposterous a scoff and a satire on free forms of constitutional liberty for frames of government to be prescribed by military leaders and the right of suffrage to be exercised at the point of the sword speaking for myself i do not want the philippine islands either out of the constitutionor under it i do not wish to have them as a part of this union in passing however i would say that with a declaration proposing to admit puerto rico ultimately into statehood i would interpose no objection to permanently retaining it provided the people of puerto rico desire us to keep them i would interpose no objection either to cuba under the same conditions becoming a part of this union these islands are differently situated from the philippines they are within the legitimate sphere of our influence they are within the western hemisphere and they lie almost at our door they may be of strategical value to us we would violate none of our timehonored principles in annexing them the monroe doctrine would not be interfered with we could defend them far easier from hostile invasion than we could defend the philippines and we could perhaps the better protect the atlantic coast from the invasion of yellow fever by annexing them i am opposed to forcibly annexing any people and it is inconceivable to my mind that this country boasting of its free institutions and glorying in its past achievements for liberty should commit itself to the attempt to force its flag over an unwilling people i am opposed to retaining the philippines because i am opposed to a large standing army before the war with spain an army of 25 000 men was as large as we needed it was ample to meet all the needs of a free people the war with spain necessitated an increase in this army and yet although this war ended more than a year ago the taxpayers are still supporting a great army and all because of the philippines no man today can tell when this army will be disbanded no man can predict when what we are pleased to call the insurrection 1 in the philippines will end and no man can say how long it will stay ended whenever an end is reached the history of these islands offer us but little hope that we could with safety withdraw our army even though peace with them should be declared the retention of these islands it seems to me therefore makes the retention of the army a necessity and upon the other hand no man will deny the proposition that with the release of the islands the army will not be necessary i am opposed to retaining these islands because of the expense it is stated that the normal cost of the government prior to the war with spain was in round numbers 5 per capita and it is now stated that this expense is 8 per capita we thus have an increase of 3 per capita or a total of over 200 000 000 per year and all because we own the philippines and the foolish natives of the islands have disputed our title the war taxes are still collected although peace ia declared these taxes fall upon every home and every workshop their imposition has already lasted too long and the burden they entail should be lifted instead of being permanently fastened upon our people as the retention of these islands will necessitate i am opposed to retaining the philippines because i am opposed to a oneman government in any land that flies the united states flag i do not believe in centralizing power in the white house i do not believe in enlarging the already too great power that is now vested there i do not believe in a strong centralized government i believe that those people are governed best who are governed least and i believe that the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people i have no faith in the theory that has been suggested that the government we would establish in the philippines would be so clean so pure and so able that its image reflected back to us would make this government more pure more clean and more able rather than this i fear that an autocratic government there would eventually result in an autocratic government here if selfgovernment can be denied in any one part of the united states it can be denied in all parts if we accustom ourselves to the use of arbitrary power in one place it will become natural and easy to use it in all places when we consent to a government of the filipinos who have become a part of the united states at the point of the bayonet let all patriots remember that at the same time we are increasing the number of bayonets as we increase despotic power we must remember that at the same time we are increasing the armed force to maintain it is not this dangerous desperate ground to enter upon the part of prudence and the part of safety is to withdraw from it before it is everlastingly too late learned gentlemen and able gentlemen have talked about the inherent powers of this government we hear it claimed that whether the constitution provides for it or not this government possesses the same powers of all other great governments this government has no power that the constitution does not delegate to it for by the language of the constitution all other powers not so delegated are prohibited if the framers of this government had supposed that in its creation they were giving to it the despotic powers of the governments of old would they ever have established it they were seeking to escape from such powers they sought here in the new world to found a new government and ignoring all precedents they blazed a way of their own they profited by the experience of past governments and eschewed the vicious elements of all those governments from theirs the foundation upon which they laid their structure was freedom and upon this foundation they reared a superstructure dedicated to liberty it is now seriously proposed after a century of experience with this government to deliberately remove the foundation upon which it is built and to assert that the wise fathers of old had framed a government with all the despotic powers of the old world the proposition it seems to me is monstrous unless our forefathers blundered in their work and it has taken one hundred years to find it out if true the united states government can not do anything that any other government can and still be the united states i have no patience with those who claim the hand of destiny is guiding us in the philippine question those people who so claim are simply uninformed as to the facts it was not the hand of destiny that in august 1898 cabled to admiral dewey saying the president desires to receive from you any important information you may have of the philippines the desirability of the several islands and in a naval or commercial sense which would be the most advantageous that telegram was sent from the navy department by direction of the president there is nothing of destiny in it there is no suggestion of a derelict people drifting into our hands for whom we must provide it is a coldblooded business inquiry it was not the hand of destiny but the hand of our secretary of state that on july 30 1898 named as the thirdcondition that the united states would require of spain in the event of a cessation of hostilities thaton similar grounds the united states is entitled to occupy and will hold the city bay and harbor of manila pending the conclusion of the treaty of d eace which shall determine the control disposition and government of the hilippines destiny did not make itself manifest until after the cablegram to admiral dewey had been answered and our peace commissioners had gone to work to perfect the treaty and had received their instructions to demand the philippines the whole transaction was one of business of barter and sale without the intervention of destiny it yet remains to be seen whether the business deal as it was finally consummated will be ratified by the american people the united states is not the civilizer of the world we wish that all countries had our civilization and that they all had a government like ours the only way however that we can assist them to obtain that which we have is to keep ever before them an ideal government in all its pristine purity and glory we can teach them by example and by precept but we can not teach them by force i can well understand how the course we have pursued so far in reference to the philippines has created alarm among civilized people everywhere an english writer in the london chronicle says if we express our disappointment as englishmen that our american kinsfolk are apparently following our example it is because in the matter of the rights of every people to govern themselves we had looked up to them as about to show us the better way by respecting the aspirations toward freedom even of less advanced races and by acting in accordance with their own noble traditions and republican principle s the noble and disinterested purposes for which we declared war against spain raised the united states to the topmost pinnacle of the great and humane governments of the world if we had but lived up to the renown we then won or if we would live up to it now in my humble opinion we would accomplish more for freedom more for good government snore for humanity and more for the united states than all our armies in a century of time can hope to accomplish in all that i have said i have not discussed the filipinos themselves my concern has not been for them but for us i have had no intention and have none now by anything that i say to encourage them in their hopeless fight i have no fear of doing so beceuse no feeble words of mine could add to the eloquent words of freedom and of liberty that line the archives of our nation from the declaration of independence until now and no act of mine could stir a patriotic heart as the history of our glorious deeds achieved in freedoms name must already stir it i believe that the filipinos should submit if for no other reason than because they can not succeed i believe they can accomplish more by peaceful methods than by arms and yet i trust that i will be pardoned if i say that a careful reading of all the information furnished us about them shows that notwithstanding all statements to the contrary they seek and crave liberty the excellent gentlemen composing the peace commission sent by the president to the philippines say a great many things in their report and among these things i find this statement while the people of the philippine islands ardently desire a full measure of rights and liberties they do not in the opinion of the commission generally desire independence the philippine islands even the most patriotic declare can not at the present time stand alone they need the tutelage and the protection of the united states but they need it in order that in due time they may in their opinion become selfgoverning and independent for it would be a misrepresentation of facts not to report that ultimate independenceindependence after an indefinite period of american trainingis the aspiration and goal of the intelligent filipinos who today so strenuously oppose the suggestions of independence at the present time we know that aguinaldo and his followers desire independence because they have asked for it and are now fighting for it and here we have the statement of our commission that the balance of the filipinos also desire it who is promising it to them who is holding out any hope that at any time in the future their aspirations will be granted i am opposed to the retention of the philippines because i am opposed to this government acquiring any territory in the eastern hemisphere to retain these islands would mean our entrance into and participation in the everarising and everperplexing questions of the east it would convert us from a peaceloving into a warlike nation the eastern world in dealing with questions of government recognizes only the law of might this is made manifest in the large and everincreasing armament of the countries of the old world invading as we would be the territory of the old world governments who can say that we could maintain ourselves there and avoid entanglements or alliances with other nations i am not yet ready to do this i am not yet ready to reverse the declaration of our policy made by jefferson when he said peace commerce and honest friendship with all nations entangling alliances with none nor am i yet ready to discard and refute the parting words and advice of the first president of this republic when he said europe has a set of primary interests which to us have none or a very remote relation hence she must be engaged in frequent controversies the causes of which are essentially foreign to our concerns hence therefore it must be unwise in us to implicate ourselves by artificial ties in the ordinary vicissitudes of her politics or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships or enmities our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a different course if we remain one people under an efficient government the period is not far off when we may defy material injury from external annoyance when we may take such an attitude as will cause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon to be scrupulously respected when belligerent nations under the impossibility of making acquisitions upon us will not lightly hazard the giving us provocation when we may choose peace or war as our interest guided by justice shall counsel to retain these islands would mean not only a large standing army for the purpose of upholding our government among the islanders but it would also mean such an army for the purpose of defending them from outside interference it would mean a great army and a great navy because these islands are so far removed from our shores that we could not rely upon our volunteer forces to defend them we would have to be ever ready for war just as all europe is today in the research that i have made on this great question i have not lost sight of the materialistic argument that has been presented in favor of the permanent retention of these islands and while i have reached the conclusion that the view thus presented has been exaggerated and has been given more importance than the facts justify yet i am frank to say that no consideration of commerce or of gold and no thirst for empire ought in my opinion to be weighed in the balance against the constitution and liberty and the perpetuation of our free institutions some part of this government however invested with power has been pandering to whatever of cupidity there may be in our natures in the style of literature with which they have supplied us i have received government publications which set forth in glowing language the rich stores of gold and of silver of coal of iron and of copper to be found in the philippine islands and describing the great fertility of the soil and pointing out the marvelous results that american energy and american money can achieve in these islands when i come to read however that portion of this literature devoted to the facts i find that the foreign commerce in these islands in 1894 was as much as it was ever known to be and that in thig year it amounted to only 23 558 552 of imports and 33 149 984 of exports in the tables for other years the figures are smaller when we remember that if we handle this entire commerce both exports and imports we could only expect a legitimate profit out of it we can realize what a pitiful return we would get for our great investment of money leaving out of consideration entirely the precious american lives that have been sacrificed and will be sacrificed to obtain it why sir if the entire commerce both exports and importsnot the profits but the entire commercecame to us as a gift it would not pay the expenses of our army alone and would leave totally unprovided for the expenses of the civil government i find also in the budget of revenues and expenses for these islands for the year 1897 that the total income is placed at 17 474 020 and the total expenses at 17 258 145 and i notice that included in the income and assisting to make the total are proceeds of monopolies 1 222 000 and lottery 1 000 000 spain is charged with resorting to every expedient and every ingenuity to wring money from these people and yet with all this barely enough is yielded to support the government with our more beneficent governmentand i assume that it would be more beneficentand with our refusal to license monopolies and lotteries how would we provide the necessary revenue to conduct our government if we assume the responsibility for the destiny of these people i suppose is would be a part of our mission to teach them the ways of civilization to educate them and lead them up to the higher and better walks of life where would the money come from with which to do it i am told that we now expend about 80 cents per capita on our indian wards i do not know that the figures are correct but suppose we only expend 10 cents per capita each year on the filipinos it would take in round numbers 1 000 000 per year for this purpose alone it seems to me therefore that in reaching out for the commerce of these islands so far from materially benefiting our people we will entail a sore and grievous burden upon them in my opinion such a burden as no law of reason or of prudence or of providence requires at our hands reading further from the literature furnished us i learn that in the year 1894 about 60 per cent of the foreign trade of these islands was carried in british vessels and only 20 per cent in spanish vessels i learn also that great britain was the largest consumer of tile products of these islands and that we the united states consumed three times as much of these products as did spain it is true that the gentleman compiling these figures goes on to say thatwith these islands in our possession and the construction of railroads in the interior of luzon it is probable that an enormous extension could be given to this commerce nearly all of which would come to the united states perhaps it would and perhaps it would not it is a free guess for anybody the fact however that is made manifest by these figures is that in 1894 when we did not own the philippines they exported to us three times as much of their products as they exported to spain and exported more to great britain than they did to us do not these figures demonstrate that it is a fallacy that we must own a country and a people in order to trade with them if we furnish the best market for the filipinos will we not buy their goods whether we own them or not and if they furnish us the best market for our products we will sell to them no matter what flag they fly indeed it is strange to me that at this time of all times ouir people or any portion of them should have conceived the idea that to extend our commerce we must extend our territory because it has been so recent that we had our attention called to the enormous volume of our foreign commerce the president in his annual message informs us thatthe combined imports and exports for the year are the largest ever shown in a single rear in all our history our exports for 1899 alone exceed by more than a billion dollars our imports and exports combined in 1870 the imports per capita are 20 per cent less than in 1870 while the exports per capita are 58 per cent more than in 1870 exports of agricultural products were 784 776 142 of manufactured products we exported in value si 59 146 being larger than any previous year it is a noteworthy fact that the only year in all our history when the products of our manufactories sold abroad exceeded those bought abroad were 1898 and 1899 i do not think this the time for any comment upon these figures other than upon the remarkable showing they make of our growing export trade i will leave to some other occasion to discuss the question of whether or not the decrease in our importations has been due to the advance in the height of our tariff wall or as to whether this decrease is to the substantial interests of the consumers of the country or as to whether the increase in our trade generally is due to natural or to artificial causes i wish now merely to call attention to the fact that in the face of this statement showing our enormous export trade with people who owe us no allegiance and who do not fly our flag there are still those who say that we must in order to increase our export trade own colonies and govern a dependent people such a proposition in the light of these figures seems to be absurd there is other information however that we get from the literature furnished us that is interesting we are pointed to these islands as offering a great field for development as being a wilderness of riches as it were ready for the hand of america merely to reach out and take in and yet in the column of facts we are advised that in the island of luzon there are now 79 people to each square mile in the island of leyte 71 negros 73 panay 155 bohol 188 and zebu 210 and we are also told that these six islands comprise the principal islands in all the archipelago this literature further officially informs us that the density of population in these six islands is 50 per cent greater than it is in the states of illinois and indiana and is greater than that of any of our states east of the rocky mountains except massachusetts and rhode island we are told however that these islands will support a much larger population than they now have that the population now is onlyabout onehalf as great asitis in france and onethird as great as it is in china and japan it would be useless to deny this last proposition it may be true or it may not be true the proposition is speculation pure and simple if it be true however it mnust of necessity be equally true that far greater populations can be maintained in our states than now exist it follows that if we have a surplus of energy and a surplus of capital we can find here within ourown domain riper fields to exploit abetter climate in which to live and a more homogeneous people to dwell among here the hope of success is greater and the chances of failure smaller i can understand how individuals or corporations few in number could obtain franchises rights and concessions in these islands and exploit the islands to their own satisfaction and to their own profit i can still better understand how this could be done under an arbitrary and despotic government with the people exercising no rights and having no power to protect themselves but i fail to see how our government or our taxpayers can realize anything from the venture and i cani not give my consent to overturn precedents traditions and even our organic law itself to the end simply that a few favored monopolies and individuals may wax and grow fat at the expense of the people i have said that the question i was endeavoring to discuss was not political i still maintain that proposition and yet gentlemen here and elsewhere have now and then felt called upon to refer to the democratic party as the party of expansion and to point to accessions of territory in the past under democratic administrations and have felt it their duty to suggest that democrats now who oppose the retention of the philippine islands are backslidden from the faith of their fathers and deserters from the traditional policy of their party i respectfully dissent from this view i believe and have endeavored to demonstrate that those who look upon this question as i do are as true to the policies and traditions and the faith of the democratic party as any who in the days gone by have marched beneath its banner i would remind gentlemen who thus attempt to taunt us of the fate that uniformly befell those who in the past offered such taunts this is not the first time taunts of this kind have been made and yet through the changing vicissitudes of time democratic members have been returned here by democratic constituencies the records disclose to me that the attitude of the democratic party on the expansion of territory in the past was just as violently and bitterly assailed at the time as is now the attitude of its membership on the pending question and yet time and reason vindicated and sustained its position and overwhelmed those who opposed it and forced them to tile acknowledgment that they were wrong and so i believe that those who scoff and jeer today at our position will in the days to come be forced to admit their error and their wrong just as their predecessors in the past have been compelled to do my hope is that their repentance will not have to be in sackcloth and in ashes at the feet of a crushed and overturned republic the democratic party has stood in the past and stands today for expansionexpansion of territory of commerce and of freedom and of all things that are good and great wherever under its administration this country has expanded its territory it has carried freedom liberty and the constitution with it the democratic party has always believed that forcible annexation was criminal aggression and not to be thought of it has believed in benevolent assimilatiou in fact as well as in theory it has never in the past stood for expansion of territory at the expense of freedom it has never stood for the curtailment of liberty that commerce might expand it has never waged a war of conquest it has never sought by force of arms to subject an alien people it has never stood for empire or for colonies and so far as i can read the signs of the times it stands today where it has ever stoodthe foe of oppression the enemy of tyranny the friend of liberty and the champion of progress but regardless of party or party history when temptation comes to us as a republic and cupidity and avarice arise within us when great riches seem temptingly near and dreams of imperial splendor dazzle us we must invoke the aid of the true american spirit and cling to the constitution with tenacious energy as the sheet anchor of our liberties if we do not this we are undone and that which we have we will have no more and that which we receive will be but dust and bitterness rloud applause"], [0.016540944576263428, 0.9834590554237366, 1, "i move to strike out the last word before proceedingwith my remarks i want to thank the gentleman who has just taken his seat for the complimentary way in which he referred to picketts division at gettysburg i believe that i am the only man on the floor of this house who was in that charge and i am prouder of it than he possibly can be it is not my intention to discuss fully the pending bill but matters to which it relates there is no one occupying a seat in this house that would withhold from our gallant soldiers a bountiful supply of everything that will make them as comfortable as soldiers can well be and in every way possible relieve their burdens and alleviate their sufferings but when we pause and consider the vast sums of money appropriated by this bill alone not considering the naval and other appropriations yet to be provided for and further consider that these vast sums are being appropriated in a time of at least comparative peace and further that our war with spain has long since ceased and that the insurrection in the philippine islands has been pronounced as practically at an end for the past four months i shall not wonder that the taxpayers of the country will ask and that not without reason why the appropriation of these vast sums of money and the continuance of the burdensome and unnecessary war tax the appropriation made by this bill is largely for our army now in the philippines by the results of the war with spain or rather i may say by what is called that peculiar unaccountable unexplainable manifest destiny that we hear talked about as having marked the march and progress of this great republic on its course to grandeur and to glory we are in the military possession and occupancy of portions of the philippine islands which were by the treaty of paris ceded to this government and for the title we received from spain we paid 20 000 000 and thereby these islands are under the military control of this country and it is seriously urged by some to be permanently held by us a part of the territory of our country the acquisition of foreign territory by this government and its incorporation into and as a part of ours is such a radical departure from all the teachings of the founders of the republic and all that is truly american and fraught with so much danger that we can not but contemplate such action with the gravest fears as to the result the problem is one of perplexity to all patriotic and true americans and demands at the hands of the congress of the united states the most weighty consideration and the exercise of the profoundest wisdom now the question most naturally arises when the insurrection in the philippines has been fully and finally quelled peace and qrder therein restored and armed resistance to the military authority of the united states shall have ceased what shall be done with the islands or rather with their inhabitants shall congress legislate in regard thereto and so legislate as tw make the islands irrevocably a part of our great domain placing them on the same footing as our other territories and their inhabitants citizens of our republic or shall we let them go and tell their people that we began the war with spain for the sake of humanity and that we still stand by that declaration and that we regard forcible annexation as criminal aggression and that as the fundamental principles of our government forbid us attempting to govern a people without their consent and that as they have evinced a disposition and determination not to be governed by us therefore if they will formulate their own government in their own way and make to us full reparation that we will withdraw the military arm we do not now nor will we when peace and order is restored in these islands own them or their inhabitants if we should decide to retain them the most we could claim woula be the right to govern the people and what shall be the form and character of such government they are now without civil government at least have only such as the military authorities of the united states now in the islands acting by the authority of the president may choose to furnish them the people of these islands have no rights except it be to live breathe be quiet and peaceful provided always that they do not get in the way of or disturb the military establishment in their midst and that they obey the same and this state of affairs must substantially continue until the executive of the united states shall choose to withdraw the military arm and substitute some other kind of government or congress shall legislate touching the status of government of the islands and their people but congress in its wisdom may not choose to legislate in regard to the islands further than to declare that when peace and order shall have been restored the people shall be at liberty to formulate their own government andsuit themselves as to its form if this be long delayed other things may occur that may put it beyond the power of congress to allow these people to go and leave us with them on our hands the discussion in this house on the puerto rico tax measure developed that there has gotten into this question a great deal of at least apparent muddle and confusionperhaps mostly muddle of braintouching the acquisition by the united states of these islands and of the territories of louisiana and florida but the acquisitions of louisiana and florida should not in my humble opinion furnish any precedent for our action touching the philippines i can best illustrate our true position as to louisiana and florida at the time of their acquisition and how our people regarded it by relating a conversation i had some years ago with a californian who was on a visit to my section of the country he said virginia people were in some respects the most peculiar people with whom he had met that they were constantly buying lands and farms and when he asked them why they did this the invariable answer was oh because it joins us so with the territories of louisiana florida california and texas they joined us the people of louisiana and florida at the time of acquisition were to some extent at least dominated by american sentiment by reason not only of contact with our people but many of our people had settled in these territories prior to their acquisition and again in a large measure and by reason of this fact the people of louisiana and florida were a homogeneous people and occupied adjacent territory to ours while the philippine people are a heterogeneous people and live in a faraway land in another hemisphere separated from otrshores by a greatphysical barrieran ocean 7 000 miles wideand besides this they are not anglosaxons but malays red men in fact almost all colors save white in religion part mohammedan and part christian and between their civilization and ours a great if not an impassable gulf exists which will forever prevent their assimilation they have no anglosaxon instincts and no connection whatever with our history but i turn from this for the present to the discussion of another question it must not be supposed that the democratic party is not for expansion both of territory and trade nearly all the great democratic leaders who have lived in this country or now live are expansionists but there is a wide difference between what they pronounce true and proper expansion and what is termed imperialism the assimilation of a homogeneous people and of adjacent territory and that of a heterogeneous people and foreign territory no party in this country that ever rose reigned or fell has advocated the acquisition of territory for colonial purposes or the owning by this country of colonial possessions until this doctrine has in this day found champions in the now republican party of the country i am now as i have always been in favor of expansion of territory and trade but as a patriotic american true to the principles of the declaration of independence and the constitution i am utterly opposed to the newfangled doctrine of expansion as expounded by our friends of the republican party or in other words i am opposed to a colonial policy whereby part of the people of this republic will be citizens and part subjects to avoid this we must let go our hold upon the philippines or make them a part of the territory of this country and their untold millions citizens of our republic on the debate on the puerto rico tax bill i heard it argued and urged on the floor of this house by gentlemen on the other side of the chamber that congress in dealing with the inhabitants of the islands acquired by us from spain under the treaty of paris acts outside and beyond the pale of the constitution that the power of congress in this regard is plenary is supremeomnipotentand it takes an act of congress to carry the constitution to this newly acquired territory if congress does not get its authority from the constitution in dealing with these acquisitions where does it get it the congress plenary is a creature of the constitution can the creature get above the creator or go be or exist without the creator it can not be true in the very nature of things that congress can do anything outside the constitution to even assert much less admit that congress in dealing with the inhabitants of these islands can act without and beyond the constitution is the very rankest imperialism and to admit such to be the authority of congress is to state the fallacious proposition that under our constitution we can in this country at one and the same time have two kinds of government in operationone a republic under the constitution the other an empire by congressional action outside the constitution if it be conceded that congress can legislate for the inhabitants of these islands without being bound by the lmitations prohibitions and restrictions of the constitution then it or the legislatures of the territories organized under its laws can pass ex post facto laws or bills of attainder abolish jury trial suspend the writ of habeas corpus in time of peace create titles of nobility impose unequal taxation and that without representationin a word make the presiddnt of the united states or some military officer dictator or emperor the statement of the proposition is its ref utation fow can an act of congress carry the constitution to our new acquisitions is not the very reverse true does not the constitution carry congress to these acquisitions after our flag has been there planted and it has become our manifest intention to hold as part of our territory these acquisitions my examination of the decisions of the supreme court has satisfied me as to the status of territory and the inhabitants of territory acquired by the united states i do not deem it necessary to repeat what has already been said in this house along this line would it had been as mr jefferson said that the constitution had been made so clear and plain that the people would have had no differences of opinion as to its meaning and only differed in policies of the government why should we make the philippine islands a part of this country and their inhabitants citizens of the united states what do we want with them and what can we do with them if we once incorporate them into and as a part of this country and make the inhabitants citizens of the republic and we shall hereafter discover we made a mistake how shall we get rid of them it is asserted that we want their trade and the trade of the chinese seas and the orient and by a distinguished senator that it is a land of great value in its productions and great in mineral wealtha land of gold and much gbld but it must be remembered that these are the maxims of covetousness and not those of liberty and patriotism we surely have not fallen so low as to be moved by such sordid considerations as those of greed and gain and to barter our liberty and free institutions for commercial assets i have already stated that we do not own the lands of these islands they belong to the inhabitants and we can not get the lands without paying for them unless we are going to follow the example of william the norman and divide them out among our soldiers we do not and can not own the inhabitants and can not force tribute from them unless we are to become tyrants and freebooters and follow the example of england in south africa crushing as gallant chivalrous and brave a people as ever fought bled and died for liberty and yet the american congress the grandest deliberative body on the earth repreisnting the most libertyloving and enlightened people of the best and grandest republic in the world is not willing to even express sympathy with this people england is the enemy of free government she is the enemy of this country and has tried to destroy us and would be willing to undertake it now if she dared she has been guilty of arson and murder she is an old thief and robber and is not only trying to rob the boers of their gold and their diamonds but of their liberty away with your english alliance let those who will advocate it but shame to any patriot who even thinks of entertaining such an idea then there would seem to be only one principal thing we are after and that is the privilege of trading with the people of these islands and this privilege we can have without attempting to govern them it is said to retain the philippines will furnish to us great opportunities for trade between america and the nations of the orient that we must look for markets and that we must enter into actual competition for this trade that we must recognize changed conditions and that by holding the philippinesour trade in the orient will continue to increase until we shall find a market for all our supplies and surplus products i can not see the logic of this reasoning when there can be no reason why we can not find markets in the orient for our surplus products without the philippines as well as with them and by letting them go we shall escape dangers to our liberty that are not now so clearly foreseen but which will certainly come if we attempt to establish free institutions in the eastern hemisphere again the protectivetariff people who have heretofore wanted to build a chinese wall around this country to keep out the foreigner and make him pay the tax and keep out foreign pauper labor or goods made by foreign pauper labor seem to have waked up to the realization of the fact that the country has outgrown chinese walls at home and wants to go over and tear down the chinese wall on the farther side of the seas and to open broader markets for our surplus products and are even willing to open up the country to paupermade goods and even to the paupers themselves they talk about opposition to free trade and yet prate about reciprocity which we all understand is nothing less than international free trade why not stand as you will finally have to stand on the true doctrinetariff for revenue only you are traveling rapidly in that direction and to that doctrine and it will be no surprise that you should go beyond it but are you preparing to exchange protectionism for imperialism itis better to bear the ills we have than to flee to those we know not of what is the trade of these islands worth to us it has already been shown on this floor by the able speech made by the gentleman from mississippi on the 6th of last mouth that the trade of these islands as it now exists if we could get it all would not exceed 30 000 000 per year and that their productions or at least many of them are the same as our own and as shown by the speech referred to the products of these islands are made by labor costing a mere trifle a few cents per day to the laborer and that these products would necessarily come into competition with our products produced by our wellpaid labor will our laboring people submit to this or be willing to see this take place it would seem that every thoughtful american who loves liberty his country her opportunities and free institutions and our glorious history and all that we hold sacred and dear does not wish to see the philippine islands incorporated into the government of this country and its inhabitants become citizens of this republic some of the reasons that present themselves to my mind why i do not want to see this occur are first these islands and their people are too far removed from our shores climatic and other conditions forbid our people from migrating and settling there the situation of these people their condition and temperament would require too much governing and of a kind and character not suited to republican institutions certain it is that abuses in government and corruption in high as well as low places would follow and we should be poorly able to correct these abuses for we know by observation if not by sad experiences that it is difficult if not next to impossible to correct such abuses here at home are we willing to have corruption and robbery and disgraceful carpetbag rule such as we had in the south in the days of reconstruction second the character education habits manners customs and religions of these people forbid assimilation and for us to attemut by force of government or otherwise to foist and fasten upon these islanders our civilization is death to them it is important that we do not lay too much stress upon the representations of those of our people who have lately come in contact with the malay race and are too ready upon mere superficial examination to declare how they are to be dealt with if we are to take and govern the people of these islands our duty is plain and that is to govern them to the advancement of civilization if we cannot necessarily our own complex system totally different from theirsand to the mutual advantage of both races the american is democratic and progressive the malay is aristocratic and conservativecharacteristics inherited by them from scores of generations gone beforeand as these are the results of slow accumulation from associations for hundreds of years so they can not at once be eradicated but they must be treated as chronic diseases of long standing are by the medical practitioner the foremostprinciple which should always be kept in view is that the civilization of any race is not a system that can be changed at will every civilization of any race is the growing product of a very complex set of conditions depending on race and character on climate on the trade and minutia of circumstances to attempt to alter such a system apart from its conditions is impossible for instance when a total change in government is made it breaks down altogether when the english constitution was swept away cromwell or anarchy was the alternative when the french constitution was overthrown napoleon was the only salvation from anarchy and if this be the case when the externals of government alone are altered how much more is it the case if we attempt to uproot the whole of a civilized and social life we may despotically force a bald and senseless imitation of our way on another people but we shall only destroy their life without planting any vitality in its place no changes are legitimate or beneficial to the character of a people except those which follow from conviction and the natural growth of mind the incorporation of these philippine people into our body politic is a danger that threatens the very existence of the republic imperial expansionthat is the incorporation into our system of people that are incapable of receiving our civilization and becoming homogeneous with us and therefore being not of us must of necessity be ruled as subjects and can not become citizens and if this imposition of a foreign system is injurious how destructive the imposition of such a system as ours which is the most complex unnatural and artificial that has been known a system developed in a relatively cold country amid one of the hardest least sympathetic and most selfdenying and calculating of all people in the world such a system the product of such extreme conditions we attempt to force on the least developed races and expect from them an implicit subservience to our illogical law and our to them seeming inconsistent morality the result is death we make a deadhouse and call it civilization scarcely a single race can bear the contact and the burden every attempt upon a low but perfect civilization will result in eradication in our efforts to improve while the body of man remains practically the same for ages the brain develops and changes only by slow processes as the race reaches a higher level we should divest ourselves of the idea that the history of the world began when we were born a familiarity with the old testament and the classics with oriental polyamy and greek polytheism should teach us not to ignore the painful and laborious efforts in social and political problems among nations other than our own and to avoid the wellknown failures of the past and to let all the lights play fully around the subject when that subject is the elevation and betterment of the moslem the hindoo and the malay and instead of throwing the arms of protection of our government around the sultan of sulu and winking at his polygamy shall we not by frowning upon his conduct hud by wellconsidered example teach him if we can that his best policy and that of his people is to conformto our customs no one solution of the problem of society social life and culture will fit every race and most surely our civilizafion is illy adapted to be all at once imposed upon the filipino people when civilization so different from the anglosaxon has been the growth of centuries we must not indeed can not afford to force our civilization upon them for as i have already argued it is death in the end to t iem and no profit to us but eventual loss if we can not elevate and christianize them we are in danger of being carried down in the scale of civilization my third reason for stating that we do not want the philippines is that to govern them will most likely require the constant presence of the military arm yes a standing army of thousands of soldiers and the expenditure of untold millions of money which must be wrung front our already heavily burdened taxpayers and in addition at the cost of the sacrifice of thousands of the best and bravest of our soldiers it is stated on competent authority that we now have about 65 000 soldiers in these islands at the cost of not less than 1 000 per annum for each man how many lives have been lost in battle and by disease has not yet been so far as i know disclosed how many filipinos have been killed we do not know nor have we any account of how many filipino prisoners have been taken if any certain it is that our army is not burdened with prisoners our attempt to retain the philippines and to erect in the eastern hemisphere a republic is first an implied if not an expressed abandonment of the monroe doctrine and secondly is sure to excite the jealousy of and alarm the crowned heads of european and asiatic countries and lead to friction complications entanglements and collisions which must of necessity result in wars frequent bloody relentless and costly and flowing from this naturally insubordination and insurrection in the islands to retain these islands as part of the domain of this government is to bring their products produced by the cheapest and most degraded labor into competition with the products of this country made and produced by the most intelligent and best paid labor on the earth and thus bring down the price of our own products and considerably reduce the price of our own labor and with this will come discontent among our laboring people resulting in strikes if not wholesale strife these islands will become the breeding ground of trusts and combines entered into organized and intrenched in power for the purpose of controlling the trade of the chinese seas and the orient and into the valleys and plains of luzon will doubtless be transferred and transplanted many of our large manufacturing plants with the very purpose and object of securing the cheap and degraded labor of these islands the articles then manufactured will also go into the trusts and combines manufactured in this country and come into competition with articles made by our wellpaid labor we have not as yet discovered a legal method whereby can be controlled the monster trusts and combines in this country then how shall we in the faraway land of the philippines already these gigantic anacondas leeches and bloodsuckers have so interwoven themselves in through and around avenues of trade as to practically crush out small tradersindeed all formidable opposition or competitionand have almost completely destroyed or paralyzed individualism and individual effort leaving to the poor btt competent young blisiness man depending alone upon his own abor for a living little if anything to en7 courage him his hopes are blasted his aspirations crushed and wrecked no doubt the acquisition and more especially the permanent holding of these islands will be made the excuse for the advocates of imperialism in this country to unite with those of england and other european powers for the further aggrandizement of empire by seizing the first opportunity for the dismemberment of china shall the republic live or shall it perish by our folly our splendid republic is as yet in the experimental state with scarcely more than a centurys existence the hardiest of vegetable and mineral growths are those of slowest development the history and the experience of nations show that those of longest duration in reaching their climax were slowest in dying it took rome several hundred years to reach the zenith of her glory and then several hundred more to dienearly fifteen hundred years from birth to death her downfall was the result of her insatiable greed for military glory spoliation and territorial aggrandizement shall we travel the same road and meet the same fate in my humble opinion the only sensible and reasonable solution of the philippine problem is to restore to that unfortunate unhappy people peace and order and then let them establish their own government stable and firm of course and let them become the architects of their own destiny without involving ours for it must be remembered that no civilized people ever struggled fought and bled for liberty and achieved it and founded free government but have ever had a fierce struggle to preserve and maintain it every free people who have lost their liberty and wrecked their free institutions have usually done so by a forgetfulness of the cost thereof in blood and treasure and in the attempt for territorial aggrandizememnt urged on by success and the glittering prospects of empire greed and spoliation liberty and the blessings of free government can only be preserved by frequent recurrence to fundamental principles magna charta was reaffirmed no less that two and thirty times by our english ancestors the declaration of independence needs reaffirmation and instead of reaching out for empire shouting ourselves hoarse over the flag it would be a good thing for us to have a real genuine revivala liberty revivalin which we might pause long enough to think over the blood and treasure and the sacrifices it cost our ancestors to establish free government and on the other hand to consider what a crime we should commit against the republic our children and our childrens children if we suffer ourselves to pursue a policy which will be subversive of our liberties when the united democracy shall assemble at kansas city on the 4th day of july next to nominate the next president of the united states we are going to have a regular old genuine liberty revival and we shall again reaffim the declaration made by us in 1896 and the principles contained in the immortal declaration of independence then we shall declare that this is a government of the people by the people and for the people and that we intend to preserve it in its constitutional integrity free from all foreign entanglements as handed down to bs from our fathers

after the advent of the administration which installed mr lochren as commissioner pensioners were dropped and pensions reduced by the thousands and that too without notice or opportunity to be heard in order to sustain this arbitrary and biased action on the part of the pension bureau mr cleveland in his message of december 4 1893 used the following language thousands of neighborhoods have their wellknown fraudulent pensioners and recent developments in the bureau establish appalling conspiracies to accomplish pension trauds that charge was most unfair and unjust to thousands of brave men who showed their love of this country by offering it their lives it was not only false but a slander against thousands of patriotic veterans who made part and parcel of the grandest army that ever marched to drumbeat or willingly answered the bugles call coming as it did from the executive head of the nation and coming to us soon after the dropping of so many pensioners and the reducing of so many pensions it naturally attracted the attention of the public to those men and in many cases the epithet fraud was applied to one who had worn the blue and had suffered on the battlefield on the march or in prison pens an investigation proved the falsity of these charges and it showed that instead of the pensioners of this country being frauds they had been robbed by the officers of this great rich and opulent government of their little pensions and that too without opportunity to be heard and without notice so unfair was the action of the commissioner of pensions that on the 21st day of december 1893 congress passed a law forbidding the dropping the reducing or the withholding of pensions without first giving thirty days notice and provided that all pensions should be deemed and held by the officers of this government to be vested rights but the dropping of pensions continued the board of revision which had been established continued its work but members of congress by reason of the reports of the local medical examining boards and the evidence on file and with the assistance of deputy pension commissioner murphy who was a friend of the soldier were able to have many of them restored however in order to shut out members of congress and to prevent them from ascertaining whether or not injustice had been done the old soldiers instructions were issued to the various pension examining boards of this country that they should no longer rate the pensioners they examined the conduct of the pension bureau was so outrageous the object was so apparent that on the 2d day of march 1895 congress passed a law requiring the various local pension boards to rate those they examined in 1893 in 1894 and in 1895 pensioners were dropped pensions were reduced and pension claims were rejected by thousands and the old soldiers became disheartened and discouraged they would not urge their claims because to ask action was to invite rejection just to show how much"],
