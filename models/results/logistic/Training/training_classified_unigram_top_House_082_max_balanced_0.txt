connection with this vital subject of foreign trade i call the members attention to part 2 of the latest census report no ft 410 this might be called a routine cold statistcal report because it is published every month and is confined entirely to a listing of the kinds and amounts of products exported from the united states and to which countries but with a deadly war going on in korea this report is no longer routine instead it documents one of the most sordid chapters in the commercial history of the world such a monstrous thind as to make the nefarious gun runners of old look like deacons by comparison and enough to turn inside out the stomach of every moral and patriotic citizen this routine report discloses that the internationalists for a profit including socalled americans are conducting a land office business with british hong kong apparently emerging as the num ber one international robbers roost here is the situation while chinese communists are killing our men in korea small manufacturers throughout the united states either must crawl on bended knees to the black markets for all too many metals or practically do without resulting in layoffs and in some cases bankruptcy in the face of all this the truman administration to its everlasting shame is allowing precious metals and other strategic materials to be exported all over the earth including communist china and to nearby hong kong for shipment anywhere most of it to china does this profitable open door in juxtaposition for dealing with the various and sundry governments and bandits of asia explain why the chinese reds did not long ago walk in and occupy hong kong why britain was one of the first t accord formal recognition to the chinese communist regime and why both britain and france on paper supported the united nations resolution branding communist china as an aggressor but then halted abruptly and exuded a tortured cry against following up the resolution with a blockade of the chinese mainland from the standpoint of the london government and the leeches on fleet street the few british troops fighting in korea are probably considered entirely expendable and indeed good investments in britains historic cause of international profiteering and exploitation whether or not they are killed by ammunition made frommaterial lucratively transferred from hong kong to red china but the british are not alone before proceeding further permit me to point out that american internationalists with the full knowledge of the truman administration and in a vicious circle are not only providing red china with strategic materials by importing into the united states a wide range of chinese products these international parasites are providing american dollars which are used in turn to build up the chinese war machine imports from red china in october alone ran into the hundreds of thousands of dollars and included such items as drug flowers tableware bow hair for violins fish products electric lamps film material azimuth mirrors jewelry medical preparations antiques dolls and dice i wonder if the dice were loaded in true communist fashion but perhaps most interesting of all is the importation from communist china of almost a million pounds of dried eggs during october in addition to shell eggs and frozen eggs for which american internationalists paid china about a half million dollars this mind you on top of an american domestic surplus of some 100 000 000 pounds of dried eggs in the caves of kansas and it has been going on for months and months as i have revealed to the members on more than one occasion with the truman administration doing nothing about it until finally last fall the president announced that the tariff on dried eggs from china would be increased effective december 11 1950 in other words he gave the reds advance notice providing them with plenty of time to do their worstto flood the american market before the tariff increase went into effect and they did exactly that now back to the exports of our critical materials in november alone tons and tons of american iron steel aluminum copper brass bronze lead nickel tin zinc and so forth went to the four corners of the globe heaven only knows how much of it was or will be transshipped to china for use against our troops in one form or another large quantities perhap suspiciously large were exported to canada and certain of the small countries of south america all of whom incidentally have been conspicuous by their absence in the front lines in korea i am not qualified to say how much of this material is used in the various countries to which it is shipped perhaps we will never know who is shipping what to russia china and the rest of the communist satellites but the report does list shipments of various goods direct to china from the united states including for example black ungalvanized carbon steel to the tune of more than 7 000 000 pounds making china next to canada the largest single recipient of this item during november hong kong was in third place with almost 5 000 000 pounds the united states exported to no less than 29 countries during november more than 11 000 000 pounds of galvanized steel sheets the same kind for which small manufacturers in iowa and elsewhere are crying to keep their businesses alive and their employees on the job but these are just a few examples of the scarce metals pouring out of the united states for further details i refer you to the report the members will also be interested to know that both china and hong kong are high up on the list of more than 75 countries receiving millions of dollars worth of american drugs including huge quantities of penicillin and streptomycin for the benefit of communist chinese soldiers i would venture to say that if the inhabitants of hong kong existed solely on drugs they would undoubtedly founder before they could possibly consume even a fraction of the amount shipped in

generations had the greatest elementary and highschool program of any nation in the world this year almost 1 000 000 teachers serve in our 90 000 school districts to teach approximately 25 000 000 american school children however we should be concerned with more than the mere size of our vast educational program we should be so much concerned that we become determined t3 provide for every boy and girl in the nation the best and most complete education of which he or she is capable we should guarantee with our national resources that no segment of our schoolage population is denied educational opportunities adequate to any demand which his individual needs and the national welfare may place upon him we should be concerned if salaries in rural schools are so low that they discourage the best trained teachers from accepting appointments in rural areas or if any other conditions serve to deny a good education to any boy or girl because he or she happens to be born in a community poor in material wealth but with a high population of schoolage children in fact we must face up honestly to some of the basic conditions which create differences in educational

statement he has just made i wish again to call to the attention of the house the fact that the gentleman now addressing this body is the chairman of the subcommittee in charge of this particular aspect of the affairs of the state department in the light of recent remarks made by the gentleman from illinois about the socalled roweramspeck report recommending an amalgamation in the department of state of the foreign service and the departmental service and a directive by the secretary of state on this subject it is my desire in the light of certain misconceptions about this matter to present to the house certain facts concerning it i do not wish at this time to state a personal point of view about either the roweramspeck report or the acheson directive because i have not sufficiently studied this old and complex problem to have a point of view the gentleman from illinois has stated that there is a sinister and clever plot to ruin the foreign service if i am correct in my interpretation he even darkly hints that there may be something subversive about it if that is so i think the gentleman from illinois will be even more shocked when he learns that the most active group fomenting this sinister plot are the leaders of his own party he will find if he cares to explore the subject that the amalgamation of the foreign service with the departmental service in the state department is being actively pushed by the only living former president of the united states herbert hoover he will find that a proponent in this house is the honorable clarence brown of ohio he will find that in the other house standing foremost among the gfoup supporting this amalgamation are senator taft of ohio and senator joe mccarthy of wisconsin i will call the roll of all these names in just a moment but first for a bit of history one of the reports of the commission on organization of the executive branch better known as the hoover commission was its report on foreign affairs the vice chairman of the hoover commission at that time was dean acheson who was then in the private practice of law when he later became secretary of state he carried out all the recommendations of the hoover commission in reorganizing the department of state with one major exception that major exception was recommendation no 20foreign affairs a report to the congress by the commission on organization of the executive branch of the government february 18 1949 page 61which reads the personnel in the permanent state department establishment in washington and the personnel of the foreign service above certain levels should be amalgamated over a short period of years into a single foreign affairs service obligated to serve at home or overseas and constituting a safeguarded career group administered separately from the general civil service the report of the commission explains at some length why this is a desirable recommendation its recommendation was based primarily on the report of the task force on foreign affairs of the hoover commission which presented a preliminary report on foreign affairs and which made exactly the same recommendation the gentleman from illinois will be interested to know that the two members on that task force group were two republicans who had been assistant secretaries of state in the administration of herbert hoover they were harvey bundy a partner in the conservative boston firm of choate hall stewart who was also an assistant to the secretary of war in world war ii and james grafton rogers of new york president of the foreign bondholders council and a former deputy director of oss the adviser to the task force was the late henry l stimson secretary of state under president hoover and secretary of war under president franklin roosevelt and president william howard taft he endorsed the task force report the 12 members of the hoover commission were unanimously in favor of this recommendation besides herbert hoover and clarence brown there were among others on the commission former representative carter manasco of alabama former ambassador to london joseph kennedy whose views on foreign policy although he is a democrat are probably more acceptable to the gentleman from illinois than those of dean acheson george mead a republican industrialist and businessman of the middle west senator john mcclellan of arkansas and professor james pollock a republican who is chairman of the government department at the university of michigan and who was appointed to the hoover commission by senator vandenberg incidentally it is my understanding that senator vandenberg has been vitally interested in the question of amalgamation despite this impressive background of support dean acheson hesitated to put this recommendation into effect when he became secretary of state i assume he did so because he was disturbed by the possible effect on morale of his employees incidentally the late secretary of defense james forrestal a member of the commission favored the recommendation but stated he feared the effect on morale of the employees secretary acheson for many months had the problem carefully studied within the department still dissatisfied he decided to appoint an outside committee to study this and related personnel problems it is clear from the appointments that secretary acheson attempted to bring several different points of view to the work mr james rowe for instance had been a member of the hoover commission he was not appointed by the administration but was an appointee of this house he was nominated by the present minority leader the honorable joseph martin who was at the time the hoover commission was created the speaker of the house he had been recommended to the then speaker by the leader of the then minority party the honorable sam rayburn he served therefore on the hoover commission as i have said as a representative of this house another member of the state department committee was the honorable robert ramspeck who is well known to all of you through his many years of service in this house and who is the new chairman of the civil service commission he was selected because of his long background and experience in government personnel problems a third member was william e decourcy a brilliant foreign service officer of more than 30 years of experience in and devotion to the foreign service whose present post is ambassador to haiti this committee studied this problem of amalgamation for 6 months beginning in december 1949 it conducted many separate studies it held hearings for many weeks listening to more than 70 experts including many departmental officials numerous ambassadors and foreign service officers representatives from other government agencies concerned with foreign affairs political scientists and diplomats from other countries incidentally only the united states and slam have a separate foreign service and a separate home service handling foreign affairs all other nations have a single service the roweramspeck committee also circulated 2 200 questionnaires to departmental and foreign service employees a large majority of these employees believe a single foreign affairs service is the best thing for the united states it submitted its report to the secretary of state in june 1950 since that time there has been no action on the report until very recently i understand lowever that former president hoover has seen the roweramspeck report and has described it as a fine job also in view of mr busbeys previous career in the investment business i am sure he will be impressed by the fact that francis adams truslow who was president of the new york curb exchange until 2 weeks ago appeared before the roweramspeck committee last spring vigorously supporting a single service it is my understanding that the socalled roweramspeck report has been studied since july 1950 throughout the department by many individuals both in the foreign service and in the departmental cervice it has also been studied by the other agencies in the departments of the government interested in foreign affairs whatever their reasons these advisers have convinced the secretary of state once more that there should be no amalgamation and despite the misconceptions and statements already made it is clear that the forthcoming directive of the secretary of state while it includes a number of personnel reforms does not and i repeat not call for amalgamation i do not know whether rowe and ramspeck are right or acheson is right i am stating only the facts centering around this problem there has been one other recent development last week on march 15 a resolution was introduced in the senate that resolution is senate concurrent resolution 19 it requests the secretary of state to submit to the congress within 90 days after its adoption a plan for amalgamation of the personnel of the departmental service and the personnel of the foreign service into a single foreign affairs career service administered separately from the general civil service as recommended by the hoover commission two of the sponsors of resolution 19 are

long last the veterans committee has brought to the house for action this urgently needed and just legislation to grant to our boys engaged in the korean conflict benefits similar to those granted the gis of world war ii under public law 346 of the seventyeighth congress i salute the committee for its forthright decision to eliminate the flimsy distinctions between korean veterans and those of world war ii this bill of course is not perfect in all details in that it does not extend all of the benefits but it is a step in the right direction once having passed the basic law it will be comparatively simple to iron out the inequities by amendments good common sense dictates prompt approval of the measure before the house to our boys in korea the present conflict in which they are engaged is not police action it is war to our people at home their husbands sons and fathers are at war they have been placed in the uniform of our country and are active members of the armed services of the united states guns have been placed in their hands they have maimed and killed the enemy and in turn have been maimed and killed themselves they are at war and let us call it what we willundeclared war cold war or police actionto our boys lying ii hospital beds and to their families at home it is a real war in all its horrible aspects and consequences as of may 23 last 19 219 of our american boys have lost their lives seventynine thousand two hundred and sixtyeight have been wounded of which 1 791 have died of such wounds one thousand two hundred and four are listed as prisoners of war and 9 696 are currently missing in action they are fighting and have fought for the same freedom for which their buddies fought in world war i and world war ii then why delay in granting to them the rights and privileges accorded said buddies i can realize that it was necessary to make some changes and to plug loopholes to correct the abuses arising from the administration of public law 346 on which the bill before us is patterned now that work is completed let us fulfill our obligations by extending to all veterans of the korean hostilities who served from the beginning on june 27 1950 to the end whenever that may be every benefit voted for veterans of former wars i am particularly interested in having title iii housing put into effect without delay korean veterans returning home are confronted with serious housing problems and are resentful when advised that the preferences accorded to veterans of previous wars have not been accorded to themand rightfully so they have been called upon to serve in a conflict which has jeopardized their civilian advancement as completely as did those who served in other wars and must not be discriminated against in any way
