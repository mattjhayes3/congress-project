the gentleman from texas that it is hardly necessary to make even a single observation i desire however to extend my sympathy to the gentleman from illinois the chairman of the committee in his efforts to secure a proper reduction of the appropriations i believe he will bear testimony that i have earnestly sought so far as i could to limit the appropriations of the government to the lowest point consistent with an honest economical administration i think the majority of the committee will bear witness in the same behalf i must say however when the gentleman from illinois declines to make appropriations in the usual way for the fiscal year i am compelled to refuse to follow his leadership i am sure that this side of the house during the present session has dealt with the question of public expenditures with as much fairness as much honest and as much economy as when we controlled the organization of the house upon examining the official record i find that the appropriations for the fiftyfirst reed congress amounted to 1 035 680 109 94 that those of the fiftysecond congress aggregated 1 027 104 547 92 while the appropriations of the last congress amounted to but 989 239 205 69 the appropriations for the first session of the fiftyfirst congressand i desire to call the special attention of the committee to the aggregate because i concur in the view expressed by the gentleman from texas that the appropriations of the second session of this congress willlargely exceed the 506 000 000 estimated by the gentleman from illinois as the aggregate for the present sessionthe appropriations for the first session of the fiftyfirst congress were 494 456 248 65 while for the second session of the same congress they were 541 223 861 29 which caused the total of the appropriations for the congress to exceed the billiondollar limit in other words the appropriations for the first session of the fiftyfirst congress were fairly economical and substantially in accord with the demands of the public service it was at the second session of that congress however when the unbridled republican majority made the enormous appropriations that fixed the aggregate at the stupendous total of 1 035 680 109 for the congress now in this connection i desire to acquit the gentleman from illinois and also the speaker of this house because they endeavored to restrain the action of the majority in respect to expendituresi desire to acquit them of having favored these enormously extravagant a ppropriations i believe that the gentleman from illinois and the present speaker have never been quite content with the record of that congress in so far as it related to the appropriation of public money i know that the gentleman from illinois in the closing days of that congress standing in yonder aisle over and over again appealed to the republican side to stay their riotous assaults upon the treasury it is known also that the speaker was not in sympathy with the profligate appropriations then made and therefore i assume that the gentleman from illinois then as now in charge of the committee on appropriations seeks to improve the record of that congress and escape if possible a billiondollar total i have sustained him up to this moment in his efforts to reduce expenditures as a humble democrat i propose to stand by him to the end of the session in all proper efforts in behalf of judicious economy but if the reduction of appropriations is to be accomplished in this bill and others that are to follow by the absolute omission of appropriations essential for the public service i must decline to indorse such false economy i will support the chairman when he seeks to reduce appropriations to the necessities of an honest frugal administration not because i am in political sympathy with the other side ofthe chamber but being a democrat i believe that taxation in whatever form it may be imposed is a burden upon the productive capacity of the people whether it be levied by a collector of internal revenue or through postal receipts or by customs dues it is no lets a tribute exacted from the taxpayers of the country having favored economy in the last congress i will not depart from that policy now in the hour of victory we upheld this doctrine in defeat let us cling more closely to it the great founder of the democratic party in his inaugural address of march 4 1801 concisely enumerated the essential principles of government he declared among other things in favor of 1economy in the public expense that labor may be lightly burdened it follows therefore that the hand of the federal taxgatherer should be laid upon the resources of the people only to the extent of securing the necessary revenue to support and maintain the government i believe in this doctrine it is essential to the happiness and prosperity of the people but i challenge the attention of the house and the country to the fact that the majority of the committee on appropriations in defiance of precedents have refused to appropriate for the public service for the ensuing fiscal year an amount estimated at about 3 000 000 the necessities of the service call for this expenditure but it is postponed until after the ensuing election it may be that the aggregate total of this sessions appropriations will exceed 500 000 000 but i submit to the house whether it is sound policy whether it is a wise administration of public affairs to deliberately refuse to appropriate that which the obligations of the government demand during the coming fiscal year it may be good politics but it is faulty from a business standpoint pursue your policy gentlemen we are in a feeble minority and powerless except to enter our protest but until the close of this congress we shall continue to call the attention of the country to inadequate appropriations which may be prompted by partisan considerations the total appropriations for this congress doubtless will aggregate more than a billion of dollars but if they are just economical appropriations and required by law the people will not complain i had occasion to say at the close of the last congress that in my judgment the appropriations for that congress amounting in round numbers to 989 000 000 could not have been reduced much below 980 000 000 without repealing legislation which made the appropriations necessary i believe that if we are to accomplish the desirable result of bringing the total of appropriations of the government much below the billiondollar mark we must modify or repeal some of the legislation now on the statute books but so long as these laws remain so long as certain contracts exist to maintain public works then this congress should without evasion and without attempting to mislead the people make ample provisions for the pflblic service regardless of supposed party necessities in the approaching campaign"], [0.08476054668426514, 0.9152394533157349,

when the gentleman from mississippi was addressing the committee on some river and harbor items later in the afternoon some discussion took placein which the gentleman from tennessee and the gentleman from missouri took part in the course of their remarks they attacked the supreme court of the united states and i propose now in the limited time just allotted to me to defend that court this is not a political question it is not a partisan question the question is whether it is proper to attack this court a great coordinate branch of the government supposed to be of equal and independent power with the legislative branch in the course of remarks on this floor the gentleman attacked not only as i conceive mr justice shiras a member of the supreme court of the united states for his decision in the incometax cases but the attack was broad enough to affect and must necessarily and logically involve not only every member of the majority of the court but every one of the nine justices who compose the entire court i call the attention of the committee to the language which was then used by the gentleman from tennessee who with his recognized ability aspires to be the leader of the democratic party in the next congress he said it is known to all who are posted that the man who tore down the constitution and overrode the decisions of a hundred years who set aside the power which was placed in the hands of congress to assess the wealth of the nation and require it to bear a portion of its expenses was and is named shiras and that name ought to be mentioned in connection with that reprehensible and evertobecriticised decision wherever it is referred to at any time let posterity not forget him it is not likely to forgive him then the gentleman from missouri said now then let us see how strangely that provision was overturned eight judges were present when the matter first came before the supreme court of the united states they divided equally upon the main question of constitutionality the ninth justice was absent those who took the oneside and those who took the other were well known they identified themselves there was another hearing when the ninth judge was present so that the full bench then heard the case the ninth judge joined in with the four who held the law to be constitutional andlo and behold one of the four without ever vouchsafing an explanation without ever giving any reason changed his mind in such a way as to lift from wealth a tax of from forty to sixty millions of dollars annually and cast it as an additional burden upon poverty and toil that ought not to be commented on it ought not to be mentioned here according to the tender notions of some gentlemen why oughtitnotto bef men have a right to change their opinions great as well as little men often do so but when fifty or sixty million dollars of annual revenue are in the scalewhen a trained lawyer and judge after full argument deliberately reaches a conclusion and then when so iar as we know without additional light without additional good reason to carry him the other way he suddenly when it becomes necessary finds himself upon the side of aggregated wealth and power and monopoly and against the mass of the producers of the land with the result that there is a deficit in the treasury and that heavier burdens must be heaped upon the peoplewhy should there not be some comment what is there wrong in the comment why should it be withheld i said in this house about one year ago and i repeat that when the history of that judge shall be made up and when all else in his life shall have been forgotten his name will be kept from oblivion not for praise but as that of one by whose marvelous conversion a great principle of taxation was for the time overthrown in a land of free people under free institutions what was the great principle of taxation overthrown by that decision of theirs the principle of taxationthe only ruling of the courtwas that an income tax is a direct tax not that no income tax could be imposed on the people of the united states but that it must be apportioned according to the inhabitants of the various states or in the language of the constitution among the several states according to their respective numbers now let us look for a moment at the question and the original argument goes back to the 9th day of july in the city of chicago when william j bryan delivered his famous speech the crown of thorns and cross of gold in which he used the language it was not unconstitutional when it went before the supreme court for the first time i draw the attention of the committee to the fact that there were three questions involved in the incometax case that is to say in the bill in equity brought by mr pollock against the farmers loan and trust company of new york praying that sections 27 to 37 inclusive the incometax sections of the wilson tariff bill should be adjudged to be unconstitutional and void and the points were that the tax on the rents and income of real estate is a tax on the land itself and hence a direct tax under the constitution that the income derived from state and municipal bonds can not be taxed by the federal government and further that a tax upon the income derived from personal property is a direct tax within the meaning of the constitution on the first two questions the court decided in favor of the plaintiff the court decided that to tax the income of municipalities was unconstitutional and void because it involved an attempt to tax the instrumentalities of the states all the eight judges concurred in that view at the first hearing and six out of the eight judges held the tax on the rents and income of real estate to be unconstitutional and void so these gentlemen including mr bryan are wrong when they say that a large part of the act was not held to be unconstitutional on the occasion of the first hearing by the supreme court of the united states now what opinions were then rendered the prevailing opinion was rendered by mr chief justice fuller and mr justice field also filed a concurring opinion the dissenting opinion was rendered by mr justice white and concurred in by mr justice harlan so the record shows that all the judges with the exception of mr justice white and mr justice harlan on the occasion of the first hearing held the tax on the rents and income of real estate to be unconstitutional and void and what proportion of the tax was involved it stated i believe in the second opinion of mr chief justice fuller that that affected somethinglike 39 500 000 000 out of the total of 65 000 000 000 so you see gentlemen that about onehalf of the income tax was held to be unconstitutional before the second hearing occurred in the following may you remember that the first hearing was in march and the decision was filed on the 8th day of april 1895 it is true it was announced in the prevailing opinion on the occasion of the first decision that the court was evenly divided on some points that is upon the question if an income tax be considered an indirect tax whether it should not be uniform and on the question as to whether the invalidity of the provision as to rents and income of land did not necessarily invalidate the other sections of the incometax law applying tb the incomes of personal estate and upon the question whether a tax upon the income of personal estate was a direct tax or not upon those three questions the court was equally divided but i submit to you gentlemen as lawyers that no judge of any c6urt should ever be attacked for changing his opinion on a pure question of law such as that which was involved in this incometax case isubmit that it would be a very dangerous principle to encourage the practice of certain country lawyers when defeated to go down to the tavern and damn the court now gentlemen there is no evidence as to how the judges stood on the points left undecided on the occasion of the rendition of the first decision non constat as far as the record goes that mr justice shiras ever thought that the incometax law was constitutional we know that he thought the tax on the rents and income of land was unconstitutional moreover let us see how fairly they work out the problem mr justice brown another member of the court changed his opinion on the occasion of the second hearing read his second opinionthat is his dissenting opinionon the occasion of the rehearing and you will find that he then held that a tax on the rents and income of land could be upheld and that it was not a direct tax whereas on the occasion of the first hearing he sided with the six judges who formed the majority but no matter how those judges stood or how mr justice shiras stood on the occasion of the first argument i submit it is a dangerous precedent to allow any member of the national legislatureof course he has the power to speak as he sees fitto allow without rebuke any member of the national legislature to attack our great court of last resort and i have deemed that it was right for me as the only member of the committee on appropriations i believe except the gentleman from ohio who is a soundmoney democrat to protest on behalf of the democracy of the north and east against their being held up to the people of this country as in favor either of an income tax or in favor of attacking the supreme court of the united states"], [0.10348093509674072, 0.8965190649032593, 1, "i ask for the reading of the report the report was read as follows the committee on

which settled in his eyes and that his eyes had troubled him from that time upto the time when hewasmustered out of the service because of this testimony special examiner hunter recommended that

to that recommendation the department notified mr scott that unless he produced testimony to the conwrary within thirty days his name would be dropped from the roll for the reason that the disabilities for which he claimed pension had not been incurred in the service of the united states the pensioner offered some additional testimony in support of his claim but at the end of thirty or forty days his name was dropped from the roll the commissioner sending him this communication it appears from the records of this bureau that you were pensioned march 9 1883 under certificate 229326 at the rates of 6 per month from august 12 1i5 8 from january 1 1878 24 from january 18 1882 0 from march 3 1883 for disease of eyes increased to 50 from february 11 1885 and to 72 from july 1 1885 for same resulting in total blindness based on services as private company m fifth iowa cavalry it further appears from evidence obtained on special examination now on file in this bureau that the alleqed disease of eyes was not dub to your service as required by law to give title to pension but was iicurred prior to enlistment the granting of pension to you for the same was therefore erroneous under the provisions of the act of congress of december 21 1893 you will be allowed a period of thirty days from the receipt of this notice in which to file testimony in rebuttal of the evidence referred to and if the same is not satisfactory and no sufficient reason appears why an extension of time should be made your name will be dropped from the pension roll at the end of the time indicated above the letter from the commissioner states that the pensioner was dropped from the roll for the sole reason that the disability for which lie was pensioned existed prior to his enlistment i call attention to this letter for the purpose of showing that the government abandoned the idea that the man could see and finally basedits action upon the fact that the disability had not been incurred in the service of the united states now by turning to the message of the president of the united states it will readily be seen that the president did not for himself investigate these papers and proofs but contented himself with the bare presumption upon which he bases his veto that the pension bureau had acted fairly and justly in making the investigation before mr scott was dropped from the pension roll now i want to suggest to the house that it seems to me if this pensioners right must rest upon a presumption that the presumption ought to be that the man when he was accepted and enlisted into the military service upon an examination made by the government and served his three years as a soldier and then reenlisted in the service of his country again examined and accepted before a surgeon appointed by the governmentthe presumption ought to be that the surgeon performed his duty and did not accepta man who was unfit to become a soldier and unable to discharge the duties required of him again it seems to me if the president desired to indulge in presumptions that he might have with perfect propriety presumed that the congress of the united states had investigated this matter that in considering and passing a bill giving this man 72 a month it also did its duty and so if this case should rest upon presumption alone i contend that the bill should pass over the veto of the president but i am not here insisting that this bill shall rest upon any presumption whatever i have in my hand the entire testimony submitted to the pension bureau in the case and i hfvie examined that testimony with great care i am here prepared to say to the house without fear of successful contradiction that the testimony overwhelmingly shows that the mans disability was incurred in the service of the united states and not prior thereto now it will be seen that the real question for the house to determine is whether or not the disability of jonathan scott which is now conceded to be total blindness was incurred in the line of duty and in the service of the united states or whether that disability existed prior to that time i will now take up and examine as briefly as i can the testimony for the purpose of showing you that an outrage has been perpetrated on this old soldier the report made by special booth shows ten affidavits they are all here in the papers i hold in my hand and any gentleman can examine them who has the slightest doubt with reference to the representations i am making to you as to their contents the first affidavit and one which the department seems to lay great stress on is that of dr g a waters and i submit that under ordinary circumstances that testimony ought to be entitled to very much weight because the man is a man of position and character and testified that he had attended jonathan scott as his family physician from 1854 up to the time he entered into the service of the united states and that he accompanied him into the

at the manner in which they have been brought before this house when these propositions involving an important international question affecting the relations of comity between two governments were first brought before the house of representatives the distinguished chairman of the committee on foreign affairs proposed to railroad them through on a debate limited to twenty minutes on each side now i am a new member and a young one and far be it from me to seem even remotely to criticise the methods of procedure that obtain in this house but i have seen this legislative assemblage spend hours and hours in what appeared to me idle and fruitless disputation on subjects infinitely less important than this were i to cite an example i might refer to discussions on such questions as whether eight or ten more pages should be employed in the service of this house or whether the compensation for ten or twelve more charwomen should be included in a general appropriation bill it would seem to me therefore that the way in which the cuban question has been brought before the house of representatives is neither in accord with the sentiment of the american people nor consistent with the dignity of this body i for one decline to believe thatjhe applause of the galleries is the voice of the american people i have an impression that the great body of thoughtful citizens in this republic deprecate the war talk of this house and of the other legislative branch of the government and i am convinced that the conservative sense of this nation is against idle and officious intermeddling affecting relations of friendship between this government and foreign powers i desire to say in addition that it has occurred to me that the house committee on foreign affairs was established to prevent exactly the condition of things which that same committee has brought about on the floor of this house by any proper conception of their duties they should have acted as a brake upon the war talk and war clamor which have disturbed and are disturbing the business interests of this republic as one of the majority loyal to that committee i must enter a protest against the manner in which on the contrary they have seemed to lead the procession of jingo enthusiasm i say i am going to vote for these resolutions and why because i yield to no man in my devotion to human liberty or in my feelings of sympathy for the struggling patriots of cuba but sir between sympathy and international procedure between impulse and government there is a wide dissociation what sort of a government are we asked to recognize a government whose seat is a saddle whose capital is a burro whose chief of state is a general in the field but let no gentleman understand me as casting any reflection on these conditions because in that saddle may ride human liberty and on that burro may depend the hope of a nations success but my friends by all the established rules of international law we recognize only such governments as those with which we may actually treat the gentleman from new york who spoke next before the last said we should brush aside all considerations of international law in that expression he appears to voice exactly the methods and procedure of the committee of which he is a member because to judge from their attitude toward the international questions that have come before this session of the house they are of the belief that we should dispense with the state department altogether and carry on our foreign affairs by legislative precipitation we have here unquestionably a great duty to perform but if we desired to place the sentiment of this country on record in behalf of the cuban insurgents we could have done it in a manlier way by adopting straight and aboveboard resolutions of sympathy with that struggling people but it was the duty of the foreign affairs committee not to place us in the false position that if we voted against these resolutions of possible intervention we might thereby seem to exhibit indifference or hostility to the efforts of those gallantly struggling for national freedom as the case now stands we are given no choice in the matter we are forced to vote for the resolutions lest by proceeding along the established line of international law and voting against them we should strike down a people that for over a year have
