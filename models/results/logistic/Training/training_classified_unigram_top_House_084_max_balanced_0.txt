of the action of the continental congress which on june 14 1777 adopted a resolution which stated that the flag of the 13 united states shall be of 13 stripes of alternate red and white with a union of 13 stars of white in a blue field representing the new constellation it was not until 1889 however that the anniversary of the adoption of the flag was observed in that year prof george bolch principal of a free kindergarten for the poor in new york city decided to hold patriotic exercises on that day his inauguration of this program aroused such interest that the state department of education in new york arranged to have the day observed in all the public schools and not long afterward the state legislature passed a law providing thatit shall be the duty of the state superintendent of public schools to prepare a program making special provision for observance in tne public schools of lincolns birthday washingtons birthday memorial day and flag day in conforming with this law the superintendent of public schools in the state of new york ordered that the flag should be displayed on every publicschool building at 9 oclock in the morning and that there should be patriotic exercises with a history of the flag and the singing of songs eight years after the observance of the first flag day in 1897 the governor of new york issued a proclamation ordering the display of the flag over all public buildings in the state this was the first official recognition of the anniversary of our flag outside of the schools on a statewide scale several years earlier the mayor of the city of philadelphia in response to a resolution of the society of colonial dames of pennsylvania ordered the display of the flag on the public buildings in the city flag day finally received nationwide recognition when president woodrow wilson issued a proclamation for the observance of flag day on june 14 1917 since then flag day has been observed with appropriate ceremonies throughout the united states but has not been designated as a legal holiday i firmly believe that flag day should be designated as a legal holiday and i have introduced h r 323 which would provide that the 14th day of june of each year be made a legal public holiday in the same manner as the 1st day of january the 22d day of february and other established legal holidays in my opinion that is more important now than at any time in our history we need loyal citizens today who love the united states of america and honor our stars and stripes and give thoughtful consideration to our national emblem and to the principles it represents as henry ward beecher expressed it a thoughtful mind when it sees a nations flag sees not the flag but the nation itself and whatever may be its symbols its insignia he reads chiefly in the flag the government the principles the truths the history that belong to the nation that sets it forth the american flag has been a symbol of liberty and men rejoice in it men and women from all parts of the earth today come eagerly to the united states drawn by our precious heritage of freedom many have lived under tyrannical oppression even as our ancestors who sought personal liberty and religious freedom in america and it is our solemn duty today as stated so aptly in the preamble to our constitution to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity on this flag day of 1955 i have urged that in addition to the usual public ceremonies we might as individuals or in family groups hold special observances of flag day displaying the flag at home or at places of business and upon the occasion of this display pledge allegiance to the flag and all it stands for including the new words of the pledge one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all if we are to defeat the forces of communism and collectivism loose in the world today which would subjugate the individual to the will of the state and strip every man of all personal volition and freedom to think act and speak as his personal convictions dictate then we must cherish and preserve here in the united states our love of independence which has brought the united states to a position of leadership in the free world and has made this nation the major hope of the world for eventual peace and freedom from the threat of communist aggression may we all

california has made a very fine statement of the economics of the project and its effect upon reclamation in the west and in the nation generally in the few minutes i have at my disposal i wish to bring to you a picture of the physical area concerned and also a very short statement of the legislation itself the area of the colorado river reaches from the southern parts of wyoming the northern parts of colorado and utah to the gulf of california because of differences had during the early part of this century over the use of the water and the possible future uses of the water a compact was entered into by representatives of the seven states concerned the compact provided that the water of the colorado river or rather the use of the water of the colorado river would be divided at lees ferry as far as the quotas between the two areas were concerned lees ferry is just south of the boundary between arizona and utah too the lower basin was guaranteed the first 71 2 million acrefeet of water the upper basin was guaranteed the second halfwhatever that might be and if the water was not there the upper basin would be the one that would be short also the lower basin was allotted an extra million acrefeet of water which either rises within the bed of the river itself or rises from tributaries below lees ferry that was the colorado compactsolemnly entered into by the states and approved by the congress of the united states in 1923 i can advise my colleagues without any fear of contradiction that the legislation proposed in h r 3383 is in compliance with the colorado river compact and the other compacts and agreements which go to make up the law of the river already since 1930 some 400 million of federal moneys have been spent to develop the area south of lees ferry mostly in southern california or along the river itself since 1939 and 1940 moneys have been given to the bureau of reclamation for expenditure in the upper basin to investigate and survey and make reports on projects which would do for the upper basin what has been done for the lower basin the reason the work has not proceeded faster is because the contribution from the boulder canyon fund is only 500 000 a year and the amount appropriated by congress has not been sufficient to firm up a faster job but as the gentleman from california has said in 1946 the department of the interior filed with the congress its first report it filed with the congress its second report on the colorado river in 1947 with the statement of the various states all of them favorable since that time we have been busy trying to draft legislation to bring before the congress to start the development of resources mostly water resources but other developments too that necessarily go along with it in the upper basin the bill now before this committee provides for 4 major units 3 of which are power producing units and 1 of which is regulatory in streamflow only i will name them the glen canyon dam with which i think you are familiar i think you are also familiar with the flaming gorge dam and may i suggest that there are those of us who still think the echo park site was more to be desired than flaming gorge but we have been defeated in our purpose and we are willing to abide by the decision of the committee and have taken flaming gorge in the northern part of utah in place of echo park while doing this we have entered into an agreement with the conservationists to the effect that we would not trespass upon any national park or national monument area in the construction of projects

hear the representative of the department of commerce and others on the newsprintsupply situation in the united states i am sure that almost every member of this body is acquainted with the critical situation in the suppy of newsprint i know that this subcommitee through its chairman mr klein will delve thoroughly into this situation in order to understand why many companies are not fulfilling their contracts with the newspapers of this country while these same companies are allowing their newsprint to appear onthespot market at prices almost 40 percent more than the prices contained in contracts with newspapers some of the large companies supplying almost 75 percent of the newsprint of this country have indicated that they will not make up for their failures to comply wtih their contracts in 1955 in addition they have notified most of their customers that they intend to cut back 71 2 percent on their contract for 1956 all of this has been taking place while their same paper is appearing on what i would term the gray market at tremendously increased prices in normal times the spotmarket price would be somewhat below the contract prices between the newsprint company and the newspaper today in the middle west the ordinary contract price between the newsprint company and the newspaper is around 130 to 140 in spite of this the spotmarket operator is sending out letters like the folowing gentlemen we are looking ahead for 1956 as newsprint is getting very scarce and prices are going up we suggest in the event you should require additional tonnage for the year we want to offer our services to you in purchasing your requirements we would like you to let us know ahead of time the sizes you use so that we can scout around this market to get you newsprint at a low price instead of paying very exorbitant prices on short notice when you need it we promise you that at all times we will deliver to you the finest quality of newsprint in the proper size that you use as we did in the past please advise us immediately if you are interested for immediate or future delivery and we will quote you our lowest price p s canadian or american immediate shipment 2 carloads between january 2 and 10 sizes 15 15 16 30 31 and 32inch canadian wire immediately if interested you will note that in this letter he does quote his prices however newspapers in the middle west who have contacted these kind of operators find that the going price today is about 210 there is a rumor now in the chicagodetroit area that the graymarket price is to be increased to 220 i think it is apparent to any reasonable observer that when legitimate newspapers cannot get newsprint at contract prices and when apparently graymarket paper is available in almost any quantities for 40 percent more in price something is seriously wrong in the newsprint industry letters similar to the one i have indicated above are being sent out in great numbers by the spotmarket or graymarket operators indicating that paper in almost any amount can be bought providing the newspaper is willing to pay the graymarket price from figures i have at this time from the american newspaper publishers association the four large newsprint companies last year made excellent dividends in addition these companies within the past few months have increased prices 10 per ton it would appear to me at this time that there is concerted effort at pricefixing in the newsprint field i am hoping that a determination of this question will be made in these hearings beginning tomorrow if there is violation of

for a living you live in the big cities and the large towns you probably think that the farm problem does not touch you many of you think about the farmer only when you go to the grocery store and spend more and more of your pay checks for groceries your thoughts then are harsh ones you do not realize that the farmer gets a very small portion of the dollars you pay for your food and that portion is getting smaller the farmers share of the dollars you pay for your food was 53 percent in 1945 it was 41 percent in 1955 the farmers share of your food dollar has been steadily declining and

it means is this if a farmer could buy a hat 20 years ago for a bushel of wheat the farmer ought to be able to buy a hat today for a bushel of wheat all parity really means is a fair price now we do not say that the farmer must get a fair price for his crop all we say is that the farmer should get 90 percent of the fair price would you settle for only 90 percent of a fair wage do you think your telephone company would be happy with only 90 percent of the fair rate they feel they are entitled to 100 percent parity is just an insurance policy the government has been issuing similar insurance to us for decades your social security payments are a kind of insurance the protective tariff for business the subsidies to airlines and to the shipping industry the land grants which made our

administration bill and the one that i introduced was the deletion of one project this happened to be in the state of massachusetts the west hill project other than that the administration bill is the same as the bill i introduced on the 3d of january at the request of the new england governors as soon as this request was received by the committee about the middle of january the panel chairman the

was also defeated in the committee that is why we are appealing to the membership of this house to restore what the president has asked this house to do in this emergency bill this is something that everyone is united on in new england whether we are democrats or republicanswhether senator or representative or governor of a new england statewe are all here together at this time asking the membership of this house to support us in this particular emergency when other emergencies arise all over the country whenever it is determined to be an emergency we expect to give that type of support we from new england have been supporting these projects for many years this is the first time in history that new england has come to the congress of the united states for this type of help

and some work that was being carried on in projects in connecticut and massachusetts would be stoppedthat they would be stopped in their tracks as of now mayor coleman is naturally very much concerned about the possibility of this project or survey being held up for lack of funds in our conversation he once again stressed the great importance the project has to the entire economy of the city of woonsocket and its environs he cited the fact that the french worsted co the largest textile manufacturing plant in woonsocket with employment of about 500 people had been severely hit by last years floods in addition the argonne worsted co the verdun worsted co and many other textile plants and dye houses had severely suffered the entire mercantile district the center of the social district was devastated in the august flood causing at least 2 million in damage a particular point which mayor coleman asked me to make clear was the feeling of insecurity which so many small concerns had regarding future plans for the area one of these businesses a woodworking company owned by the brodeur family is faced with that problem although hard hit last year they would like to expand their present facilities but they are holding back on their decision until they hear definitely whether or not a floodcontrol project is to be authorized for the lower reaches of the blackstone river within the city of woonsocket they feel that there is no point in spending more money at the present location if they have no protection that is a feeling which a good many owners of small businesses have
