that these scarcities to which i have referred have largely been brought about by reason of the exportation of foodstuffs to europe and elsewhere all over the world and by reason of the price ceilings of the opa may i ask at the outset what has this administration done or is now doing to help promote the program to produce the necessary food that will win the peace and stop the world from being taken over by the communists the answer is very little because we find that those in power and the bureaucratic agencies which it has created fail to recognize that it requires experienced manpower adequate machinery and a proper incentive for the farmers of our country to produce the food and feed which is so essential here and elsewhere we find that the many labor disturbances which now exist in some of the leading farmmachinery manufacturing companies are preventing production of necessary farm machinery and this same condition has obtained for many months recently it was discovered that a rule or order was in the makingand it is probably in effect at this timewhereby this administration is to seize and require the shipment of 7 2 per cent of all tractors made in this country to russia that proposed requirement has been kept secret but the farmmachinery manufacturers have at least disclosed this plan and that the civilian production administration now contemplates such action which if put into effect will make some very serious inroads against the ability of our farmers to procure these needed tractors for our use in this country there is no good reason for us to send anything to russia because she has failed and refused to cooperate with us and other nations in international affairs if and when russia cooperates with us and the world then if there is need for helpand we can aid herwe will come to her rescue as will other nations unless something is done to aid in providing our farmers with farm machinery so thay may go forward and produce the essential foodstuff we may have a famine in the united states within the next 9 months in the eastern portion of our nation there are now wheat fields and hay fields that remain uncut because there is no available farm help which can be secured to help save those crops yet there are 3 000 000 people now on the federal pay roll at least onehalf of that number are not needed at all but the administration keeps them the taxpayers have to pay the bill on many occasions congress has cut down the appropriations in many of the departments in a goodfaith effort to force a reduction in the number of the employeesbut in those instances the administration now in power merely transfers those employees for whom no appropriation was made into another and a different department of government practically all of them are kept on the pay roll many of those needless employees now drawing fat salaries from our government could be used to a very great advantage in helping to save the crops and the food this outrageous plan of federal spending the taxpayers money for needless things must be stopped one thing this administration can do which it has failed to do up to the present is to discontinue taking essential farm boys and farm workers from the farms in america and inducting them into the military service during peacetime that is one act this administration can do to help in this frightful food and feed shortage yet no action is taken even to this late date they continue to take the farm help yet the war is over and it is almost impossible to buy a loaf of bread a piece of meat a pound of butter or a box of washing powder there is always a reason for such an unexplainable situation what is that reason those in power in our government in washington have utterly failed to make any plans after last years abundant crops to cover food and feed requirements and commitments for domestic and foreign consumption the only policy they have adopted is the policy of scarcity that policy has been promoted by economic stabilizer chester bowles and that policy is now bringing our country face to face with the most serious food crisis in history commitments were made without any regard to our production our reserves or our own requirements since vjday the exportimport bank has made foreign loans without any congressional knowledge or sanction aggregating 3 467 500 000 a large portion of which was spent for food in this country records of that bank disclose the following loans were so madeand this was lending the taxpayers moneyupon such security as those in power might determine france 1 912 500 000 great britain 650 000 000 netherlands 300 000 000 russia 280 000 000 belgium 100 000 000 norway 50 000 000 finland 50 000 000 greece 35 000 000 italy 25 000 000 and to many others in varying amounts yet in the fact of all of that aid almost every flour mill in our country was besieged with orders for flour from britain and other countries and they paid us cashthat was the same money we had loaned to them this food acquired by foreign interests was purchased at opa ceiling prices and we have received authentic information that the foreign buyers of our food resold it to their own people and in other countries at a tremendous profit that is certainly a new and a novel policy in dealing with hungry people i am uncertain as to whether our people are generally aware of the fact that a large percentage of the food which is now being sent out of our country is being resold at fancy blackmarket prices to people in other countries it is quite a problem to determine how the hungry people who have no money can secure any amount of food for their sustenance we have ever been a most charitable people and we have ever stood readyand we now stand readyto make great sacrifices to help our destitute neighbors but we falter in our effort when we learn of the unthinkable things that are now taking place for instance russia took all of the grain out of poland after last years harvest and now we are called upon to provide food for poland great britain is now trying to take credit for our american food shipped to greece italy and other countries that is bringing international power politics into the distribution of food and the feeding of the hungry such a policy should never be countenanced during the past 12 months approximately 400 000 000 bushels of american wheat and corn have been exported to fill foreign demands failure to plan properly last fall to meet export requirements of grains brought about the initiation of many uneconomic and unusual policies by the administration which will seriously reduce our food supply for many months to come bread lines now exist in many parts of our country and meat formations are to be observed in many places flour mills are unable to buy wheat because the government bought all that was available and gave a 30cent bonus per bushel above the legal ceiling price this attitude placed our farmers in a very serious situation becaus6 they could not buy and pay 30 cents per bushel above the legal ceiling price without becoming liable to prosecution for noncompliance with the price ceilings the result was the government secured the available supply of those grains and our farmers who had insufficient grain to carry them through were compelled to sell their livestock now a new plan is proposed by the government when our farmers take a load of wheat to the mill our government by and through a bureaucratic order issued seizes and confiscates onehalf of that load and the farmer can only rely upon onehalf of his delivery for the benefit of himself and family and his neighbors for food purposes many mills have closed down and their employees have been thrown out of their jobs on the other hand the canadian mills are operating and they are producing white flour while we in the united states are forced to change from 72percent extraction white flour to 80percent dark flour it has been reported that canada has on hand sufficient wheat to allocate 9 bushels to every citizen while we have a supply sufficient only to allocate sixtenths of 1 bushel to each citizen also our government cornered the market on corn by making purchases of available corn and it bought some 35 000 000 bushels at a blackmarket price of 30 cents a bushel above the legal ceiling price established by opa by reason of that cornering process the legitimate buyers of feedand that includes manufacturers dealers and farmers were unable to secure feed grains for dairy and beef cattle hogs and poultry the fact is we have lost about 700 000 tons of mill feed during the last 6 months because of the government requirement that mills produce 80 percent extraction flour and much more was lost when the government refused until quite recently to sell or loan wheat to mills for grinding flour when those in power seized the blackmarket purchases of wheat and corn the opa increased the ceiling price on corn 25 cents per bushel and also made an increase in the ceiling on other feeds this was done without making any compensatory increase in the ceiling price of beef hogs poultry and dairy products however very recently dairy products were slightly increased this policy throws feeding ratios out of balance and under that plan our farmers will lose money when forced to pay higher prices for corn and other feeds i am constrained to say that the scarcities to which i have referred have largely been brought about by mr chester bowles and his policy making group i am convinced the people realize that fact because they have followed this question very closely throughout the past it is a man made or a group made scarcity under that plan of scarcity the needed food and other essential commodities have been withheld from the people the fact is mr bowles and his crowd want to remain in power even though this late war is now over and they want to continue to control the lives business and destiny of every citizen in our land of course this plan and policy is contrary to the american way of life i propose a planwhich i firmly believe will be very helpful this is my plan there should be an immediate readjustment in the price of hogs cattle poultry and poultry products sufficient to compensate for the increase in prices of corn and all other feeds i am confident this would aid materially in encouraging production there should be an immediate cancellation of the 80percent extraction order to save wheat and flour this would also provide vast quantities of millfeed for domestic use our flour mills in this country should be encouraged and permitted to operate full time and full capacity in producing flour for domestic use all government blackmarket operations in grain feed lumber and all other commodities should be stopped government officials should be subjected to the same penalties for such offenses as our private citizens our people should be encouraged to produce all the grain food feed and civilian goods including farm machinery that can be produced under which method the price controls can and should be removed the ageold plan of supply and demand has never been found to be wanting in any particular it is evident to all of the people that the future solvency of our nation depends and will continue to depend upon the reduction of all government spending this 3ending must be cut to the bone this can and should be accomplished by a material reduction of all government personnel in every department of our government to peacetime requirements all bureaucracy which now exists in washington should be entirely eliminated because that element seeks to destroy our liberty and freedom lastly we must keep our country strong strength cannot develop under a plan of scarcityit can only develop under a plan of plenty"], [0.005766807124018669, 0.005766807124018669, 0, "perhaps at the outset i ought to observeand i think your own observation will coincidethat a rather distressing altitude has brown up in congress the word million does not mean anything any morc we have just knocked out the m and supplanted it with a b and we have thought so long and earnestly in terms of billions that it becomes rather difficult for us i suppose to orient our thinking to a little bill that involves 6 750 000 but as we go along we have got to reorient our thinking a million dollars is still a lot of money out in my country i think it is still a lot of money in every section of the country perhaps we ought to sit at the feet of dr einstein and develop some practical ideas of relativity when i think of the sixandthreequartersodd millions involved here i thipk in terms of the entire tax take by the federal government in the form of income tax from thirty or forty thousand american families this helps me get my feet on the ground the amount of money involved here will probably be the equivalent of the total income tax that is squeezed out of the 35 000 families in the city of peoria ill and since it is almost an incidental function it takes on some new significance for me that is not quite the whole story originally there was supplied in the first supplemental defense appropriation bill 650 000 obviously to initiate this census program after a while we added 7 200 000 when the census people got into the field and found they could not get enumerators for an average of 89 cents a schedule which plus overtime would be about 1 02 per schedule they came back for this deficiency that is before us today there thus will be expended on this agricultural census something like 14 750 000 that is a lot of money for a census in only one field of american endeavor that is the proposition before us let us look at the status of this activity for a moment they tell us that something like 2 000 000 has been obligated this may be right and it yet may not be exactly right but let us assume for all practical purposes that 2 000 000 has been allocated then the argument has been advanced that since the law makes it mandatory since the statute says an agricultural census shall be taken and since area officers have been sent out and some enumerators have been recruited therefore ipse dixit we must proceed with this matter i do not follow that line of reasoning at all the fact of the matter is that the law does not say when this must be done it says that a quinquennial census shall be taken it does not provide a specific date we can take it in the latter part of 1945 as well as in the first part of 1945 we can devise ways whereby we can save a little money and still get the information desired at the very outset perhaps we should be clear as to what the law really does provide the authority for an agricultural census is found in title 13 section 216 of the 1940 code and provides that there shall be in the year 1935 and once every 10 years thereafter a census of agriculture and livestock which shall show the acreage of farm land the acreage of the principal crops and the number and value of domestic animals on the farms and ranges of the country there you will find the whole mandate in the law it should be remembered however that since congress enacted the law providing for a census congress can expressly repeal or can make it inoperative by refusing to provide the funds i believe that fact is implied in any statute which the congregs might enact the very fact that the law is quite specific on the items to be surveyed in such a census would indicate that congress was endeavoring to apply a limitation the law does not say a lot of other things that we find in the proposed census for instance in the schedule i have there is a question whether the operator lives on the farm whether the operator began to operate this farm and so forth what difference does it make so long as war food is being produced how many days did the operator work off the farm during 1944 and did he work for pay is that essential at this time they say here that emphasis has got to be placed on the production of food as a munition of war they also ask the method of rental at a time like this when we are engaged in a war when we are in a critical period what difference does it make how a farmer rents whether it be for cash or on shares give the number of stock and machinery owned by the landlord that is very important but does it affect the production of war food and the formulation of these programs that they say are before us in fabricating a program for next year what are the number of occupied and unoccupied dwellings on the farm is that so essential does the farm have electricity does it have running water does it have a radio does it have a telephone well i could take the last census and answer that because i know how priorities have been handled by the war production board i can tell them from the last census pretty nearly how many telephones there are cn the farms of the country right now there are questions also about machinery and about tractors how many boys and girls under 14 how many men and women and boys and girls over 14 you could take the figures of 1940 minus the mortalities which are all recorded down here and the census bureau could tell you pretty well the point i am trying to make is that in the justification for this census the census bureau sets forth in its testimony before the subcommittee on deficiencies that the information to be obtained in this census is essential for planning war and postwar programs involving the determination of food allotments the development of food distribution programs the formulation of price policies the mobilization of manpower for agriculture and similar programs it is doubtful therefore whether a good deal of the information which is required in the forms which have already been prepared has any direct bearing upon the objectives cited to the committee let it be emphatically understood that if a census of this nature is to be taken at this time i have no objection whatsoever to obtaining information on the items now carried in these schedules but the point must not be overlooked that we are in war we are constantly spending borrowed funds and it is so eminently proper for the congress to determine the necessity and the advisability of the census at this time i am not one of those who believe that thrift is synonymous with hoarding because there are times when the best kind of thrift is to spend money nor do i believe that in order to achieve economy there must be an indiscriminate lopoff of federal functions i do mean to say however that a proper perception of thrift requires prudence in expenditure and that there should be an endeavor to secure value for whatever money is appropriated it therefore behooves us to look at this in a practical and prudent way the census bureau is going rather far afield in this matter i contend that as we examine the whole proposition before us we could let this thing lay a little while and see whether or not the people in the department of agriculture can ascertain and gather together the essential information upon which to predicate a war food program we could do that now then we could obtain the other data at some later time i say we can do it now because i think we have the manpower in the various federal agencies to produce the data which may be essential i went back to the agricultural appropriation bill to see just what we do have and i discovered some very interesting things these are the statements that were given to us on the agricultural appropriation bill for 1945 by the departmental authorities themselves we had all of them before us including the secretary of agriculture we have today 4 050 fulltime people in the a a a in addition to that we have 9 093 county committeemen who operate on a per diem basis we have 104 700 community committeemen scattered all over the country in addition to that the farm security administration has 9 514 people for whom we have appropriated funds and who are presently on the pay roll then to makeit even more complete we have a statistical agencyand it is a good agencyin the department of agriculture called the bureau of agricultural economics how many people has it on the pay roll it has 769 now by the very simple process of addition draw a line and what have you you have 127 000 people identified with agriculture and with the action programs of the federal g3vernment in every county in every one of the 3 105 counties of the united states is there anyone here and now who would say that we have got to spend this amount of money to get the information that the statute calls for namely the value and number of livestock the acreage and principal crops and the total acreage that is what is asked for i think i can establish to your satisfaction that the bureau of agricultural economics has done a pretty fair job in this field every month you get this little document that is known as the agricultural situation gotten out by the department of agriculture this one is dated january 1945 this issue consists of 25 pages it contains commodity reviews tables showing parity prices a very extensive article on 1945 agricultural goals for commodities and livestock a general survey of the food situation a number of articles dealing with the various agricultural sections of the country in it you will find estimates on hogs and cattle on farm labor and poultry on fruit and soybeans on food and feed grains and a host of other material all of which has been brought down to date by means of spot checks throughout the country most of this information is developed in the bureau of agricultural economics give ear for a moment as i read you from it under the subdivision poultry and eggs on page 20 an article prepared by mr t s thorfinnson of the bureau of agricultural economics the number of hens and pullets in the plains states on january 1 1944 was 63 6 million or 57 percent higher than the average for the 5year period 193741 where did they get that figure they tell you exactly how many chickens there are in the country they make spot checks from time to time and i think those would be useful and serve our purpose in devising the warfood program that lies immediately ahead you can examine this and it will give you the figures not for 1940 but for january 1 1944 and subsequent dates as to how much poultry there is how many sheep lambs hogs cattle mules colts and bushels of grain of all kinds in storage under seal on the farms in the elevators and everywhere"], [0.007963299751281738, 0.9920367002487183, 1, "i move that the house resolve itself into the committee of the whole house on the state of the union for the

property is the fruit of labor property is desirable it is a positive good in the world that some should be rich shows that others may become rich and hence is just encouragement to industry and enterprise let not him who is houseless pull down the house of another but let him work diligently and build one for himself thus by example assuring that his own shall be safe from violence when built i am one of the coauthors of the original patman bill and perhaps i feel impelled to speak briefly now because i find intolerant language used toward some of us who are coauthors of that bill charges of fraud charges of intention to defeat the american way of life to deceive the american people i am a lawyer by profession in that profession we learn to respect the opinion of our opponents even though we differ with that opinion a state of mind in the thinking of legislators which is so closed that it does not admit of any truth or sincerity or patriotism in the plans and thinking of that other american across the aisle from you is not conducive to sound legislative results in the interest of the public good an attitude of mind which thinks habitually in terms of suspicion and contempt for that other americans opinion is a form of intolerance and egotism which bears no good results for the american people i am 1 of the 116 coauthors of the patman bill i was honored to be one for i believe in the proposition that if there is full employment for the american man and women then there will be increasingly higher levels of life yes higher levels of daily life for the american people on all human experience fronts in proportion as there is full employment there will be full purchasing power and full production depends upon a full ability to purchase the products of full production manufacturers make their money profits off of the sale of their wares the more sales they make presumably they make more profits but folks who have no work cannot buy and pay cash for wares produced in our factories unless they have opportunity for the full employment best enabled to raise the standards of living of the families of america full production is dependent upon a full buying power a full buying or purchasing power depends upon job opportunities for the american people i believe it necessary and sound in our american way of free competitive enterprise that employing industry have opportunity for full steam ahead in production we have produced for war now let us produce for peace our competitive system can do this provided however that a full job opportunity is available to every honesttogod american who is industrious and forthright to work as fully as may be in decent dignified work at a decent wage you will see then why i am for the full employment bill of which i am a coauthor furthermore it is a clear sign of lack of understanding of other americans to argue that those who favor full employment are favoring the state taking over free enterprise such an argument has no application to my thinking or intentions why any american should want to limit job opportunity for any other fellow american is more than i can understand is it untrue that the hope and aspiration of america is that all industrious men shall become free of fear and free from hunger and free from want freedom of press and worship and speech is an empty phrase if honest industrious men cannot find job opportunities the machine age the atomic agethese have combined together to compel us to recognize mans inhumanity to man in matters of allowing the man who works with his hands or brain to rise and live at a level of life consistent with recognition of the declaration that all men are created equal or in the image of god if you think that my extemporaneous remarks are this day too idealistic then mr chairman and my colleagues let me remind you that a nation which places too much emphasis upon the materialistic to the destruction of proper place for the spiritual is a nation which is bound to dissolve and decay to deny creation of a national philosophy which is bounden to not let honest men starve and children not go without schooling and recreation is to deny that our fellow man who is willing and anxious for employment is nevertheless condemned to compulsory idleness with all of its damning and destroying results compulsory idleness comes from lack of job opportunities in almost every case please note that i said compulsory idleness from lack of opportunity to gainfully work at decent wages and honest toil and when mass compulsory idleness comes about again as part of the depression that even you members of this house on the republican side admit will come if certain conditions prevail then our free competitive system is not unlikely to be further weakened and justly condemned as inadequate this full employment bill is a backlog to free enterprise a friend of free enterprise in time of trial and need freedom of enterprise will not survive in its present form if we allow mass compulsory idleness to come about through fault on our part of procrastination or blindness to truth hunger cold lack of opportunity for schooling for children lack of ample necessities of lifethese are determining factors in the progress of our great nation full production and full employment would make lack of the necessities of life impossible for honest men yes i am liberal enough to insist upon the right of all my fellow americans to have full enough job opportunities so that they too regardless of race creed or color can also have a sense of rise in their standards of living from day to day but if this original full employment bill does not pass this day i shall vote for the committee amendment while it shuns the declaration for full employment which i favored as essential yet the committee amendment declares a national policy of high level of employment it does not say how high but the ordinary meaning of the word as compared with the term low or medium or average or other applicable or comparative terms will take care of that when the time comes and as i had no desire to weaken the system of free enterprise it appears to me that the committee amendment also keeps it strong this committee amendment is a definite beginning in the right direction inasmuch as the original bill may not pass today a high level is not a full level but it is higher than our present national level of no declared policy at all as to doing away with compulsory mass idleness money profits are essential as motive for taking money risks for the investment of initiative and for outlet for american resourcefulness and ingenuity but i feel we have so far in this congress magnified the extent of the need or desirability for piling up material gain man never has lived by bread alone and man never can seek primarily to acquire and acquire and acquire more and more and more of the material things to the exclusion of the spiritual unless such man anticipates selfdestruction and moral decay yes we have pretty well taken care of american industry in terms of taxes cutbacks excessprofitstax cancellation and other protection from money losses growing out of this war but what have we yet done to protect and fortify the human body and mind and soul from the ravages of war i do not minimize the proper place of material and money gain as essential but i do say it is high time we recognize in terms of legislative action the fact that men and women of forthrightness ahd morality and industry and with the love of god in their daily lives are the realistic national wealth manhood is higher than money and character is richer than cash the obligation of government is not to control men fully nor is it to enrich a few at the expense of the many there is no security for the few if there is insecurity as to the necessities of life fo the many let us be willing that a1 worthy men shall achieve an abundant life we wantthis for ourselves and feeling that we are entitled to a working condition in which we can deservedly reach this level of living for ourselves we are also obligated to see to it that our neighbors have like opportunity to earn it this is free enterprise in opportunity for employment and advancement i see no reason to think i am unsound in arguing for full employment when these four older statemen of america pronounced for it listen to them franklin d roosevelt chicago october 28 1944 to assure the full realization of the right to useful and remunerative employment an adequate program must and if i have anything to do about it will provide america with close to 60 000 000 productive jobs if anyone feels that my faith in our ability to provide 60 000 000 peacetime jobs is fantastic let him remember that some people said the same thing about my demand in 1940 for 50 000 airplanes harry s truman washington september 6 1945 a national reassertion of the right to work for every american citizen able and willing to work a declaration of the ultimate duty of government to use its own resources if all other methods should fail to prevent prolonged unemploymentthese will help to avert fear and establish full employment the prompt and firm acceptance of this bedrock public responsibility will reduce the need for its exercise i ask that fullemployment legislation to provide these vital assurances be speedily enacted thomas e dewey seattle september 21 1944 if at any time there are not sufficient jobs in private employment to go around the government can and must create job opportunities because there must be jobs for all in this country of ours if there is one thing we are all agreed upon it is that in the coming peacetime years we in this country must have jobs and opportunity for all that is everybodys business therefore it is the business of government herbert hoover newark september 18 1928 i wish to lay down the proposition that the very prerequisite the very foundation of economic progress to our industrial and business employees is full and stable employment a continued surplus of unemployed workers means decreasing wages increasing hours and fear for the future to protect labor to maintain its prosperity to abolish poverty we must so organize our economic system as to provide a job for all who have the will to work when patrick henry said give me liberty or give me death he was not pronouncing for the protection of a material thing it was a patriotic and positive assertion for the preservation of an everlasting and necessary principle of human conduct and of an enduring human relationship patrick henry knew that where there was no liberty there was no chance for human happiness it was for this indestructible essential of daily life for which he was willing to die this leads me to observe that the evolvement of civilization demonstrates that material things are only of real value as they contribute to the progress and happiness of human kind material things are made for man and not man for material things any other deduction would enslave the very souls and spirits of men to unworthy objectives i mentioned liberty as one of the indestructibles of daily living this leads me to add to this list of the indestructibles of human progress and liberty the freedom to think although we may think differently good will amongst men faith in god faith in other human kind too conscience fortitude humility tolerancethese are a few of the absolute necessities in the daily consciousness and conduct of our nation and the victory in war we recently won along side of our allies makes these indestructibles and absolute necessities even more essential than before in our daily approach to and solving of our national and international relationships if you are thinking or would say to me if you had the opportunity that these remarks of mine are too idealistic and are therefore impractical of accomplishment may i remind you that it is still a factand always will bethat a nation without god and a nation without ideologies which keeps that nation on her knees in the terms of a spiritual humility is too materialistic to endure and also that the materialist philosophy that might makes right and that power begets privilege without regard to justice has never yet contributed toward the inspiration of humanity and the raising of the standard of living for the masses of the people and away from serfdom and ignorance yes we have won our recent war against the militarists of germany and japan at the same time the necessary development of and use of the atomic bomb resulted in our own nation becoming the most destructive in the worlds history in time of war or peace granting gentlemen that this development and use was essential to the preservation of the democratic way of life this very possession of the most destructive power within the knowledge of man likewise places upon us the most farreaching responsibility and trusteeship for its sanest and soundest and surest use for the perpetuation and preservation of enduring peace sound judgment and the dictates of selfpreservation compelled us to cooperate with and understand and respect the other allied nationr with whom we fought a common battle of selfdefense we did this in time of war even though we continued to think we had material differences of opinion on some major matters with reference to their forms of government and their economic philosophies as related to our own and whether all of us would have it so or not it clearly appears that our nation is now a member of a world neighborhood of nations and that for this reason we must either learn to live in terms of residence and responsibility in a world neighborhood or not to live in enduring peace and security at all amongst the decisive lessons which the necessities of war have taught us is that there can reasonably be plenty of opportunity and work for earning of money and for material prosperity in our nation and in the world god forbid that it can ever again be truthfully said that our levels of life and living rise more in time of war than in time of peace or that it can ever be said again that our economic expansion and stability depends for its life on a shot in the arm in the form of a world war tablet the war discoveries inventions and advancements discovered and developed by the public treasury and for the public benefit and defense must now be promptly turned to the raising of the standard of livelihood for the people of america and international cartels designed to make millions of money profit out of the slaughter if needs be of the youth of the world have no longer a place in a world which must live together as neighbors in order to survive at all and what of some of our world neighbors can we in good faith and with tolerance and mutual respect criticize condemn even outlaw in our speaking and attitude their right to self determination of their own ways of life is there no room for mutual respect confidence and good faith in the minds and hearts of all thinking and acting men without regard to race creed color or otherwise i do not conceive that we have exclusive ownership or control of all of the good faith justice liberty and desire for peace that exists in the world i therefore emphatically speak for international tolerance international good faith with increased consciousness of and participation in all reasonable steps which may be necessary to establish and preserve an enduring world peace gentlemen anything less than this is to belittle the unselfish sacrifice already made by those who have died in this and other wars that we might have liberty and live more abundantly it will likewise result in the eradication of the fundamental principles of world understanding neighborliness and cooperation which is essential to an enduring world peace there is no other way provided whereby mankind can be saved from the destruction of the essential implements of civilization as the spreading of jealousy hatred suspicion ill will gossip and rumor destroys the possibility of individual neighbors living in terms of neighborhood good will and neighborhood security so in like manner do the same forces destroy the possibility of international neighborhood understanding and cooperation we are in a period of reconversion from what to what is there imagination that we will ever reconvert back to the same normalcy and status existent before pearl harbor such return will be absolutely impossiblefor the discoveries inventions and improvements in transportation communication science manufacture and distribution alone will compel us to raise our standards of living as washington jefferson patrick henry revolted against the status quo as intolerable so we must have our eyes to the east and notonly be willing to live and let live but also be willing to have others enriched by a sense of economic and political advancement and achievement i conceive of my beloved nation reconverting into a land where honest and forthright men and women without regard to race creed or color have a more adequate opportunity to support themselves and their families with dignity with fuller opportunity to work with increasing freedom from the destructive fears and forces which are born out of the womb of greed and intolerance in this period of reconversion it is my belief that we have not yet adequately approached at least two major necessities in such period first and without criticism of any person or any committee for doing or leaving undone anything i nevertheless feel that the gi boys and likewise the girls who served in this war have not yet had adequate or prompt provision made for their fair and just and earliest possible reconversion from youths in uniform to youths in civilian endeavor and life for instance from my native state of california comes reports to me from bankers as well as veteran groups to the fact that it is taking as long as 45 days to process a gi loan this of course in practice amounts to foreclosing the intended use of the 0i bill then i feel that the amount of aid and assistance presently provided in the gi bill for the continuation of education of these distinguished men and women is not adequate hundreds of thousands of them gave up their education voluntarily and those who did not have that privilege were compelled to bear arms and sacrifice their education in order to serve the ideologies of our american way of life can we now do less than to immediately and adequately see that those who seek their schooling and are deserving have it at the earliest possible date the standards of living do not raise sufficiently where there is lack of educational and recreational opportunities we must see to it that this war does not condemn this generation to be an unschooled one because of any lack on our part of doing our fullest duty to prevent such a catastrophe no less than the fullest possible and immediate reforming amendments to change the gi bill in whatever ways may be ascertained as essential can be considered as honorable and fair treatment of those who would have died for us if needs be and secondly i call your attention to the fact that we have already made much provision for the reconversion of machinery and of factories and of the necessary material things in our nation while we have not yet reached our responsibility of recognizing the need of reconversion by the citizens of our nation back to peacetime life and endeavor and is it not true that the machine of the human body and the human temperament with its human limitations of discouragement and despondency is the most delicate machine there is to reconvert granting that it is essential under our competitive system of free enterprise that the money profit motive be encouraged and protected nevertheless we can if we are not very carefulgo to an unnecessary extreme in allowing cutbacks and credits and reducing sources of national income to such an extent that we will not have adequate reserves to protect the needs of the reconversion of the human element in our nation to peacetime life and endeavor my experiences as a member of this great legislative body have been most pleasant i have received the utmost courtesy and understanding from everyone but i am sure you are also aware of the fact that entirely too often for the welfare of our nation and of the world we are not in possession of all of the material facts in connection with the major legislation or decisions which we have to make this fact is most distressing to me i increasingly feel that it is only in the light of an informed democracy that there will be an intelligent acting and therefore an enduring democracy illy or only partially considered legislation i deem as legislation too poorly born the fullest possible opportunity for discussion and debate and discovery in committee and on the floor is an essential prerequisite to sound legislation and therefore to perpetuation of our american way of life less haste will make less waste in the field of legislation as it does in the experiences of daily life our determination in this testing period of our national and international existence and relationships should be to the decision and to the end that there shall be the fullest possible revealing of the true facts and a corresponding freedom of speech and opportunity for expression by and for the american people i have never heard of intolerance of other mens sincere opinions having made any contribution to the preservation of our american way of life i conceive of it as everlastingly true that it is sound to be willing to fight for the other mans right to speak his mind even though he may not agree with me as no nation ever makes material or spiritual progress over the backs of and out of the abuse or misuse of the life of its children and youth so we must increasingly take heed and make reasonable provision for the preservation and continuation of those elements in our national existence which definitely contribute to the upbuilding of the character of american youth and against those factors in our existence which are known to tear down and destroy the all too xapid increase in the child and youth delinquency of our nation is not only appalling it is a matter of immediate and vital concern to the continuation of our nation as one of necessary homes churches and schools just what the states themselves should respectively undertake and do and just the exact field of responsibility which should be occupied by the national government i am not sure of but gentlemen the total field of the problem of the childhood and youthhood of america is rightly of national concern not least of all is this true because it is from the ranks of these future citizens that come the men and women upon whom we call to sacrifice their lives if need be in time of war or national defense i shall not conclude these remarks without calling to your attention that this war would never have been won had it not been for the volunteer spirit of service and sacrifice rendered by those millions of americans who gave of their utmost of material and spiritual resources without a cent of compensation or material reward therefor it is this dominant spirit and fact of selfsacrifice and patriotism in the line of emergency duty to family god and country which has established and preserved our american way of life without discrediting or discounting the high services rendered by those in office or in all organizations wherein they were paid a financial compensation either adequately or inadequately for services rendered yet i think it highly essential that we also give recognition to those millions of men and women and children who rendered services to god and their country and their fellowmen during this war knowing in advance that they had no opportunity of ever receiving either financial compensation or pay therefor it seems to be proved by human experience that we get back what we send forth in our loves or hates or fears or in our prejudices suspicions or our good will and i am frank to say that it seems to me that if the people of certain foreign nations could hear some members of this house speak of their nations in terms of suspicion condemnation and of fear of their purposes and intent and of their alleged lack of good faith or sincere purpose for world peace that then those peoples hearing such declarations on this floor would likewise be justified in suspecting our motives or fairness of dealing as we were powerful in war for winning that war we must likewise be powerful for winning a world peace there is no other way whereby mankind will be saved from selfdestruction by atomic power development and war we will either become civilized enough tolive together or we will fall further and further apart and end in chaos so i bespeak that we give to other peoples of the earth as much credit for good faith in their conduct as we know we ourselves are part entitled to this will build world good will and build for world unity for world collaboration for enduring peace the dictates of selfpreservation in this atomic worldeven if we are not advanced enough to place it on higher groundscompel us to conduct ourselves energetically and in good faith for an enduring world peace by implementing the united nations organization i want that no other parents of any other lad in any land in the universe shall know what it means to raise their son to die in another world war there is no need of it but we must mobilize our hearts and spirits and souls andmaterial resources for it we must be willing to give and take for the sake of peace it is the most important goal within reach of man it must be achieved we must not tolerate any conscious act which will bring us to the precipice of the destroying of world collaboration for peace we should not need the catastrophe of another world war to bring us to the realization that we must work for peace as we also worked and prayed for the end of war peace does not just happen nor will it just continue as a matter of course we will have to fling our heart and soul and mind into the purpose of enduring world peace war is the common enemy of mankind it is a beast which rhust be attacked in force and kept at bay it prospers in greed lust for power hunger hate misunderstanding ignorance of truth there must be millions spent in education for peace through the charter of the united nations research and technological achievements together with an undying human will and patriotism to lprinciple won the war in large

income of 31 000 000 000 we are showing a deficiencyin government operations of over 3 500 000 000 which represents more deficit spending next year the fact that the treasury balance is expected to be reduced instead of increasing the debt is a good sign but continuation of deficit spending in 1947 when we need a balanced budget indicates a lack of grasp of the needs of the united states it is not a satisfactory situation nineteen hundred and fortyseven is the crucial year if we do not balance the budget then it is going to be difficult ever to do it revenues for future years are going to be less because the income of the people is going to be less and taxes are going to be less the budget estimates for the different departments for 1947 are invariably higher for personnel for almost every single activity it is absolutely impossible for us to balance the budget and increase the number of personnel in the departments all the way through some of the departments that show tremendous increases are interior an increase from 234 000 000 to 353 000 000 or 50 percent justice 96 000 000 as compared with 94 000 000 in 1946 labor 128 000 000 as compared with 69 000 000nearly 100 percent state department 146 000 000 as compared with 90 000 000 the treasury department with the exception of war finance division and tax refund estimates shows an enormous increase the commerce department shows an increase from 93 000 000 to 165 000 000 and the department of agriculture shows an increase of 2 400 additional employees the budget recommends enormous sums for food subsidies and for foreign gratuities but nothing is included in estimates of appropriations those figures will increase the public debt by 6 000 000 000 to 10 000 000 000 if president truman has his way how are we going to balance the budget with that sort of thing it is up to the congress to see that this budget is thoroughly reviewed and cuts made to bring it within reason all of the cuts that have been made

proud over the contribution our area has made in building and repairing ships fabricating tanks producing chemicals and turning out an armada of airplanes with which to punish the axis powers i rise today because i am deeply apprehensive about the unprecedented shortages in certain food items which confront the civilian population of puget sound area the unparalleled paucity of meat and sugar seriously threatens not only the morale of all who live in the western part of the evergreen state but it further threatens to hamper and cripple the measure of contribution we have been making and are expected to make and which we are willing to make in the trying days that lie ahead until we have beaten down the sinister nipponese enemy we know that meat and sugar and other food commodities are not to be found in plenitude in other sections of the united states we do not contend that we should be regarded as an especially favored people what i am saying is that with the accent in the current war beamed in the direction of the pacific the states which are situated on the shores of the pacific ocean are feeling the increasing brunt of the burden with each passing week the ports of western washington are being called upon to receive and ship out more military cargo as the tempo of warfare against japan is accelerated tens of hundreds of thousands of soldiers and sailors are moving into our cantonments and receiving barracks for training and organization preparatory to more iwo jimas and okinawas the four transcontinental railroads which reach through the cities of tacoma seattle and other western washington cities are unloading their incalculable tons of supplies and equipment for use against the japs and to sustain our fighting men the war plants of all description including the airplane companies the ship construction yards and the ship repair establishments are working at top speed in these congested war population areas the men and women who weld and rivet hammer and drill design and direct are not getting enough meat or enough sugar to provide a diet adequate to sustain them under the pressures of wartime production which demand a maximum outlay of energy both mental and physical the men and women of my area who contribute directly or indirectly to the successful prosecution of the war are expected to stay on the job our production accomplishment proves they have stayed on the job and produced more and more and more but the hundreds of communications i am receiving from the homes of war workers and from experts who have surveyed the situation all indicate it is getting harder and harder to find food it is literally impossible to find meat butcher shops are closed for several days each week and many are closing their doors for the duration the ration allowance of sugar is not adequate for the average home and home canners are finding it impossible to plan a homecanning program thousands of tons of raspberries loganberries blackberries peaches and other fruits will rot on the ground or wither away on branches because home canners have no sugar there is no freezer storage capacity left for civilian use and commercial canners and packers do not have the sugar or dextrose they need for packing purposes that situation if allowed to continue will spell the death knell for the berry and fruit industry and the packers and canners of my area to say nothing of the lossthe tragic lossof food for the civilian and the military population of the northwest and the united states the sugar production and the potential meat production of the nation and of the countries upon whom we depend for supply has not dropped so low as to provide an obvious sound explanation for the shortages that exist we have had official and unofficial committees of investigation seeking an answer to the sugar and meat situation they have gathered some interesting facts they have made some excellent recommendations as to how to cope with the problem i feel compelled to draw attention to some of the reasons for the shortage in meat supply and the inadequate quantity of sugar available to mr and mrs consumer of my area they are entitled to know explanations will not put more roast beef in their ovens or give them more sugar to can peaches but at least they will know we are finding out what and who is to blame and how we propose to remedy the situation within the limits of our capacity as national legislators on the subject of sugar i charge the executive agencies responsible with failure to allocate sufficient labor and farm machinery to our domestic sugarproducing areas i charge the office of price administration with lax rationing methods resulting in the leakage of approximately 800 000 tons of sugar last year over and above allocations this of course depleted reserve stock more sugar went to home canners and industrial users than had been allocated for that purpose because of faulty calculation of base requirements there are other factors which have affected the supply of sugar from areas outside the continental limits of the united states the cuban sugar supply dropped sharply because of a drought last year the principal reason for our failure to obtain more sugar from cuba and puerto rico was the denial on the part of the office of economic stabilization the war food administration commodity credit and the office of price administration of a high enough price to stimulate sugarcane production in cuba and puerto rico and beetsugar production in our own country incentive payments to growers have been too small and on most occasions have been announced too late to serve the purpose of encouraging production in the case of sugarbeet growers it was natural they would turn to other crops on which the opa permits a more attractive price the house food study committee under the direction of my good friend and colleague clinton p anderson the new secretary of agriculture and other congressional groups have strongly criticized certain federal policies on sugar and meat i join in that strong criticism because to the best of my knowledge at least so far as sugar is concerned adequate steps have not yet been taken to stimulate greater production in my area in 1946 the best information i am able to obtain from impartial sources indicates that we have a huge quantity of livestock on the hoof while the opa is trying to straighten out the tangled rationing mess on red pointsa mess that got its start when the opa failed to keep faith with the american housewife by canceling point values consumers had been told would be good indefinitelyother federal agencies must find a way whereby packers and processors and growers and producers of livestock can get together on an equitable basis and start the cattle that are now on the range through the packing plants to the butcher stores and to the tables of working men and women laboring 12 and 14 hours a day to turn out and repair ships that can go out to sea and face the kamikaze suicide squadrons of the dangerous jap air force growers must have a reasonable profit on their investment and labor packers processors and butchers must fare likewise there can be no skyrocketing inflation of the price mr warworker pays for his pork crops as long as he is held to the little steel formula grower and packer lay themselves open to criticism and appropriate action if they attempt any policy of withholding supplies until they are guaranteed unreasonable and abnormal profit there are some collateral questions which i would like to have answered in connection with food shortages some information has been furnished on one or two of these questions but i want the whole story are the united states military requirements set too high are the allocations for lendlease liberated areas and neutral countries in europe set at too high a figure in light of our domestic minimum needs and the fact we are carrying the brunt the major weight of military production and military attack against japan the combined food board has so far refused to publicize the allocations to individual countries the food produced in america is subject of vital concern to every person within our shores i insist the american people are entitled to be informed on this question within the limits of necessary military security furthermore i would like to know why we cannot encourage beetsugar production unless it can be proven that such action will create a serious shortage in other foods we may find it necessary after a full consideration of all the facts to cut foreign allocations i think we should concentrate on providing more labor and farm machinery to domestic growers if there is no other alternative i urge that we increase incentive payments sufficient to encourage increased sugarbeet planting for harvest in late 1946 and early the food situation is serious i have bitterly inveighed against inaction ineptitude inefficiency and incompetence on the part of those charged with the responsibility for providing the people of america with a minimum quantity of essential food items how stupid it is to force mrs welder or mr riveter to take time from repairing a destroyer so that he or she can stand for hours in a long line waiting to ask a butcher or a grocer for meat and sugar he probably will not have when they get to the counter how we have bungled and fumbled in creating a situation wherein restaurant proprietors because of the new 20 percent cut in their overall point allotments keep open only a few hours each day or a few days each week while shipyard employees go from restaurant to restaurant trying to find one that is open hoping that there is enough food so that they can be served the restaurant owners in my home city of tacoma are facing a critical situation that may force many of them to close their doors until the end of the war if restaurants are to close packers and canners are to curtail operations berry growers are to have their crops rot on the ground what about our agricultural industrial and business economy who will pay the taxes and who will buy the war bonds where will we find the plants to provide employment for our returning veterans i am going to keep on criticizing constructively criticizing in company with many of my colleagues until we force enough people in enough

house for 33 consecutive years and who at the time of his death was chairman of the appropriations committee this grazing act was introduced by congressman taylor at the request of the thousands of sheepmen and cattlemen who were using those remaining unpatented public lands of the west commonly called the public domain as a user of those ranges myself and as president of a western colorado cattle association i took an active part in supporting this program for bringing about a fair equitable distribution of grazing on these public lanas these arid lands have no value for agriculture unless irrigation can be provided but have value during a few weeks in the year for the purpose of limited grazing the fact that these 142 000 000 acres of land located in 10 states had no supervision caused stockmen to use them to excess there was no incentive for conservation or for the preservation of forage for future years promiscuous use of these ranges was bad for the stock for soil conservation and for the relationships between neighbors particularly between sheepmen and cattlemen range wars broke out at intervals and often there was bloodshed overgrazing caused erosion and poor watersheds for the ranches lower down these are the general reasons we asked congress to pass the taylor grazing act the appropriation for which is before us today we in the west did not wish another great intricate bureau such as the national forest service built up but rather our desire was merely to have as small an agency as possible whose duties would be to supervise a fair and equitable distribution of these ranges and to maintain proper safeguards for the conservation and protection of our watersheds to accomplish this a real democratic program of advisory boards was set up that started with the grass roots local elections are provided for in the act whereby the 22 000 users of these ranges may go and select their own representatives on the regional advisory boards equal representation between cattlemen and sheepmen is provided on each board with the sheep permittees voting to select their representatives and the cattle permittees theirs these regional boards of whom there are 600 district advisers at this time pass upon what sheepmen and cattlemen shall use the ranges and how much stock each may run based upon the availability of range forage the general plan is to give the local ranch property owner and taxpayer preference over the migratory stockman who is not a resident of that area and may not even reside in the state these boards composed of local stockmen hold hearings for those who have complaints about the permits allowed or other matters in dispute also representatives are elected to serve on their state and national advisory councils it is one of the greatest attempts of modern times to decentralize a government agency and bring back local selfgovernment such as once existed in the new england town meeting twelve percent of the cattle and 42 percent of the sheep raised in the united states are grazed usually for short periods on land administered by the taylor grazing act this land is divided into 60 grazing districts with 57 administrative units its governing bureau is under the department of the interior and is headed by the director of grazing whose official residence is in salt lake city and an assistant director who lives in washington the grazing districts each have a regional grazier in charge and under him graziers who ride and generally supervise use of the ranges in the original hearings in 1934 when the act was under discussion secretary ickes stated that his department would handle the act with 22 employees and at a cost not to exceed 150 000 the following year the request was for 250 000 and these expenses have increased each year until there are now 250 fulltime grazing employees103 caring for soil and moisture conservation and 19 for range improvementand the amount spent for salaries and expenses last year was 1 017 740 we find today there are not only graziers but range examiners attorneys hearings officers chief of range surveys a chief of information scientists fieldoffice inspectors and so forth one w6nders if we are giving birth to another huge government bureau the grazing service requested for 1946 and received budget approval for 1 485 200 for salaries and expenses and 200 000 for range improvement the appropriations committee cut this to 979 470 for salaries and expenses and 80 000 for range improvement in so doing the committee recommends that the grazing service be selfsupporting and they quote the original hearings to show that that was the original intent it would seem that we have come to the time when the congress the stockmen of the west the secretary of the interior and the taylor grazing service itself should stop and consider what we are doing the total revenues received by this agency for grazing privileges in 1944 was 813 351 96 of this amount as prescribed by law 50 percent was turned over to the 10 states wherein these areas lie in lieu oftaxes so far however the states have returned this money to the grazing service for specific uses such as range improvement reseeding and so forth the law further provides that 25 percent shall be used for range improvement subject to congressional action if all the revenues collected from uses of the range could be used for salaries and expenses the present expenses and income would nearly balance especially when we consider that all these charges should not properly be made against grazing director forsling has stated that he will recommend an in crease in grazing fees of 300 percent they are now 5 cents a month per head for cattle and 1 cent for sheep the stockmen unanimously oppose this increase the matter is being held in abeyance until the mccarran public lands committee of the senate can hold public hearings in those western states and give the local stockmen a chance to be heard on the question it is hoped the house public lands committee will send representatives to attend these meetings also the stockmen will be asked whether they desire all these services at present given and proposed and whether they consider the present fee sufficiently high to cover the services they need and also what proportion of these costs should justly be charged to grazing by the time the interior appropriations committee holds hearings on the bill next year these hearings will have been held in the west and i hope they will invite representative members of the taylor grazing advisory boards to find out from the stockmen themselves just what these men from the range country consider just and give their views the same consideration they do the

myself supporting a series of amendments which i have offered in past years i have an amendment on the speakers desk at this time to the last section which is very similar to this because after all this amendment will affect both sections the last section is the one which the proponents of this bill have held out to you as a cureall that is the thing that you are to take back to your farmers here is what they say you are to take your f armers and show them as evidence of what you have done for them you are to say to him mr jones just look what we did for you we saddled off something like a 250 000 000 or 350 000 000 tax burden onto you but here is what we did for you we wrote into that bill in terms that you can understand or if you cannot understand maybe that your mule can understand themanyway it says that the interstate commerce commission in the exercise of its power to prescribe just and reasonable rates fares and charges shall give due consideration to the increased revenues which carriers will receive as a result of the enactment of this act so that such increased revenues will be reflected in appropriate readjustments of rates fares and charges to shippers now you are supposed to say mr farmer we hope something good is going to happen to you for we had a dream that you are going to have some good luck and you know that if you dont have that good luck we have taken good care of the railroads anyway so why should you be bothered with this little matter of a quarter of a billion dollars the government is going to have to pay why what is that to you and we have been told too by the gentleman from indiana that this section makes it absolutely certain that the farmer is going to get the benefit of this bill but there is not one word in that paragraph that says the interstate commerce commission shall do anything only a pious hope that they shall give consideration to these things do you know that the interstate commerce commission held long ago that it could not even consider a rate except when somebody came up and complained about it the interstate commerce commission has been fooling around for 55 years talking about doing something about discriminatory freight rates in the territory of the chairman of the subcommittee and they have not done a thing in the world the interstate commerce commission has not done one thing toward readjusting the inequitable rates that are imposed upon those sections of the nation that have to pay 175 percent of what those of you who live in the official territory have to pay"],

maker of history and a breaker of established precedents of many kinds and in many ways his trips and e cursions were not entirely at the expense of the taxpayers but most of them were and up to may 1937 the press estimated that the presidents use of special trains government vessels escorting craft and other modes of travel had cost the american taxpayers between11 500 000 and 2 000 000 what those costs have been altogether is anybodys guess in 1934 and early 1935 the president cruised on the private yacht nourmahal owned by his friend vincent astor in company with such friends as mr astor judge franklin kernochan georgest george lytle hull william r stewart dr leslie heiter kermit roosevelt his son james roosevelt and others in the fall of 1935 to mention one of many other similar trips mr roosevelt traveled by special train to the west coast stopped at san diego calif where he reviewed the pacific fleet and went thence to southern california where he fished from a naval vessel that was attended by other naval craft it is recalled that prior to october 1 1945 the house ways and means committee of which i am a member consid ered the matter of a 200 000 loan made by john hartford of the great atlantic pacific tea co to elliott roosevelt a son of the late presidenta loan which if mr hartford is worthy of belief was made only after elliotts father had given his approval to the loan our committees activities consisted merely of reviewing statements taken and reports made by representatives of the bureau of internal revenue concerning the hartford and similar loans together with a claim by hartford of the right to deduct a loss of 196 000 in his incometax return after the original loan had been settled by mr jesse jones for 4 000 at the request of the late president the majority of our committee felt and reported that while the hartford loan had been settled for about 2 cents on the dollar with little or no effort by hartford to make collection in full the committee was not justified in challenging the conclusion reached by the bureau of internal revenue that mr hartford could properly take credit for a loss of 196 000 in computing his later incometax return in other words our committee did not have the benefit of either direct or crossexamination of witnesses but acted solely on the testimony taken and the report made by the bureau of internal revenue copies of the bureaus investigation reports and findings were published by the committee and filed with the house the minority members of the committee recorded their dissenting views in the form of a printed minority report pointing out among other things that the majority report was based in part upon testimony of mr hartford to the effect that he would do nothin6 to embarrass elliotts father so much then for the hartford loan to elliott roosevelt now during the investigation of the hartford loan to elliott roosevelt by the bureau of internal revenue frequent mention was made of loans and advances to elliott roosevelt by persons other than mr hartford especially loans and advances to him by sid w richardson and charles f roeser oilmen of fort worth tex for launching elliott roosevelts radio ventures in the state of texas concerning which much has been published and said indeed the bureau of internal revenue investigators took much testimony from richardson and roeser among others including elliott roosevelt and his former wife now mrs ruth g eidson of fort worth tex the testimony concerning the richardsonroeser loans and advances to elliott was taken because they like the hartford loan went into the texas radio activities of elliott roosevelt it is now known that the loans and advances by richardson have a direct relation to one of the late preiidents fishing trips and the facts are such as seemingly to justify the conclusion that they like the hartford loan were made at least with the knowledge consent and approval of elliotts late father many will recall president roosevelts 1937 fishing trip to the gulf of mexico when he used an eightcar special train the presidential yacht potomaclater discardedthree navy destroyers several seaplanes and established a temporary white house in the swanky hotel galvez at galveston tex that same fishing trip included a stop at new orleans la where tothe tune of happy days are here again the president rode between the then governor leche and the then and now mayor maestri ate oysters rockefeller at antoines along with other viands for which that place is justly famous and concluded his repast with special cake and ice cream fashioned in the shape of a tarpon that new orleans stop came to be called the second louisiana purr chase because it was said it regained for mr roosevelt the previously withheld support of the t hen powerful huey long political machine on arrival at the tarpon fishing grounds off port aransas tex president roosevelt was welcomed officially by the then governor of that state the honorable james v allred and during the same fishing trip the same jesse jones who later used his own 4 000 to settle the 200 000 hartford loan to elliott and who was then in the good graces of the new deal participated in the gulf tarpon fishing an article by walter trohan in the chicago tribune and the washington timesherald for november 19 1945 relates for the first time how at the time of the 1937 fishing trip certain hot oil prosecutions were pending in the federal courts in texas against numerous individuals and concerns how after elliott roosevelt had introduced certain oil tycoons to his father and they had entertained the president at an island retreat of theirs off port aransas at least one of the prosecutions was speedily cooled off and disposed of as to the channel transport and marketing co owned by the late presidents hosts and how soon thereafter oil men richardson and roeser commenced to make loans and advances for financing the radio ventures of elliott roosevelt in texas the article speaks for itself and i shall insert the same in the record at the conclusion of these remarks it seems likely that the richardsonroeser loans and advances to elliott roosevelts radio venture were made because elliotts father was president of the united states and after he elliott had introduced richardson with other oil men to his father on the occasion of the 1937 fishing trip as disclosed by the chicago tribune and the washington timesherald indeed bureau of internal revenue representatives asked richardson whether he would have made his advances of funds to elliott if he had been at the time of the loans just elliott roosevelt and not also the son of the president of the united states richardson replied i couldnt say positively what i would have done because it was not presented in that way richardson also admitted having said after meeting the president and elliott on the island and returning to fort worth he felt it would not hurt him to know elliott roosevelt better another thing that has not been disclosed is that hon james v allred former governor of texas who welcomed the president to texas on the occasion of the 1937 fishing trip was appointed by president roosevelt as a judge of the united states district court for the southern district of texas on february 23 1939 on september 17 1938 judge allreds brother rene allred v as indicted in the federal district court for the southern district of texas houston division along with other individuals for conspiracy to violate the connally act known as the hotoil law the charge was that the defendants had agreements and transactions with the channel transport marketing co the concern owned by clint w murchison and dudley s golding hosts to the president at their island retreat as reported by the chicago tribune and the washington timesherald manifestly judge allred could not sit in judgment on his own brother so according to court records a judgefromthe northern district of texas was designated to and on december 8 1939 he did dispose of the case against judge allreds brother by accepting a plea of nolo contendere and fixing afine of 1 000 which was paid thereafter judge allred resigned his judicial position to make the race for the united states senate against senator w lee odaniel after being defeated in his senate race president roosevelt again naned judge allred for a federal judgeship it seems however to have been asserted at the time that his reappointment was made pursuant to a deal and the second appointment failed to bring confirmation from what is known concerning elliott roosevelts financing activities as to which i am assured much more is to come from what has been said and written about james roosevelts lucrative insurance connections and business and from what has been disclosed of mrs eleanor roosevelts large earnings fromher writings and radio activities it is clear that the members of the roosevelt family have lost but few if any opportunities to cash in on their connections with and relations to the highest office within the gift of the american people someday i hope the entire sordid story will be told for the benefit of the taxpayers at whose expense in many instances these irregularities and improprieties were made possible"], [8.869171142578125e-05, 0.5000886917114258, 1, "as the chairman of the committee has just indicated we now come to the close of general debate on this bill i shall not attempt to answer all the charges that have been made but i shall mention a few statements or charges that have been repeatedly made by all of those if i remember correctly who have opposed the bill charge no 1 is that the a a a can do this job is it not quite significant that so many laudatory remarks should come here today about the a a a from the republican side of this house i am glad these gentlemen have finally decided that the a a a after all is such an efficient organization some of us did not fully realize how efficient it was until i heard these laudatory speeches today the reply however again is that if the a a a had this information certainly it has not passed it on to the secretary of agriculture because despite what the gentleman from wisconsin my esteemed friend has said let me once again remind the house that the secretary of agriculture has asked for this information and urged the passage of the pending bill the fact that the war food administrator mr marvin jones has written a letter in which he has asked specifically for the information is the best answer to the argument that he now has all that information much has been said about the information on which the food administrator has made his decisions and issued directives for many years i have had a high regard for marvin jones the food administrator now to hear the gentleman from wisconsin say the food administrator knows the number of cows and chickens owned by every farmer in america is certainly a high compliment to him of course no one pretends to say that the war food administrator or the department of agriculture knows every calf every chicken every duck on every farm in the country but no doubt they can make and have made reasonably accurate estimates the food administrator says he wants the full facts and if there was ever a time we should have the facts rather than an estimate it is now charge no 2 is that the passage of this bill proposes a waste of manpower you have heard that over and over again somebody said there will be 27 000 farmers taken out of production to do this work yet let me again remind you the record discloses that every enumerator must be cleared through the united states employment service so that oftrepeated charge like the rest falls by the wayside the record also discloses that for the most part the actual enumeration is being made by elderly farm women a few disabled war veterans and older men have been employed again they say the agricultural census is not needed oh it was greatly needed back in 1925 and again in 1930 a republican secretary of agriculture appointed by the great engineer testified it was needed but now with america in a war that will decide civilization for centuries to come and with the growing realization that the slogan food will win the war is becoming more and more important we are suddenly told that this vital information the food administrator and secretary of agriculture both say is essential is not actually needed the gentleman from illinois the very eloquent orator and clever debater mr dirksen departed somewhat from the usual opposition you will remember he did not say that this census is unnecessary and i challenge the record on that score oh he said there were a lot of foolish questions being asked in these schedules by the census bureau i hold in my hand these books they talk about containing all of the questions they say there are some foolish questions in here that may be true he read some of those questions into the record there were originally many more questions when his party took the census i have here a list of the new questions being asked this year these were not asked by our republican brethren there are only six of them in this book and none are among those placed in this record by the gentleman from illinois three hundred and eight questions asked back under hoover hell and hard times have been eliminated ninetyfive questions have been eliminated in the other book i hold here the six new questions are important and sensible they refer mostly to the dairying industry milking machines poultry eggs and electric power being used on the various farms does anyone object to that information does anyone say that information would not be helpful not only in winning the war but also in the postwar program to follow if petty partisan politics is not the primary factor behind this stubborn
