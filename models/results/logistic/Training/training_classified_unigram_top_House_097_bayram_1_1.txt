votes of their representative in congress i take great pleasurein carrying on this tradition during this 97th congress at this time as we move into the final hours of the 1st session of the 97th congress i would like to submit the first congressional district yearend report these have been an exciting 12 months to be in washington i believe history will record this first session of this congress as one of the most significant farreaching legislative sessions of this century by actions taken this year this congress has begun a redirection of our national government in many cases the changes wrought will restore to individual citizens and families a measure of control over their lives and pocketbooks which had been surrendered to a federal government grown too expensive too expansive and too burdensome in other instnces the new direction will begin the necessary revitalization of our national defense and restoration of a strong clear and consistent foreign policy swhile rnany major issues have been addressed by this congress it has ween the economy which has ltaken the greatest amount of time and attention that concern by the congress of course only reflects the concern of the people of new york and the rest of the united states it also is true that congress in this first session has reflected the national will and desire for a meaningful ch ange from business as usual in washington at his inaugural in january this year president reagan called for a new beginning in midmarch he came before us in a joint session of congress to lay out a fourpoint economic recovery plan to meet the challenges of that auspicious theme for his administration the programs four major elements designed to complement one another were first cutting the growth of federal spending second reduction of tax burdens third regulatory reform and fourth controlling money and credit now only 9 months later the planks of that program directly affected by congressional action are in place or soon will becofie effective in major showdowns this year with opposing elements in congress determined to derail the economic recovery plan the presidents program repeatedly prevailed much of the credit for those successes lies with the people i received hundreds of letters and phone calls from the people of the first congressional district not all supported the presidents plan in every instance but a recurrent theme running through many of those messages was it may not be perfect but the presidenits plandeserves a chance i have supported most of what the administration has proposed in its attempts to launch a new beginning those of us elected by the people are not sheep to be led by the executive branch on occasion the interests of the people of the first congressional district run counter to an administration plan in those cases i have voted or acted accordingly but for the most part the policies and programs of this administration have warranted the support i and others have given them what we have accomplished in pursuit of the presidents economic recovery plan is truly impressive we have lowered personal income taxes by 5 percent as of october 1 with additional 10 percent reductions planned for july 1981 and july 1983 those 25percent acrosstheboard reductions will mean more money for the persons who earn it to decide how to spend not some bureaucrat in washington we also have insured that for the first time the government no longer will profit from continued inflation beginning in 1986 personal income tax rates and personal deduction will be adjusted or indexed for inflation this willmean the end of the bracket creep s by which salary and wage increases onlyboosted individuals into higher tax brackets where governiment takes a larger bite december 15 1981 coi we have put into place incentives for businesses to invest in new plant and equipment in order to operate more efficiently and create new jobs we have enacted major incentives for individuals to save more money and thus help create the capital needed for investment and economic growth as well as to better provide for themselves and their families for the future we have added extra incentives for individual initiative by insuring that a farmer or small businessmans lifetime effort and investment benefits his family not the tax collector by easing the inheritance tax rates that destroy many family farms and enterprises other benefits we have enacted as part of the taxreduction plan include new deductions for couples who work reducing the marriage penalty new charitable deductions for those who do not itemize on their tax returns an increase in the amount of money that can be put into an individual retirement account ira or keogh retirement plan with persons already oovered by a pension program at work allowed for the first time to set up an ira too in order to help workers to better save arid plan for their later years i believe it is worthwhile to reassess how far we have come in improving the economy this year to understand where we are today we have to recall where we stood at this time last year tinder the last administration when jimmy carter took office in 1977 inflation was running at 4 8 percent when he left office inflation had risen to a 12 4 percient per year rate under the reagan administration inflation is down to a 9 5 percent annual rate just last month consumer price rises were holding at 4 4 percent annual rate clearly we are turning the tide on inflation and it is this lowered inflation which offers the greatest encouragement for those on fixed or low incomes who have been hurt most by the soaring inflation of recent years when jimmy carter took office in 1977 the prime interest rate was 6 25 percent when he left office it was up to a high of 21 5 percent now it is down to 15 5 percent and stilll heading downward ~when jimmy carter took office federal spending wa s increasing at a rate of 12 3 percenta year when he left off ide the spending growth rate was 14 percent the latest estimate of the growth in spending uinder the reagan administration is 10 6 percent for fiscal 1982 one area where we have not seen as much improvement is in unemployment unemployment inthe last quarter of 1980 was 7 5 percent during the same period this year it is 8 percent as regrettable as that high figuire is there are signs of hope one purpose of the reaganeconomic program is to increase savings and investment needed to create jobs during all of 1980 only 300 000 new jobs were created this year there have been 730 000 new jobs created so we are seeing some progress although clearly not enough we have begun to fulfill the mandate of the people we have cut spendingfor fiscal years198284 by 167 billion in budget authority and by 131 billion in actual budget outlays we have reduced the tax burden for fiscal 1982 from the 22 1 percent of the gross national product projected by the carter administrationto only 20 4 percent under the reagan administration what we have been doing is painful but i believe the people of the first congre ssional district continue to realize we can endure some shortterm pain in order to get a longterm gain the primary responsibility of an elected representative is to insure that the voice of his constituents is heard on the issues that is why i have maintained a higher than average attendance record on the floor of the house the place where final amendments are proposed and the place of ultimate judgment i am proud to say that in the 3 years i have served in congress i have been present for 95 percent of the more than 1 800 recorded votes conducted in that time issues which took on very special significance in this congress were the preservation of blean drinking water and clean air my own efforts in this behalf have been helped by becoming the ranking minority member of the science and technology committees subcommittee on natural resources agriculture research and the environment on long island we have a particularly keen interest in clean water because of our total dependence on underground aquifers for our drinking water this year i have worked with state and local officials as well as federal agencies to enhance efforts to insure a pure drinking water sup ply for suffolk county and all of long island i take particular pride in being able to use my subcommittee position for the betterment of our environmental quality on long island next session we look forward to rewiiting the clean air act this is one proposal that will get my very close attention when we get done rewriting that law i want to be able to gay we have mfore effective protection of the peoples health through enhancing the quality of the air they breathe the security of our nation is an essential federal priority because of this it has been my pleasure to support the president ii his efforts to bolb ster our national detense effort which slipped badly in recent years on november 18 i voted for the 197 4 billion defirnse appropriations bill on longisland we are proud of our contributiont to the national defense economists have calculated that the long island economy will realize a 1 billion boost as a result of the 1982 defense spending bill the core of our defense program remains the men and women who serve in the military service in september i supported the 14 3percent increase in basic pay for all military personal a move which should help retain the experienced personnel needed to operate our sophisticated modern military with its allvolunteer force our national debt to those who serve us all in the military continues after their service this year we in the house enacted three major veterans bills all of which i supported signed into law on november 3 was the veterans health care training and small business loan act of 1981 a major provision in that law provides medical help for the first time through the veterans administration for vietnam veterans exposed to the herbicide agent orange who developed health problems as a result the veterans disability compernsation housing and memorial benefits amendments became law in october among other provisions that law increased disability compensation for disabled veterans and their dependents or survivors by 11 8 percent effective october 1 the third measure to become law was the former prisoner of war benefits act of 1981 we in the house also passed two veterans bills which the senate now must approve one would strengthen the va medical system the other would create a variablepayment home loan program to help veterans buy houses in times of high interest rates there is one last item which i want to particularly note for the people of the first congressional district because it has the potential of overshadowing all else we have done i refer to president reagans historic peace initiative announced on november 18 at that time he issued a challenge to the soviet union a challenge not of war but of peace eacll of the four points in his plan is highly significant but the most critical is the offer to cancel the placement of new nuclear defense missiles in europe if the soviet union will dismantle the strategic missiles it already has in place targeted on western europe this is a call for the beginning of a mutual disarmament if that disarm ament can be adequately verified the strategic arms reduction talks start which president reagan called for have the potential of becoming the turning point in the worlds prospects for a true and lasting peace a peace without the threat of a nuclear holocaust the voting summary printed below represents the highlights of the recorded votes taken by the house in 1981 i have tried to represent your interests to the very best of my ability the congressional office of new you i welcome your advice and com working with you in

more p rofitable nionutlity businesses 2 this countrys utilities arc experiencing serious financial difficulties which if allowed to continue would have a devastating impact upon the nation and its citizens and industry dependent upon reliable electric and gas utility service as many of us know the common stocks of electric utilities are selling well below their book values and lowered bond ratings have resulted in higher interest charges that are ultimately passed on to consumers these factors have caused the utility industry as well as other concerned citizens to explore the possibilities of diversification as a means of improving the industrys financial performance and stability and contributing to the wellbeing of the nations energy resources the act was passed in 1935 to correct a series of abuses by electric and gas utility holding companies notably excessive pyramidding of corporate structures and stock watering at the time a handful of holding companies controlled virtually the entire utility business in the nation these holding companies operated in disparate parts of the country and were not subject to effective state regulation in the view of the congress the power and interstate character of these holding companies rendered state control over such abuses ineffective and required that authority over them be conferred upon the securities and exchange commission the principal purpose of the act as noted in the legislative history was to nsure effective state regulation by reorganizing these holding companies into geographically contiguous units virtually all of the questionable practices the act was designed to correct were securities and accounting ones not unique to the utility industry as such they probably would have been eliminated over time by the thennew securities act~ of 1933 and the securities exchange act of 1934 both of which turned out to be far more effective than anticipated accounting standards and practices have improved dramatically since the mid1930s moreover the regulation of public utilities on the state level is considerably more effective today than when the act was passed since state utility laws have now evolved into~ strong comprehensive regulatory systems thus present federal and state regulation is drastically different from that of the early 1930s and there is little likelihood those problems would recur in the face of regulatory scrutiny under federal and state laws other than the act the bill allows both independent electric and gas operating companies to form exempt holding companies it also allows exempt holding companies to diversify without later being subject to arbitrary sec revocation of their exemptions the bill would apply to all electric and gas utilities with the exception of registered holding companies i recognize that there are a number of issues relating to utility diversification and the act that need to be addressed i hope introduction of this legislation will encourage early hearings on this subject earlier this year hearings on the subject of least cost energy strategies for the utility industry were held by chairman ottinoers energy conservation and power subcommittee in fact it was at a september 10 hearing of that subcommittee that i first discussed the possibility of the need for the congress to consider the impact of the act on the financial health of the utility industry subsequently i sent a questionnaire regarding the act to approximately 150 utility executives and each of the 50 statepublic service commissions in reviewing the act we must look at the likely impact of diversification on investors and consumers alike secondly one must view utility diversification in the context of the nations overall energy posture and the development of its renewable and alternative energy resources finally we should address specific questions that maybe of concern to regulators and investors alike such as whether the holding company structure with separate corporate subsidiaries for utility and nonutility businesses as providedin the bill adequately protects against cross subsidization between the utility business and the nonutility business and possible competitive effects in the marketplace particularly among small businesses i consider the financial health of the utility industry to bean important issue 1 look forward to further addressing this matter in the ensuing months for the benefit of our colleagues i would like to include in the record at this point the text of the public utility financial reform act h r 5220 a bill to amnend the public utility holding company act of 1935 to improve financial performance of electric and gas utilities by removing unnecessary regulatory impediments to the exercise of sound and prudent business judgment by utility executives be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled"],

inordinately geared to fattening the coffers of the weailthy and the corporate giants and international cartels of this world perhaps he did not touch on one subject which when we finally get down to

cuts are planned in all areas of the country the fiscal year 1983 budget proposals affecting afdc food stamps energy assistance medicaid and housing assistance programs will make poverty a more severe and permanent condition for millions of lowincome families we will see reduced funding to the supplemental food program for women infants and children establishing in its place an expanded block grant the proposed budget will not produce anticipated cost savings for the federal government these cuts have nothing to do with balancing the budget or helping the economy all theyll do is punish poor people who will endure greater poverty according to the census bureau in 1980 13 percent of the population or 29 3 million people had incomes below the poverty level this includes 15 7 percent of those over age 65 32 5 percent of black and 25 7 percent of hispanic families we foresee proposed changes in regulations under title vi and ix of the civil rights act which would limit the forms of discrimination prohibited by the act permit certain forms of direct student aid to go to discriminatory schools and permit schools receiving government grants to discriminate in programs not directly funded by the federal government these changes would significantly limit civil rights protections by redefining what constitutes a violation and by limiting the definition of who has standing to challenge violations that occur the existence of the legal services corporation is being threatened while in the meantime has been severely limited in its ability to bring class action suits against the states on behalf of poor people challenging discrimination anyone advocating major changes on civil rights enforcement from within the administration has to understand that in the aftermath of such clear disasters as the irs tax exemption proposals for discriminatory private schools the administration has no credibility on these issues briefly other issues facing severe cuts are in the area of education an additional cut is being proposed of 24 percent in the federal per pupil expenditure for title i which supports special education programs for educationally disadvantaged children in lowincome schools in addition to the administrations proposed cuts the department of education has cuts of its own planned for title i the department of education is considering using 1970 census data in calculating esea title i allot ments to the states this would result in the loss of hunderds of millions of dollars for states throughout the country in title i funds additional reductions of 19 percent in educational assistance to handicapped children has been proposed this would affect 4 5 million handicapped children and reduce the average per pupil federal contribution from 246 to 180 or 7 percent of average student costs additional cuts of 32 percent in vocational rehabilitation programs and the elimination of 36 percent of the number of individuals participating in the programs has been called for along with a 32percent reduction in federal aid for vocational and adult education there will be reductions in bilingual education assistance by 32 percent and the elimination of all library program funds including public college and research libraries a number of changes are being pushed for aid to higher education including large reductions in fell grants and other direct aid to college students as well as significant increases in the cost of borrowing money through guaranteed student loans if the administration succeeds in eliminating the graduate student loan program or in charging commercial interest rates for student loans then large numbers of minority students will be forced out of higher education all of the traditionally black colleges estimate that they would have to close their doors and almost no blacks or other minority students would be able to attend graduate school we can also expect that teacher training programs would be eliminated at most colleges since high commercial interest rates plus loan initiation fees would eliminate the credit eligibility of everyone except those students with limited financial need it is no coincidence that efforts to defund public education come at a time when minority students represent a majority of the public school population in many cities the council of great city schools an association of 28 of the nations largest school systems estimates that of the 5 million students in these 28 systems 75 percent are minority and 30 percent have incomes below the poverty levels in those areas30 percent cuts have been proposed in direct funding to these schools which will increase to 40 percent over the next 2 years when inflation is factored in i oppose these cuts because they are shortsighted and unnecessary in terms of the economic resources of this country i think they also represent a fundamental reversal of the unitedstates policy of providing access to quality health care and education and a reasonable

to extend the distinguished tenure in the unitedstates navy of adm hyman 0 rickover so i take this time today to urge our new president 3f the united states who has determined to rebuild americas military strength to continue admiral rickover in his important defense job for another 2 years one of the major objectives of president reagan has been to see that the american taxpayer gets a buck of service for every taxpayers buck that is spent and no one assuredly has done a more relentless job in seeing that government contractors produce completely for the money that they are paid than has admiral rickover besides that he has instilled a unique spirit of excellence in the members of his nuclear navy a spirit matched by very few other military services around the world in addition to that if admiral rickover had been in control of the civilian nuclear energy wve would not have had three mile island i hope that admiral rickover will be reappointed with my remarks i include an article that appeared in the armed forces journal of october 1981 describing in great detail and with greater eloquence the accomplishments of admiral rickover it was written by hon r james woolsey under secretary of the navy in the carter administration i commend it to the attention of my colleagues the article followvs rickoveas lengthening shadowv by r james woolsey one of this centurys unique figures is about to be in the news again by february of evennumbered years since time out of mind the secretary of the navy has had to decide whether to extend admiral hyman 0 rickovers active duty for yet another two years the current secretary john lehman can expect at least as much advice on this pending decision as countless of his predecessorsfrom such random quarters as the odd congressional committee chairman passersby on the street and other casually interested folks such as say the president the decision is usually made by the preceding summer or early fall so the papers are probably in secretary lehmans inbox by nowsitting there staring at him i have the timing and mechanics of this process pretty well in mind i signed the last rickovcr extension as acting secretary in the fall of 1979 the object of all this bieninial attention is not only washingtons ultimate survivor lie ismore importantlyone o1 its perennial winners the two traits are not unrelated as the years have rolled on he has come to know more and more about the business of building and operating nuclearpowered ships he and his staff have such a combination of institutional memory and expertise especially compared to tile civilians who came and go from the defense department that they win a good many more than they lose he has both survived because he winls and won because he has survived for many years he has played the 11111 thle way casals played the cello but many of his strongest congressional supporterspastore rivers hebertare no longer around and he is not the darling of the new military reform movement rickovers influence in the navy and in the country has spread lightyears beyond the construction of naval nuclear reactors seeing the need for bettereducated officers and enlisted men to run his power plants for example he has become a major force in education at the naval academy and in the nrotc program his whynotthebest standards about nuclear ship propulsion have affected the rest of the navy as well to the point that generations of nonnuclear officers have gnashed their teeth and worse at having to go to a special school on conventional propulsion before assuming their seagoing commands many of them argue strongly that the time would better be spent on tactics and other subjects rickover is the scourge of the conglomerate builders of nuclearpowered warships insisting on maintaining a whip hand over his projects that leaves very little room for their corporate notions of profit and none for the washington lawyers who handle their claims against the government he scorns the latter breed even more if that is possible than he does whiz kid systems analysts i treat the governments money as if it were my own he is fond of saying there are several corporate board rooms where they must wonder if hyman rickover has ever spent a nickel on himself his offices by the way have always been intentionally dilapidated every penny goes for nuclear power in the strength of his nononsense personality in the indomitability of his will and in hiswellprckliness rickover resembles only a few modern figures to me the closest parallels are charles de~aulle

possible or reasonable especially to those who get bent such men can be infuriating to deal with even for statesmenrecall churchills saying that the greatest cross he had to bear was the cross of lorraine and when such people arc wrong their mistakes can be as lasting as their triumphs but the degaulles the begins and the rickovers are the people whose impacts reach far beyond and last long

recreation areas and for grazing of livestock and for exploration for oil and other minerals it also administers mining and mineral leasing on an additional three hundred and seventy million acres lying under other federally and privately owned land plus another roughly one billion acres on the outer continental shelf it manages the national park system which consists of some three hundred parks covering more than eighty million acres it is in charge of the bureau of reclamation which promotes development of water resources particularly in the west and it runs the fish and wildlife service which is in charge of conserving migratory birds endangered species and other wildlife and supervises some four hundred wildlife refuges it has jurisdiction over stripmining policy it runs services involving outdoor recreation and national landmarks it influences policies involving the production consumption import export and stockpiling of minerals and it administers the bureau of indian affairs all these activities make interior one of the most controversial and sensitive departments in the government affecting as it does so many conflictins interests and a secretary of the interior has wide discretionary authority secretaries of the interior have ruined presidents and one albert b fall went to jail great stakes are involved in the departments decisions and many of the results of its actions are of course irreversible in recent years for a variety of reasons the department has become more controvers1l1 than ever in the west the controversy has been embodied in the sagebrush rebelliona political movement that helped ronald reagan carry every western state and that now has one of its avowed partisans james watt as secretary of the interior i am a part of the sagebrush rebellion through actions he has already taken or is planning watt intends to try to reverse federal policy across the spectrum of functions performed by his department to put less emphasis on preserving federal lands for wilderness areas and more on leasing them for drilling and mining to accelerate the distribution of federal lands on which states have existing claims and of parcels of laud they would like to obtain to speed up off ihore drilling to promote mineral exploraition watt was instrumental in the adninistrations recent decision to interrupt and reassess the united states participation in negotiating a law of the sea treaty to halt the acquisition of national parks and turn more of the management of existing ones over to private enterprise to relax regulations on stripminingr to reduce the requirements for assessing the environmental impact of driling for geothermal energy and to allow more killing ofwild horses and burros and also of predators and put less emphasis on the protection of endangered species the sagebrush rebellion in its ultimate form of protest calls for federal lands to be turned over to the states watt has said that this demand is a way of bringing pressure for changes in federal policies in his confirmation hearings he was somewhat ambiguous i do not see the need at this time for a massive transfer of public lands to state or local control or private interests if we do not shape up the management processes of these public lands then there probably ought to be a massive transfer i think some good management will handle those problems watt has also been influencing environmental energy an i even international policy beyond the boundaries of his depart ment according to white house aides watt was a lively and enthusiastic participant in the early cabinet meetings and offered opinions on a variety of questions the president they said was cuite pleased with him watt recommended greater budget cuts for his own department than had been suggested by the office of management and budget and he was placed in charge of the interagency cabinet council on natural resources and environment which includes representatives of the department of energy the department of agriculture and other departments and agencies the council will shape the administrations position on the forthcoming revision of the airpollution law which must be reauthorized this year and on water policy watt is effectively in charge of important energypolicy decisions such as the pending one on whether to deregulate the price of natural gas he supported the deregulation of naturalgas prices during previous government service recently the president appointed him to head the advisory commission on intergovernmental relations which was established in 1959 to examine relations among federal state and local governments and has done distinguished work in that field watts early actions have stirred up a storm but the few dispassionate observers one can find tend to agree at least in part with some of the things he seeks to do the question s how far he intends to go in this as in other areas of government those who supported various programs in the past did not attend to how they were being administered and are now on the defensive even som environmentalists agree that there is good reason to try to develop less cumbersome ways of administering some of the laws on the books one can find dispassionate observers who agree that procedures for granting leases for mineral exploration can and should be speeded up moreover it is the role of the environmental groups to sound the alarm to give the worstcase analysis of what anyone who differs with them is trying to do and to take the most adamant positions and many of the actions initiated by watt are only in their beginning stages more are to come after some of his appointees have been confirmed by congress several people who as worried are prepared to give him more time but it is clear that a number of the actions already initiated or being contemplated by the department of the interior as well as by related agencies could amount to a radical change in land conservation and environmental policiesmany of which have had an essentially bipartisan consensus behind them for many years some of the actions could upset delicate balances that have been painstakingly reached some could result in the transfer of substantial amounts of land and resources now deemed to be the domain of all of the people to a much smaller group some could result in very big gains for certain private interests watts personal style as well as his profes sional background has added to the controversy surrounding his appointme it and his management of the department thus far he comes across as smart certain of his views intense combative and suspicious to an unusual degree of those who do not agree with him and also of the career bureaucracy which includes many dedicated public servants there have been wholesale firings at the interior department and the career civil servants many of them experts have been cut out of decisionmaking we are not to become a part of the bureaucracy watt said in an interview in public opinion which is published by the american enter prise institute a couple of months ago he went on to say frequent cabinet meetings keep us isolated and in unity theres comfort in that when i go against my bureaucracy the issues are often against me but when i come back to the fold im nurtured in march addressing a group of people who run concessions in national parks he said the president was brought to power by a restlessness of the people because they needed change and he represents change and those oldtime liberals that dont want change are going to frustrate conservatives who want change every chance they can and weve got to change forty fifty years of bad government to ac complish that we fired every person in the department of the interior that was a presidential appointees i mean we cleaned every one of them out and then we started appointing good people forty or fifty years of bad government covers a lot of ground including several republican ad ministrations watt who grew up in wyoming is fortythree years old tall and bald he wears thick glasses and he is polite and contained one of his friends senator alan simpson republican of wyoming who is a most agreeable person insists that watt is a warm and sensitive man who has been treated unfairly by the environmentalists and in the press in the early nineteensixties watt worked for simpsons father milward simpson who was also a senator from wyoming and who served on the senate interior committee then in 1966 watt became a lobbyist for the chamber of commerce where he opposed the first national laws dealing with water and air pollution during the nixon and ford administrations watt served in the interior department and then on the federal power commission in both jobs his actions were controversial and led to a reputation justified or not for being prodevelopment uninterested in preserva tion and quick to remove subordinates who did not agree with him there is of course nothing wrong in and of itself in being prodevelopment obviously some resources have to be developed the real argument is over manner and degree over how quickly resources should be developed and how much attention should be paid to other considerations such as preserving resources for the future preserving the land around development areas setting aside land for recreation and protecting renewable resources like forests and rangelands in a rush to gain access to current resources future productivity can be damaged and if the emphasis is on developing oil and otherminerals now will america be more secure in the future these are issues that call for careful reasoned judgments everyone involved in these controversies it seems uses the word balance everyone says that he is for balance and everyone feels qualified to define it if one drew a chart of the philosophies of secretarles of the interior watts would be way off to one side following his government service watt was hired by joseph coors the president of the adolph coors company and a rightwing activist also an important backer of ronald reagan and ultimately a member of his kitchen cabinet to head the mountain states legal foundation which ia in denver and which coors founded in 1977 the purpose of the foundation which is nonprofit and taxexempt was watt said in 1977 to fight in the courts those bureaucrats and nogrowth advocates who create a challenge to individual liberty and economic freedoms in a much quoted speech he gave during his tenure at the mountain states foundation he said what is the real motive of the extreme environmentalists who appear to be determined to accomplish their objectives at whatever cost to so ciety is it to simply protect the environ ment is it to delay and deny energy development is it to weaken america watts argument which he made many times was that the west held virtually all the nations energy resources and that because of the actions being taken by extrem ists to delay or stop the orderly develop ment of energy resources the nation is likely to suffer energy shortages and thus severe economic hardship his thesis was that when this happens the politicians in washington will seize on the crisis and take whatever action is needed to extract energy from the western states in order to light and heat the east and to maintain jobs in the midwest and on the east coast he continued i fear for our ecology in thu west and for our life style when the eco nomic pressures start strangling the eastern states due to short supplies of energy their political leadership will come after our resources one person who knows watt says he sincerely believes that he is standing between this country and disaster his beliefs are close to those of corporate americas because he believes that america would be better off if the companies were unshackled to do what they want this made him just right for the mountain states legal foundation the foundation is an offspring of the national legal center for the public interest to which coors has contributed and on whose board he serves as vicechairman the national legal center organized and initially funded several regional legal centers of which mountain states was one the legal centers remain associated the first chariman of the national legal center was j robert fluor the chairman of the fluor corporation which is an international engineering and construction company the fluor corporation is also in the coal business provides drilling services and has been attempting to acquire other mineral companies the current chairman of the national legal center is charles barber chairman of asarco inc formerly the american smelting and refining company and one of the nations largest mining concerns the coors company not only makes beer but has invested in coal oil and naturalgas leases its mining affiliate has stripmining plans pending at the interior department joseph coors was also one of the founders of the heritage foundation a highly conservative policyoriented organization based in washington several of watts early ac tions at interior are in accord with recommendations made in a report mandate for leadership that was published by the heritage foundation shortly before the reagan administration took office the mountain states foundation will not give out the names of its contributors but its financial backers are known to have in cluded large firms involved in energy devel set values or are we going to continue to let opment construction and agribusiness and artificial forces coming out

provided lowcost tions he wants to go in pre right but were irrigation water in western states in febru not being tapped he says that the career ary watt told the house interior comait people are

drawn up by the carter administra for the government theres very much an tion under court order to stop the practice usversusthem mentality developing and of providing water to corporations and its very sad watt is essentially a loner farms whose holdings exceeded the one who works hard and spends what spare time hundredandsixtyacre limit set by the rec he has with his family he conducts his lamation law an official order to delay the business briskly and likes to make decisions new regulations has been issued over the quickly says one interior official hes signature of one of watts deputies but the smart but not particularly analytical a lot department announced the action as watts of people are impressed by him because he watt himself is a man of modest means talks rapldiy and comes across decisively and in religion he is a devout fundamental in the course of the meeting with park conist he was born again in the midsixties cessionaires he stressed that he would make and became a charismatic christiaq he decisions without hcaitationp im out to spelled out his basic philosophy in public make decisions and i will make them quickopinion watt declined to be interviewed ly i make lots of decisions he also for this article as follows said if we need to change personnel to aci come to washington with a western complish a more aggrerssive concessioners states perspective we feel that our individ program we will changes the people we ual freedoms have been reduced considerably mean business and when you rad the press by the power of washington to set values youre going to find that i can be cold and market forces and the individual properly calculating and indeed i can but we are dset values we feel the pressure of reduced termined and we are going to get ahold of freedom in terms of access to the resource this thing fast if a personality is giving base we have grown up with the land the you a problem were going to get rid of the wealth of the nation comes from its re problem or the personality whichever is source base and its people so we have had faster he recently told a writer for the access to economic enhancement for person denver post that he had hired his psonal al gratification in the last ten years we secretary because she is as abrupt as i am have seen the government redetermine no one has much question that watt rethese values by limidting our access to these flects the reagan administrations outlook lands for market use or personal pleasure but other cabinet secretaries also represent i believe strongly in market forces thie the presidents views in a different mannier presidents decision to deregulate crude oil a white house aide who works on energh was symbolic and important i pushed very environment and naturalresources issues hard for that decision economically its recently told some environmentalists that not that big a deal but the symbolism is im the attitude of this administration is that portant will reagan allow market forcesto the 1980 election was about privatization versus publicization and that we won watt told public opinion no other secretary of the interior in recent times at least has had a president who understands my department like ronald reagan does hes a westerner fifty per cent of his state is owned and managed by the federal govern ment when i said i want to do this i want to do that he replied sic em watt was chosen secretary of the interior after clifford hansexa republican who has been both governor of and senator from wyomingdropped out of consideration because he did not wantto sell his familys valuable permits to graze cattle on federal lands in order to comply with conflictofinterest regulations when hansens appointment fell through watt was proposed by a group of western senators who knew him from his earlier work and was interviewed by senator paul laxalt of nevada the presidents close friend according to people working on the transition it was understood that when it came to selections for the inteder department laxalts word was it laxalt tells me that he had known watt only by reputation but that after he inter viewed him i almost singleshotted himi phoned the president and said hes our man at that point laxalt had the enthusiastic concurrence of coors who along with other wealthy reagan supporters was helping the president select his cabinet laxalt says that coors had been backing another manthat apparently watt had not occurred to him laxalt told me as soon as i called joe about jim he agreed immediately and enthusiastically backed his appointment reagan who did not know watt then met with him for about twenty minutes and selected him alan simpson said to me when we were talking about who should have the job someone said if youve got a bear 9f a job to do why not hire a grizzly they got a grizzly when they hired jim when i asked laxalt what watts mission was he said simply to pacify the west this gets to why the west is so angry and what the sagebrush rebellionof which laxalt is 4 leader and with which reagan identified himself during the campaign count me in as a rebel is all about not all of the west is angry of course nor does the sagebrush rebellion represent all of the west it is concentrated in the rocky mountain states and represents a combina tion of forces oil and mining interests that want more access to the minerals and other resources they believe to be on federally owned western lands interests that want federally owned land for commercial development livestock interests that want more land and ranchers who want to be freer of restrictions on grazing on federal lands cowboys and farmers who are traditionally suspicious of the federal govermnent and commercial interests that seek to overturn a number of federal policies and in recent years these forces have been fed by the new right political movement a western senator says that the sagebrush rebellion represents the old cowboy whos not angry so much as independent and suspicious plus a new force fed by the new right and raw commercialismthe old landgrab issues of the nineteenth century reemerging one interior department official describes it as an attempt on the part of some opportunistic politicians to grab some land capitalizing on some very legitimate complaints and frustrations on the part of local people it has some roots in resentment of the easta feelint that the east is the center of the environmentalists and that easterners think that westerners if left to their own devices would stripmine grand teton the environmental movement is strong in the west of course simpson says the toughest thing to handle is the paternalism from other areas which think that we really dont know what a jewel of a place we have and that they are going to help us preserve that jewel the sagebrush rebellion has some roots in restntrmntsome of it apparently justifiedof a oureaucracy that is felt to be unresponsive to the ranchers with whom it deals in administering the federal lands and it has some roots in commercial interests that have recently come to see value in certain of those lands the argument is over the disposition and management of the public lands currently managed by the bureau of land management in the department of the interior this agency manages almost seventy per cent of all the land in nevada fortytwo per cent of the land in utah roughly a quarter of the land in wyoming oregon and idaho these are the lands that were long considered the least valuable or attractive public lands and have not been set aside as national parks or reserved for forest preserves by the forest service or given away or sold off over the years homesteaders didnt want them until about a decade ago the federal policy was essentially to dispose of these lands then a variety of people began to realize that they contained a number of important resources ecological and environmental resources renewable resources such as timber and forage land water resources recreational opportunities and valuable minerals the lands are estimated to contain mineral assets worth hundreds of billions of dollars eighty per cent of the nations oil shale and forty per cent of its coal reserves large deposits of oil natural gas and uranium ore tar sands and geothermal heat at the same time that commercial groups were taking a greater interest in these lands the nations population was increasing and the demand for recreational areas was growingand all this coincided with a heightening of the environmental movement the first earth day was in 1970 a move developed in congress to establish a more comprehensive policy toward the disposition and management of those federal lands and in 1976 the federal land policy and management act was passed this law said for the first time that it was in the public interest for the federal government to retain and manage the lands instead of disposing of them and it established procedures for deciding which lands should be set aside for wilderness areas and which should be released for other uses the decisionl are made by congress on the basis of recommendations by the department even those lands which are set aside for wilderness areas can be drilled for oil and gas and other minerals with certaln stipulations as to how the land around drilling sites is to be treated land that is awaiting designation as suitable or unsuitable for a wilderness area can be explored for oil and minerals with certain restrictions that are designed to prevent the land from being made unsuitable for wilderness of the almost hundred and seventyfive million acres that the bureau of land management has studied to see if they should be released as unsuitable for wilderness all but about twentyfive million haive been released but watt and the mining companies say that the restrictions still go too far and watt has acted to loosen them it is not quite accurate to say as watt and other critics of federal land policy do that federal land has been locked up for a single purpose by which they mean wildernessand that exploration for resources is prohibited on it one career official at interior says they are reacting to impressions rather than facts it stands to reason that people who had become accustomed to the old system would resent the new one before the 1976 act grazers and miners had relatively free access to these lands some parts of them were being overgrazed and ruined for future use it also stands to reason that various interests that wanted to possesss or exploit these lands would be upset a permit to graze on federal lands is a very good deal since the federal government generally charges cattlemen less per acre than private landholders do previous administrations have tried to raise the price of grazing fees but the reagan administration despite its emphasis on cutting the budget and its nod in the direction of charging users fees has made no such effort the politics of such a decision are fairly obvious the rental cost of an oil or gas lease is also an attractive arrangementa dollar an acre per year if oil or gas is produced on federal lands the federal government receives a royalty reductions of grazing allotments and of access to public lands for drilling for oil and gas were among the subjects of suits watt brought when he was at the mountain states legal foundation the complaints about the bureau of land managements overseeing of lands include homey stories about a rancher who was not allowed to put a fence up about a miner who was penalized for building a road three feet in the wrong direction about a rancher who opened his land to hunters who were then forbidden to hunt on adjacent public land simpson points out that some westerners are also disturbed because when federal rulings are challenged in the federal courts the appeals end up in the federal cir cuit court of appeals in washington rather than in a court in cheyenne wyoming most of the complaints however have to do with restrictions on grazing and with delays in or restrictions on getting access to minerals laxalt said to me iecently westerners should be more involved in the decisionmaking that was essentially the situation we had before the 1976 law was passed implicit in the old system was the idea that the allocation of grazing lands would be left to westerners the 1976 law had the decisions taken over by the activisttype managers in the interior department they made decisions about where there would be grazing about predator control about wild horses essentially the same thing is true of mining by virtue of tremendous withdrawals of land primarily for wilderness a great deal of valuable property was being denied for use the hostility just grew and grew into the sagebrush rebellion it wasnt just administrative turmoil it was political if there was one thing that burned jimmy carter in the west it was this in 1979 the nevada state legislature passed a bill supported largely by miners and stockmen that called for the turning over of federally owned lands to the states and in the following year similar legislation was adopted in utah arizona wyoming and new mexico bills to this effect have also been introduced in congress sponsors of such legisiation argue that these lands belonged to the states in the first place others argue that people who say this have their history wrongthat these lands were originally owned by the federal government or were given to it as part of the arrangements for achieving statehood the idea of turning the lands over to the states horrifies many people of course they argue that there is a national interest in the way these lands are utilized and assume that the lands would be yielded to the strongest economic interests within a given state richard lamm the governor of colorado and a existed because of what bureau officials and democrat has said the west went into previous other interior officials believed to the union with its eyes open knowing well be the requirements of the law the major these lands were reserved in the enabling ity of the people who work for the bureau acts that made us states we waived any in the west are westerners but most of rights to these lands we didnt want the them are trained as foresters range managburden of administering

landholders has like timber companies build access roads now resulted in an attempted land grab by through it it is the role of the bureau to remining companies large ranchers and land solve these conflictsa process that can speculators and oil companies take time shortly after watt assugied some career people in the bureau of land office he held a series of large meetings management recognize that some of the with department employees and told them complaints are valid and are struggling to among other things that any of them who make the agency more responsive they say were committed to a singlepurpose use of that the process of deciding whether an land should seek work elsewhere but it is area should be set aside as wilderness the funciton of the wildlife biologists and should be speeded up and that the backlog the geologists on the staff to say that if of applications for exploration or drilling drilling for example is permitted in a crfor minerals should be dealt with more rap ta place an endangered speces or a geoidly but they say they need more people logical formation might be destroyedto be to handle these things watt however cu advocates in a process in which a decision is the agencys budget for management of the made further up the line now some of lands he has frequently referred to the these people arefearful of doing their job bureau of land management as arrogant shortly after watt came i he fired fiftyand he has proceeded in a way that under one staff members of the solcitors officemines the morale of the very people he the office that gives opinions on how the needs in order to deal with the complaints laws are to be interpreted and helps the de of the westerners a theory is held by prtment build the caes that are then some in the agencyand they concede that brought by the justice department against it may result from paranoiathat watt is violators he explained his action by saying setting them up for failure so that he can that the carter administration had exceedaccept the more radical proposals of the ba ed hiring levels carter administration offigebrush rebels watt has said that the cals say that the levels were exceeded in sagebrush rebellion helps create the atten terms of numbers but not in terms of the tion on those basic problems which con budget and that the firings were political gress needs to address and that it will be if the office was too large some have augmy objective to manage these lands as a gested it could have been reduced by attrgood neighbor to eliminate that friction and tion the solicitors office of course decidlet the sagebrush rebellion die because of ed on the regulations that watt challenged friendly relations when he was asked in court when he was with the mountain during his confirmation hearings what his states legl foundation and that annoy so inclination would be if he was asked to tes many ranchers and mining companies after tify on legislation providing for the transfer watt took office as secretary he asked of federally owned lands to the states or pri some interior employees why they did vate entities watt replied my present in something in a certain way and was told clination would be that that would be a pre that they acted in accordance with an opinmature piece of legislation that would be a ion issued by the solicitors office in 1979 divisive force in congress unlikely of being watt replied that the solution to that was passed he also said if i failed in my mis easythey would just get a new opinion he sion pressures would be so great on you sen added that one thing he would insist on was ators to do that that you would have no that the solicitors not sit around deliberateother alternative ly misinterpreting the law some of the anecdotes about the bureau watt has said that he will seek to release of land managements recalcitrance are not more land for exploration and developmentd altogether true watt had one that he par the department has already taken stepsticularly liked to tellabocut how long it by getting a new solicitors opinion reintersupposedly took a school to be able to buld~ preting the lawto relax the environmental an athletic field on federal landand he constraints on oil drilling and mineral excontinued to tell it after his office had been ploration on some of the public lands these informed that the facts were otherwise constraints were the subject of a suit the when a congressman asked bureau officials mountain states legal foundation brought about it in a hearing and was told the facts against the interior department douglas he suggested that watt get another exam baldwin watts spokesman and longtime ple and the interior department headquar friend told me that the new regulations ters sent a request to a meeting of state dl will perite exploration even though there rectorsof the bureau in phoenix to provide will be some degradation of the environone many of the examples of the bureaus ment the department also has under conunwillingness to allow a fence or a road to sideraton aprocess by which congress be built are true and this unwillingness and would beasked to release lands unsuitable many of the bureaus restrictions on mining for wilderness while potential wilderness in potential or actual wilderness areas have areas werestill being stuilied but some members of congress want to continue the practice of considering the two types of areas at the same time so as not to find that they had foreclosed the possibility of saving wilderness lands in certain areas the real question is what sort of balance watt will want to strike though congress acts on interiors suggestions as to which areas should be set aside for wilderness and which should not the shape of the proposals it receives from interior can affect its decisions and there have been reports that watt will recommend no further setting aside of land for wilderness area at all baldwin told me that that would be consistent with his phllosophythat this country has enough recreation areas and there is no need for more baldwin continued he has said many times that public lands suitable for such development should be developed for multipurposes the secretary has taken personal charge of regulatory revision well say not only what regulatory actions are wrong but what solicitors opinions are wrong watt has expressed concern that the united states is not sufficiently aggressive in developing its strategic mineral resources and has become dangerously dependent on foreign suppliers he has told congress i plan to end unnecessary and burdensome regulations now frustrating americas mineraldevelopment programs he has called for a minerals policy that involves not simply the establishment of emergency government action in the face of a nonfuel minerals crisis such as war market disruption or price manipulation but the adoption of policies that protect american jobs and investments improve our balance of trade revitalize the nations economy and provide for the security of foreignmineral imports he has told a congressional subcommittee that the department of the interior must be the amicus for the minerals industry in the court of federal policymakingnot as a representative of private mining interests per se but as a spokesman for the very real public interest involved in the protection and preservation of a strong minerals sector again the godl of developing minerals is in itself unexceptionable up to a point but the question remains of whether it will be done without undue damage with a fair return to the government and with consideration of what would be involved in getting at the minerals there is also the question of whether it makes sense to go all out to extract strategic minerals nowas the mineral companles would likeor is it more in the national interest to identify mineral deposits and leave them in the ground until it becomes clear that they are needed watt objected to going ahead with the law of the sea treaty because he felt that it represented too great a concession to the third world moreover the administration was under strong pressures from large mining companies to renegotiate the treaty the new administration made its position known on the eve of what was expected to be the final session on the treaty at the united nations and fired the entire negotating team the negotiations had been going on under bipartisan auspices since 1973 elliot richardson who played a variety of roles in former republican administrations had been the chief united states negotiator it is widely agreed that the mining companies need a treaty in order to go forward with deepseabed mining be cause of the enormous costs and the risks of competing claims the question before the administration which now has the treaty under review is whether the companies can get what they want and also get a treaty ane 9 1981 watt has considerable discretionary authority in leasing certain lands for exploration and development of oil and gas he has taken steps to speed up the process of granting leases for exploration of the outer continental shelf and in early february he proposed making four areas off the northern california coast available for oil drilling the four were among five california areas that had been under consideration for some time and last year cecil andrus the secretary of the interior in the carter administration proposed making just one of them availablean area to the south of the others exploration of the others would involve drilling in waters off such areas as big sur point reyes and mendocino the agencies under andrus had recommended that these areas also be drilled but estimated that most of the potential oil and gas were contained in the one area andrus proposed andrus decided that the expected yield in the four other areas did not justify the environmental hazardsthe danger of oil spills the threat to sea life and birds watts proposal was protested not only by environmental groups but also by governor jerry brown and by a majority of californias congressional delegationincluding such conservative republicans as senator 8 i hayakawa and representative barry goldwater j necently a decision on these new areas was deferred watts aides say that andruss decision was made for political reasons watt also has discretionary authority to dispose of certain federal lands and in this area as in other areas he moved quickly the interior department may sell off to state and local governments parcels of federally owned land that is near privately owned land for parks municipal facilities or community expansion in his second week on the job watt write to western governors inviting them to identify parcels of federally owned land needed to meet com munity needssuch as land for community expansion and for schools hospitals and parks if these needs could not be met under existing authority watt wrote i am prepared to pursue vigorously legislative and regulatory changes if necessary to meet your needs the offer is unprecedented and does not indicate whether watt intends interior to take into account the possibility that some of the parcels of land may be of great value and to follow existing law and regulations governing what the states might have to pay for the property speedy action on all requests could result in the transfbr at low cost of some valuable public land the responses that have come in to interior thus far indicate that some governors and local communities have interpreted the invitation broadly new mexico has asked for land at no charge that communities plan to turn around and sell to developers one community in california is proposing to acquire land free that it has said it might then sell off to a developer watt has also begun proceedings that could result in the transfer of a very large amount of valuable land to the state of utaha transaction that could set a precedent for similar action in other states the transaction arises in part from the fact that the federal government still owes some states some land on the basis of arrangements that were made when they acquired statehood when western states entered the union the federal government gave them specific sections of land in each township primarily for the purpose of building schools if the designated lands were already committed for other useshad been set aside for national forests or parks or indian reservations or had been given to the railroadsthe states involved were entitled to select other lands instead some states such as nevada simply sold off the lands they were given some claims for land in lieu of the lands originally designated are still pending in part because it has taken the states a long time to decide which land they wanted or whether they wanted any and in part because such exchanges are studied for the value of the lands involved and hearings are conducted for all parties that might be affected eight states still have a total of slightly over six hundred thousand acres due themranging from small amounts wyoming and south dakota are owed just over a thousand acres each to quite substantial ones the largest claim is that of utah two hundred and twentyseven thousand acres and utah has decided that it wants some other land as well states may seek to exchange some of their land for federal landfor example to consolidate each of the two kinds of holdings but there is a very large question of what consideration is to be given to the value of the federal lands those states are seeking a few years ago utah tried to claim over two hundred thousand acres of federal lands containing highly valuable oilshale deposits as the lands due it in lieu of its original federal grants the interior department re4ected the claim and utah sued arguing that the secretary should have no discretion to determine which federal lands could be claimed the issue reached the supreme court which ruled last year in utah v andrus that the settlement could not simply be on an acreforacre basis but must be on the basis of roughly equivalent value now governor scott matheson of utah is engaged in discussions with watt about ideas that utah has for overcoming the supreme court decision and arranging not only for a transfer of the lands in lieu of the original grants but also for a trade of a substantial amount of federal lands for lands owned by the state matheson a democrat supported watt enthusiastically during his confirmation hearings on february 18th matheson wrote to watt enclosing a memorandum written by the assistant attorney general of utah that he described as concerning the statewide landexchange program which we discussed in your office on february 10 matheson said in his letter that he was in general agreement with the memorandum and concluded i think we both view this subject as an historic opportunity for the publiclands states as well as the united states to solve many of their landmanagement problems and to create vastly improved relationships that should endure for decades to come the memorandum proposes that utah identify as lands to be acquired from the public domain lands and minerals having a sufficient value so that we could actually do something with them and derive some substantial income from them it goes on to say that value is not a vital federal interest and there should be no reason why federal lands of high value would not be suitable for state acquisition simply because of such high value it suggests that the state offer in return school lands that we own but do not want or cannot use and a number of what it considers unliquidated claims among these claims are lands that utah argues it would have received if the 1976 federal land policy and management act had not been passed it argues that at the time utah became a state and up until the passage of the 1976 law the federal policy was to dipose of unreserved public lands and that utah was therefore economically damaged by the new law the memorandum asserts that because of these claims we are justly entitled to values substantially in excess of the current net value that we will offer in exchange for the selection rights that we will agree to release the memorandum goes on to suggest that there be no effort to make exhaustive and detailed appraisals of the land to be exchanged because such appraisals would be timeconsuming and also partially irrelevant in that we will ask congress to agree to the proposed overall statewide plan or prop als in other words congress is to be ask d to approve post facto an elaborate plan that will have been worked out between utah and the interior depart ment and not bother with the details the state memorandum suggests developing a number of proposals each with a different ratio of benefits for utah as opposed to those for the federal government starting with fivetoone it warns against making a proposal where the values were equal or roughly equal because it might be too tempting for congress to opt for the latter alternative the meraorandum suggests that a legal brief be written to be used as a lobbying tool to justify the value discrepancy we would seek it says that this brief will be a subjective document prepared by one advocating a particular cause drafted to persuade and convince members of congress the memorandum suggests that the state proceed independent and apart from federal regulations and procedures reason ing that since congress would have ap proved the states proposals there would be no violation of any law or regulation the career staff worried about the implications of this proposal warned watts office and drafted a response for him saying that the department would have to give the proposal further study before the letter was signed by watt a second one arrived from utah on march 19th matheson wrote to watt referring to our telephone discussion last week he went on to say i am very pleased that you have agreed to proceed with my proposal to block up stateowned lands in utah that is to consolidate them through a comprehensive exchange with the department of the interior he proposed a speedy schedule for action and said i assure you that we are committed to making this a successful endeavor and a model for other publiclands states he also said it is important to remember during the process that the question of value is secondary our responsibility is to provide the congress with a rationale for the final package not an accounting of dollars or acres if we proceed as though this is a businessas usual exchange on a massive scale the project is doomed on february 25th watt met with the governors of eleven western states and held a press conference afterward governor robert list of nevada told the press conference in all candor i cant recall a single instance in which the governors raised issues that the secretary did not agree watt stirred up a major storm by halting the expenditure of funds for the acquisition of land for national parksincluding parks whose purchase congress had authorized the carter administration had recommended that three hundred and thirtyfive million dollars be spent on acquiring parks this year watt reduced the sum to fortyfive million dollars to be used in special cases his action not only would halt the acquisi tion of new parks but would leave some existing ones such as the cape cod national seashore and the redwood national park incomplete it was when reagan was run ning for governor of california that he made the remark a hundred thousand acres of redwood trees are an awful lot of trees to look at if youve seen one youve seen them all watts position is that the ii 2821 h 2822 government must learn to manage what it owns before it seeks to acquire more land however his decision to acquire no more parks may be a permanent policy baldwin told me that watt believes that we have already protected most of the truly unique lands watt has also proposed to halt funding for the acquisition of parks in urban areas his position is that these are playgrounds unsuitable for consideration as national parks this is another area in which some dispassionate people feel that watt has something of a point but also that he is carrying things much too far and has come up with a simplistic and short sighted solution these people who include conservationminded democrats maintain that congress had got in the habit in recent years pf authorizing the purchase of parks that could not be described as national jewels that a bit of porkbarrelling was going on traditionally the interior department was supposed to recommend twelve national parks to congress each year and congress added to the list if some itate or local areas desire more parks these people say they should pay for them some of them say that there are less expensive ways of allocating areas for recreationthat is by designating them wilderness reas however watt may not want any more wilderness areas either baldwin says that watts general view is that we have enough of each type of ecological system already set aside watt also plans to close down the youth conservation corps which has offered maintenance jobs in na tional parks and wilderness areas to poor young people the people who agree that congress has gone too fast say however that it is one thing to slow down the acquistion of park land another to stop it altogether and if land is to be acquired in the futureassuming it is still availableit will cost all the more others argue that the population is growing that we are running out of land suitable for parks and that state and local governments are not likely to buy the land they point out that watt complains that some parks are overcrowded and yet refuses to add to the inventory they say there is a national interest in having more parks available they cite theodore roosevelt who was the first president to champion the establishment of national parks and point out that the parks have been called the lungs of the land former senator gaylord nelson now the chairman of the wilderness society says if you stop the acquisition of park lands now where will you be in fifty years when the population of the country has doubled they point out that the acquisition of parks was maintained through the nixon and ford administrations and that watts action reverses a longstanding tradition and some are inclined to suspect that his action stems from concerns other than good manage ment some environmentalists say they suspect that watts intention is to diminish the size of national parks that contain timber or oil resources baldwin says that even though there are a lot of mineral resources in some national parks watt would never allow them to be opened for exploration or development baldwin also says theres probably a treasure trove in yellowstone park but watt would never allow it to be gone afterand congress wouldnt allow it there may of course be valuable land adjacent to existing national parksland that under the new policy would not be acquired for park expansion watt has said that he might consider the transfer of some national parks to state and local governmentswhich may or may not have the funds or may decide they dont want to use their funds to maintain the parks a stir has also occurred over some re for those already listed the new adinismarks that watt madd in early march to tration dismissed the environmentally orthe conference of national park

whose motivation is not the same as that of also moving to take certain afican leopards the national park service pans of the park off the endangered list thus permitting service who believe that it

that federal agencles carry out the requirements of the national environmental policy act has been fired and the councils budget has been reduced the council was established in 1970 during the nixon administration to help carry out the national environmental policy act and republicans were among those fired the new solicitor of the interior department is to be william coldiron the former general counsel of the montana power com pany daniel miller a former geologist for several oil and gas companies has been named assistant secretary of the interior for energy and minerals the undersecretary of the department is donald hodel an energy consultant who served as deputy administrator of the bonneville power administration the forest service which is in the agriculture department and is the largest publicland manager outside the interior department is to be headed by john crowell a timber lobbyist who was previously general counsel for the louisianapacific corporation which is an offshoot of the georgiapacific corporation and is one of the countrys largest cutters of timber in national forests the role of the forest service is to administer the national forests so that some of the land is used for wilderness and recreation and some for timber cutting and to insure that the timber cutting is done in a way that preserves the land for future use louisianapacific has been at odds with the forest service and the environmental protection agency over a number of policies and some of the disputes have resulted in decisions against the company crowell has advocated an increase in the cutting of timber in national forests by lumber companies and has been a critic of the forest service he has denounged the idea of setting aside some of the forest land for wilderness areas as a concept that originated with a surprisingly small band of devotees who over the years preached their cause with articulate persuasiveness and with unremitting fervor and zeal even some republicansand they include lawyers representing corporate clientswho seek changes in the way laws in these areas have been administered are concerned about some of these appointments they are concerned that things will be carried so far as to cause a reaction that would make what they see as legitimate change impossible certain federal officialssuch as members of the joint chiefs of staff or the head of a consumerprotection agencyare meant to perform advocacy rules but most federal positions require administrators who will weigh and balance interests the pattern that has appeared in the sphere of resources and the evironment is that positions that require judiciousness and a sensitive balancing of interests have been filled with dedicated advocatesadvocates at one end of the spectrum and advocates whose former clients stand to gain a great deal from their decisions a number of conservative republicans who could have been named secretary of the interior would not have drawn the electricity that reagans choice has some true conservatives suggest that what watt may be setting out to do is not truly conservativethat a true conservative would be more concerned with preserving our heritage there is more of a consensus even within his own department for changes in direction and emphasis than watt may think but if he goes at his job with hostility toward real and imagined opponents operates in isolation is driven by ideological fervor and is hellbent on taking action for the sheer sake of taking action he is headed for trouble some people in interior and outside including environmentalists havent given up on watt yet some even hold out the hope that he will be able to make sensible changes in policy and calm the west down without giving away the national store and will thereby do some real good but he may lack the temperament or the flexibility to do thisand in any case intentionally or not he is the instrument of forces that are bigger than he is in this area as in others there is a danger to the reagan administration and its allies in overinterpreting its mandate the large interests that are propelling watts policies may find as watt may that they can lose a great deal if they push too far the changes over the last decade or so in national poll cies having to do with the management of resources and the environment would not have occurred if there had not been a substantial constituency behind them they were not just the product of a few zealous lobbyists in washington they did not arise out of transient values the america that some of the large interests seem to long for has ceased to exist the days of everyone for himself with little thought for the future are over but while the issues are being fought out a great deal of irreparable damage can be done elizabeth drew"], [0.016169726848602295, 0.9838302731513977, 1, "i certainly wish to allay any fears i certainly do not intend to take all 15 minutes this afternoon however impulsed as i am by the need to go on the record i wish to report that this past saturday it was my honor and privilege and personal satisfaction to address the annual rio orande united methodist church conference which is an historical one perhaps the most historical of all the meetings in that particular church or christian denomination in the southwest united states to give my colleagues an idea of its historicity all of the transactions in the official proceedings of the conference are in spanish because there are spanishspeaking delegates from both the states of new mexico as well as texas and even some delegates from northeastern mexico the meeting is evocative of a history of the united states that has yet to be written that particular developmental history in the southwest border country and particularly the 20year period known as the mexican revolutionary period stretching from about 1910 to 1930 this conference is really unique as a matter of fact it is a separate and apart annual conference from the main southwest conference of the methodist church which was celebrated in my district in san antonio tex the heart of the city in fact at a place adjacent to the alamo just a few days prior to the rio grande conference last saturday but it is nevertheless an integral part of methodism the rio grande conference took place at georgetown tex at another historical site the southwestern university which has been in existence 141 years and is a substantial educational institution with a tremendous background of service to methodism and in imparting education to the people of texas it is a beautiful campus it has grown tremendously just in the last 20 years since i served in the texas state senate and had ccasion last to go to the campus in any event i feel it was a real privilege to attend this particular conference last saturday the methodist bishop for the region bishop ernest dixon was there the vice president of the university william b jones was also there and there were more than 1 000 persons present at this great conference the discussion that i was asked to develop was the developing eighties the decade of the eighties and the role of the ethnic minorities i will insert in the record at this point the substance of the address that i gave in pursuance of that request i am grateful to have the opportunity to be here ith you and spend a few minutes reflecting on the eternal dilemma where do we go from here there are never any easy answers or sure road signs to guide us in lifes conflicts no matter how great or small those might be we travel with certainty only when we move on the basis of firm faith it is so in daily life it is so in academic life it ia so in political life therefore when you ask me to talk about the role of minoritles in the eighties you are asking me to describe a map that does not really exist except in faiththe faith that we can even in the resurgent spirit of a new knownothing age of politics still find ways to improve the lot of people who are all too often left behind left out and left hurt in the great swirl and hubbub of our society we know at the outset in the words of herman melville that there is no steady unretracing progress in this life we do not progress through fixed gradations there is no way that we can with certainty say what this decade will bring or what we will be like at the end of it all we can know is that we have to strive for the best that is within ourselves and seek to commit this country to do the best that it can for all of its people there is in any country any society the temptation to be complacent to shut out the afflictions and problems of the unfortunate this is no less true of our great country than of any otherbut still there is a redeeming optimism that prevails in our country most of us believe that there are very few problems of any kind that cant be licked that is why americans didnt let the prairie be the end of the westward movement there might have been less water and little wood in the westbut americans discovered that you did not have to have wood or stone to build fences you could use wire and you did not have to have water in streams you could drill deep wells and bring the water from the earth by using the power of the wind and just as we have tended to be inventive and practical so have we realized that social problems can be licked too sometimes our efforts to help our fellow man have been terrible failuresprohibition was a disasterbut far more often we have found that there are ways and means of helping our fellow human beings overcome the viscissitudes of life so we have been optimists i like to think that our general optimism has also made us idealists justice brandeis who himself sprang from a class who were subjected to the most odious kind of discrimination found it in his heart to say this there is in most americans some spart of idealism which can be fanned into flame it takes sometimes a divining rod to find out what it is but when found the results are extraordinary we know from history and the events of our own lives that idealism is a real and present thing in our society where else but in america would anyone dream up an idea as outlandish and as outlandishly successful as the peace corps where else but in america would we find a president inviting as franklin roosevelt did the daughters of the american revolution to think of themselves aa immigrants where else but in america could there have been the great civil rights movement that mighty and creating wave of equality and dignity that expressed itself in words of idealism and faith that no one could ever forget we shall overcome we shall overcome i do believe we shall overcome some day nowhere but in america could you find that kind of movement born in faith nourished by optimism and fueled by pure ideal lam crystallized in those words and now here we stand the fight for simple access won here we stand knowing that the real fight is only now beginning for it means nothing it we have the right to walk into the hamburger joint if we lack the money to buy the burger it means nothing to have the right to apply for a job if we dont have decent schools to equip us for that job it means nothing to have the right to buy or rent a home if there are no homes to buy or rent the fight of the civil rights movement was a fight for access the fight today is much harder than that it is the fight for the mainstream the fight for economic opportunity and this is the key it is not a fight only for the minority people of this country it is a fight for all the people of this country in the state of texas about a third of the population could be considered a member of one minority or another about one texan in five as hispanic about one texan in eight is a black it is true that when you talk about unemployment when you talk about low income and when you talk about poor education and when you talk about poor nutrition those are problems that fall first and hardest and most often on the ml nority population of this state but when you talk about absolute numbers there are twice as many poor anglos in texas as there are poor hispanics there are four times more poor anglos in texas than there are poor blacks therefore when we talk about the fight for economic opportunity we are not merely talking about a fight of by and for blacks and hispanics we are talking about a fight for all poor people when we talk about how republican budget cuts hurt poor people we too often forget that the greatest number of the poor are not minorities at all but anglos for all poor people the fight in thin decade is to reach the mainstream the point where most americans live a decent job a decent education a decent home and a decent meal on the table because so many in the minority population are poor this effort to reach the mainstream is too easily seen as simply a minority struggle such an image is wrongfor the problems of all poor and struggling people are different only in degree and there is no degree of difference in the pain of poverty a hungry stomach does not differentiate between races in the civil rights struggle the key was to awaken the realization that civil rights was h 2778 co not just a concern of black people it was a concern of all people i remember vividly that when i fillbustered aainst the infamous segregation bills of the fifties i did not merely arousd the hatred of rednecks and the suspicions of the fbi my own friends said they were disappointed in me that i was trying to reduce my own hispanic brothers down to the level of blacks but what was any different about laws that tried to exclude me from certain housing right along with blacks what was any different about me being excluded from a public park right along with blacks what harmed blacks harmed me and what offended any human being offended all human beings there are many keys to the economic mainstream it takes more to reach that mainstream than to have an opportunity for a job it is necessary to be equipped for that job and so for many the main thing is to stay in school to gain skills we have done well in that task in the last decade and the progress for minorities has been encouraging and yet even today among adult hispanics in texas only a third have finished high school blacks by contrast can count half their adult number as being high school graduates meanwhile twothirds of the anglos have completed a high school education therefore for a third of the anglo population half the black population and twothirds of the hispanic population education remains a supreme priority without education and without skill the door to opportunity may be open but the threshold remains too high to cross what that educational attainment means is this a third of the anglo population of this state lives on an income of less than 6 000 a year close to 60 percent of hispanics and blacks on that kind of income 500 a month here in texas if you have less than four years of education it doesnt make much difference what your ethnic background is black white or brown anybody with less than a fourth grade education is twothirds of the time working at a low wage blue collar job of one kind or another there is nothing dishonorable about hon orable workbut what i am saying is that staying in school is the first prerequisite to entering americas true mainstream and that is the upwardly mobile population the population that moves up the ladder rather than being forced to stay on the same level unable to move ahead if we have to be concerned about education we have to doubly concerned about the forces that are threatening our schools today all across texas there is resentment about property tax levels our states teachers are inadequately paid and they get nothing like the respect their jobs entitle them to but most alarming of all is the fact that at the same time the reagan budget programs intends to cut federal aid to schools by 25 percent what this means for disadvantaged people is that it will be next to impossible for schools to provide the kind of remedial and special education in the eighties that they did in the seventiesthis at a time when test scores are confirming that those programs have worked and worked wellthis at a time when we know that the investment in human potential has truly paid off just this week the house education and labor committee driven by the fantastic budget cuts imposed by the republican budget voted to kill future funding for the impacted areas assistance program this can if the decision sticks have disastrous effects on schools in san antonio that have no conceivable way to relay on local taxes to make up the differ ence and we are seeing moves to dismantle federal aid to the handicapped here in texas the clients of the texas rehabilitation commission last year reported a total income of 19 million before rehabilitation training after that training their income went up to 120 million the cost about 25 million vocational rehabilitation pro duced in other words an increase in income of four dollars for every single dollar that was invested in that training yet that program atands in clear danger today i think that if we but had the instruments to measure it we would see that education of every kind produces the same kind or return on investment for the poor and disadvantaged there is absolutely no doubt that the chances of getting a job increases with each additional year of school and the quality and income from that job likewise increase with each additional year spent in school and for that reason i think that ethnic minorities need first to be concerned about maintaining educational opportunities in the eightiesand this is a concern of every citizen rich or poor black or white i have said much about education and i underscore the importance of education as the key to economic opportunity but i do not want to leave the impression that the struggle ends there if there is no job to be had qualifications and skills make no difference if there is no food in the house it does not matter how great the schools are hunger and learning arent compatible if there is no roof to live under no clothing to wear it does not matter if the schools are outstanding we have to be concerned with overall economic program we have to be concerned with programs that make it possible to realize human potential when an administration creates dellberately an economic program that forces high interest rates upon uswe have to under stand that those interest rates forcea general economic slowdown a general rise in unemployment a general rise in small business bankruptcles those are the things that fall hardest on those who have the least to begin withand most particularly on minority groups does the building industry have trouble then we have to reali2 that the small builders and the small suboontractorsa great many of whom are minority persons struggling for a break throughare hit first hardest and longest of all does the auto industry have trouble it is the assemblyline worker the car salesman the mechanics who suffer the first blows the hardest knocks and the greatest struggle do the banks cut off loans we have to understand that it is the corner grocer the neighborhood dry cleaner the independent merchant who really suffers the consequences in each and every case it is not just the minority who sufferit is every struggling person in this country who suffers what we have to look for them is ways and means to make common cause with everyone who shares the concerns and burdens of proverty or handicaps of one kind or another it was making that common cause that allowed the great civil rights breakthrough now that we are looking for economic opportunity the fight is far more complex far more subtle far more difficultbut it can only be won in the same way by making common cause with all who are poor all who are oppressed all who need help and all who care about human decency what we cannot afford is to become locked in some sterile selfisolation not long after the civil war walt whitman wrote a great essay democratic vistas we have to understand that whitman loved this country as few others could he saw its greatness torn assunder he worked in military hospitals around wash ington and witnessed the terrible tragedy of war and he had mourned the death of lincoln and yet despite all that he looked to the future and saw a nation which he said would eventually have lorty or fifty great states and he saw in america a place where every individual could realize the best in himself he saw equality for women he saw the building of a unique ideal society and he saw the dangers of injustice and isolation he might have been thinking of todays demands for blind conformity when he wrote the great word solidarity has risen of all dangers to a nation as things exist in our day there can be no greater one than having certain portions of the people set off by a line drawnthey not privileged as others but degraded humiliated made of no account what he was saying was this we can neither allow ourselves to be cast into ethnic stereotypes nor can we put ourselves into such a mold just as we would not have society put us into an isolated box neither should we in our own pride impose rigid conformity on ourselves in whitmans vision of americs every man and woman would be unique would honor their own roots but be free to reach out in all directions to other people other citizens he saw american individualism as not that half only i which isolates there is another half which la adhesiveness or love that fuses ties and aggregates making the races comrades and fraternizing all whitman lived and wrote at a time of great national disillusionment the din of disputation rages around me he wrote acrid the temper of the parties the president sends his message reconstruction is in abeyance the nomination and the contest for the twentyfirst presidential draw close with loudest threat and bustle but he did not despair of these and all the like of these the eventuations i know not but well i know that behind them and whatever their even tuations the vital things remain safe and certain and all the needed work goes on so are we in an age of disiluslonment the industrial world sees slow growth and no way to cope with the insidious effects of inflationand so the rich intend to build their walls higher and surround their wealth with moats fearing that they might lose everything the politics of the administration today is a new period of knownothingsome thing that whitman knew very well the administration puts its civil rights litigation on hold it spends all its energies dismantling education housing and employment programs saying that when the economy is right everyone will be all right but they ignore and forget the experience of our own past it was only in the sixties that we had ideal economic conditions like those stock man promlaes yes in the sixties we had low unemployment we had low inflation and we had rapid growth but we also had millions who were left out of the general prosperity millions who has no way to latch onto the promise of americathe promise that they too could become the kind of individuals we all want to bethe promise that every man and wolman could realize their full potential we discovered then that general prosperity and stability does not bring with it automatjune a 1981 co ic success for everyone there are those for whom the door may be open but the threshold too high to step over there are those who struggle for food for the bare necessities of life for any kind of hope at all that ia why we had riots in the midst of plenty there was despair and that is why the new knownothing age is so dangerous it ignores the reality that even when there is plenty even when there is economic stability there are those who need help to survive and to realize their share of the dream for us then for those of us who are ethnic minorities and for those who care about people who are in need this is the task of the eighties we must first and foremost defend the basic civil rights that have been so hard won after all as melville warns the gradetions of progress arent automatic and retracing our steps is a possibility it would be tragic to forget that vigilance is not only prudent but absolutely necessary in an age where the president aims to tear down the structures that protect civil rights from affirmative action right down to the elemental human rights of prisoners secondly we must concentrate our energies and resources on the fight for economic opportunityfor it means little or nothing to have the right to ride the bus if we cant serape up the money to buy the ticket or to enter school where there are no books and third we must make common cause with others when the civil rights of some are threatened the civil rights of all are threatened when poverty afflicts minorities it also afflicts those who are not in our number we cannot let ourselves be isolated or work in ways that isolate ourselves the great strength of this country as whitman observed is in its diversity he saw in us a great rolling massindividual and yet united no matter how great the concern how far the vision sooner or later we come down to one single solitary soul and so it is with us we have to concern ourselves with the greatest good for the greatest number and yet we can never forget that for people of faith and people of good will we can never forget the individual dignity and worth of each single solitary soul that is what our country is about it is what our faith is about and it is what our task is about if we maintain civil rights if we achieve economic opportunity we can only do it as part of a great nation that remains dedicated to the achievement of individual potential a nation that prizes most of all its own people that is why the song reads we shall overcome black and white together we shall overcome i do believe"], [0.017935097217559814, 0.9820649027824402, 1, "i want to express my appreciation for this opportunity for my colleagues and me to present what we feel is a compelling case for concurring in the judgment of the other body and opposing the expenditure of billions of taxpayer dollars on the troubleplagued c5 i feel this special order is particularly important in light of the enormous lobbying effort being conducted not only by private contractors but by a wide range of department of defense and air force personnel this coordinated series of actions was described today in several major newspapers including the washington post the boston globe and the chicago suntimes it is in the words of one pentagon official quoted in the boston globe article written by fred kaplan the militaryindustrial complex at work stark naked selfrevealed and selfidentified i have had a chance to review the detailed computer printout described in these articles the possible illegalities and the obvious improprieties of the defense departments actions are most serious because they represent a coordinated plan to influence members of congress utilizing govern ment personnel and involving the ex penditure of public funds it shows an unprecedented abuse of a much abused law according to a pentagon official quoted in the globe article its unusually intense ive never seen one handled this way among the specific actions described in the c5 team actions are having lockheed draft a letter to be sent to key members of congress as representing the position of the secretary of defense the maintenance of a computer data base to coordinate actions of lockheed department of defense and air force personnel to lobby members of congress this data base is discussed at almost daily meetings in the pentagon pressuring contractors and subcontractors to actively lobby for the c5 although not included in the printout there are also reports of communications from department of defense officials to firms with an interest in the 747 directing them not to lobby on behalf of that alternative air force drafting of softsell dear colleagues for use by members of congress this is in the words of an official quoted by the boston globe one seedy step farther then theyve gone before attempts to mobilize private military associations and obtain back home lobbying support despite the fact that the legislative history of title 18 section 1913 the statutory prohibition on the use of appropriated funds for lobbying was specifically adopted to prevent this type of activity on the part of the executive all in all the 79 items listed on the team action document represent the most widespread and finely integrated efforts to pressure the elected representatives in the congress to accept a department position they go far beyond simply providing information at the request of the member and through proper channels and can not be represented as democracy at work as one air force general characterized them in response to these revelations i today introduced with 10 of my col leagues a resolution of inquiry to the secretary of defense to determine the full extent of the pentagons lobbying efforts and whether illegal actions have in fact occurred while i feel it is important that this lobbying effort be brought to light it is more important for members of the house to consider the airlift options before us on the merits initially it should be noted that in a rapid deployment force scenario only about 6 percent of all equipment to be delivered will go by airlift sealift and prepositioning will play a much larger role of that equipment that is time sensitive and demands airlift only about 1427 percent is socalled outsize equipment that would demand a c5 aircraft we do not plan any major airlift of tanks and even marine corps gen p x kelly has said this should be the exception rather than the rule further the congressionally mandated mobility study on which stated requirements are based assumed the inclusion of 32 more 747 equivalent aircraft in the civilian air fleet and did not account for dedication of the c5 to outsize cargos even though the military airlift command according to a memo from brig gen donald brown does give outsize cargo priority on the c5 thus the stated requirements overstate the need for outsize cargo and understate the shortfall of oversize capability which the 747 can economically provide in addition we are already taking a number of actions to improve the capabilities of our existing c5 fleet including a 1 5 billion rewinging program over 1 billion in additional spares and acquisition of 44 kc10 tankers which will increase c5 productivity up to 20 percent with completion of these improvements the c5 will provide 36 percent of our total airlift capability even though even the most demanding cmms scenario requires only 27 percent of cargo be outsize the major effort to improve oversize capability through craf enhancement has been a failure only one aircraft has been added in the last 8 years and with no new widebodies being purchased by domestic companies and the fact that conversion of surplus widebodies would make them more difficult to sell there is nothing to suggest crap enhancement will be any more successful now than in the past purchase of new or used widebodied aircraft on the other hand offers several advantages compared to the c5 they are far less expensive have longer range and carry a larger payload they can deliver cargo at one quarter the cost of the c5 based on the experience of the yom kippur war they have demonstrated their military utility not only in this conflict but in department of defense team spirit exercises as well i want to emphasize the importance of the cost savings and explain why the defense departments attempts to increase costs guaranteed in the boeing proposal are not valid the air force admits that as probosed by boeing the widebody option would provide a 6 billion life cycle cost savings over the c5 even if we purchase no used aircraft the pentagon attempt to artificially increase support costs by rejecting without any specific analysis the proposal to provide contractor support this support concept is already in use on the kc10 the c9 and e4 and air force witnesses have testified it has achieved a 50percent savings over organic support on the kc10 the pentagon also increases the fuel consumption for the 747 beyond credible levels in its desperate attempts to reduce cost differences on the other hand the pentagon ac cepts at face value the lockheed proposal even though the line has been closed for 9 years and they propose to supply aircraft at a lower constant dollar cost than during previous pro duction most important the pentagon accepts an assumption that maintenance costs which at 75 6 manhours of maintenance per flying hour are four times those of other aircraft will be cut in half in the new airplanes clearly an objective reading of the two proposals will show major savings for the widebodied commerical aircraft option this savings lb most important at a time when we face serious budget constraints and the total pentagon shopping list has increased by 150 billion in just the last 3 months of last year according to the selected acquisition report finally the c5 is justified on the grounds that it will provide airlife improvements quickly this is simply false the c5 is no near term solution the full 50 will not be in operation until the 1990s at least 3 years later than the commerical aircraft option the real long term preference of the services for outsize both intertheater and intratheater airlift is the c17 this is obvious from the presentation of january 8 of air force secretary vernon orr to deputy secretary of defense carlucci the c17 meets all 10 long range airlift requirements defined for the cx mission elements needs statement while the c5 meets just two according to new chairman of the joint chiefs of staff vessey and the simple fact is that by going with the c5 you are killing the c17 the revised funding profile for the c17 over the next 5 years went from 7 billion to under 100 million as a result of the decision to spend nearly 9 billion on the c5 and you can be sure that c5 proponents will try to get more than just the initial 50 bought making acquisition of the c17 even less likely in summation i think there is a strong merits case for purchasing commercial aircraft in favorable economic conditions and converting them to highly capable military freighters to meet our immediate airlift requirements for the long term whatever outsized requirements we have can better be met by the c17 the winner of the cx competition i hope the members of the house will be able to disregard the high pressure tactics being used on this issue and carefully evaluate the real issues involved i am confident that when they do they will be convinced that the taxpayers interests will not be best served by reopening the line on the system that still is the champ on cost overuns and maintenance failures c5b team achrons action 05 24 ap

public debate there has been remarkably little critical examination and discussion of the administrations prpposals the underlying assumptions the desirability of the proposed shift to freemarket solutions for problems ranging from energy conservation and funding for the arts to distressed industries and cities and of the human and social impact of the changes being considered if we have learned anything about economics during the past decade it is that no single group least of all professional economists have a lock on the truth yet we face today a very determined band of conservative economists and policymakers in the white housesome might call them economic theologians who trade in belief rather than proofwho are asking congress to ratify sweeping changes in federal policy without offering in return the harc economic and impact analysis that is needed to consider their proposals the reagan administrations game plan represents far more than just a series of piecemeal budget cuts it signifies a major reordering of federal priorities roles and responsibilities built up over the last three decades as one example the president proposes to consolidate health education and social service programs into a few block grants while cutting aggregate funds in each area by about onequarter under this plan states and localities will have complete discretion to decide which program will receive funds and for what in the education field it could mean that the claims of a disadvantaged child for funds will be set against the claims of adult or vocational education or even library support without federal standards political weight can prove decisive in the fight over block grant funds is this the concept congross had in the historic battle against poverty and unequal opportunity the reagan proposals also contain the seeds of a fundamental shift in the composition of federal revenues already during the past few decades the corporate share of the federal tax burden has declined dramatically while individual taxes have risen now under the reagan proposal to cut business taxes through accelerated do preciation business taxes could be cut by more than half of what they are presently yet there are no contemplated cuts in payroll taxes on individuals that in many cases already exceed the burden of income taxes it should be clear by now that the administrations intention to cut taxes by 30 percent will impose on congress the deepening burden to make even further domestic program cuts in future years as the individual tax load grows ever more

business for themselves as chairman of the goverment information and individual rights subcommittee i have become acutely aware in the last few months of the need for this legislation in a growing and vital part of our economythe socalled information industries of telecommunications and data processingsome government agencie 5 seem to be usurping the role of private enterprise in the united states we believe that where private enterprise can do the job it should do the job we believe that the government has only a secondary role in providing services to its citizens we even rely on the private sector to deliver the services that the goverinment needs to do its job nowhere is this policy more clearly established than in the area of telecommunications and information servio~es twice in our history the congress has rejected proposals to let the goverrnnnt run our communications system first with the telegraph and later with the telephone we are beginning t~o open the third chapter in this centhryold congressional debate we have gone beyond the telegraph and the telephone we now talk of digital communications and electronic messages the question before us is what role government should have in the delivery of enhanced communications services such as electronic mail electronic fund transfers and a wide variety of data base services the bill i am offering would prohibit any federal agency from providing computer or comnmunications services to anyone other than another agency the object is to insure that the government does not stifle the development of innovative and competitive informnation services by private enterprise the legislation would also insure that federal data processing and communications resources are not misdirected in this time of budgetary constraint with fewer resources available govenent should be using what it has to conduct its internal operations not providing subsidized services to private businesses there are of course exceptions to this general rule where government is the only one capable of providing a service where it is uneconomic or impractical for private enterprise and where the service is needed by the nation then a federal agency should supply it in this field however those circumstances are rare the bill permits an agency to provide computer or commiunications services to people outside the government first where congress has approved the service and requires an agency to provide it or second where congress has granted a general authority which permits the agency to provide a service and the president after determining the service is warranted approves its provision through an executive order this legislation should cause no undue hardships in electronic mail for example the postal service would be able to carry out its planned ecomv system the bill would in no way restrict the postal service from receiving electronic messages printing them out and delivering them the bill would only forbid the postal service unless it gets congressional approval from offering telecommunications transmission services and as senior assistant postmaster general james finch told the government information and individual rights subcommittee on october 5 our intent is not to get into the transmission business under any set of circumstan es with this legislation however the danger of the postal service or any other agency moving unilaterally into the provision of telecommunications services would end the provision of electronic information services would occur only after careful scrutiny by the congress and the president the bill is not a final product rather it is the appropriate starting point for debate and deliberation the government information and individual rights subcommittee intends to continue its inquiry into the provision of computer and communications services by federal agencies for private use next week we will be examining the role of the federal lieserve system in electronic funds transfer and that will be only the second day of hearings in this continuing inquiry the text of the bill follows hi r 4758 a bill to amend the federal property and administrative services act

is a back door attempt to repeal and undo what this very house did overwhelmingly just about 2v years agoand to do so not through the authorization process but through the appropriations process now my good friend the distinguished gentleman from new york mentioned that these two amendments would constitute a violation of the rules of the house and the gentleman is absolutely correct they would that is why we need to have a rule which would make them in order but by the same token what the appropriations committee has brought to the floor is an appropriation for the federal trade commission which has not yet been authorized by the authorizing committee and that is a violation of the rules of this house and that is why the waivers exist in this rule this morning if it were not for the waiver in this rule a point of order could be made against the ftc appropriation now it is not the fault of the appropriations committee i want to make that very clear it is not the fault of the appropriations committee the authorizing committee has not yet reported out an authorization and the appropriations committee is faced with the alternative of trying to bring some funding forward in

this problem and if you remember i suggest to my colleagues several years ago because of the same type of situation we are in today the exact same type of situation the ftc was not authorized and ultimately did not get funds appropriated because of this same type of fight what we areseeing here is a minority of the members of the house attempting to impose their will through the use of the

in place we do not have legislation before us so we do not know exactly how it is going to fit into the whole program we do know though that no portion of the money is going to be earmarked for legal services so when it goes to my state the competition i know is going to be there the vested interests there will compete for the money already with a 25percent cut out of them and the constituency developed over the years to compete for the funds i have very real doubts about whether there will be a legal services program administered by my state if it is put in the block grant program there is a possibility with a reasonable transition period and i would favor this after we have had an opportunity to develop a state program to supervise it then maybe would be the time for a block grant program but to pull the rug out from under now would be wrong"], [0.001179516315460205, 0.4988204836845398, 0, "the members of the oregon delegation to the house of representatives have today

know the state of oregon provides a veterans home and farm loan program to qualified state veterans revenue for this program is raised by the sale of taxexempt mortgage revenue bonds prior to january 1 of this year the oregon state department of veterans affairs issuedloan commitments to thousands of veterans in anticipation of bond sales scheduled for january and april of during the final days of the 96th congress the mortgage subsidy bond tax act of 1980 was enacted although veterans home loan programs were initially e~empted from the jurisdiction of this act amendments were added during consideration by the senate house conference committee which extended coverage to certain veterans home loan programs as well those oregon veterans who on the basis of a firm loan commitment from the state department of veterans affairs sold their homes invested their life savings and entered into land sales contracts are now in the position of suffering irreparable financial harm these veterans have become unwitting victims of a fedeeal law which has toppled a longstanding state program it becomes the responsibility of the congress then to see that veterans who negotiated loan applications and commitments prior to the enactment date of the new law january 1 are provided emergency relief from the devastating effects of the mortgage subsidy bond tax act our bill asks that the january and april oregon bond sales be exempted from the new law so that applications received prior to the enactment date can be honored by the state department of veterans affairs i urge that the house of

that some of the chairmen would have the authorization of their committees and also the best interests of the american people at heart and would allow us to consider this legislation but i would say

i was serving as lieutenant governor among his many contributions while in congress craigs involvement with atomic energy development while serving as ranking member of the interior committee and the

is not from a lack of confidence in the judgment of the gentleman let me suggest to the gentleman where our information comes from and why i am concerned about this first of all the department of energy has made a study of thi matter and just recently reported that it is substantially more expensive to the tune of almost 1 billion that it would cost to go to the new steel tanks as opposed to the salt domes frankly there are those of us who believe their estimates are wrong our own subcommittee staff did the best it could in a limited period of time they estimate a more conservative amount that ps timate is a more conservative estimate that estimate states that it would cost 280 million better than a quarter of a billion dollars in additional expenditures to build steel tanks rather than big hill salt dome this is why i say that i think we are a little premature in the house to make a decision that could have a major budgetary impact i would hope certainly that the gentlemans

find this whole policy and the excuse of the defense department to be ludicrous there is a great deal of difference between having comparability as to american and foreign components of a defense product these are not essentially defense products we are talking about in fact it might interest some of my colleagues to know that the unitedstates army has bought small japanese picktp trucks and put them in massachusetts at several of its installations they did not even have the decency to go out and buy a japanesemade chevrolet luv or ford whatever it is called so that at least the profit would come to the manufacturing company in this country they went out and bought something that says datsun across the back of it i find my constituents outraged at a time when we are suffering the largest unemployment rate in the history of thet automobile business when we are underwriting the problems of chrysler corp when we have had the worst sales record in the auto industry in history when

that reason i am going to vote with the gentleman to override the presidents veto unlike some of the other members who have spoken here today i am not reluctant to vote to override because we in maine are facing many of the same problems in international trade that some of our other colleagues here face with this particular issue i do not want to get far afield from the subject of this particular debate but our shoe and textile manufacturers have suffered because of lack of sympathy by the administration not simply in this administration but several and we have lost thousands of jobs over the last 5 or 10 years to trade situations which have worked against the interests of domestic shoe and textile production at the present time we are facing several very difficult problems with agriculture in aroostook county particularly import problems with canadian potatoes coming in and flooding american markets the fishing industry the wood products industry the wood dowel industry and the cement industry have all had similar problems i would hope that a vote on this particular piece of legislation would provide at least some measure of concern from us to the administration and
