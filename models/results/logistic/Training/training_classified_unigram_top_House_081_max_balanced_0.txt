able to correct its own errors of commission or make amends for its errors of omission the wisdom or folly of what we have done and what we have left undone will be matters for decision by the electorate in november in many cases there is time enough to wait for that judgmentand to be guided by it in the next congress in some matters however the delay of months even 6 or 7 may be more than we can afford in such matters our failures may be written large and indelibly on the record before the eightysecond congress ever convenes that is why i speak today a bill vital to the welfare of this nation the health of our armed forces and our civilian population alike is in danger of being left in the debris of the unfinished business of this congress h r 8886 the emergency health training act better known as aid to medical education is a measure which should be passed now not 6 or 12 or 18 months from now and all the stalling twisting turning conniving tactics of the american medical association cannot conceal the stark need for this legislation the word emergency has seldom meant more than it does in the official title of h r 8886 this nation is now involved in an enormously difficult and costly police action in korea the evolution of this conflict into a fullfledged modern war is a distinct possibility a possibility not entirely within the power of this country to control even if we should escape a major holocaust no one believes that the communists adventure in korea will be their last yet at this moment as at every recent critical moment in our history we do not have enough doctors or dentists or nurses or publichealth personnel to meet peacetime requirements much less the demands of our mobilizing armed forces and civilian defense and we have not taken a single step to end the critical shortage of every kind of trained health personnel as a matter of honest and disturbing fact our national resources for training health personnel are rapidly deteriorating instead of improving financial difficulties are forcing our professional healthtraining schools particularly our medical schools to curtail their programs drastically both the quality and quantity of training are being slashed fewer individuals are receiving training in some schools and the training is falling short of minimum standards in others some of our medical schoolsand by no means the weakest in an academic senseare near to closing because of their desperate financial state this situation is intolerable in a nation that may soon need more doctors nurses and other trained health personnel than it ever dreamed were necessary before world war ii and even if it were not for the possible demands of war we would need these people to take advantage of the expanding opportunities for better health in a peaceful world the eightyfirst congress must reverse this trend to neglect and potential disaster by immediate action on federal aid to medical education we must by our action recognize that you cannot train doctors and their assistants overnight that we are already far too late in getting a program under way that our inaction in years and months past has created our present healthpersonnel shortage and that inaction now will create shortages for the next crisis the minute we moved into koreaand i believe there is near unanimous support in this house for that movethe armed forces started to look for doctors dentists and nurses if the experience of world war ii is repeated and it is certain to be because of present shortages the armed forces will never find as many as they need and the ones they do find and take will be those whose services are fully needed by civilians it is proper that the needs of our armed forces come first it is hardly proper for congressional inaction to permit this choice of life and health for one group as against sickness and occasional death for another group when there should be no real need to make the choice we have it within our power to make adequate care available for all for those who may hesitate to believe that our present situation is really so bleakand i know there are doubters among the membets of this housei will cite a large number of chapters and verses at a later point in this speech most of them will come directly from the best authorities on health education in the nationthe deans of the nations leading medical and dental schools public and private alike and the heads of associations of nurses and publichealth personnel it is also worth noting that the american dental association is on record for the bill right now however i want to discuss the general situation of the bill to aid medical education with particular reference to its only vocal oppositionthe american medical association h r 886 is still in the interstate and foreign commerce committee scheduled for further consideration august 8 if this house and its committees are still in a position to consider any legislation at that time this despite the fact that corresponding legislation passed the senate last september and shortly thereafter went to the rules committee of this house with the blessing of the full interstate and foreign commerce committee who and what are responsible for this sudden reversal in the legislative process who is responsible for this inexcusable delay in meeting a vital national need this late in the grim struggle of the free world against the forces of communism why do i stand here in july of 1950 and plead for action on a measure which most of us well know should have been law months ago the answer is always the samethe american medical association until recently i though i had grown calloused to the amas doginthemanger selfishness in its efforts to defeat almost every progressive public health measure offered in this congress i thought i had grown used to the double talking double dealing methods of the ama and its huckster representatives in their defense of a status quo riddled with inadequacies i thought i had learned to brace myself against the overwhelming weight of the ama hierarchys 3 000 000 advertising and political slush fund well i was wrong when the ama maneuvered to kill by indirection this literally lifeanddeath legislation i lost my calluses i want the members of this house to know the whole story of this measure and the amas opposition perhaps it will furnish an insight into the operations of this organization which some of you have not always displayed in the recent past i do not mean to say this is the only story of ama duplicity and reaction in the face of the health needs of the people of this country many others come immediately to mind there is the slander campaign against nationalhealth insurance which calls it socialized medicine despite the fact that the ama well knows it is not socialized medicine at all part of this campaign is the attempt to use the completely discredited alleged quotation from lenin that socialized medicine is the keystone of the arch of the socialist state the ama has been called upon to either document or stop using that quotation many many times its officials have admitted that the quotation cannot be documented experts at both the library of congress and the university of chicago have declared there is no such statement in the known works of lenin yet the quotation continues to be used in published material in public speeches and in political assaults the use of such falsehoods is typical of the ama approach to issues of public health and they can no longer be defended on the lame grounds of ignorance of the truth they are willful perversions of the truth then there is the attempt to discredit the federal security agency and its administrator with completely unfounded and disproved charges that they wish to dictate to american medicine there is the constant pounding at the slogan keep politics out of this picture while the ama tops the nations lobbyists in expenditures and publicly prepares a political blast in the nations newspapers for next october while its incoming president dr elmer henderson delivers a violent political tirade against the fair deal at the annual ama convention in san francisco he attacked our government as sick with intellectual dishonesty moral laxity and with reckless excesses and charged the administration with a campaign to gain control over all fields of human endeavor to make this a socialist state dr henderson ignored his responsible position as head of an organization which says it wants nothing to do with politics to engage in political mud slinging and use of misrepresentations and distortions there are many other items there is the amas cooperation in spreading the hatemongering nonsense of john t flynns book the road ahead across the country in hundreds of thousands of volumes volumes which the conservative new york times has very properly labeled pernicious flummery there is the backscenes battle against school health measures there is the long history on voluntary medical insurance plans related in the harpers magazine article the dogged retreat of the doctors there is indeed an overwhelming mass of evidence to show that the hierarchic officialdom of the ama is one of the most reactionary forces in american life today but i think the story of the bill to bring federal aid to the medical education is the most devastating illustration of all of the amas complete disregard for the national interest when it conflicts with the narrow selfish interest of the ama the history of the legislation to provide federal aid to the nations medical schools is the story of conflict between two forces on one side is the desperate need of the medical schools and the health requirements to the nation on the other side is the american medical association in 1946 immediately after the war it was generally agreed that this country must proceed to make up its deficiencies in medical personnel to get sorely needed doctors dentists nurses and trained public health technicians into rural and other shortage areas to make available enough health personnel to put into practice all that we have learned about how to keep people healthy and well it was recognized that the only way to do this would be to step up the numbers of individuals receiving training and to improve the quality of that training even the american medical association permitted official spokesmen to discuss the need dr herman weiskotten dean of the syracuse university college of medicine and a member of the council on medical education and hospitals of the ama declared that approximately half of our medical schools were operating on budgets far below the essential basic minimum required for the conduct of a satisfactory educational program and in february 1947 he added and i quote the american people should realize that the first and most important step in improving the health and the medical care of our people is the more adequate support of more than half of the medical schools of this country in october 1947 dr anderson secretary of the same council told of a study made by the ama of which he said and again i quote we are prepared to contend that the maximum deficit that could possibly be forecast for 1960 does not exceed 15 000 physicians only 15 000 when you consider that the average physicians patient list runs between 500 and 1 000 you get some idea of what number of people would get inadequate care with such a shortage it could not conceivably run below seven and a half million and this in peacetime yet there you have the statement of a responsible ama official predicting a doctor shortageand even more astounding not worrying about it well the ama for all its later denials and present insistence that the federal government do nothing to help medical schools recognized at that time that some help must come if the schools were not to collapse so in february 1948 its board of trustees decided that it would seek voluntary assistance in order to avoid bringing the federal government into the matter a commendable idea but it just did not work the 1948 report of the council on medical education of the ama said medical schools required an addtiional 15 000 000 in support for operations and some 197 000 000 for construction of needed facilities and commented the question that remains is whether the public will provide this support voluntarily or whether it will have to be provided by direct federal subsidy that indeed was the question the trouble was the answer in july 1948 a meeting authorized by the board of trustees was held in new york city representatives of universities business industry banking educational foundation and private philanthropic organizations discussed a national campaign for raising about 15 000 000 a year to support medical education a lot of hopes were raised by that meeting but as of this date 2 years later no money so we have arrived finally at the set of circumstances which led to introduction of the aid to medical education legislation something had to be doneand still does for that matter it could not be done privately or through state governments only the federal government was in a position to act did the ama admit this not the ama the report of its council on medical education and hospitals on october 30 1948 as much as declared that if the problem could not be solved the amas way there was no problem the report was naturally a bit confused but i will quote it anyway to give you the full flavor these studies have led to the conclusion that there is no need for any great increase in the number of medical graduates and the gradual expansion of facilities for medical education that is taking place will adequately meet the nations needs the council will continue to give close attention to this problem where did that word problem come from again was there or was not there one there was one dr weiskotten pops up with this admission in a statement in february 1949 in which he points out paradoxic as it may appear in the face of the present plight of the existing medical schools there is developing a demand that these schools greatly increase the sizes of their student bodies and that new schools be established at this juncture it became clear that only federal aid could help with this problem a very real one growing more acute with every evasion and statement of the ama so bills were introduced in both the senate and the house at the end of the open senate hearings a group of the most distinguished experts in every sector of the professional health training field including important ama representation agreed on a set of 13 general principles among which were statements that the schools were in a financial emergency that there are recognized shortages of manpower in the health professions and that existing private sources of income are not able to meet the needs for either operation or construction they supported federal aid and even agreed that scholarships as well as operation and construction grants would be helpful in equalizing and expanding educational opportunities for qualified individuals this group also set up a series of guides to the senate committee for the writing of the bill the bill conformed to those guides as closely as possible and was passed as s 1453 in september 1949 before passage at an august meeting in washington dr george f lull of the ama told reporters the organization favored aid to medical education after senate passage the house interstate and foreign commerce committee took up h r 5940 the house companion bill which i sponsored the committee unanimously approved the bill and sent it to the rules committee for a rule the rule was refused not because of opposition but because of the press of time just before the close of the first session of this congress during this entire process the ama was almost quiet only a few words broke the welcome silence and they were far from ominous in a report to the ama house of delegates in november the amas council of medical education declared and i quote while the council is not entirely satisfied with the bill it does incorporate several modifications suggested by the councils representatives and it is a distinct improvement over any other bill for federal aid to education that has been introduced the honeymoon however was soon over in a supplementary report of the board of trustees in december 1949 there was the following statement since s 1453 has now passed the senate and since it appears doubtful that further changes will be made by the house in the companion bill h r 5940 the board of trustees feels it must oppose this bill there was no explanation of what happened between november and december and so it has gone ever since attempts have been made to satisfy the ama objections which were made after this december declaration h r 8886 a considerably changed version of h r 1940 which goes at least half way in compromising both major and minor issues has been the result and still the ama opposition is adamant there is neither rhyme nor reason in their opposition but nothing apparently will change it the federal government is involved and while the federal government safely makes all other sorts of laws for the united states the ama is not going to have it even take note of the health needs of the nations citizens despite the amas exasperating attitude despite this long compromise and then oppose the compromise period extending way into june we have done everything possible to write a bill which would get at least the tacit approval of the ama we might as well have saved our energy no matter what was said or done the ama stalled and temporized typical was a proposal that we wait until still another survey the survey on medical education of the ama be completed i asked a participant in the survey dr joseph c hinsey dean of the cornell university medical school and chairman of the executive council of the association of american medical schools if this request was valid i will not read his whole reply but let me give you one paragraph i strongly recommend that you do not hold up action on h r 5940 now h r 8886 the final report of the survey committee will be available for the use of the national council on education for health professions a group set up by the proposed legislation before it submits its recommendation on january 1 1953 i repeat 1953 well might hinsey add later as he does there seems no reason to wait there is only one conclusion the ama does not want the federal government to help the nations medical schools no matter how desperate their plight and since there is no other aid forthcoming it looks very much as if the ama did not want medical schools and other professional healthtraining schools helped at all as a matter of fact many of the schools and professions affected are beginning to realize this sad truth and break with the reactionaries of the ama this congress would do well to follow their example earlier i promised to cite chapter and verse on the entire health training situation in this country we must all know something of the general picture time printed a piece discussing the plight of the medical schools recently the philadelphia inquirer carried an editorial the other day which told of the closing of private rooms and wards in voluntary hospitals in new york because of the shortage of nurses other newspapers have noted both nursing and public health personnel shortages the new york times carried a long analytic article in one of its sunday magazine sections asking for urgent action on federal aid to dental and medical schools but to get down to the chapter and verse let us turn to the statements of the best qualified experts in america the men who run the professional health training schools of all kinds i am going to read just a few excerpts on the floor but i ask that the entire communications be made part of the r cord i have already read some of dr hinseys remarks as head of the organization to which almost all of the medical school deans in the country belong but i want to quote from another letter written january 12 1950 in which he discusses this need the ama denies first making clear that the ama acted on aid to medical education without consulting the association of american medical colleges he goes on to tell the schools sentiments in the matter here i begin to quote our committee on financial aid to medical education decided unanimously that we should poll the individual medical colleges by telegrams in order to fairly determine our overall position this committee on financial aid to medical education is made up of dean arthur c bachmeyer of the university of chicago dean george p berry of harvard university dean walter a eloedorn of george washington university vice president ward darley of the university of colorado and dean joseph c hinsey of cornell university chairman after its study and work with this legislation this committee is unanimous in its support of h r 5940 the poll of the membership with definite returns in from 63 schools shows 47 favorable to the legislation in h r 5940 and 16 opposed of the 26 stateowned schools 14 favored and 12 opposed two municipally owned institutions were favorable of the 35 private institutions 31 were favorable and 4 were opposed even if the 15 schools not reporting were to be opposedand i have reason to believe strongly that this would not be the casethere would still be a strong majority in favor of the legislation other letters i have from individual deans support dean hinsey the ama did not consult them they point out and they after all are the ones who know the facts of the situation dr willard c rappleye dean and vice president in charge of medical affairs at columbia university writes may we express the earnest hope that your committee will give favorable consideration this is a matter of great urgency dr r s cunningham dean of the albany medical college at union university writes only if our income is substantially increased can we maintain the high level of medical education from which the public benefits so greatly in view of these facts i hope that you will exert your full influence to secure passage of the bill dr w e brown dean at the university of vermont adds i hope we can count on you to help medical education in vermont and throughout the united states by supporting h r 5940 or its substitute house bill for aid to medical education most american medical schools and this includes the university of vermont college of medicine must radically curtail educational programs unless substantial financial support is forthcoming within the next 2 months that letter gentlemen was dated may 12 it is the same with the university of buffalo marquette university creighton university meharry medical college the university of virginia loyola university and dozens of others the association of urban universities wired this in october of 1949 the association of urban universities whose membership are carrying a large percentage of the burden of medical dental and nursing education voices its approval of the emergency health training bill and now that we have begun to hear of the other schools beside the medical schools let me read you a part of a letter from the deans of all the schools of medicine dentistry and public health in massachusetts the dentistry nursing public health and other training included in this bill is just as important as the training of doctors this is what the deans of these varied schools at harvard tufts and boston university wrote we are convinced that the present desperate plight of our professional schools not only in massachusetts but throughout the united states has already interfered with the quality of professional education and is preventing the development of adequate medical and health personnel for the country we make this statement in full awareness of the position recently taken by the american medical association we vigorously oppose that position the american medical association in adopting its position was in no way authorized to speak for the professional schools of massachusetts early passage of h r 5940 will enable the professional schools of the united states to start immediately on an expanded more effective total program of training we do not believe that this urgent need can be met without such a program then there are the letters from the administrators of huge universities like chicago and illinois chancelor robert hutchins of the university of chicago also chairman of the committee on federal aid to medical schools of the american association of universities wired president conants recent statement on the precarious financial condition of harvard medical and public health schools is applicable in my opinion to every school in the country training personnel for the professions concerned with health without operating funds schools will be unable to maintain current enrollmentsalready dangerously lowand improve present standards of instruction i therefore urge prompt passage of h r 5940 dr a c ivy vice president in charge of the college of the health professions at the university of illinoisincluding medicine dentistry nursing and pharmacyexpresses similar sentiments with this interesting statement thrown in for good measure everyone knows that more physicians nurses dentists pharmacists and public health officers are needed in our state and county in some places this is true to such an extent that the principle of free enterprise and free choice of a physician is not operative that as the ama has been telling us all along is intolerable there is much more of the same and i include it all in the record an editorial from the university of southern california medical bulletin the statement of need from the joint congressional committee on the economic report which saw many lowincome families without proper medical care because of health personnel shortages and the hoover commissions task force recommendations there is the recent speech by father michael i english regent of the loyola university of medicine in chicago in which he criticized the ama for deciding against government aid to medical schools without consulting medical leaders calling the organization more than conservative among the endorsements of federal aid to medical education which i am attaching to this record is one from father english in which he not only endorses the bill despite ama opposition but indicates that at least one ama sponsored amendment would hurt rather than help the bill it all adds up and it all adds up to this h r 8886 the latest version of the emergency health training act is of vital importance to build our national health defenses for both peace and war our healthtraining schools cannot do the job without federal aid the only opponent of federal aid is the ama as the ama has so often been the only opponent of bills designed to improve the health of the american people we must pass h r 8886 over the objections of a blindly selfish ama officialdom which either stupidly or wilfully is interfering with the welfare of our armed forces and our civilian population we must either pass h r 8886 or relinquish to the ama our right to promote the general welfare through health legislation as brig gen james s simmons dean of the harvard school of public health told the same ama convention at which dr hendersons disgraceful mangling of the truth took place 2 weeks ago all problems of health assume a dominant role in the present uncertain international situation we must among other things be prepared to meet the entirely new threat of unannounced atomic war and biologic warfare what we need most and again the words are those of general simmons is to shore up our national health defenses h r 8886 is the first step in that most urgent task it cannot wait for another congress"], [0.01439136266708374, 0.9856086373329163, 1, "i thank the gentleman from new york the worst offenders of course were from the armed services but they are not the only offenders i know of no bureau or agency appearing here that was not an offender 1 day this week after a rollcall vote the members of my subcommittee six of uslike in a mack sennett comedyjumped into a taxi to go down to witness the great historic signing of the north atlantic pact arriving at the hall we waited in line 10 minutes while this long array of government limousines while these bureaucrats and their gracious ladies got out to go to this ceremony and the peasants from the house of representatives stood around trying to get out of the cab i do not think we should have limousines here i have been using shanks mare for a long time i use cabs or somebody elses automobile busses and streetcars and i am sure my colleagues will do the same as we have been doing happily i have no objection to dignity and protocol and to the representatives of our great government being in proper decorum at all these meetings at all times i would be the first to hold a brief for them to see that they are properly accoutred and that their entourage is the equal if not greater than of any country in the world i come here only to protest the abuses because many times i have gone with my colleagues to government affairs and receptions or what have you and the senators and we members of the house have had to jump behind poles or behind trees or up on the curbstone so that some bureau chief with his limousine and chauffeur would not knock our heads off throwing dust and gravel in our eyes i am not presuming to be facetious in this very sacred forum but enough is enough let me assure you that my subcommittee refused day after day and dozen after dozen of requests for replacement of motor vehicles and for new cars the bill before us makes appropriations for the departments of state commerce and the federal judiciary for the fiscal year 1950 the amount recommended in the bill for 1950 for the state department is 271 405 656 for the justice department 132 579 141 for the commerce department 259 927 605 and for the federal judiciary 20 703 700 this is a total of 684 616 102 there is as well contract authorizations in the following amounts for the department of state 2 900 000 for the department of justice 900 000 for the department of commerce 58 800 000 this is a total for contract authorizations of 62 600 000 this gives us a total in appropriations and contract authority of 747 216 102 i have always felt that it is a good practice for the appropriations committee in dealing with particular departments and perhaps more so in dealing with the socalled oldline departments to grant contract authority in lieu of outright appropriations because i feel this practice will result eventually in considerable savings i say this because of the fact that when actual cash is available for expenditure the chances are it can be expended much more readily this is true by all means if the moneys present and at hand are to be utilized for the purchase of equipment and materiel the state department during these troubled times occupies an important position in the government service with relation not only to our own economy but with relation to all the nations of the world the duty of maintaining the prestige and to point the leadership of our nation in world affairs to a great extent depends upon the manner in which the department of state functions there is no doubt that the activities of this department have been greatly increased during the war years and since and this is the result as well of marked changes in our foreign policy i think it is especially important to observe the manner in which a nonpartisan foreign policy has been maintained during these troubled times and i trust that this great nation will ever be able to keep our foreign affairs free of political strife while it is true that i concur in a policy of economy with reference to expenditures in the federal government it is important to observe that caution must be the watchword when we have in mind reducing appropriations of the state department during these troubled times just this week there took place in the capital city of washington and say what you will washington d c today is not only the capital of the united states of america but it is the capital of the world and here in this city the dramatic and historic eventthe signing of the atlantic pact was an event marked importantly in the consideration of this committee because once more an aggressor nation is moving the cast of characters may be a little different their philosophy of government and the way of life may change but the object and the goal of world domination is clearly identical with the ideas of force and fear and terror as the weapons of dictatorship we must remain on guard and aware of these problems the state department today is facing the most complicated and difficult of international problems perhaps the most diversified and complicated in the history of our country we are indeed fortunate that at the helm of the department of state during these times is that distinguished american statesman the honorable dean acheson may god spare him and may god be with him as he speaks for the united states of america year after year the congress has before it discussions having to do with the reorganization of the department of state we now hope that with the reorganization that is now taking place and a great deal of which has been put into effect that we are confronted with a reorganization to end all reorganizations certainly i am convinced the action of this committee in providing the ways and means for the secretary of state to work with greater flexibility insofar as jurisdiction over and the administration of both the foreign service and the civil service personnel of the state department is concerned in both departmental and field assignments will work for the greatest good of the greatest number of all the personnel and undoubtedly for a more efficient service the policy decision in the department of state operating very effectively now that we should try to release foreignservice officers and staff employees for duty in the field wherever possible rather than using them in departmental jobs is a change with great efficiency and great merit and it is important as well to bring these people back to the united states for reamericanization and we should there try to give them not only experience in the department of state but experience out in the country as well it is necessary to keep in mind when we bring back these foreignservice officers who say come back 3 years out of their first 15 years of service as provided in the foreign service act that these people do not have the proper chance to become fully reacquainted with the customs and traditions of what is now america if they only serve in the department in the capital cityamerica is also out among the people of the separate statesnorth south east and west one problem dealing with the state department which of course has been of some concern to the members of the committee is that of security but i believe that the department is doing everything possible to maintain proper security and i believe that careful examination is being made of these security cases because of the fact that the members of the foreign service are separated from the department and from this country by great distances the department has indicated that it is working on a constructive program for indoctrinating the employees on the importance of security in both the civil service with the department and the foreign service it is clear in the past several months that the department is doing an excellent job and i think they can be well proud of the fact that of the 19 000 employees in the department of state only a fractional percentage had any information whatsoever develop against them by these security checks as of february 1 1949 the names and the personal histories of 13 149 employees of the civilservice lists of the department of state and of the foreign service lists had been saubmitted to the fbi for security checking in accordance with the provisions in the loyalty program practically all of these cases in which any questions had been raised were fully investigated by the fbi and processed by the department of state loyalty and security board within the last 7 months a most intensive reindoctrinaton program of the security officers and of all employees of the department have been completed the purpose of this program was to promote the security consciousness among the departmental employees security inspections and surveys are being continually conducted in the most difficult areas and the most sensitive offices in the department so that the highest degree of security can be maintained and insured at all times i must mention the large program under the heading buildings fund where a recommendation of 20 000 000 is discovered i emphasize this fact to make it clear that this is not an actual appropriation but is merely a bookkeeping transaction reflecting the value of foreign credits which the state department has utilized by the acquisition of real estate and improvements for the foreign service the chief problem as has been indicated is not so much in the actual acquisition of land and buildings for the proper functioning of this section of the department but rather because of the facility in which we have now been able to acquire these establishments we are confronted with the considerable problem of future costs and maintenance and the upkeep of these properties for that reason we are repeating the admonition of caution that we have directed to this section of the department dealing with that phase of work one of the best known and current activities of the department of state has to do with the participation of the united states in the various international organizations many of us have felt that there were too many such organizations in which the united states was participating and in this opinion the state department itself at the hearings indicated its agreement we also feel that one of the important factors with reference to this phase of the state department work is the determining factor in the allocation of amounts which the united states is expected to pay or contribute to the maintenance rnd operation of these various international organizations certainly it was the unanimous opinion of this committee that these percentages in some instances were much too high and that the united states of america has been called upon to contribute in excess of what the circumstances might warrant we are certain however that the department is in agreement with this opinion of the committee and that substantial reductions in such percentages are to be made and in the future this phase of allocation of united states contributions is to receive much closer attention it must be remembered that in these allocations of funds and these appropriations for the department of state that we are concerned not only with the functions of the department in one building in the city of washington or alone with the widespread jurisdiction of the great foreign service but there are many other bureaus and missions and organizations coming within the purview of the department of state and included under this appropriation bill i refer for instance to the united nations to that part of the united nations which is the educational scientific and cultural organization of such vast importance to our wvhole theory of life among the nations of the world then there is as well the international refugee organization and we must not forget that part of the work of this vast department which deals with the philippine rehabilitation program and with the various international boundary and water commissions with canada and with the united states and as well the large field of international relations dealing with interamerican affairs i wish to take this opportunity of emphasizing that as a member of this committee and i feel it is the opinion of the committee itself i do not voice any disapproval of the purposes and the objectives of the international information and educational program we speak only under the circumstances of the necessity for too rapid an expansion of the organization which by that mere fact alone might produce waste and inefficiency the history of this organization and of similar organizations in the past indicate that whatever loss results can be traced in most instances to rapid growth of the many activities and one which is considered of importance in this field is that activity in the overseas theater calling for an extension of the exchange of educational and technical information i am satisfied that in dealing with the department of state the committee has been aware at all times of the importance of this great arm of our government and we felt that we have dealt with this appropriation keeping in mind the taxpayer of the united states and we have so dealt without injuring the efficiency of this department or its various divisions and agencies in our consideration of the appropriation for the department of justice you will discover that there is an increase of 14 923 441 over the current year appropriation you will find however that nearly 9 000 000 of this amount is for the employees pay increases in accordance with public law 900 the committee as well was unanimous in its conclusion that increases should be allowed to the federal bureau of investigation and to the antitrust division of the justice department and we therefore authorized additional increases of 1 598 141 and 100 00 respectively and in this way met the reductions made by the bureau of the budget in those two items i am satisfied from listening to the testimony as presented to our committee by the antitrust division that the committee can be satisfied this very important provision will speed its already advanced work in the field of antitrust investigations and prosecutions and i emphasize here as was pointed out in the testimony of the committee and by my fellow members of the committee the particular interest of the committee in the antitrust work in the fields of food and clothing and housing it is entirely possible that there are other phases of the antitrust work that some of my colleagues feel should receive attention perhaps because of flagrant cxamples of violation of the various antitrust statutes and i am sure the division with this increased appropriation and its fine work in the whole field of antitrust investigations and prosecutions will now be able to give attention to these other fields in the broad program however we do emphasize the importance first of the food and clothing and housing problems there is not too much need at this time after what has been said for me to take the time of the committee in dealing with the appropriations for the department of justice and for the federal judiciary it is evident that these appropriations should not and cannot otherwise as has been indicated by the chairman be cut further even with the ramspeck promotions and the statutory increases that are mandatory certain increases were necessary but other than the fbi and the antitrust section this committee did not exceed the budget allocations and allowances in any case the record of the highly respected director of the federal bureau of investigation in dealing with appropriations and the confidence of the congress is well established for expending only such funds as he feels are absolutely needed and i have every confidence that this would be his practice again there is no evidence that the fbi spends money merely for the purpose of spending money and their policy seems to always be to use only those funds necessary to cover their operations and only the absolutely essential requirements and the unexpended funds being returned to the treasury under no circumstances however am i willing to jeopardize the internal security of this country by substituting my judgment for the fbi where i feel there has been no abuse of judgment one way or the other if i err in this case in agreeing to the substantial increase over the budget estimate for the appropriation for the fbi as part of the department of justice then i prefer to err with a margin of safety in favor of the national security of my nation with reference to the department of commerce and the appropriations of this subcommittee dealing with that department there is not too much that i wish to add at this time to what has been set forth in considerable detail in the report filed on behalf of the subcommittee in connection with the presentation of this bill to the house while some comment may be made on the fact that there is an increase in the appropriation this year over that of the fiscal year of 1949 the important thing to note is that of this increase 43 000 000 is for taking of the very important seventeenth decennial census there is no doubt in my mind that the director and his staff of this constitutional function do this job as expeditiously and as economically as the circumstances will permit i am convinced they will do the job certainly to the satisfaction of this pommittee and of the house it is important to keep in mind that this is a constitutional provision and therefore other than the determination of the funds by dollars itself there is no question as to the allocation of funds and the appropriation of dollars for this purpose we are anxious that there be no delay in the work of taking and compiling of the census and we are anxious to indicate that in no way do we anticipate any increase in the overall cost of the seventeenth decennial census personally i am satisfied that every possible effort will be made and of course should be made to work any savings in order to reduce the estimated total cost that was presented by the budget and by the bureau people to this subcommittee in the current census statistics which has to do with the compilation of the businessindustrial census i am of the opinion that the service that will be rendered for the appropriation made is necessary and of vital importance to the economy and its proper administration certainly the smallbusiness man stands to gain a great deal by the abundant information that will be made available to him for his business purposesa vast storehouse and library of important and vital material which the average smallbusiness man could not afford to obtain in any other way than through this government business census keeping in mind that 62 percent of the total appropriation for the department of commerce is included in the bill for the civil aeronautics administration and having before me the comprehensive report of the subcommittee filed with the bill dealing with the entire department of commerce as well as the caa i can repeat only for the purpose of emphasis my concern in which i join with the committee over the rapidly pyramiding costs in this particular agency resulting largely from the manner in which these services are being supplied to the private air lines and the failure on our part to be able to discover why the federal government must be called upon repeatedly to continue to furnish additional service upon additional service in this area of operation with little in return being supplied of the same nature by the air lines who seem to be the chief beneficiaries by the same token as a member of the subcommittee i was shocked when the civil aeronautics board on friday february 25 1949 granted an 8 000 000 gift of the taxpayers funds to the big four private air lines for the transportation of their air mail in which case not a single pound had ever as a matter of fact been carried this was an outright gratuity because of the grounding of the constellations and the dc6s both of which aircraft had been operating with defective and dangerous equipment clearly the result of faulty construction and in no way could the government or any agency of the government be remotely held responsible the committee has no reason to believe that the great backlog of work before the cab is going to be solved by merely increasing the appropriation the fault obviously lies with the supervision and the administration within the board itself and until this evil is corrected increased appropriations are in no way going to solve anything the same thing seems to be true of the major air lines themselves certainly if one of these air lines can operate at a profit and the others cannot all things being equal with the exception of a change in routing here or there which is not a material differential then the fault with the lines that are not making a profit lies within the faulty administration or supervision of the nonprofitmaking lines and i cannot see sensibly whether it could be any other reason it has been a privilege to be permitted to make these observations as a member of the subcommittee dealing with this very important appropriation bill there are two general comments that i would like to make the first has to do with the manner in which various government administratorsthe heads of various government bureaus and government departmentsmake use of limousines and liveried chauffeurs for the purpose of having themselves conducted hither and yon not always i am sorry to relate on government service now i am as well as i am sure are all of my colleagues concerned that proper dignity and decorum and protocol be observed by the official representatives of the government of the united states and no one is more anxious than i am to see that the dignity of the representatives of my nation is of the highest standard however department after department bureau after bureau came before this subcommittee and almost without exception requested appropriations for the purchase of new motor vehicles or the supplanting of used motor vehicles in most of these cases these cars had not been run a sufficient number of miles to merit the purchase of another car in its place and certainly the services being rendered by many of these bureau chiefs and department heads did not merit or warrant the purchasing of additional new motorcars i have walked outside of this capitol day after day during the several weeks these appropriations committee hearings have been going on and out there on that plaza i see a line of government limousines a block or two long with chauffeurs and footmen standing there waiting to take the witnesses who have just appeared before my committee back to their offices or to their homes or to wherever they are going i would think that in general principles these government officials would have more sense than to parade this exhibition of their opulence and success before the committee certainly the armed forces are flagrant in their exhibitions of limousines chauffeurs footmen and so forth but the other agencies are just as bad in my opinion i do not think one is any worse than the other they are all to blame at least the ones with which i have any acquaintance i went to the signing of the atlantic pact the other day and there were five congressmen from these important committees who were invited to this great historic ceremony piled into one cabdashed madly down there from a roll call in order to be present at this great event in world history and we had to wait in line at least 10 or 15 minutes while rows of sleek shiny limousines bearingunited states government license tags driven by chauffeurs pulled up and unloaded its group of bureaucrats and their ladies now certainly i have no objection to riding busses and streetcars and taxicabs or using shanks mare i have been doing it all my life and certainly i do not think for a moment that the government of the united states should provide congressmen or senators with limousines and chauffeurs and footmen but i merely wish to place upon the record my strenuous objection to the manner in which these government officials abuse the use of government motorcars the second general observation i have to make has to do with the manner in which the transcripts of the testimony of the hearings before this subcommittee have been returned by the various agencies and departments for correction before printing in my judgment it constitutes contempt of the committee when some agent of one of the government departments or bureaus that appeared before this committee to give testimony is impertinent and presumptuous enough to change that testimony in such a manner as to convey an entirely different impression and to distort it completely out of context that constitutes a deliberate subterfuge and that constitutes an absolute fraud upon the appropriations committee and upon this congress and in my judgment some action should be taken by the committee as a whole or by the congress itself to make it absolutely an offense for any witness to change in any way testimony which he gives before one of our hearings perhaps at the very most the mere changing or correcting for the purpose of rectifying obvious errors or grammatical construction might be permitted but under no circumstances should any other kind of insertions corrections or changes be allowed"], [0.016137301921844482, 0.9838626980781555, 1, "you have the undivided attention of this committee proceed i am not going to say how well he did or how poorly he did but i am going to call as witnesses his fellow journalists who were present and who heard him and i will let them give testimony as to whether or not he had a great treasure of information as he said he had and how well he did toward helping us let us call the washington star here is the headline pegler hurls epithets from stand but fails to satisfy hearing uses thief murderer at house labor probe balks at giving names now from the washington star story is this quotation mr pegler testified for an hour and a half and gave the committee largely a rehash of some of the cases involving misdeeds of union leaders which over recent years have been printed in his columns now let us call the new york herald tribune here is the headline inquiry finds peglers data on unions hazy mr pegler is quoted in the story as saying and he did say after having made this boast and after having had the subpena for a week or two he saidand here is the exact quote i will have to go back and make some more preparation let us go out to the middle west and pick up the louisville courierjournal and see what that paper had to say about peglers effort at enlightening the subcommittee by the time the committee recessed at noon virtually everybody at the hearing had realized pegler had pulled a hickenloopep seldom has a cannon cracker gone off with such a pfft he upheld his boast of a great treasure of information even less than senator hickenlooper did his charge of incredible mismanagement against the atomic commission the man who can roar so loud in print mumbled his words the man who is generally conceded to be one of the most articulate writers of our day talked in a rambling and incoherent fashion the man who seems so bellicose to millions of readers was as mild as a sucking dove his suitcasepresumably the source of some of his treasure of informationturned out to contain mostly old pegler columns and union constitutions even the indianapolis star which has never supported me and carries his column wrote editorially andy takes round 1 i do not know how i took round 1 i just sat there and let him knock himself out the indianapolis star said pegler revealed nothing new the only newspaper in the united states that i know of that took a little different view of the matter was the fort wayne news sentinel now the fort wayne news sentinel generally comes out on time once in a while it is a little late because they cannot go to press until they read the chicago tribune the fort wayne news sentinel had this to say editorially at the time mr pegler was called before the committee a jacobs has forgotten all about such a thing as discretion being the better part of valor and has decided to take on the brilliant columnist and scorching debater westbrook pegler for pegler it will bejust another one of those things for jacobsa blistering baptism of fire the like of which no rookie congressman has experienced now after the newspapers had reported what occurred as i just read the fort wayne news sentinel comes out editorially and says mr pegler is rightfully resentful of the treatment accorded him by the hoosier congressman the only treatment i accorded him which he is still complaining about was that we called him before the committee to give the testimony and the information which he himself said he had if we had not done so we would be blistered today for having ignored his offer now i take up the column that occasioned these remarks in the first place of course everyone in my district knows that when i was elected to congress i closed my law office i had good reasons for doing so every man is the keeper of his own conscience lie knows what he thinks he should do and i know from experience and observation how easy it is to camouflage a bribe and make it look like a lawyers fee for that reason i felt that i should not be connected with the law practice in any way and i am not it was not very long after i came down here until i saw how wise that decision was because that little law office that i occupied back there for 21 years before i was elected to congress was rented by a firm of lawyers they were new men who came in and took over my office because of the fact that i had been in that office people figured well that is still jacobs office these lawyers were offered business that i had never heard of before and of course never would have heard of if i had not been elected to congress it took some pretty straight talk to make them understand that i was not connected with that law office my name was not on the door and i had nothing to do with it pegler knows that that is the truth as does every lawyer and most people in the eleventh indiana district just to give you an idea about this fellow pegler when he came up before this subcommittee he testified that he had no connection or contact directly or indirectly with william l hutcheson who is president of the united brotherhood of carpenters and joiners union of america yet within a matter of a day or two a pegler column appearedand the column must have been written at the time he made that statement in it he said and many of you read it that i had earned 300 000 in 2 years practicing law that is one place where i wish the mans statement had been true unfortunately for me it is not true but it is very significant under circumstances i will relate it is very significant when i tell you a little incident in connection with that story i did a good deal of lawing with big bill hutcheson i was there practicing law and i turned him over the barrel a couple of times and always came out pretty well large bill does not like me he is my neighbor out in indianapolis we live in the same general neighborhood but we did a good deal of lawsuiting and bill was not pleased with results so bill figured that he might be able to scratch up some skeleton in a tuckedaway closet and he hired a firm of detectives over here in washington to investigate me understand i am just a hoosier lawyer out in indianapolis born and raised in indiana for the fee he paid them i would have been glad to write him an autobiography and write it accurately too nevertheless he hired a firm of detectives from washington d c to investigate me one day i got a call from the bank they said there were some private eyes over there trying to get some information and they wanted to know what to do about it i said just feed them something it does not make any difference just tell them anything we agreed we would tell these private detectives that i had banked 300 000 in the last 2 years i wanted to make it look good it was none of their business anyway so we agreed to do that and apparently they did so at the bank i am not going to tell how i got hold of it but i heard o that detectives report later it faithfully reported my supposed affluence of course it is awful that i made a fee for i am only a democrat bill had lawyers all across the country lots of them including the great charles tuttle of new york he tasted the dust also he also talks too much we took some depositions one time and big bill had so many lawyers that when we got through i got up and said gentlemen i know of no meeting of the american bar association i have enjoyed more than i have this most of these lawyers enjoyed the joke but not mr tuttle you see he did not think the other fellows were lawyersthat is compared to him but anyway the private eyes reported to big bill very faithfully the baloney that we had fed them i gradually forgot the mysterious 300 000 as you do a pleasant dream the next time i learned that i had made the 300 000 in 2 years was from a westbrook pegler column who just a few days before and obviously after he had written the column had sworn that he had no contact whatever with bill hutcheson of course it is very obvious that he did not tell the truth because he would not have hit that false figure by chance there are just two examples of his technique that i want to bring to your attention he kicks this 80 000 fee around again we have talked about that before it was not 80 000 it was 65 500 and i think i earned it more dearly than i did many other fees that i received however that is my private business and my clients were well satisfied not only the officers but the rank and file as i have said most of us believe in private initiative and i had some initiative and i worked at it when i was practicing law but pegler goes on to comment that i had said i had quit practicing law when i came to the congress then he said and you can see this is the art of deceiving without lying he does not say that my statement is not the truth oh no but he intends to plant that in the mind of the reader by saying had i known as much then as i know now i would have gone right ahead and loaded the record of course he might as well have said to the people that this statement of jacobs is false i got a big return or this column when it was published there was one man in my district who sent it to me and asked me what about it i think all the rest of them knew that it was not true but here is the next example of the technique all of you gentlemen who are members of congress have had experience on committees there are people who appear before committees who think they have been wronged ofttimes they are unable to distinguish between the functioning of a congressional committee and the obligations and duties of a conrt time after time as this committee sat we had to explain to witnesses that we had no power to give them redress that we were only investigating for the purpose of getting information to enlighten us on legislation when mr pegler came down to testify there was a lady who appeared i do not know whether he brought her or whether she just chanced to be there i think he brought her because he said she just chanced to be there but that is neither here nor there it is not important she had had an argument with her union over a 21 assessment which she said was illegally levied it did present a legislative question under the federal law as it exists today the assessment was not illegal but it did present a legislative question in prospect she gave us the whole story on this assessment all the information there was we listened to her through all the details then she said she wanted her 21 back well i explained to her as i stated a moment ago the functions of a legislative committee i explained to her that we could give her no redress whatever but she did not understand it i do not say that she lacked intelligence but the fact is she just did not understand what i was trying to explain to her and she still insisted that she wanted her 21 back i began to think it might pay me to give her the 21 so that we could go ahead with the hearing i did explain to her with language as simply as i could in several different ways that we could not do anything for herthat she was helping us and giving us information and no person other than pegler would say i did not treat her patiently and kindly that is the whole story as the record will disclose we told witness after witness that we could not do anything for them because it was our duty to do what we were doing but we were not a court and had no power to redress wrongs i suppose i wrote a thousand letters telling people the same thing but here is what pegler has to say about it i tested them with one case a woman got up and squealed on dave dubinskys union and gave all the details at least that demonstrates that we listened to the evidence we heard all the evidence the column reads further as follows that case later proved to be perfect when she went to the small claims court in new york and licked dubinsky and his highpriced lawyers and made them pay back the money which the union had withheld but jacobs gave her the brushoff which convinced me that he was not interested in protecting the socalled little people now listen to what he has to say during this kangaroo court you might have thought i was on trial now the truth of the matter is that all this happened exactly as i have told you i had to explain to the woman that we could not do anything for her and so far as pegler being on trial is concerned if he was on trial he put himself on trial he was given every opportunity to tell everything that he knew and i am just saying what the press said that he did not tell anything that he was a dud a fact which is becoming pretty common knowledge now there are two of the techniques of this fellow pegler it is some of the technique of a lot of journalists you remember the other day i put in the record an analysis of the columns and broadcasts of pegler pearson winchell and fulton lewis jr you remember one of my colleagues from indiana registered temporary objection and then withdrew his objection so the indianapolis star a great newspaper in my district came out with an editorial entitled congressional appendicitis and it recommends and i just want to pass this recommendation on to you gentlemen because you may want to follow it that we abolish the appendix of the record they are mild in their criticism they do not say anything too bad about me they say i only did what almost every other member of congress does and it just ought to be cut out well now let me tell you something recently the indianapolis star wrote an editorial and put it on the front page of the paper it was two columns wide and the full length of the front page they sent that to every member of congress from indiana as well as to the senators how many times do you think that was duplicated in the appendix of the record there are some who curry favor with the star you know so each one of those folks stuck that editorial in the record this star editorial did not say a word about that no objections but jacobs did not put that editorial in the record i will tell you that right now but i addressed myself to the people back home on the radio and i told them what i thought about the editorial the publisher is a good friend of mine it makes no difference to me i told him the last time that i was home talking to him about this thing i just want you to know one thing i am strictly impartial i will scrap with you and your two daily newspapers as quick as i will scrap with the shopping news no there was nothing said about that star editorial being duplicated in the record i pride myself some on being attacked by certain journalists the proudest item i have was when i was attacked early this year by the daily worker itself i got a photostatic copy of that paper because i did not want it to fade out i want to keep it but at least i try to be reasonably considerate as most of you know i have always had a friendly feeling toward labor and organized labor but when any organizationi do not care whether it is a corporation or whether it is a union or what it may bewhen any organization acquires sufficient power that it can crush the individual then i think it is subject to some restraintsome fair and reasonable restraint that is the kind of legislation i was working on this is a strange thing the members of the labor committee know i have been working on that kind of legislation as pertains to unions incidentally gentlemen i had correspondence and conversations with a senator in the seventyninth congress i recommended such legislation and i also co responded with the committee on labor in the eightieth congress which constructed the tafthartley act i am not a johnnycomelately on the thing i have been for it for years but when i try to construct such legislation who is it that makes the most bitter attack on me it is fulton lewis jr and westbrook pegler maybe they think they will be put out of work if we should correct some of the evils out of which they have made fortunes but it is a strange thing indeed that this fellow pegler who for years has been making fortunes pecking out twofingered drivel salable only in the market places of hate and directing this drivel at the abuses in the labor unions should attack me the first man so far as i know who has ever served in the congress of the united states who has taken the particular approach that i have to protect the little fellow who is a member of the union that is to insure that he may exercise his right of free speech and voice in union affairs and not be tossed out of the union on his ear i wonder why that is i did not do anything to westbrook pegler maybe i have here todayi hope i have i hope i have disclosed to some extent his technique of how he attempts to deceive the public without engaging in technical falsehood but i did not do anything to him if westbrook pegler had any quarrel his quarrel was with humanity or perhaps with the creator of all of us who did not give human nature perfection after all he seems to be annoyed and vexed with humanity and he seems to think that the lord did a mighty bum job in creating every human being on earth except pegler i did not have any quarrel with the news sentinel nor pegler nor fulton lewis i was just trying to do my job as best i could only to be beset by this fellow fulton lewis jr who incidentally gives fullpage ads in papers endorsing liquor the drinking of whiskey this great christian gentleman trying to encourage the young people of this country to drink whisky you know he switched to calvert and became a man of distinction or extinction and he encourages people to drink whisky and claims to be a christian shades of dr jekyll and mr hyde as i told him last year he might do better if he would switch to a little truth serum once in a while i said he would not bungle his words on his broadcast if he would switch to drinking water instead of old crow and if he is not careful he will be eating crow as a steady diet the people are getting wise to him but these men like pegler and fulton lewis and drew pearson if they were interested in trying to correct some of these evils out of which they have made fortunes they would not hate someone who has been trying to devise remedies they would not have time for hatred they would be too occupied with the complex problems that confront us today in an industrial age and i will say this that after pegler had talked before our subcommittee he went on for about 7 minutes reading that script that he had brought down to the committee and when he finished he ran down like an 8day clock in a haunted house he looked up and he said he was ready for some questions i said for him to proceed in his own way and he immediately bogged down because he did not have anything to say but after he had mumbled around during a portion of the afternoon i asked him what remedy he suggested for the evils in unionism he looked surprised a sort of a vacant look came over his face ie had that look on his face that i always imagined the lawyer had when he told the story about the great lawsuit he had tried this lawyer said it was a whopping lawsuit he said it took 30 days for us to put in the evidence he said my argument to the jury lasted for 16 hours and the judges charge to the jury took 5 hours and the jury was out three days before they returned their verdict he stopped and his companion asked well what did they do to your client he said what oh my client oh him well he said they hung him but i did make them hesitate when pegler had got through and said all that he had to saywhich according to his fellow journalists was about nothingand i asked him what would you suggest by way of remedy he had that look on his face that the lawyer had when they asked him what they did with his client he had never even thought about it in fact he probably thought it would be terrible if we did find a remedy that would put him halfway on unemployment with only the job of kicking at f d r s tombstone now that is the truth of the matter i regret imposing on your time in making this statement but i think it is about time that some of these people who become so adept at the art of deceiving without lying have the veil they draw around themselves punctured and whipped away so that we may see them in their true light i am happy to have this record disclose the mental gyrations that this man peglers mind has gone through in past years in arriving at some of the conclusions that he prints today first a defense and advocacy of lynching then advising the communist party to start out under another name as a communistfront party and finally an outright advocacy of fascism and oldfashioned vigilantes who was the great journalist who referred to his beautiful mansion i mean peglers beautiful mansion as the house that venom built he certainly was right if men of the ability of westbrook pegler and these other fellows had the welfare of their country at heart they would be happy to present the facts as they are they would give some study to what a proper remedy within the framework of our government would be without resorting to lynching oldfashioned vigilantes and camouflaged or outright fascism as of today westbrook pegler typifies the school of fascism in this countryhe is the patron saint of everything ugly mean low and cruel that america stands against westbrook pegler typifies it and by fascism what do i mean i mean by fascism if i understand it correctly a political propaganda by which there is an appeal to those who have been successful and who have acquired some power by way of the possession of wealth and saying to them as i understand it that their power will remain unrestrained they may use it to crush out competition from the little fellow as against this is the iniquitous philosophy of the communists who offer to those to whom they appeal to cut up and divide everything that has been created by the efforts of others regardless of whether or not the individual has contributed anything to the creation of such wealth or whether he has ever demonstrated his capacity to discharge the responsibility of ownership and management we had to fight the second world war against the extreme rightists the fascists the nazis and while we did it the commies came forward singing hosannahs they wanted to help they infiltrated into our government we have had to go through a delousing process to get shut of them as we approach this next stage of history in which we are going to have to resist the other extremes or the imperialism of communism let us watch ourselves very closely let us see if we can ward off some of the infiltration of the other gang they are going to be there hammering away at our gates this man pegler is going to be there daily in a lot of newspapers throughout this country in that way and because of our current enemies he is dangerous i maintain that every man who discloses the iniquitous and vicious technique that is employed by these angels of hateof whom pegler is the archangelevery man that can contribute to jerking down the veil so that he can be seen in his true light is rendering a service to his country that is why i took this time today so far as i am personally concerned i can take care of myself in the district i represent but the people should be shown this man pegler in his true light"], [0.016545653343200684, 0.9834543466567993, 1, "i am in favor of repeal of the tafthartley law i want to explain in some detail why i am in favor of the repeal of the tafthartley law i believe this law should be repealed because it is bad for labor bad for industry and bad for the general public the tafthartley act has been presented to us most cleverly as a safe middleoftheroad approach to labor problems it is represented as a compromise between the socalled management excesses of the days before roosevelt and the socalled labor excesses of the wagner act it is my conviction that this is not a true picture of the act it is not a middleoftheroad bill at all it undermines the fundamental principles of collective bargaining established by the wagner act and returns us to the period of potential management dictatorship which existed prior to 1934 and we can all remember that during that period management unrestrained by vigorous unions led us straight into the depression of the early thirties that period we will all agree was bad for labor bad for management and bad for the general public the labor laws of the 1930s beginning with the norrislaguardia act under president hoover were designed to permit organized labor and industry to exercise their natural powers under our social system they forbade industry to use certain unfair powers which prevented the unions from carrying out their legitimate role in our economy some of such illegitimate practices of industry in the field of labor relations were dismissal for union affiliation yellowdog contracts use of professional strike breakers the company spy and agent provocateur labor injunctions use of company gunmen black list of union members use of state and federal troops to break strikes and other such measures of course tafthartley proponents say that they would never dream of returning to such nefarious practices if they did not intend to use these provisions of the act we may be assured they would never have included them if you legalize roulette it need not surprise you to find that somebody wants to operate a wheel some people who were skeptical about the tafthartley act in the beginning have been lulled into acceptance because they feel that no spectacular harm has been done to labor in the past 2 years this is true in the main though there have been a few outstanding examples of hardship such as the chicago printers whose long strike has cost over 11 million dollars and little organizing has been undertaken for fear of the complications of the law one of my constituents has written me a series of specific questions about the tafthartley act based on the experle ence of the few months of its existence he asks what specific harm the law has done to labor to industry and to the general public and what specific good it has done to tha same three groups i can give my friend answers to these questions but they will not be answers to the main question why do i believe the tafthartley law must be repealed for the real objection to the act lies not in what it has done so far but in what it has the power to do in the future when it will pay management to invoke its destructive clauses while there is a shortage of labor particularly of skilled labor management will not risk antagonizing it by making full use of the powers given by the act but when management is more anxious to get rid of workers than to keep them the picture will be entirely different the tafthartley act is based on the labor views of the national association of manufacturers one might almost say it is legislation of the nam by the nam for the nam its principal proponents have always known this and given it support on that basis they agree heartily with the nam philosophy that the only good union is a dead union loud protests are made that the act does not seek to weaken or destroy unions or restrict their legitimate objectives in fact a great deal is said about how much the proponents of the act love the unions all they ask is to correct a few little injustices to employers but let us remember that when the nam says it is in favor of unions it means just what stalin means when he says he is in favor of democracy the unions favored by the nam are without power without national connections without influence without funds and without freedom unions of this type we are assured will be protected under the act but this is not what the american people mean when they speak of unions one of the most effective opponents of communism in american unions is james b carey secretarytreasurer of the cio jim carey declared at a recent hearing on the new labor bill that unions of workers in russia are today being operated under a communist version of the tafthartley law my opposition to the tafthartley act is based on the conviction that the only good union is a live union one with power to bargain collectively for its members to win better conditions through that bargaining and to see that the employers live up to the conditions agreed upon anything less than this is a companydominated union and not a free association of workers supporters of the tafthartley act insist that the law during its less than 2 years of operation has by no means wrecked the union movement that there have been strikes and organizing campaigns and every other manifestation of life and liberty but the act so far has not been tested by depression conditions today labor is in demand and it has not paid industry to crack down on the unions and incur labors illwill but when the demand for labor slacks off then those who supported the act will use its provisions as a weapon to crush the unions and force their destruction this view is not merely that of labor the conservative and authoritative industry publication business week made this statement in an editorial a few weeks ago the editorial said the tafthartley act must go because it destroyed the equality between labor and management which it considered of major importance it admitted in its very frank editorial that in time of depression the tafthartley act could and would be used to destroy labor let me read you what business week probably the foremost business publication in the country had to say the editorial is entitled why the tafthartley act failed it appeared in the issue for december 18 this is what this realistic employer organ says most businessmen are realistic few are wasting time deploring the imminent doom of the tafthartley act to be sure the worry about the statute which will replace it but most businessmen are getting ready to work with a new set of laborrelations rules a change of rules will bring a host of practical problems before that happens there 4 some point in considering why the tafthartley act failed and what may be the lesson of that experience for the tafthartley act did failon one of the most important grounds by which a law must be judged in a democratic society that ground is consent only the police state can enforce a law which is believed to be unjust by the people it affects what was wrong was that the tafthartley act went too far it crossed the narrow line separating a law which aims only to regulate from one which could destroy given a few million unemployed in america given an administration in washington which was not prounionand the tafthartley act conceivably could wreck the labor movement these are the provisions that could do it 1 picketing can be restrained by injunction 2 employers can petition for a collective bargaining election 3 strikers can be held ineligible to votewhile the strike replacements cast the only ballots and 4 if the outcome of this is a nounion vote the government must certify and enforce it any time there is a surplus labor pool from which an employer can hire at least token strike replacements these four provisions linked together presumably can destroy a union by going that far the law defeated itself i have quoted this statement from business week at some length because it comes from a source known to be usually hostile to labor yet it opposes the act as fundamentally a menace to business and the public as well as to labor there are other sources of criticism of the tafthartley act not from a labor viewpoint a few days ago i received a copy of a resolution passed by the common council of milwaukee since we have nonpartisan election of city omcials in milwaukee this cannot be construed to be in any sense a labor statement it reads as follows whereas in 1935 the congress of the united states enacted the wagner act which gave the workingman the right to organize into free labor unions and to collectively bargain with his employer and whereas this law based upon the american principal of equality of opportunity was thereafter hailed as the magna carta of labor and whereas the enactment of the eightieth congress of the tafthartley act because of its inequities and inequalities tended to disturb if not actually destroy the funda mental gains made by workingmen in their quest for economic justice now therefore be it resolved by the major and common council of the city of milwaukee that we call upon the congress of the united states now in session to repeal the tafthartley act and in its place reenact the wagner act as originally enacted and be it further resolved that copies of this resolution be forwarded to the two united states senators representing the state of wisconsin and the congressmen from the fourth and fifth districts and to the clerks of the senate and house of representatives another approach to the issue is found in an excellent book by the reverend george a kelly called the tafthartley act a moral analysis father kelly develops a moral and ethical argument against the act as class legislation based upon interest and prejudice he established the moral right of workers to strike or work in other ways for higher wages and better working conditions and argues that the tafthartley act is im moral in opposing those rights and he makes clear that conscious reflection upon basic moral or ethical principles would have or should have prevented the adoption of many of the most objectionable provisions of the tafthartley act many other religious leaders have arrived independently at father kellys conclusions a group of 642 prominent religious leaders of protestant catholic and jewish faith have united in condemning it they stated that the tafthartley act was a measure calculated to destroy the real strength of a free labor movement by undermining basic principles of collective bargaining making the government of the united states a ready instrument of employer resistance to legitimate needs of workers and subjecting unions to a process of decimation and frustration under government control the national catholic welfare conference has attacked the tafthartley act as disruptive and called for the elimination of its cumbersome and obstructive provisions let us return for a few moments to the dangerous objections to the act raised by business week first picketing can be restrained by use of the injunction picketing of a kind which does not lead to violence is a primary right of unions in calling attention of nonstrikers and the public to their strike the use of the injunction in this and other labor situations is a reversion to the bad old days in the 1920s the injunction was freely used in labor disputes and used invariably to restrain labor from organizing picketing striking or carrying on other legitimate acts of a trade union injunctions were issued right and left by the laborbaiting judges under the thumb of local employers the tafthartley act not merely revives the use of the injunction but actually requires the government to secure injunctions on behalf of employers where there are alleged violations of the prohibitions against jurisdictional strikes and boycotts there are also vague and dangerous provisions for the use of the injunction to protect the right of individuals not to join the union it is impossible under this provision that many ordinary organizational activities may be restrained there is also a loose phrase about not causing the employer to pay money for services which are not performed this may be used to restrain a union from demanding paid vacations and holidays shifts in work loads and other perfectly normal demands the provision for the use of the injunction in emergency situations is one which has had a good deal of popular appeal however the definition of emergency is so wide and so open to interpretations in local situations that it may be used in practically any strike if the weapon of the injunction is to be used in protecting the public against strikes which seriously affect the public welfare then the workers and the public must have better safeguards against misuse of this weapon than the tafthartley act gives them point two in the indictment by tusiness week is that employers can petition for a collectivebargaining election this means that employers may choose a time convenient to them or may supxcv 89 plant union men with strike breakers for the mere purpose of holding an election to declare in favor of a company union those of us whose memories in the labor movement go back to prewagner act days know that this can very easily happen it opens the door for those vicious appendages of the openshop system the labor detective agency and the phony employment bureau which hires out thugs and strike breakers such practices invariably lead to violence loss of life limb and property and demoralization of the community which we should all deplore the third point raised by business week is that strikers can be held ineligible to vote while the strike replacements cast the only ballots this is a further invitation for the development of employer tactics of a nature to injure the unions and the community i cannot warn too strongly against the development of a class of professional strike breakers under the protection of the law to beat down wages and beat up workers such a development which is sure to come sooner or later should the tafthartley act be permitted to continue would put labor relations back 20 to 30 yeirs it would turn us back from the theory of talk it out to the discarded idea of slug it out the fourth point is that a nounion vote won on the votes of strike breakers or in the neat phrase of business week token replacements would be enforced by the government thus making the goveinment a party to a strongarm agreement dictated by the employers this of course is not collective bargaining at all it removes all basis of equality between the two parties it knocks labor out on a foul and then certifies industry as the new heavyweight champion in addition to these four points raised by the editorial in business week there are a number of other provisions in the tafthartley act which are fraught with danger unions are made suable for the acts of their socalled agents even though the union had not approved or ratified the acts in question what could be easier than for an employer to hire a labor spy place him in the union to win a position of trust then have him set off an explosion in a struck plant the amount of the damage would easily bankrupt the union as well as arousing the public against the strikers the legal complications requirements prohibitions and general confusion established by the tafthartley act have earned it the epithet of the lawyers paradise it is in my opinion a very bad thing to remove labormanagement relations from the hands of labor and management and turn them over to the lawyers the delays and expense of continuous litigation the removal of grievances from the field of prompt and direct action by the interested parties to an uninformed and uninterested court can only result in deterioration of relations and the delay and expense is of course far more important to the union than to management that was undoubtedly in the minds of those who drew up the law one of the foremost experts on labor law in the country dr william leiserson has said that the one thing above all others that rendered the tafthartley act unworkable and chaotic was its maze of legal rules over every conceivable happening in labor relations the law against secondary boycotts is an effort to break down the solidarity of labor it was part of a definite theory of former congressman hartley and a number of other extremists to break the unions down to the local level the phrase is mr hartleys not mine the idea of separating unions from each other and from their own industry in various parts of the country is of course quite in keeping with their general desire to make the unions too weak to be effective divide and conquer is as effective a rule in labor relations as it is in the international field i have a good deal of experience with the runaway shop in a number of fields and i know that this phenomenon is a bad thing for labor for industry and for the community if those employers working under satisfactory agreements paying good wages and having good working relations are to be protected the union must be free to operate wherever competition arises many a town has suffered serious economic loss because openshop competition started up out of range of union activity and drained off their orders this condition hasbeen lessening recently however as wouldb6 sweatshop operators become convinced that the union will follow them north south east or west and force them to keep wages up and hours down this is for the benefit of industries and communities as well as for the benefit of labor many industries are organized on a nationwide basis it is absurd to consider the possibilityof operating the steel industry or the auto industry on a plantbyplant basis it is equally absurd to propose to conduct labor negotiations on a singleshop basis the steel worker today is not to be treated as a blacksmiths helper free to bargain as an individual with the individual boss he is part of a vast and complicated human organization every part of which is related to every other part only a strong nationwide union can establish his rights one of the worst provisions of the tafthartley act is the one which outlaws agreements mutually satisfactory to workers and employers if such agreements call for the closed shop much nonsense has been written and spoken against the closed shop actually it is a condition which thousands of employers as well as unions voluntarily wrote into their contracts because it was not only beneficial to them but also to the consuming public closedshop agreements voluntarily entered into helped to make america the greatest industrial nation in the world during the last war the highest records for production were made by plants operating under such contracts which are advantageous to the employer as well as to labor the employer derives the advantages of stability efficiency and friendly relations with labor where there is a closed shop the workers give their very best because they know that the employer has accepted unionism wants to live and work in harmony with his employees and is not scheming to destroy the union at the first opportunity furthermore it is very difficult to explain to the average union member of long standing why the government should take such tender care of the nonunion man who is looking for a free ride the oldtime unionist reasons like this i joined this union 20 years ago when pay was low and conditions terrible i paid my dues all those years when the dues were a much bigger bite out of the pay check than they are today i gave up my evenings for meetings and union work and walked the picket line and went hungry when we were on strike now we are doing well thanks to the work of the union our pay is good and we have vacations sick leave saturdays off i helped the union win all these things why do i have to share them with some newcomer who is too stingy to spare a few dollars from the good pay i won for him why does the government say it has to protect his right to a free ride on my carfare i support the oldtimers contention that he has a right to insist that the newcomers join the union and pay their share of the carfare through closedshop agreements labor relations as many a wise employer has discovered are really human relations the problem cannot be solved by passing a onesided punitive law at the behest of the selfish and discredited national association of manufacturers only by good will square dealing and a sincere compliance with a just laborrelations law like the administrations new labor bill can equality in collective bargaining be reestablished and genuine progress be made in the important realm of labormanagement relations the tafthartley bill must and will be repealed this is the will of the american people clearly expressed at the ballot boxes last november 2 i am sure that there are few if any members of this house who could be at ease with their consciences if they failed to carry out such an unmistakable and mighty mandate of the american people when we have removed this blot from the statute books we may rest assured that both the workers and the fairminded employers of this country will go forward as never before each recognizing the rights of the other both dealing with each other as equals living and working in harmony for their own welfare and for the welfare of the nation and the world before i conclude there is just one final point which i should like to impress upon the house when the tafthartley act was jammed through the eightieth congress and passed over the veto of the president our friends in europethe democratic freedomloving peoples of france great britain and the other countries where human liberty is still prizedwere shocked the enactment of the tafthartley act in 1947 gave a tremendous impetus to the communist propaganda machine to the peoples of europe and the whole world the kremlin pointed to the tafthartley act and said in effect well if you wanted proof here is the proof that america is the reactionary country we have been telling you it isa country that squeezes its workers and throws them into chains and then last november when the news went flashing across the oceans that the people of america had overwhelmingly spoken out for the prompt repeal of the tafthartley act our democratic friends in western europe were heartened they were given new courage to resist the communists all this is on the record it has been fully confirmed in dispatches appearing in the most conservative newspapers of our country moreover it has been fully confirmed by leading american businessmen who have been in europe and know whereof they speaksuch men as paul hoffman and averell harriman there are many many additional reasons why the removal of the tafthartley act must receive top priority in the eightyfirst congress within the confines of a single speech it is impossible of course to discuss all the dangerous characteristics of this destructive act i have indicated some of the major flaws of this vicious law the facts are known the tafthartley act is bad for labor bad for industry bad for everyone we have a mandate from the electorate and i hope that the members of this house will act with the utmost promptness to carry out this mandate and put an end to one of the most unfortunate experiments in american history"], [0.016660451889038086, 0.9833395481109619, 1, "i consider it a privilege to address the house on this vital bill our committee has clearly recognized its great importance both to the present and the longrange security of the country here is involved what is still the greatest weapon in our possessionthe american fighting man is he to be instructed and led by skilled professionals or is he to be subjected to the bungling of second raters the congress must always demand in the strongest terms that our military leaders of today and tomorrow be the best qualified men our country produces but this can no longer be assured unless we establish pay scales that will give men in all ranks a decent pay in keeping with their responsibilies what will this bill accomplish what are its basic objectives first it will completely overhaul the existing military pay system in order to correct the inequities and absurdities which have been pyramiding during the past 41 years second it will establish the fundamental premise that pay and responsibility must go hand in hand in all ranks this does not exist under the present system third it is aimed at checking the alarming rate at which our most promising younger officers and enlisted personnel are leaving the service for greater opportunities offered them in business and industry fourth it will completely revise the present laws governing physical disability retirement which have been the source of so much criticism since the end of the war the present foundation of military pay was laid down in 1908 since that time there has been no complete study or revision conducted by the congress i might add that until 1947 the sharp differences between the promotion systems of the army and navy prevented any such action there have been some changes made but they have been piecemeal with almost no regard for the great changes that have taken place since 1908 in the economic and military situations confronting our country today it is therefore not at all surprising that the original philosophy of the pay structure has been completely distorted this condition has grown to the point where it is wasteful and inefficient it is actually stifling the initiative and individual progress ol our service personnel there is little incentive to work to qualify for greater responsibilities we must get the full value from the tremendous sums we are having to appropriate for national defense it is imperative that the armed services be able to attract and to retain highly competent personnel in all ranks we cannot escape the fact that under present world conditions we are compelled to maintain the national military establishment as the most tremendous single organization in the world an organization whose equipment and material are currently valued at more than 75 000 000 000 its operating costs for the next year will approximate 15 000 000 000 certainly it would be regarded as folly of the worst kind if any private industry tried to do business under a hopelessly antiquated pay system one that could not attract and keep the best qualified people to do the job nevertheless that is the position in which we find the armed services today the facts clearly indicate that they are waging a losing battle in the vital field of personnel they are having increasing difficulty in getting new men of high caliber and qualifications they are losing too large a number of their trained and experienced veterans in the navy the resignation rate is approaching 40 percent among classes of recently graduated officers who have served the required time among those officers who fought through the war as reservists and later transferred to the regular navy 15 percent of them have already resigned the air force prior to the war had no difficulty in attracting college graduates for regular service but now only 29 percent of its new officers have as much as 2 years college training only 1v2 percent have actually graduated from college the army situation is no different of the selected graduates of the various military schools and colleges who were offered commissions in 1948 only 12 percent accepted during the current year to date such acceptances have dwindled to an appalling 1 percent all the services are confronted with the problem of retaining highly skilled enlisted men this is particularly serious in the technical fields such as engineering and electronics what are the reasons for this alarming lack of interest here are the most predominate ones too low a pay for the degree of responsibility required poor career prospects in the military as compared to civilian occupation lack of individual freedom of action and finally the problem of housing the first two reasons given would be corrected by this bill but the third reason is inherent in the military system and must be accepted by those who choose a military career the fourth is still a nationwide problem a distinguished commission appointed by the secretary of defense gave the overall problem the most intensive study for 12 months let me read you a few words from the report of this commission when an emergency arises the safety and welfare of the united states depends on an efficient performance by the uniformed forces it is the one institution in our country that can never be allowed to fail the effectiveness of any organization can be no greater over an extended period than the efficiency of its management let us now examine in some detail what this bill would accomplish as regards pay and allowances starting with the lowest enlisted grade the recruit at the present time we are paying him 75 per month this represents a 400percent increase in the recruits pay since 1908 the largest single increase for any rank in addition to his pay the government provides his food quarters a complete clothing outfit and medical attention the total value of which according to current standards is 108 per month this amounts to a total monthly emoluinert of 183 per month which compares very favorably with what is paid a beginner in any business or industry i wish also to point out to the house that a recruit normally remains in this pay grade only during the first 4 months in servicethe period of his elementary training upon satisfactory completion of this training he is automatically promoted to the next grade in view of these facts the committee recommends no further increase in the basic pay of a recruit the next grade is that of a private and a seaman second class men in this grade are presently receiving a monthly pay of 80 with a 5percent increase for each 3 years of service this represents an increase of 344 percent in basic pay since 1908 here we propose only a modest raise to 82 50 per month but with a more substantial increase up to 10 years service i should like to mention at this point a fundamental change that is proposed for length of service pay increases for all enlisted and commissioned grades present law provides a flat 5percent increase for each 3 years of service this has produced a serious overlapping of pay in the various grades which enables a man of long service to draw more pay than a more competent man of higher rank but with shorter service the bill corrects this condition by providing a flat sum increase for each 2 years of service not to exceed prescribed limits continuing now with the enlisted pay grades we come next to the corporal and seaman first class they now receive a base pay of 90 per month and 5percent increase for each 3 years service under the bill this would be increased to 97 50 with a 7 50 monthly increase after each 2 years of service the next grade is that of a sergeant or a petty officer third class it is in this grade that we enter the noncommissioned and pettyofficer ratings enlisted men who by virtue of their rank first commence to exercise important initiative and responsibility they now get a base pay of 100 per month with a 5percent increase for each 3 years of service while this represents an increase of 218 percent since 1908 this bill would provide a substantial raise for this grade to 120 with further increases f6r each 2 years of service opportunity exists for competent men to reach this grade during their first enlistment or very shortly thereafter it is highly desirable for economy and efficiency that men who reach this grade be encouraged to remain for a full career the next enlisted grade is that of technical sergeant and second class petty officer who now receive a monthly basic pay of 115 with a 5percent increase for each 3 years of service it is in this grade that we begin to find the really valuable noncommissioned and petty officers those who by their experience and skill make an important contribution to the efficiency of their service while the pay of this grade has already been raised 154 percent since 1908 this bill would authorize an additional increase to 180 per month to a man with 10 years service this compares to 132 which he now receives for the same length of service the next and very important enlisted grade is that of staff sergeant and petty officer first class at the present time he receives 135 per month base pay with a 5percent increase for each 3 years of service this amounts to 162 monthly for a man having 12 years of service under this bill the same man would be raised to 210 per month with additional increases for each 2 years service thereafter up to 255 finally we come to the top of the enlisted pay gradethat of master sergeant and chief petty officer here is the experienced practical leader of men often termed the backbone of the service under existing law and with 18 years of service such a man now receives 214 per montha 117percent increase since 1908 it would be increased by this bill to 270 for the same length of service the maximum pay provided in this grade under present law is 247 per month but is not attained until after 30 years of service under the bill maximum pay in this grade would be 300 per month after 26 years of service it is my firm conviction based upon long observation of the armed services that the best approach to a sound personnel system is not to raise the pay of the recruit or of the new officer out of all proportion to what he is worth let us say instead to these new men we will give you an adequate beginners pay as you start your career it will be substantially increased as you prove your worth and win promotion to the higher grades both the civilian commission and the armed services committee are convinced that this is by far the best method and would provide the most effective inducement for good men to make the service their life career to establish such a system is a fundamental aim of this bill the average enlisted pay has been increased by nearly 300 percent since 1908the smallest single raise being 117 percent during the same period however the average officers pay has been increased by less than 50 percent with the smallest raise being 10 percent let us now examine the provisions of this bill covering the basic pay of officers we must keep in mind the fact that the newly commissioned officer is required to have had a considerable amount of technical education or the equivalent experience and skill before he can qualify for his commission it should also be noted that these same qualifications make him a fine prospect for civilian occupation under present law the ensign and second lieutenant are paid 180 per month with a 5percent increase for each 3 years of service a 57percent increase since 1908 under this bill they would receive a starting pay of 225 with a fiat 15 increase for each 2 years of service until the maximum is reached after 14 years let me state that no one will be permitted to sit in that or any other grade for as long as 14 years that feature becornes necessary when outstanding enlisted men are made officers in order to credit them with their previous enlisted service the next grade that of first lieutenant and lieutenant junior grade with 3 years service now receives 210 with the usual longevity increase every 3 years this is a 38percent increase since 1908 the bill would raise this to 277 for the same length of service with the maximum pay attainable at 14 years the senior navy lieutenant and the army or air force captain with 6 years service now gets 253 per montha 28percent increase since 1908 this would be raised to 360 in order to cover nurses and former enlisted men a maximum pay of 435 is attainable at 22 years service others who fail to be promoted will be eliminated not later than 14 years service the major and lieutenant commander with 12 years service now are paid 330only a 14percent increase since 1908 these are the officers who begin to demonstrate their ability to exercise independent command this is perhaps the most indicative grade in an officers career under this bill and with the same length of service they would be raised to 450 maximum pay of 540 to be attainable at 26 years service lieutenant colonels and commanders with 18 years service currently are paid 417 a 30percent increase since 1908 in this grade we find officers exercising important responsibilities they command battalions destroyers and submarines aircraft squadrons each of which may include several hundred men their monthly pay under this bill would be increased to 555 for the same period of service then we have the colonels and the navy captains the great majority of these officers will complete their careers in this grade only about 1 out of 6 of their number can be promoted to higher rank under the new promotion law the others must retire after 30 years service to make way for younger men coming up the present pay in this grade with 27 years service is 532 a 31percent increase since 1908 we must now provide a substantial pay increase unless we establish reasonable career incentive the best of our young officers will leave the service for more promising futures in other fields this bill provides that the pay of colonels and captains with 27 or more years service be raised to 705 it is the only sensible way to meet the problem and i strongly urge your full support now we come to the brigadier generals and the lower half rear admirals who currently receive a fiat 550 considering the ability and expeaence required we find here one of the most poorly paid positions in the entire government during the past 41 years this grade has received only a 14percent raise these are the men upon whom we must depend for vital defense planning and for commands of great responsibility in battle what are their jobs in the navy they command task groups that may number over 20 000 men with combatant ships and planes worth several hundred million dollars dan callaghan and norman scott who gave their lives in the great night battle at guadalcanal were both in this grade in the army and marine corps brigadiers command those magnificent combat teams numbering up to 10 000 men and equipped with all of the supporting ground weapons they must be ready to take over command of entire divisions of 15 000 to 20 000 men and a tremendous amount of modern fighting equipment william darby who organized the ranger battalions and was finally killed in the mountains of italy was among the 25 army brigadiers who died in action in the war in the air force brigadier generals personally lead the great air wings of heavy bombers and fighters this means the responsibility for as many as 500 planes several hundred million dollars worth of property and 10 000 to 15 000 men with all of the supporting ground elements nathan bedford forrest iii who gave his life in the skies over europe and eusel ent who died leading the raid on the ploesti oil fields both were serving in this grade major generals and upper half rear admirals have been given a paltry 11 percent raise since 1908 are we to say to these men who lead our combat divisions air commands and task forces win our countrys battles but you are not worth a decent pay it would be an appalling mistake if we failed to correct the gross pay inequities of these grades i therefore ask your strongest endorsement for the pay raises provided in this bill with 30 years service these mean increases for the major general from 733 to 1 005 and for the brigadier from 550 to 870 we must meet this vital issue squarely otherwise the country will find that these key positions eventually will be held by mediocre men and we shall have paved the way to disaster and defeat one of the most distorted features of the present system has been that dealing with the money allowances for quarters and subsistence we have simplified this and brought it up to date the enlisted men of the top three pay grades are normally those who have made the service their career for those having dependents and not living in government quarters the monthly quarters allowance is increased from 37 50 to 67 50 this allowance is extended for the first time to men of the fourth pay grade with seven or more years servicethat being the point where an enlisted man usually decides to make it his career enlisted men below the fourth pay grade and all those without dependents when not living in government quarters will receive quarters allowance of 45 food rations are normally provided to enlisted men but where this is not done the monthly allowance of 31 50 will be continued this may be increased under certain conditions to 67 50 or 90 under present law the ration allowance for officers varies between 21 and 63 according to their rank and dependents the bill provides that this allowance be fixed at a flat 45 under all conditions officers have never been provided with government rations in kind the quarters allowance for officers with dependents varies under present law between 60 and 120 depending on their rank this would be increased under the bill to range from 75 to 150 the allowance of course is not paid when government quarters are provided officers without dependents currently receive from 45 to 105 unless living in government quarters this would be increased to range from 60 to 120 a most important feature of this bill is that dealing with the termination of the wartime dependents allowances act under that act enlisted men have been paid special allowances according to the number of their dependents it applies the same to all enlisted men regardless of their rank it has resulted in some cases of privates drawing as much as 400 above their regular pay it is a most expensive program under existing law it will cost 314 000 000 for the next fiscal year it was highly necessary during wartime when civilians with families and dependent relatives were drafted into military service but it has no place in peacetime when we are striving to develop an efficient volunteer service this bill proposes a career pay structure based on responsibility and skill on the job adequate allowances are provided for those who gain promotions and establish their value to the service but flat subsidies solely for the number of ones dependents should be discontinued as soon as possible we therefore recommend in this bill that payment of these subsidies be terminated 6 months following enactmept if as a result of such termination any man then suffers a reduction in his now current pay and allowances he will be discharged upon his own application the house will be interested to know that a number of enlisted men testified on the bill before our committee every one of them advocated that these family allowances be stopped and said they were contrary to a sound career program termination of these allowances will result in a savings to the government of 191 000 000 in the next fiscal year due to certain guaranties made in the recruitment act of 1945 all such payments will not be completely terminated until i should like to say a word about those sections of the bill dealing with hazardous duty and other special pays we have changed the flight and submarine pay from the 50percent increase now provided i have long felt that such a formula was outmoded we recommend fiat monetary increases for each rank as incentive pay to perform hazardous duty the highest amount would be paid in the colonels rank we have reduced the hazard pay of generals and admirals to 100 from the present average of 320 their high executive duties should not require them to engage in such work to the same extent as the lower ranks the handling of transportation costs under present law has become so complicated that not even the experts can understand it furthermore it has become unduly expensive and still results in many persons having to pay transportation costs out of their own pockets when performing official travel we have cleared up this section and placed it on a sensible basis where legitimate travel will be paid for by the government and at no increase in present cost we have not followed all of the recommendations of the hook commission regarding retirement the principle reason for this being that the subject of retirement is a most complicated and farreaching matter it is also tied up with adequate survivor benefits and the placing of all retirements on a contributory basis the committee therefore recommends that all matters pertaining to voluntary and involuntary retirement be made the subject of a special study and that final action be deferred until that study is made available to the congress i should like to remind the members that since the end of the war the congress has already done quite an extensive job in revising the voluntary and involuntary retirement laws affecting both the regulars and reserves in the matter of physicaldisability retirement however the committee strongly recommends drastic changes in existing law the present disability retirement law has been in effect almost without change since 18612 weeks after the battle of bull run it is therefore not surprising that this law is hopelessly out of date and has been the source of much criticism and abuse therefore instead of permitting only officers to be retired for disability with a fiat 75percent taxfree pay this bill provides a complete change in the entire system under this bill the right to disability benefits would be extended on the same basis to all persons officers and enlisted regular or reserve it will be geared to the percentage of actual disability according to standards of the veterans administration no person with less than 30percent disability is going to receive a physical retirement under any conditions if he has less than 30percent disability and still cannot do his military job he is going to be discharged with severance pay where a person is unfit for his duty and has more than 30percent disability he is going to be placed on a temporarydisability list subject to physical reexaminations for a period not to exceed 5 years if he recovers during this time he is going to be restored to active duty if he does not recover and still has more than 30percent disability he will then be permanently retired or he may elect to go to the veterans administration if he is entitled to a greater benefit from that agency i repeat that this bill would abolish the flat threequarters disability pay now available only to officers instead where a person is entitled to either temporary or permanent disability retirement his pay will be based upon the degree of his disability or upon the length of his active service whichever he elects if he elects retired pay on the basis of length of service that pay will be fully taxable those who have less than 8 years of service will be eligible for retirement benefits only if the disability is incurred in connection with the direct performance of his active duty it is absolutely necessary that the congress put an end to the present disability retirement law this bill not only will accomplish great future savings to the government but will place such retirement on a just and proper basis no person who has been previously retired need suffer any reduction in his present retired pay under this bill he may elect to have his retired pay based on the new pay rates providing he qualifies under the new rules in addition to the new rules for physical disability this bill provides that there will be no other kinds of special retirement benefits except on the strict basis of length of active service i wish to remind the members that both under present law and this bill no person is entitled to any kind of retirement except physical disability unless he has completed at least 20 years of service the additional cost that will result from this bill for the next fiscal year will be 360 000 000 the president has already recognized the vital necessity of revising the military pay system and has allowed 400 000 000 in his 1950 budget for this purpose the bill provides that the effective date of the pay and disability retirement provizions be deferred until october 1 of this year this is necessary to meet the presidents budget limitations for fiscal assuming the personnel strength for fiscal 1950 is to remain constant the cost of the bill for the entire fiscal year commencing july 1 1950 will be 406 000 000 this amount will be reduced during ensuing years due to further reduction in familyallowance benefits and the expiration of other savings clauses i wish the members to know that the above costs do not take into consideration the amount of income tax that is recovered by the government from service personnel during the war and until january 1 of this year all active enlisted pay and the first 1 500 pay of active officers was tax exempted with the termination of the tax exemption on the first of january the amount of income tax withheld from the pay of all active personnel has been increased by an annual amount of 130 000 000 and based upon the present pay rates this has resulted in a sharp reduction of takehome pay in all ranks it means that the present inadequate service pay has not been raised as it has been in all other fields but has been reduced when adequate pay rates are enacted as provided by this bill there can be no argument that service personnel should not pay taxes on exactly the same basis as all other citizens under these new pay rates the amount of income tax paid by service personnel would be further increased by an additional 70 000 000 my point is this whereas the president has authorized a 400 000 000 increase in service pay the amount of income tax reco ered by the government would be 200 000 000 over that paid by service personnel in the calendar year 1949 and before expiration of the taxexemption law in the first complete fiscal year of operation that of 1951 the total increased cost would be 406 000 000 it should be noted however that this includes 107 000 000 for increased reserve training and retired pay thus only 299 000 000 is actually available for the increased pay and allowances of activeduty personnel this represents a net increase of only 712 percent in the present cost of activeduty pay and allowances for fiscal 1950 we are living today in the atomic age of a dangerous world any future war would be carried on at almost fantastic speeds and would involve a degree of scientific mass destruction almost beyond comprehension the final responsibility for maintaining our military security rests with the armed services we will continue to provide them with the finest possible weapons and equipment but we must likewise assure that the quality of their personnel their technical skill their leadership and morale all be of the very highest order we recognize the need for economy in the operations of the government but we cannot in justice ask the men and women of our armed forces to bear more than their share of economizing in government expenditures they should not be expected to continue under an obsolete and inadequate compensation scale it is indeed a tribute to their patriotism and devotion to duty that our defense forces are today strong and intact in the interests of our national security and in simple justice to our uniformed personnel this bill must be enacted"], [0.0173872709274292, 0.9826127290725708, 1, "the legislation before the committee for consideration h r 2546 is of the most urgent character it is necessary for the maintenance of our national security the bill provides for the erection of public works including buildings facilities utilities and roads in both the continental united states and in alaska which may be necessary to provide for the establishment of an adequate airwarning and control system let me make doubly clear what i just said by emphasizing again that the authorization in this legislation is merely a publicworks authorization at the same time however the bill has much broader and more farreaching implications the construction of the public works which it will authorize is a necessary prerequisite to the setting up of an aircraft warning and control system which will alert our people and our defensive forces in sufficient time to permit the employment of all effective means of defense available to us against attacking enemy aircraft seeking to destroy our vital centers of production and population the public works themselves will not provide us with an operational system in addition there must be radar equipment communications equipment and an organization in being manned by highly trained technical personnel but all of these essential elements must await the construction of the necessary public works an aircraft warning and control system is vitally needed for the protection of the united states but let me make clear at the outset that such a system in and of itself alone by no means guarantees us security against injury from enemy air attack to understand why this is so we must first know exactly what an aircraft warning and control system is and secondly what it is capable of doing and what it cannot do the primary purpose of such a system is to detect approaching enemy aircraft in sufficient time before they arrive at vital targets to permit friendly interceptor fighters to be directed against the enemy planes so that they may destroy them before they have accomplished their mission that is not the only purpose of such a system but it is by far its most important function other purposes are to alert other active defensive forces such as antiaircraft batteries and also to give airraid warnings in order that every available means of passive defense as well may be employed but turning back again to what i said was the most important function namely the direction of interceptor fighters let me explain why this is true as we all know it is an axiom of military operations that the best defense is a good offense this principle applies with full force in the case of air defense against attacking enemy aircraft if we merely sound our airraid warnings when enemy planes approach it will be possible indeed for our population to seek cover in airraid shelters and to take other measures of a passive category but none of these passive defensive measures will stop the enemy bombers from coming over the targets and dropping their bomb loads much more can be accomplished if we mount an actual offensive against the enemy planes that is if we attack them with every means at our disposal to a limited extent we can do this with antiaircraft but this means again that we are seriously restricted because the enemy planes cannot be attacked until they actually fly within range of the antiaircraft batteries we could of course deploy antiaircraft guns in such a way that no possible area of the sky was not covered but the cost of any such fantastic proposal would be out of this world it is easy to see therefore why fighter aircraft afford the best available means of defense over large areas such as that of the united states because of their tactical mobility fighters can move around over large areas to any point where attacking hostile aircraft may appear we can thus obtain a far greater degree of protection and can intercept a good many of the attacking aircraft long before they reach their targets and can do so far more economically than if we made the entire countryside bristle with antiaircraft guns now there are several technical points about an aircraft warning and control system which ought to be made very clear when i say that they are technical i do not mean that they are beyond the comprehension of a layman on the contrary an understanding of these features is essential to an understanding of the purposes of and the need for this legislation first of all an aircraft warning and control system performs considerably more than the mere function of detection and early warning of approaching aircraft as they cross our borders a flight of enemy planes entering the united states at a given point might be destined for any one of a great number and variety of vital strategic targets located one two or three or more hours of flight time away from the point of entry if we knew that the planes had entered the united states we could of course alert the entire country with consequent stoppage of production while the whole population scurried for air raid shelters the absurdity of such a procedure is obvious it is also clear that if we knew merely that at a given moment the planes had crossed our border and thereafter had no knowledge of their subsequent path we would have no way of telling our fighters where to intercept them it would do no good to send our interceptor planes to the point where the enemy had crossed the border because by the time they arrived there the enemy will have long since passed on faced with these problems therefore it is plain that we must provide some method of continually tracking enemy aircraft once they have been detected so that we will know at any moment thereafter exactly where they are and what changes of direction they may take only by continually tracking the enemy position can we lead our friendly fighters to the kill it is this element of fighter direction which is the most important single function of an aircraft warning and control system it is this which gives the system the name control what the system accomplishes is first to detect and constantly track approaching enemy aircraft and secondly to issue orders to friendly interceptors to take off and attack the enemy while they are doing so they are guided by control centers on the ground to the point of interception should the enemy change his course radically between the time the friendly fighters take off and the time they catch him the control centers on the ground will be able to detect this change of course by means of the continual tracking process and will be able to alter the course of our fighters accordingly now i am sure that most of you gentlemen are familiar with the method in which radar is employed as the means for detecting and tracking the enemy planes and for directing our own planes against them at the cost of repeating some information with which i am sure many of you are thoroughly familiar it might be advisable nevertheless to go over some of the characteristics of radar rather briefly as you know radar was developed shortly before world war ii and was shrouded in secrecy during that conflict so much so that for a long time even the name radar itself was taboo we all know today however that it was one of the most important developments contributing to our successful operations in world war ii and it is very important that we should also fully realize in considering the pending legislation that it was radar which won the battle of britain radar employed in much the same manner that we propose to employ it under this bill was the key to the aircraft warning and control system established by the british it was by means of radar that the approach of hitlers planes was detected and by means of radar that the raf defenders were guided to an interception radar functions on a very simple principle despite the fact tha complicated electronic equipment is required to make use of this principle an ultra highfrequency transmitter sends out a radio wave ofvery high frequency this wave travels through space until it strikes a target such as an approaching enemy plane an enemy surface ship or a distant mountain and a portion of the wave is then reflected back to the transmitting station where it is picked up by a receiver both the transmitter and the receiver of course are all part of the radar set in addition the set contains an electronic device capable of measuring the lapse of time between the instant when the radar impulse or wave was sent out and the instant when it returned since the speed at which the wave travels through space is known the radar set computes the distance at which the target which reflected back a part of the wave is located also because it is possible to control the direction in which the wave is beamed in the first instance the radar set can tell us not only how far the target is but in what direction it lies these two elements direction and distance enable us to locate the targets exact position on the map with reference to the known position of the radcr set now you will remember that i said a moment ago that a portion of the wave would be reflected back other portions of the same wave will travel out farther to other targets and the radar set will then show these to lie at a greater distance and in perhaps a slightly different direction the point i want to bring out is one with which most of us are thoroughly familiar namely that our presentday radars as developed during world war iipermit us to see a picture of the entire area within a distance of many miles in all directions from the radar set the radar actually gives us a picture very much like a map on which we can see mountains airplanes high buildings and chimneys and if at sea ships aircraft land and so forth in other words when used in an aircraft warning and control system it will give us a continual picture of the enemy planes moving across the screen and it will also show us our own fighter planes and permit us to see at any instant whether they are headed on the proper course for an interception i said a few moments ago that radar was responsible for winning the battle of britain this brings me to one of the most important points which we must constantly bear in mind in our consideration of the present legislation an aircraft warning and control system will not under any circumstances guarantee us absolute security there is no means known to science or the military today whereby we can throw an impenetrable ring or barrier around the united states which will protect us against all injury from enemy air attack we cannot hope to keep out completely all enemy bombers who may seek to destroy vital centers the best we can do is to destroy some of them and to attempt insofar as we can to disorganize their mission so completely that those we cannot shoot down will unload their bombs over some mountainside perhaps instead of over a railroad yard but even then many of the enemys planes may still get through to points where vital damage can be done radar and the aircraft warning and control system in which it was employed in the battle of britain did not win world war ii nor did it prevent tremendous destruction and loss of life in london coventry and other cities neither did it destroy the german luftwaffe but granting all this to be true let us make no mistake about its effectiveness had it not been for radar and for the british aircraft control and interception system by which spitfires were unleashed against the oncoming luftwaffe it is virtually certain that the battle of britain would have been lost and there can be no doubt that the ensuing destruction of cities and loss of life would have been of untold proportions so grave that the actual damage done in world war ii would look negligible by comparison had britain not possessed this system she could have offered no effective defense against the german attacks it is because no other means exist for effectively utilizing our defensive capabilities that we so urgently need an aircraft warning and control system in this country we must have the means by which we too can detect track and effectively intercept enemy aircraft threatening our homeland such a system is indispensable to the economical and effective use of our defensive weapons such as fighter aircraft and antiaircraft artillery without such a system it would be theoretically possible to deploy fighters so thickly in the air space over the united states that they could not fail to intercept any attack but it is equally clear that the economy of this country would collapse before we were able to build the number of planes which would then be required an aircraft warning and control system permits us to make the most effective and economical use of the planes and the guns which we have it tells us that the enemy planes are hereand not over there somewhere it thus enables us to direct our fighters hereinstead of having them patrol aimlessly somewhere else it also tells us that we must take passive defense measures and seek security in airraid shelters hereand that it will not be necessary to do so in other places thus production may continue uninterrupted everywhere else although it may be necessary to suspend it temporarily here while the attack is in progress as the aircraft warning system used in the battle of britain did not suffice to destroy the luftwaffe nor to prevent many of its planes from bombing london neither can we reasonably expect complete security from the system which will be provided under this bill but what the battle of britain did accomplish and what we can reasonably expect from our own aircraft warning and control system under comparable circumstances was to provide the means whereby the interceptor fighters of the raf were able to exact such a high toll of german bombers that hitler was suddenly brought to the realization that the attacks were unprofitable in terms of the balance between the damage inflicted on britain and the losses which he was suffering this consideration alone forced hitler to the conclusion that the german economy could not much longer stand the drain resulting from the high attrition rate imposed upon his bombers in like manner we hope to establish in the united states a warning and control system which will permit us to use our own interceptor planes so effectively that we can impose a prohibitive attrition rate upon enemy bombers seeking to destroy our vital centers we cannot escape unscathed without a scratch nor can we hope to avoid being hurtperhaps badly in some places but if we can provide the means whereby our fighters can hurt the hostile bombers badly enough to make the enemy call the whole thing off the aircraft warning system will have fully justified the expenditure of every penny invested in it when we consider how much more effectively we will be able to use our defensive fighter aircraft with an aircraft warning and control system it becomes very clear that we may actually be able to reduce the overall cost of air defense because of the simple fact that a lesser number of fighters can be used more effectively i do not mean to imply by this that we can afford any reduction in the number of fighters presently planned even with such a system in being the point is that we would need a great many more to adequately protect the united states if we do not provide an aircraft warning and control system an aircraft warning and control system consists essentially of radar stations control centers and communications facilities an individual radar station will pick up enemy planes on its radar screen and after identifying them as hostile aircraft will communicate information as to their location to a control center the control center will have operational control over defensive fighter aircraft and antiaircraft weapons and will immediately alert all defensive forces under its command which can be brought to bear upon the enemy it will issue orders to fighters to take off and will guide them to a point of interception from what i have said to you so far i believe it will be quite obvious that an aircraft warning and control system must be set up in such a manner as to provide a sufficient interval of time between initial detection and interception to permit all the necessary steps in the process to be taken before the enemy planes reach vital targets in other words the radar stations which detect the planes must be so located geographically in relation to vital strategic targets that the process of identification as enemy aircraft transmission of information to a control center orders to fighters takeoff of fighters climb to enemy altitude and actual interceptionso that all of these steps in the process can be accomplished before the enemy bombers arrive at their assigned targets radar unfortunately has certain technical limitations the radio waves or beams which it utilizes cannot be directed below the horizon in other words radar cannot see around the horizon and hence can detect only those targets which are above the line of sight to the horizon it is this feature which made it possible for lowflying planes during world war ii to escape detection by radar as they approached their targets just as a high mountain can be seen over the horizon so also can a plane flying at higher altitudes for all practical purposes therefore the range of radar is limited to about 150 miles assuming that the attacking plans fly at altitudes which are tactically feasible however we can obtain greater range by deploying an additional radar station beyond the first this would give us what was recently referred to in the newspapers as a twonotch program whereas one station would represent what we might call a onenotch program you may ask why if we use two notches we could not dispense with the original notch on the inside we would still require that in order to enable us to continually track the enemy after he had passed inside the range of the outer radar station otherwise without the inner station we would merely obtain early warning from the outer screen but we would not know what the enemys position was subsequently and hence we would be unable to continually track him until our fighters were able to complete the interception because the basic active defense weapon for any large area is the fighter airplane the first and most important consideration in organizing an aircraft warning and control system is to meet the requirements for fighter defense fighters may be moved quickly to meet changing situations but an aircraftwarning system is relatively fixed and immobile we must therefore provide an aircraftwarning service in those areas in which it appears likely that we may be required to deploy fighters the establishment of an aircraftwarning system is in effect an organization of the ground to provide a capability for utilizing fighters effectively actual fighter deployment will depend upon the force available and the tactical situation aircraft warning requirements for fighter defense are based largely on the time and space relationship between friendly fighter performance enemy aircraft performance radar performance geographic deployment of fighter airfields geographic deployment of radar stations and geographic location of the boundary of the area being defended defensive fighter aircraft on groundalert status at an airfield will be ready to take off on orders from a control center however because of the time element involved in the performance of all the necessary steps which must take place between the time of initial detection of enemy aircraft and the time of completion of interception the enemy aircraft will have advanced a considerable distance during this interval hence an area lying between the point where they were originally detected and the point of interception by friendly fighters cannot be defended by the fighters an area lying behind the point of interception by the fighters may on the other hand be considered to be defended from this it is very clear that if we can extend our early warning frontiers farther out so to speak we should be able to discover the enemy earlier thus permitting fighters to intercept him earlier and thereby extending the cover of fighter protection over a larger territory where it is necessary to protect a vital target lying out in an area which is not defended that is exactly what we will do we will deploy an additional radar station farther out thereby extending the cover of fighter protection to the target in question in this manner simply by deploying a radar station outward we can obtain the same additional degree of protection which could otherwise be achieved only by the construction of an additional fighter airfield at a considerably greater expense the deployment of radar stations and control centers under the proposed program is designed to achieve full utilization of available fighter airfields the control centers which will exer cise tactical control over defensive fighter aircraft will be provided of course with their incoming lines of communication from outlying radar stations which will furnish information of approaching hostile aircraft but in addition they will also have lines of communication to civil and military airfields both air force and navy for the operational control of fighters to local antiaircraft artillery defenses and to caa traffic centers for movement liaison and control finally there will be lines to local military commands for airraid warnings and also offshore radio liaison for coordination with naval ships and forces at sea the control center will be the point from which all airdefense operations are controlled and directed for a given area it is to be the command post of the airdefense area in which it is located i will now proceed to a description of these areas the entire united states must be organized into airdefense areas to enable us to conduct an effective air defense as i said a few moments ago the system which it is proposed to establish is essentially an organization of the ground to provide a capability for utilizing our defensize fighter aircraft effectively accordingly the entire united states will be divided into eight airdefense areas for peacetime and initial operations in war upon mobilization of the air national guard the eight original areas will be subdivided to make a total of 20 airdefense areas covering the entire united states each of these areas will be under the command of an area airdefense commander whose command post will be a control center of the 12 control centers to be brought into operation and manned by the air national guard a few days after mobilization 10 are to be used as peacetime training stations at the home of the unit the other two centers will have to be manned by national guard units from other areas these two must be constructed in advance and ready to receive the national guard units these two plus the eight initial centers make up the total of 10 centers in our current construction program the closest possible coordination exists between the air force and the army and navy in connection with this program and i might say that the committee has been impressed by the cooperation evidenced by the three services and by the complete absence of the slightest indication of the existence of any interservice problems or controversies in this field the only difficulties which exist today are those which stem from purely technical problems rather than from questions of responsibility under the program planned the commander of the eastern and western air defenses respectively will be charged with coordination with eastern and western sea frontiers and with the appropriate united states army commanders in matters of mutual defense this program will provide the united states with the minimum acceptable degree of protection from a military point of view but at the same time it is one which is economically feasible it will furnish us with a modest degree of protection at a very reasonable cost without this system we would have no protection whatsoever against attack by enemy aircraft it will reqlire a considerable length of time to install and perfect this system and to make it operational this element of lead time is of vital importance in our consideration of the present legislation if the protection sought by this bill is to become a reality within a reasonable time in the future we must act at once to get this program under way prompt and early action is essential if the united states is to have an adequate system of air defense within a reasonable time in the future in this connection let me point out that the achievement of an operational system in being will be necessary before we can expect protection from an aircraft warning and control system the mere construction of buildings and installation of equipment is not sufficient the system must be a going concernan organization of large numbers of technical and operating personnel who have had extensive training and experience over a long period of time can think of no more appropriate illustration of the importance of this factor than the recent press reports regarding the failure of navy radar operators to detect the approaching aircraft which recently dropped a simulated a bomb over a task force in the current fleet maneuvers it is inconceivable that such penetration could have been accomplished without detection in actual operations during world war ii when all personnel and units were in a high state of training and readiness the proposed program is of high priority particularly in view of the time factor mentioned which will be required not only to accomplish the prompt installation of radar equipment but also to achieve the required level of training and operational experience necessary to make the system fully operational until the system is in being and operationally effective the air force cannot hope to discharge its primary responsibility for the air defense of the united states neither can the forces of the army and the navy which those departments will be required to furnish in defense of the united states against air attack be utilized with maximum effectiveness unless employed in conjunction with a landbased airdefense system the establishment of the system however will facilitate the development of tactics and techniques for joint employment of all available forces for air defense because of the vital importance of this program as a defensive measure the air force deemed it appropriate to request specific authority for the construction herein authorized apart from the usual publicworks program a construction program amounting to 35 500 000 will be authorized pursuant to the authority contained ii this bill this sum includes only the cost of construction of buildings facilities utilities and other public works it does not include the acquisition cost of real estate nor the cost of radar and communications equipment the total overall cost of the airwarning and control system including those costs which are not covered by the present legislation will amount to approximately 161 000 000 exclusive of personnel costs this sum includes an item of 42 250 000 representing the value of radar and communications equipment now on hand which has already been bought and paid for it also includes 7 000 000 for the cost of conversion and equipment of four radar picket vessels to be provided by the navy under the program these four vessels will be used to provide radar coverage over sea approaches in localities where the proximity of vital targets to the coast line precludes the deployment of landbased radar installations sufficiently far out to permit early warning and interception of enemy planes funds for these vessels were requested by the navy but were deleted from current budget estimates prior to submission to the congress it is understood that the navy already has a number of vessels of this character hence these vessels can be provided by the navy even though funds are not included in the budget in furnishing them however the navy will be compelled to reduce correspondingly the animount of radar protection furnished by vessels of this character to the operating forces at sea after deducting the value of existing equipment and the cost of the picket vessels there remains a total estimated cost of about 112 000 000 for which the air force will have to obtain new funds this sum consists of the 85 500 000 for which authorization for construction is sought in the present bill and also of an item of about 26 000 000 representing the cost of new radar and communications equipment authority for the procurement of which exists independently of this bill this program has been considered by intelligence agencies looking at our strategic makeup from the point of view of a possible enemy it will not furnish absolute protection but it will give us a reasonable degree of protection where protection is needed at a cost which the economy of this country can sustain moreover it represents a balanced program in which this particular project is in balance with other armed services projects it takes account also of the great strategic importance of alaska where existing radar facilities are totally and wholly inadequate in this connection i might say also that testimony was received during the hearings from responsible officers of the air force to the effect that words would be impossible to describe how poor our radar defenses in the continental united states are today this program has been approved by the joint chiefs of staff the secretary of the air force the secretary of defense and the bureau of the budget in view of the fact that this particular legislation is designed merely to authorize the construction of the necessary public works the committee on armed services belidves it appropriate to limit the authorization contained in this bill to 85 500 000 the bill has been amended accordingly but with the clear understanding and intent that this limitation shall apply only to construction costs and will in no way limit the cost of procurement or installation of radar and communications equipment or other technical equipment required to establish an operational system in being it is intended that this limitation shall apply expressly and exclusively to construction costs alone the committee on armed services and its staff has made a very careful and thoroughgoing study and analysis of the pending legislation prior to the hearings a comprehensive list of written questions pertaining to almost every conceivable question which might arise in connection with this bill was submitted to each of the three armed services and written replies were requested much of the information furnished in response to these queries was classified and hence cannot be made available however those replies which did not require classification for reasons of military security have been printed in the hearings and may be found at pages 352 to 359 complete and exhaustive hearings were held before the subcommittee of which i am chairman and by the full committee and in both instances a motion to report the bill favorably was carried unanimously despite the fact that a great deal of the information pertaining to this bill and obtained both during the hearings and in answer to the written questions is of a highly classified nature i believe the members of the house will find ample justification for this legislation in the open hearings and the committee report"], [0.017950057983398438, 0.9820499420166016, 1, "this is indeed an auspicious occasion as the congress begins debate on the pending labor relations act of 1949 the event

welfare at the close of world war ii we again see big business aided and abetted by the republican party engaged in another drive to make material things not human welfare the theme song of the postwar era the first republicancontrolled congress in 15 yearsthe eightieth congressgave you the socalled labor relations act of 1947the tafthartley actand in so doing they turned back the clock of labormanagement relations a quarter of a century to the postworld war i era when government by injunction was legal for what do these republican gentlemen propose to punish labor for winning the war on the battle front and the industrial front for establishing an alltime record of production for making america the arsenal of democracy during 4 years of global warfare with all its hardships and heartbreaks on the home front and while the husbands and sons of the workers were fighting less than onehalf of 1 percent of all available working time was lost by reason of strikes had industry kept its highsounding nowarprofiteering pledge as well as labor kept its nostrike pledge our national debt today would not be so high i see before me men members of this body grown old and gray in the labor movement who remember the infamous hinchman coal co and the eagle glass co cases that originated in the united states district court in west virginia in the period of the first world war these cases set the pattern for a national policy that soon became a stench in the nostrils of libertyloving americans my native state of west virginia emerged from the crucible of the civil war with the motto montani semper liberi which means mountaineers always free despite this love for liberty and freedom our state during the 1920s saw constitutional government submerged to the will of the courts so flagrant were the abuses by the mine guards and the baldwinphelps detectives operating under cover of mandatory injunctions that rioting and violence broke out which finally led to an armed march of thousands of workingmen in protest to these abuses and in protest to the contravening of their constitutional guaranties men demanding only simple justice were charged with treason instead of a trial before a jury of their peers they were held in contempt of a mandatory injunction of the united states court and instead of a trial at the scene of the alleged crime they were dragged hundreds of miles away to a distant part of our state and tried in the same courtroom in which they tried john brown for treason in the civil war days many of them went to prison following their conviction by a threejudge united statez district court i say to you my colleagues that there is in the present tafthartley labor law and the proposed wood bill the foundation for a recurrence of this disgraceful episode god forbid that my native state or any other state within this union shall once again be prostrated at the feet of those whose motto is the almighty dollar where may i again ask is that unity that singleness of purpose that carried our nation to victory in the worlds most gigantic struggle what about those promises made under patriotic compulsion that we would never forget those who fought so gallantly on the field of battle and those who labored so diligently in our mines in our mills and in our factories to make possible that great victory two years after the ceasefire order ended the greatest of all wars we see those who shed crocodile tears over the need for national unity in wartime engaged in an allout economic war to hamper and even destroy organized labor why i ask would a sane america want to weaken our first line of defense against communist ideology why would we want to destroy that very segment of our population on which our nation must depend in the event of a third world war that now appears inevitable after years of struggle to be freed from the constant threat of the federal injunction labor appeared to have reached the promised land through the enactment of the norrislaguardia act in 1932 this act was hailed by a labor spokesman as a protective shield against invasion of rights that always belonged to labor in 1947 however the protective shield was badly cracked by the injunctive provisions of the tafthartley act the tafthartley act has revived the use of the federal injunction in labor disputes and has reinforced it by directives for its immediate use by public officers against unions the thomaslesinski bill contains no provision requiring or authorizing the use of the injunction the tafthartley act however had made such inroads upon the norrislaguardia act that in drafting the thomaslesinski bill it was considered necessary to restore the norrislaguardia act to its original status the proponents of the tafthartley act have attempted to justify its injunctive provisions on the grounds that injunctions can be sought only by the government that they are not made available to private employers well in the first place that is not entirely true section 302 of the act relating to welfare funds and the checkoff provides for the use of injunctions to restrain violations of the section and such injunctions are not restricted to the government but what difference does it make that only the government can seek these modern streamlined tafthartley injunctions should that fact make them more palatable to the labor organizations which are restrained from striking picketing and other activities for legitimate objectives does the fact that the government secures these injunctions make them any less effective in hampering workers in their exercise of basic rights obviously not indeed the fact that the government seeks these tafthartley act injunctions has a decided advantage for employers not the least of which is that the costs and inconveniences of litigation are borne by the government the history of the use of injunctions shows that the intervention of the government made the injunction an even more oppressive weapon it was the government that accelerated the use of injunctions in labor disputes by showing the way in the debs case injunctions had been secured prior to the debs case but after that case the trickle of injunctions became a flood i do not think i would be wrong in saying that it was government use of the injunction more than employer use that led to the passage of the norrislaguardia act then there is the injunction authorized in section 10 j which permits the board to seek injunctive relief in the case of any unfair labor practice immediately upon the issuance of a complaint and prior to the adjudication of the case by the board while this type of tafthartley injunction is available against both employers and unions the score thus far is 6 to 2 in favor of the employers the use of this injunction is discretionary with the general counsel and he saw fit to announce that he considered it a very sacred trust to be used sparingly and only where either a large segment of the public welfare is endangered or where life and property are seriously and in reality threatened or where there is a principle involved that will result in substantial and widespread irreparable damage or injury of more than a merely private nature now let us look at the pressing issues which warranted resort to the use of this sacred trust in some of the cases against unions one case involved the retail meat departments of 11 a p stores out of a total of the 5 000 stores in the national chain in the itu case it was alleged that there would be paralysis in the newspaper industry although newspapers printed by substitute methods have continued to reach readers in the chicago area despite a strike that has been in progress for over a year in another case the conway express case there were involved the operators of an independent freight carrier doing a small volume of interstate work and a companion case arose out of a temporary cessation of deliveries at the shipping dock of one store outlet of the large montgomery ward chain where was the danger to a large segment of the public welfare the serious threat to life and property the substantial and widespread irreparable damage or injury of more than a merely private nature in these cases let us not place any more sacred trusts in an administrative agency which can lead to such an indiscriminate use of such a powerful weapon as the injunction the third type of tafthartley injunction is provided in section 10 1 this section requires the board to seek injunctive relief against unions in the case of secondary boycotts and related matters the employer really gets service under this provision such a complaint is given priority over all other complaints and if after investigation the boards agent has reasonable cause to believe that a complaint should be issued he mustit is mandatorypetition a federal court for an injunction furthermore in such cases a different test of coverage of the act is applied than in any other case in a recent case the board declined jurisdiction over a plastering contractor who had been charged with an unfair labor practice on the ground that his activities were essentially local and had only a remote and unsubstantial effect on interstate commerce the chairman of the board stated however that the board would not have a similar discretion to decline jurisdiction if the same case had involved a secondary boycott by a union the effect of this is well stated by another member of the board who disagreed with the chairman he stated if the employer commits an unfair labor practice the employees are left without redress whereas if the union violates section 8 b 4 a the employer is afforded plenary relief i am sure the chairman of the board reached his conclusion reluctantly he had no choice however under the provisions of the tafthartley act these mandatory 10 1 injunctions can be secured only in the case of union unfair labor practices in answer to criticisms of the onesided nature of this provision our opponents have tried to justify this onesidedness by arguing that t is injunction is directed at union practices which threaten the very existence of a business what are some of these horrible practices mr chairman in one case it was the distribution of an unfair list and peaceful picketing by one picket in another case union members refused to work alongside of nonunion workers installing floor coverings the nonunion men being employees of the supplier of the floor coverings a retailer of housing material these are typical of the threats to the existence of businesses which the board has been required to enjoin under the tafthartley act these injunctions are issued after a summary proceeding which is in no sense a determination of the merits of the case the summary nature of injunction proceedings is particularly objectionable when you realize that the effect of an injunction in a labor dispute is not to maintain the status quo but to upset it by stopping the picketing boycott or strike and returning the situation to where it was prior to the action in question in other words although these injunctions are supposed to be temporary relief pending the adjudication of the case by the board they really effectively and finally determine the outcome of the dispute the effect of these injunctions is to deprive unions of these economic weapons because their effectiveness depends upon their use at the strategic moment the lapse of time between the issuance of the injunction and the final adjudication by the board of the merits of the case does the union irreparable damage if the board later finds that no unfair practice has been committed by the union there is no possible way to undo the damage done to the union by the injunction the passage of time is a very effective weapon of advantage to the employer some supporters of the tafthartley act are willing to retreat to the extent that they will remove the mandatoryinjunction provision and leave only the permissive injunction the new wood bill makes two major changes in the injunction provisions of the tafthartley act both are more objectionable to labor than the tafthartley bill itself it removes the provision making it mandatory for the general counsel to secure an injunction against an unfair labor practice as defined in sections 8 b 4 a b and c secondary boycottsthe bill would grant new and broad injunction power to the general counsel in section 10 j of the wood bill it is provided whenever it is charged that any person has engaged in an unfair labor practice under this act the general counsel may petition any district court of the united states for appropriate injunctive relief pending the final adjudication of the board with respect to such matter this means that the general counsel may secure an injunction as soon as a charge is filed with a regional office and before any complaint has been issued in that case section 10 j also permits the court to grant a temporary restraining order an ex parte proceedingto be effective for not more than 5 dayswithout any notice or hearing to the party against whom the injunction is issued here we have an example of a real labor czar with unlimited powers i object and i am sure other members of the congress object to placing such legal authority in the hands of an executive officer i want no part of the injunctive provisions permissive or mandatory i am basically opposed to any legislative enactment that contravenes a citizens constitutional guarantees to the right of free speech free press and the right to a trial by a jury of his peers injunctions are inherently onesided since they are much more effective against unions than employers the effectiveness of the economic weapons of unions depends upon their use at the strategic moment and i do not want any general counsel tipping the scales in favor of employers by exercising his discretion to seek an injunction the history of labor legislation excluding of course the tafthartley act is the history of efforts to free labor from the pressure of poorly informed and sometimes hostile courts the supporters of the tafthartley act have ridiculed the charge that there has been a revival of government by injunction and have pointed to what they describe as the limited use of tafthartley injunctions as of january 31 1949 41 injunctions had been sought under sections 10 j and 1 of the tafthartley act all but two of which have been directed against unions thirtynine petitions for injunctions against unions in a period of 18 months when you consider the farreaching effect of the injunction upon the relationships of the parties to a dispute you must agree that this is a high number in a period of generally favorable economic conditions compare this number to 83 cases brought under the sherman act during the period of 1890 to 193083 injunctions in 40 years against 39 injunctions in 18 months the charge of government by injunction is wellfounded the fourth tafthartley injuriction is that provided in section 208 which authorizes the president to direct the attorney general to petition for injunctive relief against work stoppages of a national emergency character authorities in the field of labor relations have testified that an injunction in most cases serves to aggravate a dispute and to delay its settlement of course that criticism is directed to the effectiveness of injunctions the most ardent supporters of the tafthartley legislation must agree that in the period of slightly less than 2 years in which the law has been operating it has never settled a single labor dispute through injunctive procedure in all the instances where the injunction was resorted to the strike was finally settled around a bargaining table one instance was the bituminous coal strike of 1948 where the final settlement on a contract was reached 12 days after the expiration of the 80day period provided for in the injunction procedures once more the wood bill goes a step further than the existing tafthartley act in that the procedure for dealing with national emergency strikes is so changed so that the president must get an injunction before he can use the procedure of appointing a board of inquiry to determine the facts in the case in effect this provision means that the president may not attempt to use the boardofinquiry method for settling the dispute until he has secured an injunction to force the workers to continue at their jobs or to return to them here you have a grave constitutional question in which you deny the worker the right to strike this new move of the coalition against labor is aimed solely at weakening the presidents position in settling strikes affecting the national welfare it kills the 30day coolingoff period provided in the lesinski bill and if adopted would kill the 80day inhibition against strikes contained in the present tafthartley act i am convinced that regardless of their effectiveness the use of injunctions in these situations is fundamentally bad they increase the resentment of workers who are compelled to work for private employers with no comparable burden put upon the employer and encourage employers to refuse to bargain knowing that they will have the labor of their employees for at least 80 days on their own terms in effect this injunctive provision presents to employers a gift of the forced labor of their employees for a period of 80 days the injunctive provisions of the tafthartley act have been aptly described as hateful and unnecessary the sole test of a labormanagement law should be its effectiveness in promoting collective bargaining and peaceful industrial relations the sanctions of the injunction with its overtone of compulsion will never create harmonious relationships between management and labor there is no justification for arbitrary legal prohibitions or compulsions in labormangement disputes no matter how pressing the need for such steps might appear to be in the heat of the moment the distinction between strikes that affect the public health and safety and strikes that do not is an extremely questionable one and it is easy to confuse mere inconvenience with emergency it is safe to say that we have never had a strike in this country that created a genuine national emergency involving a clear and present danger as distinguished from temporary inconvenience no such emergencies occurred during the years when the norrislaguardia act was in full force and they will not occur when that act is restored to full force workers and their leaders are no more unpatriotic and no more immune from the force of public opinion than any other groups in our society only a police state can abolish strikes no country which values free labor can abolish strikes in any industry however affected with the public interest so long as the employers are private persons or corporations the ambiguous and yet undefinited terms national emergency and public health and safety have been used to cloak a multitude of sinsit should be recalled that hitler used them to seize and secure his total power over the lives of the people of germany surely a law which justifies and makes possible suppression of the basic freedoms by the government on these vdgue grounds creates a greater inherent threat to the public welfare than the contingencies at which it is aimed the enactment of a law that impairs the rights of one group today establishes a precedent for the impairment of those of other groups tomorrow it is revealing that those who have been the most insistent in their use of the catchall phrase public health and welfare to justify the suppression of free collective bargaining in wide sectors of industry are the same ones who oppose most strenuously government activities designed to further the public health and welfare in limited fields where a genuine need is most apparent and readily definable such as housing social security and health insurance their pet peeve is summed up in the phrase creeping socialism they are really the mouthpiece for the united states chamber of commerce and the national association of manufacturers where this injunction procedure has been used it has definitely hindered the ironing out of grievances and that voluntary mutual agreement between the parties directly concerned that is the essence of collective bargaining and the only sound basis for lasting industrial peace and stability strikes are not the causes of industrial unrest but the effects of more basic underlying grievances the arbitrary suppression of effective protests against those grievances only serves to aggravate them further and build up pressures that would be bound to eventually culminate in an outburst that all the laws on the books could not control speaking facetiously may i make the point that all that labor wants out of the eightyfirst congress is its two front teeth which were kicked in by the tafthartley law more seriously labor does not plead for charity it demands equal justice under law the right to free collective bargaining the right to be a part of this great america of ours on an equal footing with all other segments of our society to grant their plea the congress must repeal the tafthartley act and reject the vicious provisions of the proposed wood bill as a substitute for the pending legislation i trust it will be the privilege and the pleasure of the house to grant labors plea"], [0.018122076988220215, 0.9818779230117798, 1, "i yield myself 35 minutes whether we like it or not we are today a world power insofar as democracy is concerned we are the world power in attaining this position in world affairs we have fallen heir to a tremendous responsibility it is the responsibility of preserving democracy throughout the world and preventing the spread of political concepts antagonistic to our national interests in order to meet this obligation we must have the military equipment and manpower required for us to fulfill our destiny and our world responsibility weakness in our armed forces is an open invitation to disaster this therefore means that for the foreseeable future we must maintain a strong modernized army a navy equal to any upon the seas and an air force second to none we are not an aggressive nation we do not aspire to world domination nor do we seek to impose our will upon others but we must stand ready at all times to preserve our free form of government in this nation and to deal effectively with threats to our national interests in all parts of the world this bill now before you deals with the composition of the army and the air force its sole purpose is to give a charter specifically stating their authorized personnel strengths and their organization it goes to the very core of our national defense planning it will become the statutory anchor of the army and the air force for many years to come what it amounts to is that by this bill we are creating a legal framework which will be the longtime foundation for these two branches of our armed forces now this measure does not apply to the navy in any way that service has for some time had specific statutory authority for its personnel and matdriel but i feel about this bill now before the committee as i did about the various navy laws previously passed to establish the composition of the navy that is i deem it only fitting and proper that the congress express clearly in law just what it considers must be the peacetime structure of those agencies of our government which hold the grave responsibility of protecting the american people in this troubled and uncertain world every year or two during the past 15 years the house has passed legislation that has fixed the size of the fleet or the strength of the navys various personnel groups or the navys research authority and so on until navy law is now adequate to the job the navy is expected to perform but not so with the army and the air force the congress has not gone thoroughly into the fundamentals of the army since the national defense act was enacted in 1916 and amended in 1920 and we today appropriate for the army which does not have in law its own authorized regular personnel strength it lacks a clearly defined composition it lacks specific research authority in short the army has a foundation that shifts back and forth up and down and round according to appropriations we have no longrange mandate for peacetime operations anywhere in army law that meets the present national defense needs and now what about our air force we divorced it from the army only a year and a half ago we have not yet taken time to create an adequate body of law that sets out clearly what the air force should consist of how large it should be in time of peace what kind of authority it should exercise and so on it will be a default of congressional responsibility and it is assuredly unsound from the national defense standpoint to leave these matters unresolved no longer should we leave the army without a clearcut expression from the congress as to how many regular officers it may have how many regular warrant officers and how up to date it should keep itself no longer should we leave on the statute books a prewar ceiling of 6 000 aircraft for the old army air corps and consider that we have acted adequately for the new air force the composition both in materiel and personnel of these two services must be firmly and separately establishedit is incumbent upon the congress to do so in the interest of constructive planning for national defense over the years ahead therefore i have every reason to believe that the committee will react to this legislation in the same favorable manner as it has to the same type of basic navy legislation that i had the honor to sponsor before the house time and time again in the past certainly legislation of this nature is not unusual the bill establishes by law the basic authorization of the army it authorizes an overall active duty army of 837 000 officers and enlisted men plus several special categories of whom 33 500 may be regular officers to arrive at this regular strength we took the present proposed budgetary strength of 677 000 then provided that onehalf of the 67 000 officers normally required by an army of that size should be regulars thus we keep at least half of the officer corps of the army open for reserves and and guardsmen this keeps the regular establishment at a low enough level to permit reduction in army strength in the future without excessive difficulty should international conditions make such reductions advisable further the bill authorizes 750 000 officers and enlisted men for the national guard and 980 000 for the army reserves these strengths have the endorsement of the army the guard and the reserve actual strength and the degree of training these civilian components will attain hinge of course upon appropriations but for present plans these figures are required and were therefore written into the proposed law by the committee in addition to the personnel strengths proposed the bill sets forth for the army procurement authority research and development authority and certain appropriation authorizations thus the bill gives the army a continuity of development and planning both for the regular forces and for the civilian components once the bill is enacted the army and the air force can proceed logically and steadily with their national defense planning now let me summarize some of the air force provisions of the proposed bill this bill does for the air force about the same things i have outlined for the army an authorized air force active duty strength is set at 502 000 plus several special groups the same basic figure as we approved last year in the draft bill this strength is necessary to man the 70group program of the 502 000 we authorize 27 500 to be regulars arriving at the figure as onehalf of the number of officers the air force will have on active duty under the presentproposed appropriated strength therefore we plan that the air force like the army will keep at least onehalf of its officer strength open for the training of reserves and guardsmen then the bill proposed 70 air groups this number of groups will require at least 7 000 firstline aircraft there will be about 5 500 more for the air reserve a little over 8 100 in war reserve and about 3 400 secondline aircraft this gives us the total of 24 000 provided in the bill the bill goes on to say that the air force may procure up to 5 200 aircraft a year within the 24 000 authorized the purpose of this is to keep the air force modern uptodate and equipped to defend the united states with the latest aerial weapons this air strength will keep the united states reasonably prepared for any emergency requiring the use of air power now there has been much talk about the 70group air force just what does it consist of let me give it to you in detail the groups now contemplated each such group consisting of three squadrons will be as follows four groups of heavy bombers sixteen groups of medium bombers six groups of strategic reconnaissance five groups of light bombers twentyfive groups of fighters four groups of tactical reconnaissance four groups of heavy troop carriers six groups of medium troop carriers in addition there will be 22 separate squadrons rounding out the 70 groups these squadrons will be airsea rescue squadrons mats squadrons and so forth in each of these groups the number of airplanes varies according to the type of group now let us take a heavybomber group it has three squadrons of six b36s each that gives us a total of 18 b36s in one heavybomber group since the 70group program contemplates four heavybomber groups the committee will see that the 70group program will have 72 b36s in the firstline element medium bomber groups will have 30 aircraft per group light bomber 48 day fighters 75 allweather fighters 36 strategic reconnaissance 36 heavy troop carrier 36 medium troop carrier 48 and tactical reconnaissance 54 from these figures we can tell exactly how many firstline airplanes are in 70 regular air force groups under present conditions of aerial warfare and i include this information in these remarks to bring down to earth a great deal of vague discussion which has occurred on this subject in the past i invite the attention cf the committee to the fact that the proposed bill authorizes the air national guard to have a strength of 100 000 officers and enlisted personnel this is considerably above the present level in the air national guard but this was intentionally provided so as to permit upward revision of the present air guard strength as circumstances require without requiring successive amendments of the proposed law in the future the proposed authorization has the complete indorsement of the national guard interests and of the air force as well as the indorsement of the reserve officers association also the bill proposes a strength of 500 000 officers and enlisted persons for the air force reserve this does not mean that all of these 50g 000 will receive full or parttime training the figure includes the inactive reserves as well as those who are to be active in the air force reserve however it was necessary to authorize 500 000 to take care of the present air reserve strength and still leave enough leeway for the additions to this strength which will come along in the future now let me suggest that the committee read section 207 of the proposed bill it provides that the present status of the air national guard is not to be impaired in any way by this legislation this was included in the law because of great concern on the part of guard interests lest this legislation be used as a means by which to federalize the air national guard the committee on armed services received detailed testimony on the magnificent performance of the air guard to date it was our unanimous conclusion that this particular piece of legislation must not be used in any way to upset the present operations of the air guard and to insure that we wrote it into the bill i mention this point intentionally because i want to allay any similar concern any member of this committee may have in respect to the effect of the proposed law on the air national guard now i know that many members of the committee are asking the question how much will it cost the nation to get this 70group program under way before answering this let me explain what has already been done for the air force in the way of appropriations last year the congress appropriated 1 957 000 000 for the procurement of aircraft for the air force 392 000 000 of this was for plan improvement and production changes so the air force actually had for aircraft procurement about 1 545 000 000 in the 1949 budget this was enough to contract for about 2 437 aircraft now the presidents budget this year provides 1 480 000 000 for aircraft procurement this would let the air force contract for about 1 668 aircraft so what has happened well the budget sets aside less money 65 000 000 this year for the procurement of aircraft than was appropriated last year and because of the emphasis on larger airplanes a much smaller number of aircraft will be purchased this year if no addition is made to the presidents national defense budget as of december 31 1948 the air force had 59 air groups although not all of these groups were fully operational under the presidents budget these groups will be cut to 48 in other words unless more money is appropriated for the air force the 70group program is stopped dead at least for this year and so it is my hope thtat the appropriations committee and the congress will add at least 800 000 000 to the presidents budget for the department of the air force and i might add this can be done without increasing the overall budget by one cent by using the funds now earmarked in the budget for universal military training it can be done in fact with less outlay in direct expenditure than is now proposed in the national defense budget for this fiscal year for most of the 800 000 000 if allocated to the air force will be used for contract authorization which cannot be expended until 1951 or 1952 when the completed aircraft are delivered now what can the air force get done with this 800 000 000 it could build 57 effective groups instead of the 48 proposed in the national defense budget this would be a substantial steponce again like we took last yearin the direction of the 66 groups planned originally in the 1949 fiscal year but what does the 800 000 000 mean in numbers of aircraft well suppose all of it were spent for airplanes it would buy 1 116 more than the 1 668 planned for in the new budget but there is no point in having the airplanes without the pilots to fly them or the men to keep them in flying order so instead of the 412 000 men required to man the proposed 48 groups 450 000 would be needed by the end of the fiscal year to man the 57 groups this would be an increase of 38 000 men over the budgeted strength so of the 800 000 000 365 000 000 would have to be used to balance out the additional groups with men materials and equipment the balance of the 800 000 000 or 435 000 000 could be used for aircraft procurement adding this to the 1 480 000 000 proposed in the 1950 budget we would have the total sum for aircraft procurement of 1 915 000 000 this would give us 702 more aircraft that would raise the total of 1 668 planes now provided for in the budget to 2 370 this compares adequately to the 2 437 aircraft we authorized to be procured in i may add that if we provide this additional 800 000 000 this year to the present budget and annually thereafter grant the air force the present budget plus an additional 800 000 000 the 70group program will not be in operationon an aircraft basis aloneuntil 1954 at least of course now all members of the committee understand that this is an authorization bill only the question of appropriations is an entirely separate subject but i feel that in discussing this authorization the committee should know something of the costs involved now just what is the factor that underlies this legislation it is preparednessthe need for keeping our armed forces in a state of readiness at all times for the protection of this nation but we must never lose sight of the relation of our military preparedness to the preservation of peace to american foreign policy to the morale of freedomloving people throughout the world certainly no fairminded person can characterize the united states as an aggressive nation as i mentioned previously in these remarks it is not our practice or desire to impose our will upon others nor do we fifthcolumn our way into power in foreign countries but despite all this we have an extremely powerful deterrent effect upon other nations which might do any one or all of these things now why is this so we deter such nations only because of the existing and potential force our great nation can apply in the event we are embroiled in war and how strong is that influence well it ebbs and flows as our actual and potential military strength advances and recedes over the years but the foreign reaction is not confined to the amount of force we can exert it is also related to what this congress doesnow and in the futurein respect to other matters involving our armed forces because that is gaged throughout the world as a measure of our determination to adhere to or renounce our principles under hostile pressure surely there can be no question in the mind of any member of this committee that so long as international relations remain in a state of anarchy the measuring of force against force between nations in time of peace as well as in time of war will continue under such conditionsand so long as those conditions continuecertainly it is evident that military weakness in our armed forces invites abuses and contempt on the part of those with aggressive designs so that conversely reasonable military preparedness is today the most effective deterrent to war i am not unmindful of the disillusionment that normally follows war and certainly i share with all other americans their great hope and desire for peace and i too look forward to the day if it ever comes when our people can safely reduce our armed forces or dissolve them and turn to an international regulatory body for the maintenance of peace among nations yes and i am 100 percent behind the united nations as are all thinking americans but it is not enough that our whole aim and effort is to preserve peace neither is it enough to place all of our confidence in the presumed success of the united nations providing adequate protection to this nation takes precedence in my view over all our hopes all speculation all theory all eagerness for peace so as i have said many times before this congress and as the history of our country has so consistently borne out over the years we cannot safely scuttle our armed forces or reduce them materially until the state of the world becomes far more stable than it is now or than it can possibly become during the next few years neither can we today default the world leadership we have inherited as a result of the recent war if we do default by failing to provide adequately for the national defense ours shall be the responsibility for the catastrophe which will be heaped upon our children and their children for generations to come i shall continue to maintain in this house that our nations deep longing for peace must be accompaniedfor the foreseeable futureby the strength to insure it i shall continue to maintain that fairness in international relations and a spirit of cooperation cannot of themselves deter a nation bent on aggression now i have dwelled to this extent on this phase of the problem before us today for a very specific reason this possibility of the nation relying upon meekness of spirit and upon good works in international and military matters is not idle speculation our nation has followed this path before our nation has followed that path after every war in its history after the revolutionary warthe war of 1812the war with mexicothe war between the statesthe spanishamerican warand up to the very brink of world war iiit has been our national characteristic to starve and severely limit our armed forces to ignore their counsel and advice and to place our faith instead in the presumed protection afforded by the great oceans on either side of us perhaps this scuttling of preparedness was more readily defensible in the days of sailing vessels perhaps it could be maintained without excessive danger before the time of blitz aerial submarine atomic and bacteriological warfare before nationwide fifthcolumn activities before the time of guided missies and rocket weapons but it is certainly not true today we know now that the world can no longer isolate a war that involves one of the great powers we know now that our world leadership thrusts us in one way or another into any fracas that may bob up anywhere we have found that these great oceans on either side of us have become avenues of war not protection against it and we know now that when a modern war starts this nation can no longer indulge itself in 2 or 3 years of getting ready to fight i shall always believe that had the united states sufficiently increased its military strength to deter those madmen of the thirties bent on aggression war could have been averted i believe that had italy known action would be forthcoming with military power adequate to the job the league of nations would not have been defiedthat japan would not have waged war on chinaand that hitler would eventually have been consumed by his own ghastly war machine it is because of all these considerations that i have no question in my mind that the house will approve this bill by an overwhelming vote for i am sure that the entire congress will recognize that the bill proposes but the minimum army navy and air force necessary for our own national defense and for a war deterrent throughout the world 1949"], [0.018299758434295654, 0.9817002415657043, 1, "i yield myself 30 minutes when the rule covering this bill was being considered the discussion representing the conflicting views on the part of the gentlemen on both sides of the aisle had nothing to do with the bill we are presently considering their views were on another matter entirely we have under consideration h r 4754 which may be cited as the federal property and administrative services act of 1949 this measure was reported out unanimously from the committee on expenditures in the executive departments this bill establishes a basis for a plan to simplify the procurement utilization and disposal of government property and to reorganize certain agencies of the government and for other purposes the major purpose of this bill is to provide for a uniform system of property management and supply for the entire federal government accordingly h r 4754 creates a new general services administration which will include the propertymanagement functions now scattered among several federal agencies and carry with it certain other related service activities many of our states and some of our large cities have excellent uniform propertymanagement systems practically every large business enterprise and most small concerns have devised and developed such systems these bodies and organizations have learned from experience that they must have these systems in order to run their business efficiently and economically however in the federal government there is a definite need for this phase of management and at the present time we find it lacking in the report on an office of general services compiled by the commission on organization of the executive branch of the government and dealing with the supply activities of our government we see a vivid description of the staggering size of the supply problem besetting our government this commission popularly termed the hoover commission has this to say the federal government runs one of the greatest supply businesses in the world it is spending more than 6 000 000 000 a year for new material supplies and equipment for the regular activities of the civilian and military agencies the federal government has in storage also in the continental united states military and civilian inventories valued at 27 000 000 000 the government also pays out more than 1 000 000 000 yearly for transportation of property and 440 000 000 in salaries of the nearly 150 000 employees working in supply operations at the present time the administration of this vast federal supply business is largely uncoordinated to some extent duplicative and definitely in need of better methods and procedures corrective steps which are indeed long overdue are now critically required under the existing law the war assets administration will be dismembered on june 30 1949just 22 days from nowits sizable remaining inventory as well as the disposal of surplus property generated in the future will be scattered throughout the government thus we will see the present lack of better uniform management continued in this regard having this urgency in view together with the complexity and scope of the property management problem and the desire and enthusiasm on all sides for an immediate solution for the needs our committee held long and extensive hearings encompassing several weeks these hearings were based on n bill h r 2781 presented by the federal works administrator with the approval of the director of the bureau of the budget acting on behalf of the president we sought testimony from many experts in this field and we solicited and heard everyone who evinced a desire to be heard this list of witnesses included mr carter manasco and mr clarence brown the two members of the house who served on the commission on government organization among others the bill brought out by our committeeh r 4754is based upon the administrations early bill upon the report and recommendations of the commission on government organization upon the recommendation of the comptroller general of the united states and upon several salient factors we believe merited attention and consideration under the able leadership of the gentleman from illinois the distinguished chairman of the full committee the members of our subcommittee particularly messrs burnside bolling and harvey have labored on the problem long and patiently mr riehlman though not a member of the subcommittee often sat in with us and made many valuable contributions thanks are due to these gentlemen and the remaining members of our committee we think we have in our bill here today as fine and clear charter for government property management as can be developed at the present time thus in strict accordance with the recommendations of the commission on organization the bill creates a new general services administration likewise as recommended by the commission in its very recent concluding report we have set up this general services administration as an independent establishment and not as a part of the presidents office however the administrator of general services will be appointed by the president and will be personally and directly responsible to him continuing in this vein we see that property management affects every executive agency and so the bill expressly authorizes the president himself to prescribe policies and directives and specifies that these presidential policies and directives shall governnot merely guidenot only the administrator but all executive agencies in carrying out these propertymanagement functions here we have established therefore a clearcut line of authority running directly from the president and involving a very close working relationship between the president and the administrator this objective is accomplished without resort to the unworkable extreme of placing an operational or line activity having approximately 35 000 employees within the small staff or advisory body which ministers to the president in policy matters i cannot help but bring out at this point that there are only 1 204 individuals in the presidents advisory staff what we properly call the presidents office to show how ridiculous it would be to bring in an operational governmental function of some 35 000 people and place them in the presidents office which now has only 1 204 people in keeping with the recommendations of the commission on organization our bill lodges in the general services administration a the management and operation of most federal ofilce buildings and warehouses now under the general administration of the federal works agency b the procurement cataloging supply and related functions of the government including the present bureau of federal supply now in the treasury department and c records management functions including the national archives establishment the disposal of surplus property is the reverse process of procurement and supply in our bill the functions of disposing of surplus government property has been placed in the general services administration this latter is presently the responsibility of the war assets administration where world war ii generated surplus is involved the federal works agency and the bureau of federal supply handle the remaining surplus another end result of procurement is contract settlement this fast dwindling function is within the purview of the bureau of federal supply acting in conformance with the strongest recommendations of the secretary of the treasury h r 4754 transfers these contractsettlement functions to our newly created agency i want to point out that the function of the contract settlement board operates under its own statute and that it is merely placed in this office of general services for housekeeping functions as it has been placed in the treasury department for housekeeping purposes alone neither the secretary of th6 treasury nor the administrator of federal services can interfere with the function of the contract settlement board because it rests upon its own statutory authority the backbone and hard core of the new organization will be the federal works agency administering as it does the largest single segment and providing about 80 percent of the total personnel this bill reposes in the general services administration the remaining activities of the federal works agency which are a the design and construction of public buildings b the conductin the public roads administration of the administration of the federalaid road program and c community facilities the commission on government organization recommended that the federalaid to the states for the development of roads be transferred to the department of commerce as part of a new alinement of transportation services the commission also recommended that the design and construction of public buildings and the provision of community facilities become part of centralized building construction services in the department of the interior no matter how meritorious these considerations may be such proposals are separate subjects worthy of independent treatment and not to be cursorily handled as a byproduct or collateral issue of property management as soon as possible it is our committees intention to give careful study weight and evaluation to these proposals but feel that at this time no opinion should be expressed concerning them thus meanwhile rather than leave these public works service functions dangling in thin air our bill carries them into the general services administration after we have gathered within the four walls of our structure these related ingredients it is the intention of the committee after deliberation and study to effect the best possible solution for these constituent agencies merely placing the several property management and service agencies under one roof obviously will not in itself eliminate overlapping and duplication in the federal works agency at the present time are the public buildings administration the public roads administration and the bureau of community facilities so that without disturbing their operational functions at this time we place them in this office as the means of bringing related things together later we are going to define the functions of each one of these agencies that are p laced in the general service administration then if at that time the recommendations regarding public roads and public buildings after being given a fair hearing before our committee show that they should be transferred to other bodies whether it be the department of commerce or the department of the interior or any other department at that time when the whole subject is being considered we expect to take such action as our committee deems to be wise accordingly and again in line with the recommendations of the commission on government reorganization the bill centers in the administrator the responsibility to carry out all functions and authorizes him to delegate his authority to subordinates as he deems appropriate the bill further authorizes the administrator to regroup and redistribute the various segments and functions of the agencies incorporated in the general services administration let me clarify that by saying he can only regroup and redistribute in the office itself he cannot take it outside or get somebody else and bring it in this is clearly for the purpose of redistributing and eliminating overlapping and duplication within these related agencies of government there we hope we can achieve some measure of economy the superlative record of the new federal works administrator mr jess larson in bringing improved management into the war assets administration fully guarantees that he will in carrying out his duties so regroup and redistribute the elements of the general services administration as to eliminate overlapping and duplicative activities and thus promote efficiency and economy in the government the federal government needs immediately a comprehensive workable plan for property management this plan had it been established in the past would have returned enormous savings to the federal government through the elimination of competition by the executive agencies for the same articles in the same markets by prudent buying and including quantity purchases this is made even more glaringly apparent when wc consider that losses to the government are particularly acute when one agency has purchased new articles while at the same time another agency in the government has been disposing of the same articles by sale at low prices or storing same in their basements there is a definite need for a clearinghouse of information as to goods on hand and usable in the role of the general services administration we see this defect cured through lack of central coordination waste and losses have occurred in the field of warehousing and other space utilization appearing before our committee the former federal works administrator general fleming said that the department of agriculture paid 4 000 000 a year rent t store wool in private buildings in the new england area while at the same time in this particular area there was enough empty available warehouse space owned by the government which might have been pressed into service for this purpose general fleming cited this 4 000 000 a year loss as directly attributable to lack of coordinated information and a lack of centralized controls and supervision in this regard in the executive branch this type of situation will be eliminated under this bill the key to the bill is section 201 which provides for a uniform yet flexible systemgovernmentwidefor procurement warehousing property identification supply traffic management and management of public utility services as pointed out by the commission on government organization uniform policies and methods are absolutely essential to achieve economy efficiency and substantial savings it is expected however that the carrying out of these functions will often be delegated to the various executive agencies for operational purposes and the bill so provides primarily centralized procurement will be limited only to those items commonly used by a number of agencies also the bill specially provides that the secretary of defense may unless the president directs otherwise exempt the national military establishment from action by the administrator whenever the secretary deems such exemption to be in the best interests of national security the bill contains strong provisions for maximum utilization by the government of its own property everyone familiar with this phase considers that efficient use by the government of its own property will save more money than any other phase of property management it will reduce to a minimumthe procurement of new supplies it will cut to the bone the sale of used supplies at less than their cost section 202 of the bill directs the administrator to prescribe overall systems for property use and requires every executive agency to maintain adequate inventory controls and report any needs for new property to the administrator it also requires these agencies to report to the administrator any property on hand no longer needed by such agencies independent of these reports the administrator is authorized to conduct his own surveys with respect to the use of property by other agencies acting in conjunction with the comptroller general of the united states the honorable lindsay warren our committee developed a most important phase of property accounting in this regard the comptroller general is directed to prescribe principles and standards of property accounting to cooperate with the administrator and executive agencies in developing property accounting system to approve those systems and to report to the congress any failure by any executive agency adequately to account for its property this section in itself is very important existing property accounting legislation is incomplete and largely antiquated the development of sound and uniform principles and standards in this field and the devising and installation of modern systems of inventory control and property accounting will go a long way in aiding government agencies to do a better job and make substantial savings in appropriated funds by making better and fuller use of property owned by the government furthermore by another section206 c the comptroller general is directed to audit all types of property accounts at the places as far as practicable where the property or records are kept to prevent augmentation of appropriations contrary to congressional intent the bill provides that in general all transfers of excess property from one federal agency to another shall be at the fair value thereof as determined by the administrator and the proceeds covered into the treasury the present limited authority of the federal works administrator to assign office and storage space in government buildings is enlarged and strengthened this will prevent hoarding of space by executive agencies and will reduce both the demands for private leased space and for the construction of new expensive government buildings under this bill property becomes surplus to the needs of the entire government only when so determined by the administrator and only after he has exhausted all efforts to find another federal use for it the provisions relating to the disposal of such property generally follow those contained in the present surplus property act of 1944 with these significant exceptions after december 31 of this yearthe date of expiration of the surplus property actall property valued in excess of 500 must be disposed of by advertising for competitive bids there are no priorities or preferences in the disposition of such property the special conditions which induced the congress to establish certain priorities in the disiosition of world war ii generated surpluses will not apply to the relatively small and widely scattered peacetime generated surpluses which will occur over the years the bill recognizes however that occasionally there will be surplus to the government books equipment or other supplies the sale of which would realize little cash return but which would greatly benefit our schools and colleges the bill therefore authorizes the administrator in his discretion to donate such surplus property for educational purposes but only upon the recommendations of the federal security administrator furthermore the bill authorizes the federal scurity administrator to take any action respecting the enforcement of compliance with or the amendment of contracts and deeds by which property has heretofore been transferred under the surplus property act of 1944 for educational or health use the bill retains in substance first the present authority of the secretary of agriculture to control the disposition of surplus agricultural commodities so as to prevent dumping or disruption of pricesupport programs second the authority of the united states maritime commission to dispose of surplus vessels of 1 500 gross tons or more and third the authority of the attorney general to investigate and advise the administrator with respect to possible inconsistencies with tie antitrust laws in the disposition of surplus property it is not our thought that having passed this bill the congress should forget about the whole problem of property management on the contrary the bill requires the administrator to submit a report on his operations in each january and at other times as he deems desirable he is also directed to submit to the congress with his report any recommendations for amendments which he may consider necessary for better affectment and administration as a result of operating experience title iii adopts completely another recommendation of the commission on government organization it extends to the general services administration virtually the same flexible procurement procedure that the congress granted to the national military establishment in the armed services procurement act of 1947 the language of this title was drafted in cooperation with representatives of the general accounting office and is endorsed by the comptroller general this title also requires that a fair proportion of all purchases shall be placed with smallbusiness concerns in considering title iv we find excess property located in foreign countries has far less potential for general government use than property physically located within the borders of united xcv469 states in our government the armed services are the only substantial users of property in foreign countries further the costs of transporting foreign excess property back to the united states and of rehabilitating it would in most cases equal or exceed its value for use by a civilian agency here and most importantly the disposal of foreign excess property to foreign governments has proved in the past and should continue to prove in the future an effective instrument for aiding our foreign policy accordingly this bill in title iv provides generally that the responsibility for the disposition of foreign excess property shall be lodged in the agency charged with its custody subject however to policy guidance and direction by the secretary of state under title v in order to prevent uncertainty before the new order is brought into being this bill temporarily preserves existing policies and directives until modified by administrative authority under the new legislation the bill repeals the surplus property act of 1944 except for the sections relating to transfers for the airport programs and for parks and historic monuments and the sections relating to the foreignscholarship program all of which are retained as permanent legislation the bill likewise repeals a that portion of public law 862 of the eightieth congress which would abolish war assets administration on june 30 1949 and scatter its functions throughout the government b executive order no 6166 the present limited procurement authority and c also some 20 statutes relating to the use of tradein allowances in other respects the act will supplement but will not supersede existing laws relating to property management in conclusion the bill exempts certain specialized activities the principal ones being programs of the department of agriculture for price support and stabilization grants to farmers foreign aid the stockpiling of critical materials the national schoollunch program the atomic energy commission the central intelligence agency and some responsibilities of the tennessee valley authority thus we have by virtue of this bill taken the first of a series of steps which will inevitably result in the increase of efficiency in government vast savings and better management methods will be introduced to keep the government service abreast of the developments and plans for operation in these fields"], [0.018564939498901367, 0.9814350605010986, 1, "i yield myself 15 minutes this bill has the unanimous support of the committee on armed services it will have these effects first it extends for two more years the 1948 selective service act which expires on june 24 of this year second it bars any inductions until congress has declared that a national emergency exists which requires an increase in our military strength third it suspends the presidents power to seize plants essential to war until the congress declares an emergency fourth it keeps in operation the requirement that every male person in the united states between the ages of 18 and 26 must register with his local selective service board fifth it keeps in operation the requirement that registrants be continually classified as to availability for military service sixth it authorizes the president to order to active duty for 21 months all national guardsmen reserves and regular retired personnel after a national emergency is declared by the congress seventh it suspends provisions of law authorizing shortterm enlistments in the regular armed forces so there are the two main effects of the bill first it puts inductions in a standby status until the congress says men are to be inducted second it continues the registration of 18yearolds and their classification as to availability for military service in its daytoday operation what this bill really amounts to is a manpower registration law it keeps us up to date on our youth of military age in the way of possible exemptions and deferments and keeps their addresses readily available in case the congress should find it nacessary sometime in the future to authorize inductions into the armed forces it also keeps induction authority on the statute books for immediate use in time of emergency but that authority is suspended until the congress determines that world conditions require an increase in the strength of our armed forces now what are the reasons that justify the extension of the selective service law first i want to discuss world conditions for a moment two years ago when we put this law on the statute books all of us hoped that world conditions would so improve that we could by now dispense with a draft law that is why we put a 2year limit on the law now i know it comes as no surprise to any member of the house when i say that despite our hopes world conditions today are not improved two years ago the armed services committee reported to the house that selectiveservice legislation was the necessary response of this government to specific aggressive and dangerous actions on the part of the government of the soviet union now the fact is that the actions of the soviet union are quite as menacing and truculent today as they were thenif not more so as general bradley testified before the armed services committee on may 2 there has been no letup in the aggressive extension of communism toward its goal of world domination the trend of international affairs in recent months has been extremely disturbing to all of our people as general bradley said it is not so much the specific incidents as it is their accumulationtheir cumulative impactthat gives us concern let me remind the committee what has happened in recent months there has been a recent unprovoked attack on a united states navy plane costing the lives of 10 of our citizens there has been continued soviet pressure on our occupation forces in berlin which very recently has taken on very serious aspects there has been a tremendous extension of soviet influence in the far east and indochina burma siam and the malayan peninsula are in steadily increasing danger of going the way of china in eastern germany the russians have created a powerful army under their domination and they have recently taken over the polish armed 7670 forces more recently they have demanded our ouster from trieste various harassing and menacing acts are occurring with increasing frequency against our private citizens and government officials at various pressure points throughout the world meanwhile soviet armed strength has steadily increased and our government policymaking officials have found it necessary to tell our people almost daily that we must maintain ourselves in a state of great readiness in a tense and threatening world several of our most responsible leaders have repeatedly reminded the nation of the fact that russia now respects only force so what does it all add up to general bradley asked that question before the armed services committee on may 2 and answered in his own words thatcertainly it does not support discontinuance of the selective service act when it expires on june 24 the armed services committee has unanimously agreed with that sound observation by general bradley there is nothing whatsoever in the international scene which would warrant relaxation on the part of the united states of her readiness program it is the committees conclusion that if we let the selective service act expire it would clearly constitute an unfortunate and unwise reversal of our preparedness efforts there was another important reason prompting the armed services committee to bring this bill unanimously to the house general bradley made this observation to the committee it appears to me as i tabulate the actions of the past several monthshe was referring to the marshall plan the north atlantic treaty defense planning at the hague the military assistance programthat it would be entirely inconsistent for us to participate in all of these plans to protect ourselves and others and then penalize ourselves by letting selective service lapse at the height of the cold war we had similar testimony from the secretary of state on this point he testified while i realize that for some months it has not been necessary to use the selective service act as the basis for meeting our manpower requirements of our armed forces i nonetheless believe that failure to extend the act might be widely interpreted abroad as a relaxation of our determination to remain strong as the principal defender of the peace against aggression from any power it would appear inconsistent both with the responsibility which we assumed under the north atlantic treaty and with our efforts to encourage the other members of the treaty to increase their individual and collective strength to resist aggression the committee agrees fully with the secretary of state the secretary of defense general bradley and others that profound effects could flow in foreign lands from a refusal by the congress to keep this law on the statute books not only could the impact abroad be directly contradictory to what we are trying to do through other measures in international affairs but i am personally convinced that the soviet union would seize upon such a refusal as evidence that this nation is halfhearted in its international effortsand there is no doubt that enormous volumes of misleading and damaging propaganda would be spread from one end of the world to the other in an effort to persuade our friends overseas that america is not willing to stand up to the requirements of the cold war so from the standpoint of our own readiness for an emergency in a world which is certainly no less troubled than it was 2 years ago and from the standpoint of the effect on our friends overseas who after all are right next door to the russian military machine we have unanimously concluded on the armed services committee that it would be extremely unwise to permit the selective service act to lapse now how does keeping this law on the books assist our readiness program i mentioned before that the committee is putting inductions on the shelf unti the congress declares a national emergency i want to emphasize that this will not eliminate the value of those provisions in the law in case of an emergency it will be far simpler and much quicker for the congress to approve a concurrent resolution than it would be for us to try to write in a great hurry a law that sets out in great detail all of the exemptions and deferments and so on which have to go into a draft act there is definite readiness to be gained by keeping this authority on the statute books upon approval of the concurrent resolution by the congress we can promptly increase the armed strength very substantiallymuch faster than we could if we had to write an entirely new law from scratch but there is an even more important reason why this measure contributes to the readiness of our defense program this bill will keep the selective service machinery operating and will continue registrations and classifications these three activities are absolutely vital to the rapid mobilization of our manpower we have arrived at a time because of atomic weapons and other instruments of modern war when we cannot postpone until after an emergency begins our efforts to mobilize promptly we have to be as ready as we can when the emergency starts this means that we must be able to mobilize far more rapidly than ever before in our history i think it is evident to every member of the house that our manpower mobilization plans can be of little value in time of an emergency unless there is machinery already perfected and in operationmachinery which does not have to be assembled and personnel gathered and trained when the crisis is upon us there can be no doubt by the way that in case of a future pearl harbor it would be much more difficult to create and place in operation a selective service system than it was 10 years ago and again in 1948 there will be enormous dompeting demands for civilian manpower and there could possibly be very serious damage to the nation on the very outbreak of the emergency it follows therefore that the present selective service system in actual operation with board members already appointed with personnel already trained ready to function at once in each of the local communities of the nation can much more acceptably and much more in the national interest produce prompt results than any organization which we could hastily assemble under circumstances possibly chaotic in nature what this means in terms of time is 4 months it means that we could reach an induction rate of 300 000 a month in the event of an emergency 4 months sooner than we otherwise could if we let the system lapse the saving of this time could be of incalculable importance in the event of a sudden military crisis now i want to take just a moment to summarize what the selective service system consists of i remind the house that the system is kept in operation under terms of this bill now this is the selective service system it consists of a national headquarters here in washington which is headed by a director confirmed by the senate although headed at the present time by a retired major general it is a civilian organization unconnected with the armed forces and operates directly under the president the selective service system now has 54 state headquarters there are 3 745 local boards which for reasons of economy are housed at approximately 3 000 locations throughout the country there are about onehalf the number of local boards and less than 20 percent of the personnel that the system required to operate during world war ii the selective service system is staffed with 37 000 uncompensated citizens they serve as members of local boards appeal boards medical advisers appeal agents and advisers to registrants most of the compensated peoplethere are 3 600serve as clerks of the local boards and most of them are on a parttime basis in many instances working only 1 day a week in fact although there are 3 600 persons employed payments are made for only about 2 100 manyears now what about the cost of this legislation the president asked for 6 454 000 for selective service in the 1951 budget that sum did not presume the extension of the selective service act and therefore included a sum of 3 000 000 for the liquidation of selective service which can be saved if the act is extended now i remind the committee that in the eightieth congress we passed public law 26 that established the office of selective service records an agency charged with the liquidation of the selective service system and the proper maintenance of all selective service records of world wars i and ii the selective service act of 1948 absorbed into the selective service system the office of selective service records for the life of the selective service act so to take care of the contingency that the congress might not extend the selective service act the 1951 budget as requested by the president provided only for the liquidation of the selective service system and for the continuing operation of the office of selective service records the president asked for 6 454 000 for these purposes three million dollars of that was to liquidate the selective service system and as i say will not have to be spent when this bill is enacted into law the balance 3 454 000will continue to be needed to operate the office of selective service records through the selective service system now the house cut that budget by 1 500 000giving selective service a sum of 4 954 000 instead of 6 454 000 this bill adds the obligations of registration and classification and the maintenance of the selective service machinery so it appears to require an additional expenditure of 4 200 00y however that does not count the 3 000 000 we will save by not liquidating the selective service system so what the bill will really cost is an additional 1 200 000 in fiscal year 1951 if the senate does not restore any of the house 1 500 000 cut in the selectiveservice budget that will make the total budget in 1951 for selective service somewhere in the vicinity of 6 000 000 as contrasted with the 10 654 000 anticipated by the president in his 1951 budget so to sum up the committee can understand that in fiscal year 1951 this bill will entail an additional cost of only 1 200 000 the balance of the selectiveservice budget 4 954 000 passed a few days ago by the house provides for all other selectiveservice costs the total selectiveservice budget amounts to less than onetenth of 1 percent of our total defense expenditures and yet that will keep in operation the selectiveservice headquarters in the 48 states the possessions the district of columbia and new york city and will also operate the 3 745 local boards as well as the national headquarters that total budget provides an enormous amount of mobilization potential for a remarkably low cost so to sum it up this is a bill which at the very low cost of 1 200 000 contributes very importantly to our national defense through the saving of valuable mobilization time through the impact on our friends overseas and through the impact upon our potential enemies overseas by keeping the compulsory features of the law in suspension we make sure that the congress retains full authority over the decision as to when compulsory service is necessary but at the same time we insure that the benefits of the act are kept available in this era of atomic weapons in this time when a vast foreign country is so evidently hostile to everything our nation stands for in a time when emphasis is on force in international affairs the armed services committee is convinced that it would be a serious blow to peace if we failed to continued selective service in law now the gentleman from nebraska asked why have the committee gone up the hill one day and down the hill the next or in other words why do we seem to be in an inconsistent position regarding this bill in my prepared statement i have just about covered this ground already but the gentleman from nebraska will recall that the president in his message of last january recommended an extension of the selective service act the selective service act was passed in the eightieth congress at that time there was written in the bill and in the report the hope of every member of congress which was the hope of the country that world conditions would be such that the selective service act would only be required for 2 years and so we wrote it in the bill of 1948 congress convened in january of this year the president sent his message on the 4th of january hearings were opened on the bill and we had all the qualified witnesses from the departments including the secretary of state general bradley and others qualified they pointed out the reasons why there should be an extension of this draft the committee was deeply impressed by the point that substantial time would be saved by an extension now get that point in your minds because this is very important if this law were not on the statute books and a national emergency should arise it would require 7 months to get the machinery in motion so we could be able to induct a substantial number of people the committee therefore was impressed with the necessity to save time 4 months at least in the event of a national emergency after the hearings world affairs drifted along and were in a fairly stable condition so the committee said well we will drift along too and see how things are going we did not do a thing from january into may then we began to look at world conditions and we saw that they were more aggravated than they had been in january when we commenced our hearings i mentioned this situation in my opening remarks an airplane had just been shot down over the baltic other things had happened in europe which caused the committee to call general bradley we also called admiral hillenkoetter director of the central intelligence agency we had mr johnson secretary of defense we shut the door they stated to us how they visualized world conditions at that time"]], "top_incorrect": [], "top_unsure":
