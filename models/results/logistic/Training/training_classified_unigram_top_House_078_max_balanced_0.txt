harold l ickes they insist that if the east is to continue to support the war effort they must have more gasoline and next winter more fuel oil they ask that the middle west where at the moment there seems to be an abundance of gasoline be further rationed they insist that approximately the same restrictions relating to the consumption of gasoline which are now in force in the east be imposed upon the middle west to the representatives of the middle west it seems unfair to require that their constituents be deprived of gasoline or fuel oil merely because transportation or storage difficulties now for the moment make it impossible for the east to receive all the gasoline or fuel cil needed let us avoid any discussion which will tend to promote sectional feeling let us turn rather to the basic cause of all or at least the greater part of our domestic trouble the reason for much of the burden of the inconvenience and of the rules regulations and directives which are hindering not only industrial production but the production of food is the determination of the new dealers to remake not only our form of government but our whole economic structure coming from a republican that statement might be challenged as the result of political bias but last week senator w lee odaniiel a blowninthebottle democrat exasperated by 0 p a regulations which threatened the poultry industry in his state made the statement that responsible officials in the administration were and i quote taking orders from somebody and that what they are doing is only part of a plot to change our government into communism socialism or some other foreign lsm which means a dictatorship and regimentation of our people and abolishing our private system of enterprise the senator did not understate the case not only are responsible administration officials destroying the poultry industry they are still limiting the acreage which the farmer may plant to produce necessary food crops by arbitrary and unreasonable restrictions the administration is strangling the packing and the canning industries last week the packers of the nation asked chairman vinson of the economic stabilization board to secure a ruling which would permit them to pay their employees an additional 15 cents an hour to prevent those employees seeking employment in nearby industries engaged in war production where the wages are in effect paid by the government and are much higher they also ask that the 0 p a without further delay fix a ceiling price for the finished product of the canner which would include all costs of production the canners were not insisting upon a price which would insure them a profit they are asking however that they be permitted to operate on a basis which would enable them to exist for if they were forced out of business the already apparent shortage of food would be increased not long ago mcnutts war manpower commission issued an order containing an unprecedented provision requiring that labor unions be consulted on the hiring and firing of workers and the obtaining of exemptions when a union which merely represents employees who are neither stockholders in nor charged with the responsibility of the management of a corporation must be consulted before men can be hired or fired it is rank hypocrisy to talk about individual enterprise or the preservation of the ability of those on the home front to adequately support the fighting forces the confusion and the interference with industries with business with farming ias grown so great that no longer cpn it be charged to incompetency alone as stated by senator odaniel there appears to be adeliberate effort on the part of administrative officials to adopt follow and insist upon a course of action which common sense teaches us can only end in disaster no fighting force can win a war unless it is adequately supported on the home front support on that front means production orfood processing and transporting food producing and processing and transporting of all the things needed by an armed force must be prompt and adequate notwithstanding that acknowledged fact here at home the administration continues to interfere with all three exasperation exists throughout the country and the conclusion of all too many was concisely expressed on june 7 before the house small business committee when w h albers president supermarket institute of cincinnati testifying said let the policy of the organization be based on facts and let the 0 p a stick to that policy the agency now has become so hopelessly disorganized that the time has arrived for mobs to descend on washington mere words do not bring relief on the following day the president addressing the delegates to the united states food conference reading from his prepared address said the better use of natural and human resources must be assured to improve living standardsand he intimated as he frequently has that those improved living standards must exist throughout the world he then added this extemtioraneous statementand i want to add that all this will be accomplished without the exploitation of any people by any nation anywhere unfortunately what thepresident says is all too often followed by action which contradicts the import of his words whil2 the president is announcing that no individual anywhere is to be exploited while the senators and the congressmen from the east are insisting upon more gasoline in order that their constituents may continue to contribute to the war effort labor goons and labor racketeers operating under the protection of this administration are exploiting people in the city of port huron mich and they are defying the right of individuals to aid in the war effort from a courageous editor of that city comes a wire which reads in part as follows attorneys for the retail grocers here have applied to the circuit court for a temporary injunction restraining the teamsters union morris coleman and certain other union olficers from picketing boycotting and interfering with the grocery business by cutting off delivery of food meat and other items the petition for the injunction sets forth that these acts by the teamsters union are damaging the public health and welfare of the city of port huron the court this morning granted a temporary injunction following along the line requested and an order to show cause on a permanent injunction setting the hearing for next monday morning again in port huron there is a milk strike on you may recall that some time ago from the well of the house your attention was called to the fact that men convicted of criminal offense but hiding behind labor unions were driving automobiles on rationed gasoline and rationed tires from the city of detroit to the city of port huron where they follov ed the conveyances driven by nonunion men used to deliver milk to customers about the streets of that city and interfered with their customers in an effort to compel the nonunion drivers to stand and deliver a portion of their wages to the union racketeers there was an investigation but the unlawful activities of these socalled union racketeers have been renewed according to another wire which reads as follows labor goons again at work in port huron no action from war labor board food shortage threatened here as result of teamsters boycott on grocery stores handlingmilk supplies of blacklisted dairies situation serious for our community cant you help us stop these outlaws when there is throughout the east a shortage of gasoline when under our constitution men have the right to join or not to join a union when under that same constitution protection of property is guaranteed when we are spending billions upon billions of dollars and sacrificing the lives of thousands of men to carry freedom from want and freedom from fear to all the peoples of the world why should this administration extend protection or fail to prosecute those who here in americato be specific in michigan in port huronare being exploited by the political allies of this administration what excuse is there for permitting the use of rationed tires and rationed gasoline by those who are insisting that loyalty to the union is more important than loyalty to the government the president of the united states who is so fond of calling himself commander in chief has ordered our civilians to work and broduce now comes the union organizers who add a proviso to that order which is that citizens shall work and produce when and only when they become members of a union i if the president expects the respect the wholehearted support of the civilian population he must play fair he must treat with justice those who have obeyed his order not long ago the president appealed to the coal miners to return to work fifteen peoria ill coal miners went back to work on may 3 in answer to the presidents demand on june 4 those 15 miners were called upon by their local union to face the unions executive board and to answer for their disobedience to the unions order to strike as was asked from the well of the house on march 22 who is the big boss in time of war the president called upon those miners to dig coal they dug coal and now they are being prosecuted by their union for obeying the presidents order for refusing to obey the strike order of the union are the people of port huron to be protected are those who in port huron and surrounding territory are producing milk to be protected in their efforts to deliver that milk are grocery stores engaged in distributing food to have their supplies of food cut off food which comes in through interstate commerce by striking teamsters of the a f of l as mr albers suggested to the small business committee if this administration does not straighten out the lawlessness which it is protecting by its refusal to act there will be the formation and the unlawful activities of mobs

zootsuitwearing violators of the law the insulters of soldiers and sailors and of their sweethearts have learned what the anger of those in the armed forces means we have had violence strange as it may seem the military authorities have declared los angeles closed to the members of the armed forces the obvious the just reaction to the practices of zootsuiters would have been to punish them for their unlawfulness had a firm just procedure been adopted in the beginning there would have been no need to bar los angeles to the armed services apparently we in this country must make a choice between lawless violence unjustifiable assaults upon the constitutional rights of our citizens and orderly constitutional processes the racketeers should be barred from port huron mich and the zootsuiters should be kicked into the jails of los angeles their constitutional rights should be restored to the people of port huron and the soldiers sailors and marinesall those in the armed forces of uncle samshould be allowed into the city of los angeles those who are going to sacrifice their lives in behalf of their country should not be barred from the streets of any american city when the fighting men come home those who seek to deprive them and their relatives of the american way of life will meet a just a swift and effective retribution unless this administration begins to preserve some of the four freedoms here in america some fighting men may think it their right to do something before they go to preserve the american way while they are gone"], [0.0030969977378845215,

the t v a and i have spent many years working for its development and for the extension of its benefits to the people throughout the area and especially throughout the district i have the honor to represent i not only succeeded in getting t v a power extended to the ones who were using electricity in the district at that time but for the first time in history we got it extended to the farmers and others living in the rural section that was the beginning of our rural electrification program that has rapidly spread to every state in the union it is the greatest thing that ever came to the farmers of this country and especially to the farm women for it has brought them more light more hope more joy and more relief from drudgery than anything else that has ever been done we have just agreed to the conference report on a bill that contained three amendments of mine which taken together constitute the greatest victory for rural electrification we have ever won the first one reduces the interest rate to the cooperative power associations to 2 percent the second extends the amortization period or the period in which these loans are to be paid back to a maximum of 35 years while the third one removes the limit on the amount congress may provide for rural electrification each year the limit in the present law is 40 000 000 a year we never could have electrified the farm homes of this country under that limitation in 1938 i got around that provision by an amendment to the relief bill against which points of order had been waived and secured an extra 100 000 000 for rural electrification for the next year and got an additional 60 000 000 for each of the two succeeding years in the same way the amendments to the bill we have just approved will enable us to electrify every farm home in america that is not already served with electricity just as soon as materials are again made available remember this is not a gift every dollar of this money will be paid back with interest and the extension of these lines to every farm house in america will make this the richest the brightest and the most desirable country on earth in which to live the tennessee valley authority has proved to be the greatest development of its kind in ancient or modern times to agree to an amendment of this kind now i am afraid would tend to hamper the operation of the t v a at a time when we are in the midst of the greatest war in history and when the tennessee valley authority is rendering the finest possible service in supplying energy to produce the necessary war materials if this provision to require these funds to be paid into the treasury of the united states is agreed to you will in my opinion deprive the t v a of that freedom of action which now enables it to make the greatest success of its kind in the world a few years ago we had a cyclone in mississippi the third greatest tornado in the history of this country which struck in the darkness of the night and devastated a large section of th country including the city of tupelo my home town the first assistance that came was from the tennessee valley authority they were there replacing lines and transformers and supplying electricity to the temporary hospitals by the time the news of the disaster had reached the rest of the country a day and a half later we had a telegram from t v a s chief competitor offering assistarce to do what the tennessee valley authority had already done the tennessee river is the one great stream in the country that is being properly developed the floods of that stream are now controlled and there is provided a 9fo t channel more than 650 miles long it is today producing 12 000 000 000 kilowatthours of electricity a year through energies that were actually going waste and wanton to the sea a few years ago to attempt now to handicap the t v a in this way might prove to be a disaster from which the authority would not soon recover i hope the pending amendment is voted down and that the policy now purxc 3 6 sued on the tennessee river may be extended to all other streams in america until we electrify the entire country and make it possible for

fruits and vegetables of the republican food study committee i have investigated the source of the above headlines and i have found tons and tons of food wasted and hoarded by foderal officials this year we lost 27 000 000 cases of canned fruits and vegetables due to delays and bungling of bureaucrats the government has held too much food from the civilian population and permitted it to spoil potatoes butter beans skim milk and rolled oats have been allowed to spoil to waste money is one thing and to waste food is another but money is much more easily replaced than food which takes a year to produce the hoarding and wasting of food is criminal farmers victory gardeners food processors and distributors have done a splendid job in the food effort notwithstanding the new deal handicaps placed upon them yet the sad fact remains we are losing millions of dollars worth of food that has been extremely difficult to produce the food situation in this country is one of our most important and perplexing problems it is my sincere conviction that a food investigation should be started immediately in order that we can be assured of having ample food for our armed forces our people on the home front and our associates in this war to bolster my accusation that food is being wasted i want to call your attenticn to a report from our caribbean area director of the war food administration

incident to its continuation i wish to call your attention to the fact that if we do not correct some of our domestic procedures we will not be in a position to furnish much food for leaselend we might do well to produce a sufficient amount of food to fulfill the needs of our armed forces and our own citizens this is especially true when we havent fed ourselves for many years you realize that for several years we have been on a foodimporting basis and the food imports have exceeded our exports by 1940 we were importing twice as much food as we exported now we are called upon to provide food for leaselend as well as to fulfill other food commitments today i have particular reference to what is taking place this very moment in connection with the canning industry representatives of the canning industry together with a policy group from the office of price administration appeared before the house agricultural committee last week after the hearings a conference was arranged whereby the canning people the 0 p a and theu s d a were to work out their differences i understand that up to this time the office of price administration still wants to dominate the situation and that the differences have not been eliminated these differences were first that the 0 p a and the department of agriculture had been dilatory in not arriving at the prices they would pay for the canning pack of 1943 the canners had been told what they must pay for their produce but they were not given any assurance as to what they would obtain for their pack second the fact that the 0 p a insisted on grade labeling this has been a controversial question for 20 years the canners showed where this innovation at this time would hinder their production third that the canners must accept a subsidy program regardless of whether or not they are in favor of such a program for one thing there is no use trying to justify any procedure which leaves an industry on march 9 without contracts for acreage that should have been signed up long ago the food program for 1943 is being jeopardized the 0 p a is in this case rendering what is one more example of its disservice to the war effort secondly the 0 p a s requirements for grade labeling appear to be an absolute violation of the letter of the law under which they operate i quote public law 421 seventyseventh congress second session h r 5990 chapter 26 section 2 subsection h the powers granted in this section shall not be used or made to operate to compel changes in the business practices cost practices or methods or means or aids to distribution established in any industry except to prevent circumvention or evasion of any regulation order price schedule or requirement under this act in public law seventyseventh congress second session h r 7565 chapter 578 to amend the emergency price control act of 1942 we find the following statement that in the fixing of maximum prices on products resulting from the processing of agricultural commodities including livestock a generally fair and equitable margin shall be allowed for such processing is there any member of this house who wants to stand up and say that the office of price administration is justified in insisting on grade labeling in the light of this quotation from the law if you cannot defend the 0 p a on this i ask the majority at this time why you do not curb this assumption of power whether grade labeling is desirable or not is a question that can be decided after the war this is the third month of this session we have the smith committee to investigate the bureaus which do not seem to be following the law here is a good opportunity for the smith committee to get the 0 p a under control before it ruins the chances of a maximum canning pack in 1943 the time is short we may not have time to bring in corrective legislation from the great banking and currency committee from which this legislation emanated but there is surely no reason why the smith committee cannot get into action and get this situation straightened out right now again i want to ask the majority how much longer are you going to let the 0 p a get away with this kind of a procedure some of this 0 p a outfit still act as if they are more interested in making america over than they are in furnishing the maximum food production which we need so much today they evidently intend to carry out their objectives regardless of the effect they may have on the canning pack of 1943 the office of price administration and the united states department of agriculture both seem to insist that the canners must have a subsidy as has been brought out before there is some question as to the letter of the law in regard to these funds there is no denying that most members of congress feel that the spirit of the law has not been followed by these agencies this is not the time for double talk small business and the canners are many small businesses receive little comfort in reading what this department or that department or this committee or that committee is doing for small business when they know full well what the 0 p a is doing to small business i think the time has come when we might well spend less time in telling about what is being done for small business and instead correct some of the things that are being done to small business which is evident to every one of us here every day here is the story then an industry an especially important industry as far as the food supply of 1943 is concerned has to come to a committee of this house to present its case in an effort to prevent an outfit like the 0 p a from putting two things over on them which are both questionable as far as the law itself is concerned mr edward n richmond of san jose calif mr harry cannon of bridgeville del and mr fred a stare of columbus wis who appeared before our committee during the hearings last week are three of the most impressive citizens who have ever appeared before the agricultural committee they made a splendid presentation of their problem they sounded like real americans trying to do a good job in an american way they sounded like men who were sincere and gave every indication of being men who were patriotic in their motives they were pleading for an opportunity to provide the food to win this war they were practical men with an evident comprehensive knowledge of the canning industry representatives from their districts can provide you with information as to their standing in their various states i had never seen any of them before but i want to frankly say that they impressed me as being men of very high business standing my interest is not only in the canning business my interest is also in the farmers who produce this food and in providing the necessary food to win this war in calling the attention of the majority to this situation at this time i repeat the time is short plantings and seedings are soon to take place if the majority does not remove the bottleneck which is largely the 0 p a they must assume the responsibility for this bungling they must assume the responsibility of not allowing one of the largest food industries in our country the opportunity of producing food for war leaselend and the consumers of our nation it is your responsibility and the question is once more what are you going to do about it this afternoon the gentlewoman from massachusetts and the gentleman from massachusetts have evidenced a very keen interest in the matter of food production i can well understand why they should do so you will find in the appendix of the record tomorrow statistics regarding the food production and consumption of each state looking over the list this morning i noticed that the state of massachusetts produces seventyfive onehundredths of 1 percent of the total amount of food produced in the united states and her population is over 3 percent of the total population of the united states in other words she produces about onefourth the food she consumes therefore the people of a state like massachusetts as dependent as it is upon food from the outside should certainly be interested in the matter of food production for themselves as well as for leaselend purposes and the other commit ments for food that we have made in other parts of the world"],

the confusion the crackpot plans and schemes of the starryeyed new deal dreamers should be brought to an end since 1938 the dies committee has turned up for the information of the public and the perusal by congress the records of many of the socalled crackpots on the federal pay roll that committee has also demonstrated that there are on the federal pay roll some who follow the communist party line on at least two former occasions congress directed that funds then being appropriated should not be used to pay named individuals nevertheless those two individuals later were found on another federal pay roll last monday chairman dirs of the committee gave to congress a list of 38 federal employees who were by the committee deemed unfit for public service nevertheless when the question of continuing to hire those individuals came before congress friday the administration was able to muster a majority of seven for their retention the argument was made by some who overlooked the real issue that congress should not try condemn and politically execute these individuals without a hearing those advancing the argument forgot that congress was not sitting as a trial court but as an employer the individuals named have no property right in the jobs which they hold and if in the judgment of the people their theories of government run counter to those held by the majority and proof of that proposition was given at the last election then certainly the congress which appropriates the money for the jobs has the right to say who shall hold those jobs or if it desires to abolish the jobs we may even end the agency in which they are employed congress may have overlooked the fact that the individuals sought to be separated from the public pay roll belonged to that group or advocate theories of government similar to those held by the group which for more than 2 years has been dissatisfied with our constitution our constitutional form of government and desires to remake america we have had some 6 years of the advancement of that theory by that particular political faction and it seems to some a little strange that a congress which was elected in spite of the opposition of that group and with a clearcut mandate to get rid of the bureaucrats the crackpots the communists and the new dealers should now hesitate to obey the instructions given it by the voters on november 3 last ever since election lame duck after lame duck wouldbe officeholders and officeholders rejected by the people have by this administration been placed in positions of power where they can perpetuate the very theories and practices repudiated last november the senate decreed that paving block flynn should not go upon the public pay roll are we to disregard the instructions of those who sent us here by continuing in public office in positions where they can make the policies and continue to issue orders against this that and the other those who were condemned by the voters is the will of the people who voted to end the new deal to be thwarted by the action of congress which furnished the money and then permits the new deal and the crackpots to continue in power that is a question which if not answered correctly now may end the political life of those who refuse not only to listen but to act are we so naive so silly that we will vote the money to continue in power those who not only sought to destroy this congress but who are still seeking that same end the issue is not whether the individuals named by the dies committee are communists or something else the issue is do the people want on the public pay rolls those new dealers those dreamers those bureaucrats those purgesmearers who have carried on as have those named by the dies committee this congress is sitting not as a trial court but as an employer a hiring and a firing agency charged with the expenditure of public money the taxlayers indicated in no uncertain terms that they had grown weary and wanted fired employees who held views similar to those of the 38 proof of that is found in the defeat of many a new dealer and in the election of some 69 new members of congress most of the 69

then the god might be a graven image today it may be either love of gold worship at the feet of international financiers or love of pomp and show desire to bask in the smile of some prince or king or queen to be knighted made a member of the british royalty there are those who having obtained freedom of speech freedom from fear freedom from want and freedom of religious worship here in this country and under our form of government now disavow all loyalty to the country which gives them the opportunity to leat prosper and be happy who seek to surrender our sovereignty make us a subject nation they are not america firsters they are america seconders or more accurately america lasters they think of their country only after and when they have thought of and promoted the interests of other countries other peoples because the article by shirer is so typical of the absurd stupidyes viciouspropaganda put out by the antiamericans let us take a glance at his story it is evident that the article was written before the return and report of the five senators who toured the war front evidently mr shirer was too tired to rewrite it to make it conform to the fact after their report their report substantiates in every particular the charges of those who are smeared because they place america first that report shows beyond argument that great britain is extending its commercial empire at our expense it shows that russia continues to deny us bases in the east from which we could get at japan it is apparent from that report that our nation is being stripped of its natural resources for the benefit of the british especially is this true with reference to oil mr shirer headed his article isolationist strategy a warning in time we all agree that war is wicked and wasteful he and those who agree with him then jump to the assumption that war can be prevented if we join with certain nations and fight a war to preserve the peace whenever some race or nation may refuse to obey the orders of the international group of which we are a member the fact that throughout history world alliances combinations of nations to preserve peace have not prevented war is blandly ignored the experience of the ages is brushed aside and egotistically it is proclaimed that we with great britain russia and china can accomplish that which no other group of nations has ever been able to bring about the america seconders would perform an international marriage ceremony giving us at least three husbands or wives when two of the three britain and russia through their spokesmen churchill and stalin have announced clearly and in all apparent sincerity that no international marriage shall interfere with the interest of either great britain or russia because mr shirer expresses so well the thought of those who wouldsurrender our sovereignty let me quote he writes as a people i think we have two weak spots in this regard we do not likethe idea of giving up an iota of our sovereignty to any world organization and we have an almost grotesque fear of being done in by slick allies especially the british and the russians read that again so dislike of giving up an iota of our sovereignty is a weakness is it suggest that thought to stalin or to churchill and the fear of being done in by slick allies especially the british and the russians is grotesque is it mr shirer when we remember how after the last war to the winning of which we contributed so much when we recall how our men went in when britain was on the verge of defeat and at the cost of their lives saved france and britain from defeat and how after the war was over in spite of our contributions of men and of money we were branded as a shylock is there any reason why we should not expect to again be done in when we recall that we were told that lendlease vould be reljaid to us in money or in kind and that it was but a loan and not a gift and now we learn that no reimbursement is to be made are we not being done in when we know as now we do that materials contributed by us to britain are being reexported by her to other countries as gifts from her not from us are we not being done in when we learn as we have learned that our money and our materials which our people are denying themselves are being used to build harbors and wharves and stock houses and factories and airfields in almost every land throughout the world and that those facilities will be used by our trade competitors after the war is over while we are denied their use are we not being done in so today the american manufacturers the american workingman who support this administration and ask a fourth term for f d r will awaken to the realization that the factories which we are building in foreign lands will be operated by cheap foreign labor and that the job of the american worker will be done in a foreign land while he seeks work on a government made job the export trade of the manufacturer will be lost to the factory operating abroad done in yes we are being done in and sold out by those who lack confidence in the american people in the american form of government in our constitution shirer writes that the people are at the mercy of a minority which he says may by legislative trickery and connivery defeat the will of the people then he called attention to the arguments which the socalled minority has used he writes listen for example to representative clare hoffman of michigan the fulbright resolution he said in the debate means but one thing that we repeal the declaration of independence 0 0 if we agree in setting up such international machinery we are to all intents and purposes surrenoering a portion of our national sovereignty 0 we shall not be masters of the situation a a we may find ourselves to our sorrow in the position of an australia new zealand or canadaa royal province back once more under the union jack instead of the stars and stripes a a is there any reason a why we shall be ashamed of the proposition that we are for america first a a a our forefathers brought forth the declaration of independence well may i ask mr shirer what is wrong with that argument it is largely a statement of fact the propaganda put out by world fellowship and federal union and the material which came to the desks of senators and congressmen on the 27th of january 1942 and the proposition which was endorsed by harold ickes and by justice owen j roberts called for the surrender of our independence a declaration of an interdependence it called for the hauling down of our flag and the substitution of another flag that program demanded that we surrender a part of our sovereignty that we join with other nations and abide by the joint decree of those nations now i ask mr shirer and any and all of those who agree with you on this move to enter into an international supergovernment what is wrong with the proposition that we stand for america first in view of the fact that stalin is for russia churchill for britain first tell me just why i should not be for america first continuing mr shirer writes today mr hoffman continues great britain is extending her commercial empire while we furnish the sinews of war and aid in financing her international trade does anyone with a knowledge of the facts today doubt that great britain is extending her commercial empire while we furnish the sinews of war and aid in financing her international trade if mr shirer does not know that fact let him read the statements of the three democratic senators of the two republican senators who just returned from a trip to the battle front then he refers to those who oppose a super world government of which we should be but a part the article gives this subhead they forget the yankee trader and under it is this paragraph the sequel is that if we get into an international organization we shall certainly lose our shirt if not our pants it seems to this writer that if these gentlemen had ever seen the shrewd yankee trader dealing with the slick europeans they would lose their weird and hardly justifiable inferiority complex or is it merely a good demagogic talking point which many americans our background being what it is easily fall for we do not need to get into the permanent international organization to be certain that we are not only losing our shirt but our pants and may i add mr shirer if we continue we will lose our shoes and socks and we will be lucky if our toenails are not pulled out i are you and your fellow advocates of america last so ignorant of the fact that you do not know that we are already on the paying end of the war take a trip out into the country and see the farmer who for example is unable to buy a wrench or a pair of pliers necessities on every farm and then finds in a catalog published in england that british manufacturers have both for export we know now from the reports of the returning senators that we are losing our pants as well as our shirts in our international deals we know now that our farmers are going without much of the machinery which is needed in the war effort while that machineryyes and complete factoriesis exported to other countries the yankee trader to whom mr shirer refers is but a myth if there is one in evidence today he will be found down in the smithsonian he has been succeeded by a harry hopkins by a henry wallace each bighearted and generous with other peoples money hopkins if he had his way would supervise at the expense of the american worker farmer and businessman a worldwide glorified w p a not only would he rake leaves put shoes on and feed everyone but he would set the hottentot and the bushman to sweeping up the waves of the ocean with paper brooms and pay them with american dollars wallace would be a little more practical he would give he first thought 1 quart but later reduced it to a pint a pint of milk to everyone everywhere he hasnt yet determined whether he would send it in glass orpaper containers or whether accompanying each pint to the tropical countries an electrical refrigerator with a power plant to keep it cool would go writes shlrer rpresentative hamilton fish who was in favor of the resolution spoke in the same vein the time has come said he for some of us at least to take an american view of our foreign policies that will be the propaganda line america first so you think mr shirer that the time has not come when some of us should take an american view of our foreign policy so you believe that this is not the time when we should pledge our loyalty first to america would you also do away with the pledge to the flag you think do you that it is not now time to save the constitution and the declaration of independence for the soldiers who will return apparently you have plenty of companyothers who would sell america short it is quite evident from the arguments made in the press and elsewhere that there are those who would remake as henry wallace 6dvocates america there are those who hope as tugwell said that we can destroy the american system of business and that the process may not be too bloody let me suggest to mr shirer and those who think with him that they go out into the highways and the byways into the small cities the towns the crossroads and there suggest to the businessmen to the farmers and to the workers who have sacrificed to aid in the prosecution of the war who have bought bonds who are struggling along as best they may to do their utmost in support of our fighting men that america does not come first that we are fighting the war for britain or for russia or for china let him suggest that we should not save the constitution that we should not adhere to the declaration of independence that the time has not arrived for us to take an american view of our foreign policy do that mr shirer or any of you who believe as he apparently does and then come back if you can and tell us of the reaction one more line from mr shirer he quotes william lemke as having said during the debate uncle sam is not going to be a perpetual santa claus they our returning troops will never substitute a mongrel flag for the stars and stripes and then shirer writes this those will be the beautiful words nicely wrapped up for the american people in red white and blue to disguise their enormous emptiness and meaninglessness so you believe do you mr shirer that the statement that our returning fighting men will never substitute a mongrel flag for the stars and stripes is empty and meaningless now you tell that to the boys who are about to take off in a bomber knowing full well that they may go down in flaming death or be cast adrift to die of hunger or of thirst on a blistering ocean you go down mr shirer to the boys who are fighting not only the japs but loneliness and sickness in the south sea islands and tell them that america the homeland does not come first you tell them that the statement that the stars and stripes shall not be hauled down doesnot mean anything you tell the warweary boys in africa in sicily in italy that the stars and stripes under which they fight is but a rag and is to be replaced by the flag of some international organization you go mr shirer to the mothers and the fathers the wives and the sweethearts of the men who are fighting this war and tell them that their sons and husbands and brothers are not fighting for home for fireside for america go if you will mr shirer into the homes which have received that little slip of paper telling that a loved one has been lost in battle or is missing in action and take with you instead of the stars and stripes which the house last week voted should be given to the parents of every man who lost his life in this war the mongrel flag referred to by the gentleman from north dakota william lemke to mr shirer and to all those who think so little of our liberty our independence our freedom our prosperity and the happiness which was ours before this war that they would subordinate our interests to the interests of other nations to a group of international bankers and power politicians who after each war have financed the rearmament of nations bent on war let me say that there are millions of americans who believe first in america who do not propose to be intimidated and that if need demands they will fight here at home to maintain our independence and our sovereignty millions of americans when they recite the pledge to the flag mean it they are for america first they believe in the america of today they believe in the america of tomorrow and they intend that down through the ages shall go an america willing in the future as in the past to help

disturbed about this matter of food particularly so as the few remarks i expect to make this afternoon will indicate why he should feel more than the average member of congress with the possible exception of the representatives from the state of iowa that this food problem is a real problem today i particularly wish to call attention to the fact that chicago is the food capital of the world the importance of food in its relation to war is receiving more attention each day in these days of particular interest in food production it is well worth our attention to realize where the great bulk of the food of our country is really produced a few states surrounding chicago contribute a very large percentage of the food of our nation official reports of the bureau of agricultural economics of the united states department of agriculture which i have studied show that in 1941 iowa minnesota wisconsin illinois and michigan furnished over onethird of the milk produced in our country minnesota iowa and wisconsin produced over 42 percent of the creamery butter wisconsin illinois and indiana produced over 62 percent of the american cheese of the nation and wisconsin alone produced over 11 percent of the milk of the nation iowa illinois indiana and minnesota produced over 53 percent of the pork of the nation and iowa alone produced over 20 percent of this pork illinois minnesota iowa missouri kansas and nebraska produced over 36 percent of the beef and veal of the nation and iowa alone produced nearly onetenth of the nations supply illinois iowa minnesota missouri and ohio produced over 25 percent of the chickens and over 28 percent of the eggs of the nation illinois and iowa alone sell over 55 percent of the corn that goes into manufactured corn products and produce practically onethird of the corn in bushels grown in the entire nation kansas and north dakota produce over onethird the wheat of the nation and ohio indiana illinois and south dakota produce an additional 15 percent of the national production illinois and iowa produce nearly a third of the oats and minnesota north dakota and nebraska produce over onethird of the barley of the united states minnesota iowa and north dakota produce over 70 percent of the flax of the country and minnesota alone produces over 47 percent of the flax of the nation illinois alone produced 46 percent of the soybeans and with iowa indiana and ohio produced over 87 percent of the soybeans of the nation as to farm income iowa from sales from farms is 7 90 percent illinois is 6 17 percent minnesota is 4 54 percent ohio 3 86 percent or a total of 22 47 percent in these four states with iowa alone representing nearly onetwelfth of the farm income of the nation iowa though only 56 147 square miles in area in comparison with other states with over 250 000 square miles has the largest sales from farms of any state in the nation when you realize that this one state has only 20 000 000 acres of cropland out of the total 341 000 000 acres in the united states the importance of this one state in food production is readily appreciated my purpose in calling your attention to the facts are twofold first if food is to be produced to feed our armed forces to feed ourselves which we have not done for many years to furnish food to fulfill our leaselend commitments and to feed those falling behind our lines as well as occupied countries we must get this accomplished where they have the land and the productive and fertile soil to accomplish it if we want coal we go to the coalproducing areas and if we want food we must recognize the areas that can produce it second in talking of manpower transportation farm machinery equipment and other requisites for more production we must appreciate the area that can furnish the production we cannot let any productive acres lie idle we must provide the priorities necessary to make these acres produce their maximum or we will not provide the amounts of food that must be produced the great midwest with the greatest area of rich fertile and productive land in the world is the focd hope of this same world today many states do not produce enough food for their own populations the midwest has never in history had the agricultural responsibility it has today since iowa alone is reputed to have 25 percent of the a no 1 farm land in america you can readily see that a rather large percentage of the best land in america is within confines of this area chicago can most assuredly be termed the food capital of the world"],

trust that the rollbackers will note that the farm women of america are actually working together with their children as never before in their lives to provide this needed food i also hope that they realize that these farm people are carrying on this great work with only 40 percent of them having electric lights in their homes and with only 1 out of 10 of them with modern conveniences in their homes i wish that my colleague from pennsylvania wbuld ask his audiences how many of them in each audience have electric lights and bath tubs in their homes and what their daily income is at this time and find out how far it is from 2 71 per day my good friend and colleague the gentleman from texas often asks for a better plan than the rollback subsidies but i have never noted that he yielded long enough to have the question answered it is surely difficult to unscramble a scrambled egg when so many insist on further scrambling however at this time i wish to make a few suggestions to the professional rollback subsidy advocates if this group is really interested in providing food at a reasonable price to the lowincome groups why do they not support legislation like the herteraiken bill which revives the stamp plan to provide this food if this group wants to do something really constructive why do they not bring their pressure to bear on the 0 p a and ask this agency how much longer they are going to let the man with the price obtain cream without points and make the average citizen pay 5 points for cottage cheese made from the skim milk they could find out how much longer the 0 p a is going to allow cream to go pointfree so that the man with the price can secure all he pleases from which to make butter and yet compel the average citizen to pay 16 points for butter made from the same cream third how much longer is this group going to allow the 0 p a to knowingly or unknowingly protect the oleo interests by not putting a ceiling on oleo the rollback subsidy group are making a big hue and cry about rolling back the price of butter 5 cents a pound or with at the most forty to fifty million dollars a year subsidy yet they see the 0 p a without protest allow the oleo interests to sell this product for from 17 to 29 cents a pound if the price of oleo were rolled back to what some of it is being sold for and squeeze out some of this 12 cents a pound it would represent a saving of part of this 72 000 000 annually on the 600 000 000 pounds plus of oleo that are being manufactured this year the rollback subsidy group could easily show the 0 p a that they already have a ceiling of 11 cents plus on soybean oil 13 cents plus on cottonseed oil 13 cents plus on peanut oil 12 2 to 1412 cents per pound on powdered skim or 11 2 cents per pound on skim milk in fluid form and since the oleo institute shows that these products make up a large percentage of the ingredients of oleo there should not be much difficulty in arriving at a ceiling price for this product in other words although some oleo is being sold at 17 cents a pound other oleo is being sold for 29 cents a pound and the subsidy group up to this time has made no effort to protect the consumers of america so far as this product is concerned however they do insist in all their righteousness that it is imperative to roll back the dairy farmers prices where in 1942 the laborer has been receiving 34 cents or less per hour for labor that goes into his product and why i note in the 1942 production of oleomargarine that they used 74 000 000 pounds of skim milk although they call it milk at the 0 p a ceiling price this would be not over 11 2 cents a pound as long as this is being sold as an ingredient of oleo at 1729 cents a pound it would seem on the face of it that this was a rather large margin that might need attention before the rollbackers start on people who are receiving 34 cents an hour for their labor in 1942 why do not the protectors of the consumer question the advisability of asking the 0 p a to check up a little on the filled milk that is being manufactured at this time if they are really interested in the welfare of the consumer of this country why do not they find out why filled milk is being sold without a ceiling price and without any points and being sold also at a price equal to the regular evaporated milk that is made from normal milk of course when they find this out from the 0 p a they can also find out why the war production board allocated 7 600 tons of tin plate in the last 2 years to this filled milk industry when it has been very difficult even to get enough tin to repair a vat in a corner cheese factory in wisconsin it is surprising to read in the milwaukee journal recently an article with a headline milk picture turning sour is it so surprising when you see an organized group trying to roll back the dairy group where the selected individuals of the dairy industry are on a 34centperhour basis there is one more situation that i would like to call to the attention of the rollbackers at this time at wisconsins largest livestock market day after day 100pound pigs are selling for 8 cents a pound i receive the market prices as issued of course you all know that the parity price of hogs is 12 cents per pound at this time and that the parity does not apply to just the 200 to 270pound hogs which have support prices when the support price was announced too much emphasis was not put on the weights for which the support price was made now if this group is interested in providing food for all why do they not ask the 0 p a to remove ration points on pork for 60 days so that the average citizen can secure and process these hogs that are selling for so much less than even the support price it has been demonstrated that the man with the price will get his product regardless but here is an opportunity to provide cheaper meat to the great majority of our people now let us get a few things here straight from the shoulder i was home the same as most of you this summer i spent every possible minute with the groups of my district i tried to obtain the facts and i tried to give the facts these groups included the a a a service clubs county agents f s a auto dealers p c a labor delegations cheese makers bankers the farm bureau feed dealers newspaper editors granges and groups interested in social service what were the outstanding impressions i obtained one was that this war is a serious business to these people with practically everyone having a blood relative in the armed service second was the fact that at no meeting was there any mention made about prices and vays of getting rich out of this war the whole approach was on the basis of how best they could increase the food production in 1944 and how best these other groups could carry their part of the load in furnishing the services incident to the foodproduction program they realized that they had a duty to perform and that in addition to the normal desire to produce it was now the patriotic desire to produce in order to furnish the food for their sons and daughters in the armed forces of our country when you realize that the rural people of our country although only about 25 percent of the population raise toward half the children of the country you can appreciate how these producers of food have a very personal interest in producing it these people know that they are receiving from 6 to 2 cents less per pound for cheese than the producers in other states they know of other injustices that have been accorded them but the overall objective of furnishing food to win the war overshadows any of their personal grievances these rural people show the strain of these 2 years of increased food production and it irks me to hear people who have never done a real days work in their lives complaining about the 34 cents per hour this group receives at this time when i returned to washington what did i hear the same old story price price price for 9 months we have been hearing about the wonders of the rollback subsidies two food czars have passed out of the picture no doubt because they did not see that the vote crop should have preference over the food crop we now have marvin jones trying to bring these forces together he is pleading with congress today to come to some decision on this subsidy program so that he can set up a food program for 1944 it would not embarrass me to support a rollback subsidy program if they could be used to increase food production but they have not and if anyone thinks they have i shall be glad to yield for him to so state at this time and show where they have we rolled back the price of butter last june and the production each month has gone down below the year previous and in october the production of creamery butter was the lowest of any month since the records were kept by the united states department of agriculture in fact i really have a sympathetic feeling for the professional subsidy rollbackers in the large they represent the new deal part of the administration it must be humiliating to them to make the two public confessions to the people of america that this rollback subsidy issue presents first these rollbackers are telling the nation that after 11 years of complete control of congress after seeing the peo ple with the highest individual as well as the highest national income as a result of the war that the country has ever hadthat the people cannot pay for the food they eat although this food represents 6nly 20 percent of the cost of living it is surely a humiliating admission for this group to make second these rollback advocates are publicly announcing to the farm people of america and in no unspeakable terms that although parity is a splendid word to talk about and when the individuals and the nation have the greatest income in the history of the country the palace guard that is directing the agricultural department cannot even provide the parity for the farmers of the country in fact it has not been provided even when the law said it should nor of couise has the cost of farm labor been included in arriving at the parities that have been allowed to prevail i well realize the cheap politics involved in this issue the antirollbackers must face this situation if food goes up me antirollbackers will receive the criticism and the blame right here and now i want the subsidy rollbackers to understand also the other situation that is when the people go to the market place and cannot find the food for their families they will also know who to blame and can put it on the doorstep of the cheap politics involved in the rollback subsidies where producers receiving 34 cents an hour for their labor are the victims of the rollback a further situation which i wish to call to the attention of the rollbackers is that by following their leadership a 30percent payroll tax can result and a sales tax can be imposed on the people of this country in addition to the present taxes so i say let us unite to roll up production of food and give little heed to the professional rollbackers who are trying to roll back a group of our society which is making a contribution that the rural people of america have made are making and will continue to make regardless of all the fake false and unfair propaganda that emanates from washington marvin jones is right in asking that this question be settled once and for all we should give him this support we owe this to the armed forces of our country we owe this to the people of our country

of it will have to be done a shortage of funds might be disastrous consequently i see no reason why we should stop working for a deficiency appropriation if the money is not needed it will not be expended it would be too bad to run into a long siege of pumping and have to stop in the middle of the season for lack of funds still having plenty of money in the bank yours truly"],

unjustified in the effort to defeat the proposal that has been made by the offering of the dingell bill the interest of some has led them to give expression to thoughts that are not justified from the standpoint of the bill or from the standpoint of the purpose of those who have been interested in offering it frequently reference has been made that it is the result of deliberation of longhaired boys and their theories or it is the work of crackpots i want to say to you that the members of this house who joined together in an effort to produce a worthwhile piece of legislation upon this important subject are not to be described in that manner those who joined with them were representatives of the american federation of labor the c i 0 the railroad brotherhoods and representatives from different departments of our government who have had intimate contact with this problem over a period of years and whose judgment has been accepted in this house on more than one occasion none of these are of the longhair or crackpot type we sought to produce a bill that would be entitled to receive the support of this house we believe the dingell substitute bill to be sound logical and worth while now on the larger question namely the matter of sufficiency of benefits let me bring to your attention the fact that the necessity of increased unemployment benefits has had the support and approval of leading men of business agriculture and labor in a joint statement on social security issued by the national planning association and signed by representatives of agriculture business and labor 17 representatives of business joined in a statement which included the following criticism of the existing state laws the unemployment insurance system should also be amended so as to raise the level of benefits and to provide benefits for dependents and to protect workers who worked in more than one state during their eligibility period from impairment of benefit rights unemployment insurance is capable of making a major contribution to the stability of the economyand get these further wordsduring the inevitable displacements that will accompany the conversion of industry to peace but to do this certain amendments are necessary among the businessmen who signed the above statement were men representing the general electric co the johnsmanville co the bankers trust co of new york swift co and the aluminum co of america the men representing those companies are not radicals they are not what you call crackpots they are not what you call longhaired boys they know that adequate liberal employment insurance benefits are necessary to assure business a good market they boldly state that the level of benefits is inadequate both in amount and duration and that it is necessary to make some special provision to supplement at federal expense the existing system of unemployment insurance during the process of reconversion another one who has made a statement that has a direct and important bearing on this subject was former supreme court justice james f byrnes no one would say that he was a crackpot no one looks upon him as a longhaired boy or a radical what did he say existing state employment insurance laws were framed to meet local conditions of tcmporaryunemployment and are not adequate to deal with the nationwide problem of reemployment demobilization must be regarded as a national problem and its cost as a part of the cost of the war state unemployment insurance plans should be supplemented by federal support to the extent necessary to give practically all workers during the transition from war to peace suitable unemployment benefits similar opinions have been expressed by mr altmeyer chairman of the social security board and m ir latimer chairman of the railroad retirement board they have made similar statements as to the inadequacy of the state unemploymentcompensation laws this congress has placed itself on record in the q i bill by supplementing state employment compensation by a federalized system providing larger amounts than would otherwise have been received national commander atherton testifying on the subject stated that this congress was right in making such a provision it illustrates that congress recognizes the insufficiency as to amount and time of duration of state unemploymentcompensation benefits the unemployment problem can be of tremendous importance during the reconversion period we must be prepared to deal with it in a realistic way if it should occur only in this way can we prevent fear arising in the hearts of our workers as to their future security we will need confidence to a high degree in the uncertain period that lies ahead in conclusion i want to bring to your attention a quotation from a report made by the new york joint legislative committee on industrial and labor conditions this report was made ia 1943 the report in its conclusion said the benefit provisions of the state laws cannot be said to be adequate to meet fully the needs that will arise if unemployment succeeds the cessation of hostilities it does not seem possible that in the remaining time before the war ends most state unemployment compensation laws will be sufficiently extended and improved to intensify sufficiently the degree of protection against widespread unemployment the search for a solution to the problem must therefore proceed in other directions the above reference to other directions must mean federal legislation there is no other place to go the dingell bill seeks to provide a solution in the manner the abovementioned report indicated namely by federal legislation today this house faces a great responsibilitythe passage of the ways and means committee bill will prove too little and too late in meeting the situation in the event we are faced with a great unemployment problem due to the transition from war production to peacetime production the dingell bill provides a solution that will give heart courage and a feeling of security to every worker i appeal to the membership of the house to give approval to it"]], "top_unsure": [[1.093745231628418e-05,

roads and trails is one of the most important appropriations that the congress is called upon to make and i say that from 50 years experieace in living in the forest lands of the undeveloped sections of the west when i read this appropriation for forest roads and trails it is quite apparent to me that the forest service has received more consideration than the f s a or when it comes to other appropriations on page 49 under the paragraph for white pine blister rust control we find an appropriation there including employment of persons and means in the district of columbia and elsewhere amounting to 1 900 000 on page 55 still applied to the district of columbia with other items we find an appropriation of 12 826 826 on page 57 the amount for expenditure in the district of columbia and elsewhere the appropriation amounts to 646 168 then it is all boiled down into personnel on page 59 in all salaries and expenses 15 646 074 and from there going on down to page 65 it says not to exceed 886 034 may be expended in the district of columbia then they come down to this important item of forest roads and trails with a little appropriation cut to 2 537 168 for forest roads and trails and on the next line above not to exceed 59 500 for personal services in the district of columbia fiftynine thousand dollars to administer 2 500 000 from the district of columbia is not that a fine system i wonder if the gentleman from new york was not correct when he said that the forest service had a propaganda machine in the moving pictures the forest service is the best propagandized organization in these united states working for the government and do not make any mistake about that and here we have buried in the undeveloped sections of idaho in the district that i have the honor to represent one of the greatest mineralized sections in the united states with minerals of all kinds all needed in the war effort locked up in the mountain fastness with no access roads and i have been here for 10 years fighting with the forest service to get them to spend a little money to be used to build forest roads and trails and to open up that country and when they do build a road where do they built it on the highest summits they can findskyline drives if you please inaccessible for 6 months of the year covered with snow i have gone up to the appropriations committee here and in the senate time after time asked for an increase in this item to open up our mineralsminerals needed today to support our war effortminerals while our government is going out into australia and into canada and south america and spending money like a drunken sailor to get strategic metals when we have all this at home do i get any sympathy or help from the forest service i say no and i can show you from letters in my files where that when i asked for a road to some particular mine that is already equipped with a mill ready to get to work and go into production when an access road is built and they tell me it is a primitive area and that a road cannot be built in there a primitive area why congress does not make primitive areas nor has the president of the united states set up these inaccessible areas they are established by the forest service a bunch of bureaucrats bureaucrats that are restraining the development of the united states in no small way this forest service needs investigation and i do not mean maybe recently the bureau of mines went back into the national forest and took diamond drills in there to explore for antimony and found tungstentungsten one of the most strategic metals we need today tungsten that costs 2 a pound tungsten that comes from china bottled up by a hostile fleet when all the time we had these metals right in idaho locked up waiting for a more liberal policy of our government departmentsdepartments that have complete control of the mountainous region in which these vast undeveloped mineral resources are located few people penetrate the inaccessible regions of idahoand the forest service discourages the prospector in every way it canas the records of the office of the first congressional district will show"]]}
