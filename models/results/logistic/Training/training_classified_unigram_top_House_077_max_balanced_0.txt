amount of money how are we going to pay the bill i do not know we will pay it however and we will have to raise the money from the taxpayers of america but i believe my fellow americansand i address

going to have to put up i do not know if you can tell me when the war will end and how it will end and what will be involved i might be able to give a guess but i do not know i do knowthat is i am convinced in my own mindthat unless we take this action we will most surely find the day coming when our own country will have to meet the dictators and perhaps meet them alone seven billion dollars in this bill and we will recall that in the public law no 11 of the seventyseventh congress we authorized the president of the united states to transfer to any of these countries not exceeding in value 1 300 000 000 of materiel which had already been procured out of previous appropriations for the american army or navy i want to stop for just a moment to comment on that because i find it is a matter about which we may easily become confused you will recall that in public law 11 there was inserted a provision that the president of the united states if it were found that there were ordnance guns materiel whatever might be needed might have the right after consulting with the army and the navy out of articles that had already been appropriated for by the congress for our own defense to transfer such articles under such terms and conditions as might seem appropriate and upon such arrangements as to reimbursement from other countries as he might be able to obtain in value not exceeding a total of 1 300 000 000 the present 7 000 000 000 combined with that provision in public law 11 would make it possible to have a top total of 8 300 000 000 provided the president exercised the right which he has under the law to transfer the full amount of 1 300 000 000 and to use the full amount of 7 000 000 000 in this bill we have written into this bill a provision section 2 to the effect that the president may when he transfers any of these articles under the 1 300 000 000 limit to other governments from our own defense stores reimburse those agencies from which those materials are transferred from this 7 000 000 000 fund therefore we have a bottom of 5 700 000 000 that may be used under this bill if the president should transfer 1 300 000 000 and reimburse all of it out of the money of this bill or we have a top of 8 300 000 000 if none of these funds is used to reimburse now why put up all the money at once why would it not be satisfactory to do as we have often done give a part of the money now and contractual authority for the rest of it i can cite several reasons which i think are convincing on that point in the first place to put 7 000 000 000 down on the barrelhead in cold cash will carry a message to certain people that they will understand very much better and very much more effectively than they will understand the speeches that you and i make about the subject in the second place to put up all the money in cash gives a certain flexibility to the program that could not be had if you give a part of it in cash and part of it in contractual authorizations this is a changing procedure today great britain may need airplanes to morrow she may need tanks the day after that it may be something else speed and flexibility are the keynotes of

interested in one thing above all others and that is the happiness and welfare of the american people now and in the future our course in foreign affairs has been pretty well indicated we passed the repeal of the arms embargo and we passed it because we felt that our first attitude of withdrawing into our shell and saying this is a backroom brawl over there something that does not concern us was in error we passed that repeal and the record shows we passed it in order to help those who were resisting aggression having voted for that bill having voted for the leaselend bill having voted for the rest of this foreign policy upon the premise of selfdefense for america america meeting its destiny manfully and courageously i believe those votes were right i think the passage of the arms embargo for instance has given us time to arm and defend ourselves in my opinion if we had not passed the repeal of the arms embargo england would have been down today there would have been no one to resist aggression if we had not given aid no one but this country alone and unaided in a totalitarian world i say to you that the attitude that i have adopted with reference to what is best for the welfare and happiness of the american people is that we want to maintain and improve our democracy at home we also wish to indicate to the world that we the american people want to do something to preserve peace and the manner in which we want to do that is as follows when an aggressor nation arises we want to indicate our desire to maintain peace in the world by cutting off communications with that aggressor and by sending to the victim aid and succor in the form of materials that i believe is what we should do today and that i believe is the destiny of america in the years to come why have i resolved my doubts in favor of supporting repeal of this neutrality law what is the necessity for it the necessity for it is this we have come to a time when the giving of did to those nations resisting aggression must be made effective all over the world are men and women shackled and living in bondage and in slavery their voices are mute but their hearts still beat for the love of liberty and freedom we have raised the star of hope before them we can keep it glowing brightly today or we can dim it and forever crush their hopes we cannot shackle ourselves with this neutrality act as the act now reads the president establishes combat and danger zones where where the most danger exists under the present law he would have to change the combat zones every 2 days for example most of the sinkings have taken place off the coast of africa this means that he should declare a combat zone off the coast of africa even though it is not near the belligerent nations tomorrow another danger zone is created by hitler aside from the propriety of hitler establishing where we can go and when we cannot there would be so much confusion that we could not effectively ship goods not knowing where danger or combat zones were from day to day at the present time i believe the american people are in favor of convoying goods it was the implications of this thing rather than the thing itself that gave me doubts would it be used as a springboard to war having once voted here would we have left the springboard if so all that will be heard hereafter will be the resultant splash into war however i do not believe that is so i have faith and confidence now that it is not so why even if this congress were to command the president tomorrow to send troops into europe he could not do so why because we have passed a law which forbids the sending of draftees or selectees outside the western hemisphere i believe the desire and the wish on the part of the president is the same as the desire and the wish on the part of the american people to give material aid to see that the goods get there but not to send an expeditionary force not to send an a e f not to have again a the yanks are coming policy the present aid we are giving is ineffective perhaps i should not say it is ineffective but it is inefficient at the present time we convoy as far as iceland then the british take over from iceland we convoy 2 600 miles from boston or new york to iceland there is a scant 600 miles beyond that to the british isles ships cannot meet there at sea on any timetable basis you cannot use radio facilities due to the fact that there are lurking submarines in the vicinity they cannot meet like two men keeping an appointment there are resultant delays amounting to days at times between the british convoys and the american convoys the merchant vessels and our destroyers waiting there are a prey to german submarines but what lies beyond you could convoy to the british isles one operation would of course be vastly more effective and the elimination of the delay now caused in iceland would mean that the danger of sinkings and of increased loss of life would not be materially greater i believe we have made up our minds to give the victims of the aggressor nations material aid and support i believe the russians are putting up a good fight further i have no truck with the argument that the british are not doing a good job after all they want to win the war we may find fault with this maneuver or that maneuver or the lack of one but the british want to win the war theirs is the decision that must be made and made not as coolly and calmly as we can make it ourselves they are fighting in selfdefense their homes are being bombed their children are being killed and they want to win the war

part of many has inclined them to accept what is rather than risk what might be the first large international business crisis occurred in 1847 the second republic of france in 1848 as a result of this catastrophe laid down certain principles relating the state to the problem of unemployment as follows the government of the french republic pledges itself to guarantee the livelihood of the worker by labor it pledges itself to guarantee work for all citzens in its machinery to realize these ideals it resorted to drastic steps that were impractical and visionary since that pronouncement the united states until the roosevelt administration came to power has shied away from attempting in any sensible way to alleviate unemployment the laissezfaire advocates always insisted that with free enterprise permitted to function without government interference there would be no appreciable unemployment we had an era from 1920 to 1930 that found the investing public subscribing lavishly to corporation shares with a government that looked kindly on business good or bad and yet out of this period of laissezfaire we inherited the greatest mass unemployment in our history since publicworks programs have been criticized as an answer to unemployment let me read you another approach that was once but no longer pursued in ohio to solve the problem the ohio state archaeological and

and the remainder at the expiration of the year we now send such persons to the work projects administration for the opportunity of honest employment after a hundred years of national neglect of this problem the democratic party in its platform of 1936 adopted in spirit the philosophy of the french republic of 1848 when it declared we belleve that unemployment is a national problem and that it is

erosion so the service was set up and they started here is what they do under the soil conservation service they go out to a farm and they find that by poor crop practice the fertility of the soil has been destroyed then they let a piece of land lay out then the ravages of washes start through it little trickling gullies are started year after year the water rushing down these little rivulets that start as a stream no larger than your finger finally they have washed out great gorges and ditches in the land to the point where that land had to be taken out of production it would produce nothing they found varied degrees of that it was under this service the farmers were taught to farm on the contour to plow around a mountain instead of up and down it taught how to plant grasses and leguminous crops that would give back life to the soil and productivity to the soil five years ago if you had flown over this country you would have seen millions of acres of the united states washed to the bone now if you will fly over it there is not a large section of the united states where you will not find direct benefit of the soilconservation activities where contours and welllaidout farms stand as everlasting evidence tothe wonderful work done under the direction of this department on every farm where soilconservation practices have been followed under the direction of this department the productivity of the soil has been increased from a very small percentage to a thousand percent you talk about cutting this out as a nonessential item one distinguished member of this committee said a moment ago that we had to cut this sort of items in order to spend money for the national defense in the name of common sense this is the very basis not only of national defense but of national livelihood to stop a thing which is causing more foodstuff and more grain to be produced in this country to feed the armies and the navies anc the populace than aill other single thing is to be ridiculous if you strike at that you strike at the very basic fundamental thing which goes away beyond national defense and means literally the lifeblood of this nation i am sure that you thinking men

pearl harbor this house passed a bill which had for its purpose the stopping of strikes in defense industries and sent it over to the other body where apparently it has been placed on ice and received the kiss of death like a good many of my colleagues i am in receipt of thousands of letters and telegrams demanding that mr knudsen and mr nelson be supported in their efforts to abolish the 40hourweek law and stoppage of all strikes or walkouts of any kind for the duration of the war and that production be put on a 24hoursperday and 7daysperweek basis so far as i know neither mr nelson nor mr knudsen have done very much toward stopping strikes in defense plants or recommending suspension of the provisons of the wageandhour law for the duration of the emergency possibly the reason is their chief does not approve i agree wholeheartedly with the objectives of these telegrams and letters and have consistently voted that way one nod of approval from the president and i am sure that the bill which we passed even before pearl harbor would be lifted from its sleeping quarters in the other body and passed immediately they ought to do it without nod but apparently they do not intend to do so i do not blame the people for being aroused and alarmed but let those who are responsible for this situation accept that responsibility as for my part i am ready to act and act speedily and

it is such language that i myself was not willing to have it included in an amendment i would offer because when you come to examine it without criticism of anybody you will observe that it does not mean anything it is only required that the matter be talked over with the attorney general even though he might disapprove the thing under the language proposed the determination of the chairman of the war production board would be jconclusive the attorney general would be in the language of the bill without any power whatever the chairman of the war production board would have to consult the attorney general before he could act but he could act with equal freedom whether the attorney general approved or disapproved from the standpoint of power allocation administratiye difficulties of
