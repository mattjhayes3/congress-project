that are becoming so prevalent in washington here is a chance to stop one of them this is a provision to create a board of 28 members to draw 10 000 per year for a term of 10 years you may say that it provides for only from 7 to 28 but it will be 28 and you know it as well as i do just as sure as i am standing here there will be 28 members of this board appointed by the president for a term of 10 years drawing a salary of 10 000 a year each or 2 500 a year more than a congressman or a senator and drawing 2 500 a year more than a federal judge who tries these cases in their finality now is the time to stop this you have the opportunity here to stop it this is the time and the place and the occasion to stop it if you want to stop it it is just a question of what you want to do i am not going to vote to establish anothernew board or bureau i am going to vote so far as my one vote is concerned against every new board and every new bureau proposed the time has come to stop it your president even a republican presidenthere the other day called the attention of the country to the fact that this wasteful appropriation of public money must stop that these added expenses of the government must stop was he talking merely for political effect government expenses are accumulating fast year after year and something must be done to stop it it wont stop unless we stop it here these unnecessary bureaus are brought about and constituted and created in just such bills as the one you have before you now and under just such provocation some administration secretary demands it and congress passes it we are given a few minutes only to consider it before we must vote on it and of course it always passes the committee is in favor of it and there are not enough of us organized to beat it the committee summons its cohorts and outvotes us such new creations are put in bills of this kind by the committee in one fell swoop it provides 28 new 10 000 jobs better than our own because they are appointed for 10 years the committee fights for it and fights against every man who opposes it the committee passes it it becomes law and the money to pay the bill is then taken out of the peoples treasury and it has to be made up in taxes taken from your constituents and mine and i appeal to my colleagues to stop it now this is to be another extravagant expensive board it means a lot of extra taxes to be taken out of the peoples pockets it means a lot of extra waste and expense we can handle this proposition without creating these 28 new 10 000 job holders i will tell you what will happen in connection with it you will note from the provisions of the bill that this board of twentyeight 10 000 per year members may sit all over the united states and rent quarters and in addition to having their transportation paid shall receive 10 per day extra for their subsistence and that all of their employees are to teceive their transportation and in addition to their salaries are to receive 7 per day extra for their subsistence these are to be 28 unusually swell jobs that this committee is creating and it is going to be a greater scandal to the nation than the expensive shipping board which at one time was paying out for rented buildings alone 558 000 per year until we forced it to occupy vacant space existing in governmentowned buildings more than sufficient to house it note subparagraph g g the secretary shall furnish the board with such dlerical assistance quarters stationery furniture office equipment and other supplies as may be necessary for the efficient execution of the functions vested in it by this section why does the committee giv e this unlimited unrestricted power to the secretary of the treasury he could appoint a whole army of employees and like the shipping board does pay them salaries ranging up to 20 000 per year under the terms of this mellon bill reported by the committee to us for passage and you colleagues are doing it with your eyes open it is by your vote that this unlimited power is to be given can you properly explain your action to your constituents i can not if i vote for such rldiculous propositions and i will uot vote for it when you create this board of 28 men drawing 10 000 a year apiece for 10year terms the secretary of the treasury is going to furnish every one of them with a highpriced secretary you know that as well as i do he is going to furnish every one of them with a highpriced stenographer you know that as well as i do and he will furnish each one of them with a special janitor and a special messenger and a fellow to sit out in front of the door to tell people that they will have to wait their turn you are going to have a whole army of extra employees on the federal pay roll as a natural sequence to this piece of legislation i appeal to you colleagues to stand up and stop it and let us strike out this unneeded board i appeal to the gentleman from iowa not to allow this thing to go through i appeal to the gentleman from illinois who il some instances has made a fight for retrenchnat i say now mr madden come on and hielp defeat this proposition and save the peoples money what are you going to do about it i ask the gentlemen from pennsylvania what are you going to do about the petition of 350 000 farmers that you brought in here the other day and which occupied so much floor space demanding that we retrench expenses what are you going to do concerning their demand that your administration stop this unnecessary expense and sfop raising salaries are you going to ignore them are you going to let these 28 men go on the pay roll by establishing by this bill 28 new offices at 10 000 each appointed for 10year terms i appeal to the gentleman from ohio the leader of the house to stop it he ought to do it in behalf of the taxpayers of the country if this new board were needed it would be another matter but it is not needed look at the great army of special highsalaried employees you have permitted the attorney general to keep on the pay roll down in the department of justice and nothing has been accomplished by it whenever you want a criminal prosecuted you have to pass a special resolution appropriating an additional 100 000 to employ special attorneys to do it the people will not get any better service or any quicker adjudication of their tax matters after you create this board it has to do only with appeals and appeals are now handled in a most efficient manner when we push them to action and they would have to be pushed to action before this board its creation will not expedite the final decision in a single case why only a few days ago one of my constituents was overassessed nearly 20 000 and they were threatening to levy upon his property to collect it having decided his appeal against him he came up here obtained a hearing immediately placed his case and his books before the department and his claim was allowed without his having to get an attorney and ie saved nearly 20 000 the press states that president coolidge is demanding retrenchment while secretary mellon is demanding this extravagant expansion i imagine that our constituents at home are going to hold each one of us responsible for just what each one of us does with our vote and we can not excuse ourselves by saying that secretary mellon demanded it we are responsible not to mr secretary mellon but to our people and i am going to vote as i know the people of my district and of the united states demandfor retrenchment"], [0.01391578745096922,

enlistment was first conceived it was thought that we would enlist solely noncommissioned officers but it seems advisable to enlist such good material as is available with a view to development into noncommissioned officers and subsequently into commissioned officers the gentleman from new york the gentlenman from massachusetts the gentleman from alabama and the gentleman from alabama mr hill1 and many other members appeared before the subcommittee urging adequate appropriations for the reserve corps i also appeared on january 21 1924 and what i said then applies equally today because of certain matters i then took up i will invite your attention to what i then said i do not think there is any man in the coumtry who is more deeply interested earnestly and from a practical point of view in the development and the proper development of the reserve corps than the chairman of this subcommittee mr anthony i am here today to say only a word and i come before the committee with a great deal of diffidence because i feel the committee is working on this matter from a point of view that we are all interested in i only come to present for the consideration of the committee the question of the amount of field training for the reserve organizations and officers and i venture to do this because of some practical personal experience in reference to some of the reserve units and reserve problems there are at the present time 64 500 reserve officers of these officers 63 000 are either attached or assigned to various units which units are component parts of the six field armies providing for 2 000 000 men to be immediately trained in case of emergency experience in the last war showed that if we had a training organization or a more or less definite regimental organization or other unitary organization it was a very simple matter to train the men in a comparatively short time during the past war in one division 5 000 drafted men were poured into this division two weeks before it sailed for france and those men were in defensive trenches within three weeks after they reached france therefore it is extremely important that the reserve officers and the reserve organizations be kept in as efficient a condition as possible ready at any moment of need to receive train conserve the health of and command in action the troops that would be drafted i venture to suggest to the committee that there being 63 000 reserve offirers attached or assigned to existing necessary tactical and other units they should be trained at least once in every three years most reserve officers are officers of no large personal means it is very difficult to get officers to cousent to come into the reserve corps when we consider the large number of officers who were in the world war there are a great many men who can be counted on in an emergency but who will mot assume the obligations of the ieserve corps in time of peace the reserve officers and reserve units throughout the winter are given specific forms of instruction i know of a reserve regiment which has two definite meetings a month in which the problems of troop handling are taken up by each officer in order under the supervision of the commanding officer of the regiment and of the regular army executive officer of the regiment they also have the correspondence schools throughout the year these officers if they knew sufficiently far in advance that they could go to summer camp would make arrangements to go but the uncertainty of their being able to go prevents them from doing so therefore as i said with some diffidence but having great confidence in this subcommittee i wish to suggest to you the advisability of arranging for the training each year of onethird of the 63 000 officers who are attached or assigned thatleaves 21 500 not attached or assigned some of those officers would probably be necessary for field training once in three years or it would be advisable to let them have field training a number of those nount officers however are officers who do not require field training take for instance the officers of the judge advocate generals department it is advisable that they should have knowledge or previous contact with troops because the point of view of a military lawyer is totally different from the point of view of the civilian lawyer there is a decidedly different element required it would be advisable that they have training but i respectfully submit that it is absolutely necessary that the officers who are expected to be company or battalion or regimental officers or other independent unit olftcers should know that once every three years they will be in the field for actual mane4vers and training i am very much obliged to the committee for having had ibis opportunity to present this view to you as a necessity for the national defense under the present defense act without any pay or other monetary compensation all through the winter the

there has been some kind of power brouglht to hear upon him in order to make him reach that decision in favor of lumpsum appropriations i do not know what it is because i know le is not in favor of the policy of lump sums but he announced then that he is going to put this policy in every appropriation bill that is brought before the house during the balance of the sessionin all of the other nine supply bills he thinks he has a little amendment which will safeguard matters but it merely requires a general average it does not keep a department chief and it does not keep the secretary of a department shifting employees about at will and from showing favoritism to certain employees in their offices and doubling their salaries and reducing other salaries a general average could be gotten in that way you could double tile salaries of favorites and reduce the salaries of those not so favored and strike that general average as provided in mr maddens little amendment and yet you would not

reported h r 655 with certain amendments every man woman and child in the united states is vitally affected by this proposed legislation in that it puts upon their shoulders the burden of paying a still larger proportion of the local taxes of the 437 000 people living in the district of columbia until recently this bill was generally understood to be a reciprocity measure designed to bring about harmony between maryland and the district of columbia so as to abolish the necessity of motorvehicle owners living within the district of columbia procuring licenses and number tags from maryland and vice versa now in the bill and report it is titled tax on motorvehicle fuels there is but one proper title for this measure and that is the district commissioners latest taxdodging scheme during 1923 there were 110 973 motorvehicle licenses and number tags issued by the district of columbia for same the following charge was made 10 for over 30 horsepower which embraced rollsroyce pierce arrow lincoln packard cadillac marmon peerless locomobile stutz studebaker and other cars of similar makes 5 for all cars between 24 and 30 horsepower and 3 for all cars not over 24 horsepower embracing fords in addition there is a property tax of 1 20 per 100 on the value of the car which on a 15 000 rollsroyce amounts to 180 under present law the 437 000 people living in the district of columbia many of whom have no connection whatever with the government are allowed a personalproperty exemption motor vehicles not included of 1 000 exempt from taxation and pay a total tax of only 1 20 per 100 on real and personal property and a tax of only fivetenths of 1 per cent on intangibles all of the balance of the expenses of this big city is paid by the whole people of the united states under what is known as the present 6040 system of charging 60 per cent of the appropriations embraced in the district of columbia appropriation bill to the district of columbia and 40 per cent of same to the governmentbut prior to the fiscal year ended june 30 1922 the ratio was 5050 the government paying half of all such appropriationsand the additional system of carrying large appropriations for civic projects purely local in character in government department appropriation bills chargeable wholly to the government in other words in every other city of any size in the united states the people are paying taxes running from 2 75 to 6 per 100 and in addition to their own taxes are paying a large proportion of the taxes that should be paid by tme people of washington by letting the 437 000 people living in the district of columbia pay a total tax on real and personal property of only 1 20 per 100 with an exemption from tax on 1 000 personal property this bill h r 655 was framed by the commissioners of the district of columbia who claim that if it is passed the governor of maryland will grant reciprocity to the vistrict of columbia whose motorists will not then be required to get license tags in maryland but the terms of this bill are quite different from the demands made by maryland all that the governor of maryland required was a tax of 2 cents per gallon on gasoline as his state assessed such a tax and he didnt want people to have an advantage of buying gasoline cheaper in the district than in maryland under present law certain receipts collected by the district of columbia are placed in the treasury 60 per cent to the credit of the district and 40 per cent to the credit of the government to accord with the 6040 ratio respecting appropriations but in framing their socalled reciprocity measure the district commissioners did not stop with fixing a 2cent tax on gasoline which was all that maryland demanded but they seek to change the law in the following vital particulars to wit 1 they abolish the 10 and 5 and 3 charges for licenses and provide that all carsrollsroyce and fords alikeare to be charged a license fee of only 1 each which entitles them to number tags 2 they abolish all of the property tax which even at the small rate of 1 20 per 100 paid in the district amounted to 1 80 per annum on a 15 000 iollsroyce and 3 they provide that instead of placing the receipts from the 2 cents per gallon tax on gasoline in the treasury 60 per cent to the credit of the district and 40 per cent to the credit of the government 80 per cent would be placed to the district and only 20 per cent to the government thus changing the present 6040 ratio respecting disbursements to a ratio of 8020 respecting receipts with the government as usual getting the little end of it tie committee has amended the bill by exempting all motor vehicles up to the value of 1 000 from a property tax but providing that the present property tax of 1 20 per 100 shall apply above the valuation of 1 000 the committee admits that this will exempt at least fivesixths of all the automobiles in the district of columbia from the payment of any property tax whatever for at least fivesixths of such automobiles would be assessed at a valuataion of not more than 1 000 which is the value the committee exempts from all taxation illustrating how discriminating this bill is say smith and brown each have 2 000 smith invests his 2 000 in a residence which impairs in no way the city streets or roads requires no traffic cops occupies no rights of way and imposes no hazard ox danger to the public yet upon his 2 000 residence he pays his 1 20 per 100 tax or a tax of 24 while brown who runs an automobile for hire invests his money 1 000 in all automobile and 1 000 in household furniture his 1 000 furniture will be exempt from all taxes and his 1 000 automobiile will be exempt from all taxes except he will pay the measly little sum of 1 for his license inasmuch as the 2 cents gasoline tax will be no more than all other citizens of other states pay in addition to their heavy license tax state property tax and municipal property tax and brown will be operating his automobile day and night upon the streets and boulevards wearing out the surface menacing the safety of the public occupying his right of way and receiving the benefit of traffic cops to guide and protect him such discrimination is mnanifestly unjust every state in the united states other than maryland has reciprocity with the district of columbia out of the united states treasury by direct appropriation maryland has had more public money spent upon her state highways than practically all other states combined and in addition maryland has received her fair share of the goodroads appropriations made by congress the bureau of public roads advising that maryland has already received from it alone the sum of 4 013 004 99 and in addition thereto congress has already appropriated an additional 75 000 000 out of which maryland will receive approximately 640 000 more and until this year maryland and virginia had approximately 2 500 children attending the public schools of washington receiving free their tuition and school books paid for by the district of columbia and the government these 2 500 children are still attending washingtons schools but this year are charged a small tuition yet maryland has refused to permit any automobile bearing a district of columbia license to even pass from the nations capital along any of her roads without paying for a maryland license let me illustrate just how difficult it is to procure a maryland license our colleague from louisiana testified before the committee that on the appointed day he took hisplace in the long singlefile line and after working his way toward the office for three long hours the office closed for that day he went back the second day and took his place in the long line already formed there was a little frail woman just ahead of him it took them three and onehalf hours to get to the office where only one at a time was admitted mr aswel heard the pompous official ask the little frail woman a question which she was slow in answering saw this otflicial hand her a card and say in a most abrupt manner take this card and get out of here and do not come back until you learn tie regulations mr aswell described this office as a dingy dirty disreputable sort of a place presided over by insolent officials he finally procured a card similar to the one handed the woman which was a blank to be filled out by him answering numerous questions by way of examination he was compelled to fill in this blank on the outside and was compelled to take his place in line on two succeeding days waiting approximately three hours each time befre lie finally secured his maryland license tag thus to get his maryland license permitting him to drive from his nations capital through any part of maryland he was compelled to stand in line over 121 hours and lose the best part of four days learning that he could ship his ford car to texas much cheaper by boat from new york our colleague mr mansfield had his son drive his ford from washington to new york for shipment but he had to pass through a part of maryland he was promptly arrested detained over night fined nearly 30 was put to expense incident to the delay and caused to miss his boat on the return trip knowing that he could not pass through maryland and to avoid the red tape and annoying delay of trying to procure a maryland license he paid 40 extra freight to ship his ford from new york to washington in their letter of december 3 1923 which the district commissioners wrote to our committee chairman when they transmitted this bill for immediate passage they assign reciprocity with maryland as its great emergency purpose yet it is titled a bill to provide for a tax on motorvehicle fuels and for other purposes the other purposes constitute its real design no clause in the bill even mentions reciprocity no part of the bill authorizes reciprocity the bill nowhere compels reciprocity should we pass this bill maryland still could compel all cars from the district of columbia to procure maryland licenses the state of virginia surrounding the district on the other side has a tax on gasoline of 3 cents per gallon with equal lxv99 propriety the next day after passing this bill virginia could demand that congress pass a new law increasing the tax on gasoline to 3 cents per gallon so that the people would not all buy their gasoline in the district and in maryland only a few miles removed the people of the united states do not expect congress to thus specially legislate at the command of any state tlh people of the united states mam entitled to have maryland grant to the nations capital the same automobile reciprocity which all of the states grant both to the district of columbia and to maryland or else they are entitled to have maryland account for the 4 013 004 99 which she has already received from the united states treasury through the federal bureau of public roads and to have stopped the payment of the 640 000 more which maryland will receive from such bureau during the coming fiscal year after the first section of this bill shall have been read i intend to offer as a substitute for the measure an amendment to the federal highway act proposed by our colleague mr aswell which if passed will force maryland to grant reciprocity same being the following that section 21 of the federal highway act is amended by adding at the end thereof the following new paragraph no suns shall be apportioned or reapportioned under this act to any state which does not recognize the motorvehicle identification tags or licenses issued by any other state or by the district of columbia the above was introduced in the house by mr aswell as h it 32 on december 5 1023 and has been pending ever since the ommittee report is misleading in stating that all states within 100 miles of the district of columbia have adopted this method viz of making the registration licensetag fee only 1 for all cars exempting at least fivesixths of all the automobiles from a property tax and depending upon the tax on gasoline for raising the revenue maryland is on one side of the district of columbia and virginia is on the other side these two states surround it in the state of maryland under its present 1924 law motor vehicles have to pay besides the 2 cents per gallon tax on gasoline a property tax to the state of 2 70 per 100 on the valuation of the car and in addition have to pay for their registration and license tags a tax of 32 cents per horsepower on all cars in the state of virginia motor vehicles for instance in the city of alexandria only a short distance away from washington have to pay a state license tax of 60 cents per horsepower which averages about 15 per car and a state property tax of 1 50 on the 100 full value of the car and in addition have to pay a municipal license tax averaging about 4 per each car and also a municipal property tax averaging about 7 50 per car and then in addition to all of the above have to pay a gasoline tax of 3 cents per gallon yet our district commissioners bill sought to let all cars rollsroyces piercearrows lincolns on down escape all taxation by merely paying a registration fee of 1 each and a gasoline tax of 2 cents on a gallon and our committee is attempting to allow fivesixths of all the automobiles in the district of columbia to escape all taxation by paying this 1 and the 2 cents gasoline tax system of taxation here crime upon wihole reorle i intend to show that the system of taxation in the district of columbia and its fiscal relation with the government is a crime upon the whole people of the united states the 437 000 people living in washington d c escape the ordinary burden of taxation borne by the people in every other city and are allowed to pay the small rate of only 1 20 on the 100 on real and personal property with a 1 000 personal property exemption and with assessments at far below full value simply becaus all the rest of the people of the united states have been paying a very large part of the local city expenses here in addition to their own taxes and they have not yet found out they are doing it i have

le pays on his residence in washington which under any conditions is worth 22 500 but which could be sold for 25 000 prior to the fiscal year of 1915 when the borland act became effective all of the streets within the district of columbia had been paved upon the 5050 basis half the expense being paid by the district and the other half by the government of the united states the district auditor advises me that when the borland act became effective fully 90 per cent of all the streets within the old limits of the city of washington had already been paved the government of the united states paying for half of all of same under the borland act each abutting property owner now pays for 20 feet and excess is paid for by the district and government 5050 up to june 30 1921 and 6040 since that date congress made the following appropriations for repairs and maintenance of streets since the 6040 plan became effective to wit fiscal year 1921 575 000 fiscal year 1922 575 000 fiscal year 1923 460 000 fiscal year 1924 550 000 and the government of the united states paid 40 per cent of all of the above congress made the following appropriations for repairs to suburban streets and roads

year 924 690 000 and the whole people of the united states paid 40 per cent of same until the borland amendment became effective in 1915 the whole people paid 50 per cent of the expense of paving all the streets and thoroughfares of washington and of their repair and maintenance without abutting property owners paying any part of same and the 5050 basis continued to 1921 the government paying 50 per cent but since then only 40 per cent of all of the above prior to 1915 to secure sewer service the owner was charged 1 per front foot and never thereafter did he have to pay anything additional but since 1915 he is now charged 1 50 per front foot and thereafter he pays no annual assessment whatever for such service in other words where the owners lot was 20 feet front he paid 20 before 1915 and 30 since then for service and all of such expense of making his excavations and furnishing him sewer connection for all time thereafter without further charge is borne by the dis trict and government 5050 before 1921 and 6040 since 1921 for water connection the owner is charged 2 per front foot which covers less than 66 per cent of the cost of making the connection for him and the charge thereafter is illustrated as follows tie residence rented by me at 1929 kenyon street nw has 20 feet frontage a basement two stories and an attic there are seven members in my family i am charged 7 65 per annum this is a lower water rate than any other city in the whole united states enjoys every time low taxes here are mentioned washingtonians immediately mention that the government owns much property here not taxed there is not a piece of property owned by the government but what is enjoyed daily by the 437 000 people of washington potomac park with its driveways flower gardens golf courses riding paths tennis courts cricket and polo gromlds bathing beach and pools skating pools boating facilities are all furnished by the government for the pleasure 1 562 of washington people the incomparable zoo park with its many pleasures for children and picnic parties rock creek park with its many outing pleasures are enjoyed by washington people at government expense every public building here is a pleasure to the people even the great center market is owned by the government and the main water conduit is owned by the government yet the district of columbia has never accounted to the government 1 for its free use practically all of the splendid school buildings of washington were built half with the money of the whole people of the united states and the more recent buildings including the 2 000 000 eastern high school building were paid for 40 per cent by the whole people of the united states and the whole people of the united states are still paying 40 per cent of the expense of conducting these schools the salaries of the 2 500 teachers and employees the thousands of street lights the army of city firemen in the fire department the approximately 1 000 members of the metropolitan force which is exclusive of the special police forces for the capitol white house senate and house office buildings and other public buildings in washington the army of trash gatherers the army of ash gatherers the army of garbage gatherers the street sprinklers the tree sprayers the tree pruners the numerous playgrounds schoolbooks for the 65 000 school children here and the numerous one hundred and one other local matters which only the people of the district of columbia should pay for but for which the whole people of the united states have to pay 40 per cent of same and the district gets several extra millions annually from the united states treasury where the whole people pay the full 100 per cent the washington times for thursday january 10 1924 on page 2 in an article headed district given 1 647 700 mentioned the several local institutions here in the district which are given the sum of 1 647 700 direct out of the treasury concerning which there is no division of 6040 but all is paid by the whole people for said items are in the interior epartment appropriation bill now before the house all of which comes out of the peoples treasury this systenli has prevailed here simply because the 437 000 people in washington are organized into citizens associations who will attempt to ruin any congressman who fights the situation and because the people of the united states dont know about the situation whenever the people find it out they are going to have it stopped what particular halo is there about the head of the rich tax dodgers living in washington that they should be permitted to pay a total tax rate of only 1 20 on the 100 assessed at about half valuation while the people of every other city in the united states have to pay all the way from 2 75 to 6 50 and the balance of the local expenses of the people of washington has to be borne by the whole people why should it be continued why should washington people be more favored than all of the balance of the people in the cities of this nation yet because so much of their expenses have been paid out of the treasury in the various supply bills that all of the revenue resulting from their little tax of 1 20 on half valuation has not all been used because the government was footing the bills an effort is now being made by the district commissioners to have such balance of nearly 5 000 000 declared a surplus to the credit of the district and they be permitted to spend same it would be a crime against the whole people to let them touch one dollar of same during the recess of congress i wrote to the mayor of every city of any size in the united states and asked them to advise us of their local tax rate of the charges for water sewer paving and so forth and what rate in their judgmeht they thought washington people should pay as a minimum i want to insert just a few in this report the consensus of opinion was that the rate here should be at least 2 50 per 100 and there was a large per cent who were in favor of it being much higher and the rates for taxation ranged from 2 75 to over 6 50 and in all these cities the people were charged more for water sewer and paving the following is from the mayor of the city of peoria"], [0.01873922348022461, 0.9812607765197754, 1, "just as i said awhile ago first to let the people in my district know where i would place those buildings and second to let the committee on public buildings and grounds know where i wanted buildings placed so that they could get the proper estimate from the treasury department on every one of those buildings when making the allotment due my district so that if the omnibus bill should be passed the committee could embrace in same such buildings as my district was entitled to in the pro rata allocation was there anything inconsistent in that certainly not whenever an omnibus public building bill come in it is going to contain certain new construction in every district in the united states and you gentlemen know it as well as i do the difference is that my colleague mr hudsprthi is for an omnibus public building bill while i am against it the gentleman from minnesota tried to joke about my introducing a bill for the city of sweetwater tex he has no finer city in his district he represents 11 counties in minnesota with a combined population of only 234 785 i have in my district 19 splendid counties whose population according to the 1920 census embraces 314 31 4 people sweetwater is the county seat of nolan county has a magnificent new courthouse and in the heart of this growing city with four trunk railroads is a valuable postoffice site which the government has owned for a number of years yet is still paying rental for a privately owned building in the city of comanche tex the heart of one of the finest agricultural and fruitraising counties in the state the government procured a site for a postoffice building and nearly 10 years ago made an appropriation to construct a postoffice building thereon but the war came on and prices were inflated and the building can not be constructed until an appropriation of an additional amount is made these good people of comanche are entitled to have this additional amount provided whenever a public building bill is passed and i would not have been doing my duty if i had not introduced a bill to provide same for them and a like situation prevails in the city of coleman the county seat of the splendid agricultural and stockraising county of coleman these loyal patriotic people have waited patiently all these years without complaint or murmur have put up with every kind of inconvenience imaginable have gone for their mall to a rickety old building which is flooded every time it rains yet have realized that it is necessary for their government to get its breath before embarking oti an extensive building program and they have beetn willing to wait a while longer in order to give their government a chance to recover financially the gentleman from minnesotat nearly collapsed into a profane spasm wien my colleague mentioned ny bill to provide a building for the city of breckenridge it is the county seat of stephens county has two circuit courts running in its courthouse is in the heart of one of the greatest old fields in the united states and is a thriving city of enterprising deserving people and so with the cities of ranger eastland and cisco all surrounded by oil fields and have doubled in population so many times since the war congress met that their remarkable growth and improvement are almost beyond belief each of these cities is entitled to a new postoffice building but their people being loyal and patriotic to their governments necessities they have waited patiently why the enterprising people of cisco tex have constructed for their citywater system it magnificent dam that in size and expense will compare favorably witi some of the reclamation dans built by our governmeat the good people of all of these cities have put up with all kinds of inconveniences in doing without an adequate postoffice building but they all know my position on this question and they are willing to wait until such a time as the government is financially able to weather a publicbuilding program my colleague from texas represents 38 counties yet according to the last census they embrace only 230 577 people there being 83 737 more people living in my district than live in his and let me tell my colleague further there are exactly 6 330 more people living in my district according to the last census than there are living in the district of my colleague and in the entire state of nevada combined yet my colleague admits that whenever it becomes apparent that an omnibus building bill is to be launched he intends to introduce numerous bills for postoffice buildings in his district and i presume that my friend rich oss delegation will do likewise for the state of nevada hence wherein have i been inconsistent why i learn that my good friend from mississippi has just this afternoon dropped into the hopper where house bills are introduced his bill to construct a 250 000 postoffice building in jackson miss i wonder how many other such bills he has whenever he gets such a building he will be forced to agree to give many of the big cities in the united states magnificent new buildings and it all is going to cost the people an enormous sum of money and they are not able to pay for it just now this is why i am in favor of waiting a few years longer our government will recuperate its finances and we are going to reduce expenditures soon i hope and when we do it will automatically reduce taxes and then we can all dress our cities in our district up in new building clothes my loyal home city of abilene is sadly in need of an enlarged building but these good people are waiting patiently knowing that i will not forget

government for the production of fertilizer at muscle shoals the ford offer was rejected and nothing has been done with tis preperty at this session and i know the cotton farmers are paying higher prices for fertilizers than last year the spirit of monopoly and greed is still abroad in the land and those who formed the habit of profiteering during the war times are loathe to give it up during

products when placed o the markets bring lower prices than manufactured and linisied articles their dollars are few and hard to jalie and any extra burdens placel upon them are heavy to bear all

moneys raises and increases passed here i voted against are benaring heavily upon the taxpayers of the country every them and will continue to vote against similar measures and dollar saved by limited appropriations is a dollar lifted from yet i am constructive and not destructive tie taxpayer i voted for the soldiers bonus because i felt that it was a in the past few years much has been done in the reduction debt that we owed them and i wanted to see justice meted out of these expenditures under the budget system congress has to them i voted for the postal salary bill because i believed been able to reduce the government expenditures annually the people of this nation receive the best service from the pos from nearly six billion and onehalf in 1920 to less than three tel employees of any servants in the nation in my opinion billion and a half in 1924 we get the bst returns on our money from the postal service president coolidge has emphasized as no other president thian from any governmental agency you see the hue and cry of the united states has ever emphasized the necessity for raised in the newspapers by the passage of the postal salary rigid economy in public expenditures

connecticut avenue bridges for the people here in paying a big per cent of the salaries of several thousand policemen to take care of the people here in furnishing 700 firemen to protect the people of the district from fire and for these hundreds of ash gatherers who go behind our residences every morning to collect and remove the ashes for furnishing this army of trash gatherers who remove the trash from the receptacles placed at our back doors and for which we ought to pay ourself for furnishing 2 500 school teachers and free school books to the 66 000 school children here in the district for furnishing magnificent school buildings here like the eastern high school that cost over 3 000 000 for furnishing everything they enjoy that makes life enjoyable that is where that 190 000 000 went still they are calling for more still they are not satisfied still they hound us still they wll not treat me with justice because i fight them and stand up here as a representative and represent the interests of the people they will not treat me justly in their papers let me tell you what happened this week there was published in the press of my district what was called mr harry p hunts washington letter he is a great reporter i am not minimizing the value or importance of either the reporter or his work but he went on to say that the poor people of washington were taxed without representation that they paid more money into the federal treasury sthan a lot of different states mentioning them and he said we would not even let them elect their officers or have any representation do you know what i did when i first came here i found out that they were using lthat plea to get money all the time that the people of washington and the newspapers were using it they were all the time saying they were being taxed without representation and i do not believe in that i believe in a man having some representation i believe in the constitution which says that congress shall keep control of this district i believe in that because it is the nations capital it is the nations workshop and the government should keep control over it but i do not believe in people not having a right to vote so three years ago i introduced a bill and if you will go yonder and get a copy of itthere are lots of copies still in the document roomyou will see that i proposed to give the people of washington a vote on their local matters to let them elect their own commissioners if you please from among men who have lived here a certain number of years to let them elect their own fiscal officers in the district and i provided the machinery by which that could be done i provided that they should elect every member of their school board i provided that they should have that right and it would not have meaft the loss of control of the district by the federal government i did not stop there i felt they should have representation to appear before our committees and on the floor of the house when legislation affecting their interests was up so i provided in that bill for them to have a delegate to sit on the floor of this house and be able to present their matters before congress when their bills came up and to present their interests to committees when their interests were involved before committees of the congress but do you think they wanted it no they held a mass meeting in the caucus room of the house office building one night and i thought they would all be in favor of it i called on colonel jones who was the chairman of their suffrage organization in washington and i said bring your men here and let us get their approval of a bill to give the district representation and the vote to my surprise that night chairman after chairman of citizens associations rose and said we do not want that bill they did not say pub licly why they did not want it but they told me privately and i will tell you privately if you will ask me some time why they did not want it you could not force such a bill on the people of the district they do not want suffrage they are using the absence of it though every day in trying to create sympathy over the united states in order to get great big sums of money that will relieve them from paying taxes now we had just as well look this thing squarely in the face we had just as well be frank about it we had just as well talk out in the meeting about it and call white white and black black did you hear the gentleman from michigan during the debate two weeks ago say why he coupled this on the lumpsum plan he said it was to get it through another body he said in effect that we never would be able to get that lumpsum plan through another body unless we gave somebody in another body this 4 500 000 surplus he said he wanted to use that to get it through let me show you exactly some of the words he used he said standing alone we will have trouble getting action by the senate on a permanent lumpsum bill i would like to use this surplus hill as a vehicle to carry through the lumpsum proposition what else did he say he said further if you today pass this bill for the payment of this 5 000 000 they will have that and you will wait a long time before you will get the senate to pass a permanent lumpsum contribution as our payment toward the district expenses why gentlemen is he so afraid of ithe senate is it because he knows that one of our new senators a very distinguished friend of ours owns the big 5 000 000 willard hotel is that one of his reasons is it because some other legislators own big property interests here is that the reason well if it is we had just as well know about it and speak out in meeting if it is because congressmen and senators own property here on which they do not want to pay high taxes we had just as well admit it and not beat about the bush do you know what the tax rate is now one dollar and forty cents on the 100 and about half valuation until we passed the cramton amendment last year it was 1 20 on the 100 in order to find out just how much more other people in other cities were paying in taxes during the fail of 1923 i wrote to the mayor of every city of any size in the united states and asked them to advise us of their local tax rates of the charges for water sewer paving and so forth and what rate in their judgment they thought washington people should pay as a minimum i want to insert just a few in this report the consensus of opinion was that the rate here should be at least 2 50 per 100 and there was a large per cent who were in favor of it being much higher and the rates for taxation ranged from 2 75 to over 6 50 and in all these cities the people were charged more for water sewer and paving let me again quote a few excerpts from the letter sent me by the mayor of the city of peoria ill novembbr 1 1928"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.9562242701649666, 0.04377572983503342, 1, "i move that the house resolve itself into committee of the

present there is a variation in the rates levied by the states which is a source of great injustice arizona has a maximum rate of 1 per cent on direct inheritances with an exemption of 1 000 california has a maximum of 15 per cent on inheritances to direct heirs and a maximum exemption of 24 000 between these rates are the other states making a condition of confusion worse confounded on collateral heirs michigan has a maximum rate of 5 per cent with exemption of 100 arkansas has a maximum of 32 per cent with exemption of 1 000 of course such a variation is a direct invitation to tax dodging with resulting loss of revenue pennsylvanians who have taken their wealth from the mills and mines of that state may go and do go in some instances to states where the taxes are lighter they can go now to florida for instance and avoid state inheritance taxes entirely since that pleasureresort commonwealth has no tax of the kind the only practicable way to secure uniformity in rates is for the united states to levy these estate taxes at figures which will compel cooperation by the states then there is the question of the personal property included in the estates subject to taxation california imposes an inheritance tax upon the personal property of the decedent resident in the state no matter where it is located though this property was never in the state it is taxed just the same and in addition to that california taxes the property within her borders of a nonresident on the other hand new york does not impose an inheritance tax upon personal property outside the commonwealth such a condition involves manifest injustice uilformity in rates personal property provisions and so forth will only come when the states realize the necessity of cooperating with the federal government however aside from these details i am enthusiastically in favor of a graduated federal inheritance tax i accept the challenge of the gentleman from new york and say that i am in favor of its being made a permanent part of american taxing policy of all forms of taxation the inheritance tax seems the wfsestsaid andrew carnegie and he advocated in 1892 the obtaining of every dollar of federal revenues from this source which he saidwould not interfere in the least with the forces which tend to the development of the country through the production of wealth the united states taxes swollen inheritances more lightly than any other democratic country great britain now applies a 40 per cent maximum tax and france takes an equally large share of large estates the total gross estate of the 12 203 persons resident in the united states who filed returns from january 16 to december 31 1922 was 2 879 372 168 they were given exemption of almost half that amount under our la so that the total tat was 115 838 953 or less than 8 per cent as a tax for raising revenue the estate tax meets all sound requirements it brings into the public treasury the entire amount of the tax and does not require an army of collectors it does not hamper enterprise nor obstruct industry and it can not be evaded or passed on to others i am for high estate taxes because of these facts and for others still more important there will be received this year through inheritances from estates of more than 10 000 the amount of 8 000 000 000 those who receive it did not earn it they becomo its possessors only because of the prbtectlon of the government today one hundred and fifty billions is held by those who did not earn it if there is an average return of 6 per cent upon this inherited and unearned wealth it means that the people of the united states pay 9 000 000 000 a year to its holders while we are listening to the cries against oppressive governmental taxation it might be well to give a little attention to this backbreaking tax 80 a year from every man woman and child in the united states we have heard a great deal also about the rights of those who inherit wealth it seems to me that the common welfare of america demands a little attention to the rights of those who are disinherited because of present conditions no sane american can fail to see the menace where wealth accunmlates and men decay through undeserved poverty great changes have come in america since that day when do tocqueville said in the united states i never heard of a man spending his wealth to corrupt the government today we are shamed by teapot dome scandals where money takes the field as an organized power to corrupt the government of the united states what hereditary royalty has done for the rulers of the old world money can be made to do in america royalty gives power to its possessors to control those who do not possess it money can give to its possesors here power over those who have it not handed down intact from generation to generation it can be made into exactly the force which our fathers tried to provide against when they prevented the creation of estates in perpetuity those old nation builders feared the influence of men who could control great accumulations of wealth through the generations and thus levy perpetual tax upon honest capital and honest labor we can not now turn back the hands of the clock and recreate the natural resources which have been used to make mighty fortunes for exploiters and their descendants but through estate taxes we may recapture a part for paying the expenses of a government which may be made a mighty instru ment for democracy and human brotherhood so too these estate taxes will prevent the evasion of taxal tion through possession of taxexempt securities it will mean that the owners of twenty billions of taxfree bonds must in the end pay a fair share of governmental expense it will help fill up the bombproof taxexempt cellar in which capital has thus far successfully hidden from the taxgatherer i voted for the proposed amendment to the constitution to prevent the issue of taxexempt bonds because i believe such exemption helps to increase prices and reduces the purchasing power of the public i voted to reduce the higher surtaxes because they do in a measure handicap industry but these estate taxes will reach the taxexempt securities and they will take the brakes off industry for the future this estate tax will furnish a just method to help raise the money needed to pay adjusted compensation to the soldiers of america who broke the heart of prussia at belleau wood chateau thierry and the argonne the common manhood of america paid a frightful price in health and blood and life for that victory let the unearned wealth of america be forced to do its fair share towdrtd adjusting the compensation of those who fought in comparison with those who stayed at home that is the most sacred war debt
