state did worse than that back yonder in 1890 when the iniquitous mckinley tariff was put across this congress they gave every pound of sugar 2 cents out of the federal treasury every farmer who grew a pound of sugar in louisiana had old sugar cane awhooping her up and they got millions on top of millions of dollars out of the united states treasury and made prcsperity blossom all over the state of louisiana and yet my distinguished friend in his eloquent style told you that this haugen bill is a subsidy and would destroy our institutions and that there is coming down from certain quarters in the united states a great radicalism which is going to destroy the stability of the government it did not hurt the morale of my good friend from louisiana when they dug out of the treasury 2 cents a pound for every pound of sugar they grew in louisiana they got that bill through for 15 years but it hapened that after about three and a half years the people of this government repealed that thigthe sugar bountywhich my friend and fellow citizens enjoyed out of the united states treasury doctor aswell says if you give the farmers a nickel out of the treasury now it would destroy the government and ruin the country but down in the very state that my friend comes from those sugar farmers have patches on their breeches as big as the head of a whisky barrel they are stoop shouldered from toting mortgages on their plantations and equipment and they can not draw a thing on earth out of a bank except their breath yet the gentleman from lquisiana is here talking against the farmer he knows that all he proposes to give tdem is a little soothing sirup this haugen bill has the vitalizing force in it this haugen bill has the stuff that will get the grapes and every man on this floor knows it subsidy why who ever heard of my friend from louisiana being afraid of a subsidy before two or three falls ago there came a drought in his district and he heralded the fact in the newspapers that he was going to take out of the treasury of the united states 500 000 to give those folks feed and seed and clothing and he even asked the delegation from mississippi to help him but as much as i love the farmer his resolution was too rank for me the gentleman actually introduced a resolution in congress on another occasion to take out of the treasury of the united statbs 500 000 to buy the seed to be placed in the flooded area yet this bill that is going to stabilize the price of five basic products so far as the farmers are concerned is a subsidy and he can not vote for it he can not do anything except kill it by their fruits ye shall know them we had another distinguished doctor who came from that grand old state of kentucky he said this bill is unsound and uneconomic and that he would not vote for any bill that carries any subsidy i heard my friend speak on this floor i heard a speech he made once before on the farmer doctor aswell was going to give them a little soothing sirup the gentleman from kentucky got out his hammer and hit everything ioe hit wheat he hit cotton he hit everything and finally wound up by taking the poor old sugar farmer of louisiana and knocking him in the head and chucking him in the river and while they are wearing patched breeches he said he is going to plow up his old tobacco patch and his old mint julep bed if the haugen farm bill passes and sow it in cotton and raise 26 000 000 bales flood the markets of the world and scare the life out of every farmer in the cottongrowing states now 26 000 000 bales i can see the gentleman from kentucky along in the hot days of august plowing down a row and a woodpecker flying up and knocking on a dead limb about 20 yards away so that the sound would be heard 300 yards away and by the time he gets to the end of the row a cottontail rabbit runs under the beam of his plow and there is a jaybird sitting in a sapling crying too slick slick dave dave and about the time frost comes in that cold clinmate the latter part of august or the 1st of september and kills the cotton then doctor kincreloe will saiy this cotton business will not do for me and yet he is going to raise 26 000 000 bales of cotton and fibod the world with cotton and fix it so that the cotton farmer can not even exist my friend kincieloe introduced a little bill here in congress in 1922 do you know he vehemently and viciously assaulted this ihaugen bill asserting it is uneconomnical he actually introduced a bill to take out of the treasury of the united states 50 000 000 while our government was helpless recovering from the world war and wlat was lie going to do about it he was going to have the government of the united states pay these tobacco growers down in his district 50 000 000 for a shirttail full of stingy green tobacco ilow was he going to use it then the government was to sell it on credit without profit to these poor pauperized bankrupt nations italy and fiance and a few poorer paupers of europe who have not paid what they borrowed from us and take chips and whetstones as pay and everybody knows they have never been able to pay even chips and whetstones for the billions of cash they borrowed from uncle sam during the war yet this bill now intended to help the farmers of the united states is unsound and uneconomical but doctor kinceloe thinks it was sound and economical and fundamental business economics to go down into the treasury and to put the tobacco growers hands in there and take out 50 000 000"], [0.01536482572555542, 0.9846351742744446, 1, "you will never get

have heard all this discussion of the mcnaryhaugen bill we had this matter up one year ago before this house every kind of disaster was predicted by the gentlemen who opposed it from every section of the united states why my good friend and neighbor who spoke just before me kept saying he is willing to vote for the other bills but he could not vote for this to hades with the other bills we want this bill why does any friend of the man who is behind the plow want to go out and talk about some other bill when this is the only bill of its kind that the united states congress has the opportunity to pass not only that but the committee on rules has just brought out the mcnaryhaugen bill passed by the united states senate if the united states senate could go out and vote for the farmer who is it over here who can not see his way clear to cast his vote in favor of the american farmer this bill just as it passed the united states senate without the crossing of a t or the dotting of an i is going to get my vote i will vote against every amendment that is offered to it because such amendments i know will kill this farm legislation if we want to help the american farmer we must vote for the bill that we know can become a law this great united states of america has 450 000 000 000 of wealth with 65 000 000 000 invested in agriculture that great class representing 37 000 000 people in this republic is now lying prostrate men who own the great farms can not realize 2 per cent net on their investment no a great plantation is a liability instead of an asset this great class of people the real folks of this republic the men behind the plow contribute to every function of government and they are true and undefiled citizens thus far they have failed to get help from the united states congress congress heretofore has gone out and helped the people who have 20 000 000 000 invested in railroads with the government aid that they have received if they can not declare a dividend of 51 2 per cent on water and all god help them you have given subsidies to every other class of citizens in this republic you have given to the manufacturers by a protective tariff a bounty on every line of production of merchandise in this republic strip this measure of all its verbiage and what does it mean two hundred and fifty million dollars of united states money put up for the use of farmers some say i am afraid to put on an equalization fee what do you care about your job you are here to represent the people it does not make any difference whether your name is john smith or percy quin a man ought to be willing to stand up and vote for what he knows is going to help the people i know that if you put this measure into effect it is going to raise the price of every commodity in it already the possibility of its becoming a law has had that effect cotton has gone up 10 a bale and if you gentlemen have any sporting blood in your veins you want to buy all the cotton you can between now and the time we get this bill up to the white house because cotton is going up just as quickly as they know this congress is back of that great product the same is true of wheat of corn of hogs of tobacco and of rice some say they can not vote for it because of tile equalization fee why the farmer is a sensible man and he has to be a smart man ie has more sense than any other man engaged in business in this republic and le has to have it a man who is engaged in farming with the united states government not helping him but robbing him all the time with the elements against him insects and pests and with high railroad fieight rates and high tariff against him has to be a smart man in order to pay his taxes and exist some gentlemen say well i know le is hard up but i am afraid to vote for this bill the man who is afraid to come up and cast his votefor that pool man behind the plow that poor mal wi with his wife and children works from early dawn until late in the evening some of themn half naked god have mercy on him i want you gentlemen on the republican side to know that i live in a country where about half the people ire poor negroes some of them line citizens i have seen ne roes on cotton plantations down there working in the fields in the hot sun with bare heads bare feet and not enough clothes on to make a wrestling jacket for a louse they work all the time and many of1 the white people the tillers of the farms work the entire year and then can hardly buy a calico dress for their wives on the fourih of july yet some of you say the united states government is not able to help them i happened to hear over the radio a few nights ago the distinguished chief executive of this republic mr coolidge and my good friend general lord the head of the budget bureau talking about prosperity president coolidge told about the great prosperity of this republic and i actually felt in my pockets to see if i could not find some money i realized that when the chief executive was talking he did not know the condition of the agricultural classes of this republic he did not know that at the very hour lie was talking homes were advertised in every state of this union for taxes he did not know that good and honest homesteaders and good and honest farmers who had worked with their wives and children the entire year were unable to come up and meet the obligations of the county and state as assessed against them yet lie proclaims prosperity the people about whom the gentleman from new jersey was talking are prosperous these men who have had their hands in the pockets of the people plundering and exploiting them through manufacturing enterprises are prosperous the railroads for which you guaranteed this enormous dividend are prosperous the shipping lines are prosperous the fertilizer makers ire prosperous everybody is prosperous except the poor farmer who must get down and plow the earth whmo must depend for his sustenance and his profit upon the elements and i might say upon the hope of congress now is your last time tie main who says lie is a friend of the farmer and votes against this bill will need a long time to explain here is a piece of legislation that will help time farmer who is it tihat is afraid to say mr farmer i voted for an equalization fee on your wheat your corn your rice your tobacco your hog and your cotton who is afraid of that who is afraid to say i voted for an equalization fee to go on your cotton i voted for the united states treasury to put up 250 000 000 to help you build up your prices i voted for you to get back three times 5 or 2 or whatever you put in i voted for that to come back into your pockets you need not think the farmer is a fool he knows that when lie puts up 5 at the gin or at the factory or anywhere else he is going to get that back with manifold interest fifteen dollars for every 5 he puts in is what will come back to the farmer you know the farmer has sense enough to know lie can not get anything for nothing but we must give him the quid pro quo and if you really want to help the farmers of this republic you must vote for the only measure that cma become a law gentlemen have said that they do not know what the president would do you need not bother yourselves about the president of the united states the question is what are you as member of the united states congress going to do the president of the united states has a function to perform you need not worry about what lie is going to do about this bill let us pass it just like the senate has handed it to us and put it upon his table you will see the president of the united states sign it some of these washington papers have made it out that lie is so coldblooded that lie would veto the bill and kick the poor farmer in the slats and say go beg or starve do not you know the president of the united states will not do that do not you know that he recognizes from one end of this republic to the other the great demand there is for this legislation do not you know that he recognizes the decrease there has been ili the value bf farm lands do not you know that he knows that these stalwart citizens in the east north south and the west owning every foot of ground in this great republic are crying out for justice they are not asking for any special privilege and this bill gives them none it simply puts up 250 000 000 and says we will make you pay the balance or whatever is necessary to lold your product off of the market until it brings its own price until they can get the price of production and a profit with anm orderly system of marketing and every sensible farmer in mississippi and in my neighboring state across the river of louisiana can read english mand they know what this means you need not be bothered about being afraid that the farmer will think their congressman has betrayed them if he votes for a hill to raise the price of their stuff even if he has to put up a few dollars with his government in order to do this what does a man care about putting up 5 if lie knows lie will make 1 5 by the operation there is no man in this house as a business proposition who would not gladly jump at that chance i take it every man here at some time in his life has bad business dealings in this republic and every day in the year the chief worry with tile farmer is whether or not be will have enough money to feed and clothe his family and pay his taxes give a few dollars to the church and pay something to the doctor that is the situation of the average staiill farmer in this nation everybody has been helped except the farmer and when he comes liere with a imeasure backed by all the farmn organizations and backed by all the men who have been studying for time last 24 nmnths sonic way to help the poor farmer out some gentlemen get up here with all their statesumnshipand some of them could not win a case in a justice court and say unconstitutional i believe when the angel gabriel puts one foot upon the sea and the other upon the land there will be some wise statesmani rise up out of his grave and shout unconstitutional why that has been the hobby of the opponents to every measure that has been for the relief of the people during time past 75 years it was talked against the fari loan bill the democrats were in power at that time and i heard men in the caucus bellowing for hours unconstitutional when we had the great federal reserve bank bill in that same caucus i heard unconstittional when we had it up on the floor of the houseboth of these great measures that stand as monuments in this republic for progress ald prosperitymen o both sides of this aisle would get ui and shout unconstitutional and whenever any measure is proposed in the interest of the people as a last resort the word unconstitutional is invoked you need not worry about the constitutionality of this measure some have talked about the supreme court some men say they will not vote for it when they know the president will veto it and some say they will not vote for it because the supreme court is going to declare it unconstitutional i say that all of you should vote for it because it is right do not try to hide behind what the president will do do not try to hide behind the sanctity of the supreme court because the president of the united states is going to sign this bill all lie is waiting for is for this congress to send it to him all the bluffs notwithstanding the supreme court of the united states has nothing in this simple verbiage to declare unconstitutional they will not declare it umeonstitutional simply because the bill makes the farmer come across with a few dollars to help raise the price of his labor to what it is worth where is there a constitutional lawyer who can decide that this verbiage is unconstitutional yet this attempt is made on this floor it matters not what the pretense or the pretext is the enemy of time people always finds one then they shout economically unsound why ecomionically unsound has got to be a bugaboo they have used it so much some of these people living around smokestacks with nothing but wheels turning around poor people working to earn their living in the sweat of their face are against this bill because they are afraid it will raise the price of wheat mm few cents or the price of cotton a few dimes when there are thousands and thousands of people in this republic who need more clothes when over yonder in asia and in africa and in various parts of europe there are people going half naked and people that are entirely naked they could have cotton garments ok l hem you could have cotton garments in china with its 400 000 000 people you could have cotton garments all over japan you could have cotton garments in java and everywhere else and you could have the flag of this republic with its commerce carried to the uttermost quarters of this earth and the american farmer would then receive a fair and just price for what he produces whether it be wheat corn lard cotton or what not we have given union labor a fair price for its work and i helped to do it i want to say there has never been a time since i have been here in the last 14 years when i have failed to stand up like a man and vote for the poor classes of people i have stood up for the laboring man the man in the humble walks of life he is the fellow who needs our help it is not the man who is able to ride in a limousine and to wear diamonds as big as a biscuit in his shirt front it is the man who toils for his living the man who needs your help is in this bill and he is justified in being there every farmer i do not care whether his name is john smith or bill jones is in this bill he votes in your district and god help him to judge us right and say whether or not we have been true and loyal to him on this final test after all the struggle of all these years when he has come before the american congress and has said give me justice and that legislation which will help to feed and clothe my children and properly care for my wife so long as i live as god is my judge i shall stand up for the poor people of this republic"],

explained by the committee denmark bound up with the tariff commercial treaties and high cost of living the problem of agriculture in europe represents an enigma by no means easy to understand the most ejcient american organizations aiding me to unravel and to understand this question are the officers of the american commercial attachds representing the united states department of commerce their trade commissioners follow the situation closely and are able to render a very high order of service to the american student of agricultural marketing the farmers of denmark as i have said are especially well organized and are in control of their own business the government merely acquiescing in the activities of the marketing associations the development which during and since the last quarter of the nineteenth century has taken place in danish agriculture has been due primarily not to say entirely to the efforts and resourcefulness of the danish farmer himself and only to a very limited extent to direct assistance given to agriculture by the national government government assistance to danish agriculture during the early years of the modern development took the form chiefly of an acquiescent and willing attitude the government when necessary acted to remove existing barriers to the organization and development of cooperative agricultural associations for production and sales purposes and provided freedom from taxation and other liberties and privileges for these organizations of direct aid in the form of subsidies valorization or marketing assistance practically nothing was done or has since been done among the few contributions of this type are the following 1 appropriations for agricultural attachss abroad 2 an export subsidy of 5 000 000 crowns available in the form of export guaranties and export loans 3 reduction of railway freight rates on certain agricultural products destined for export the first item mentionedestablishment of agricultural attaches abroadis of rather old standing there being however but a few of these posts in existence the total expenditures in this connection it appears from the budget is about 225 000 crowns 60 000 the second item export credits in the form of government guaranties against loss on export shipments and extension of government credits to the extent of 5 000 000 crowns is of comparatively recent origin having come into force about a year ago this system was organized with export to russia in view but has apparently not proved of very great value to the danish farming community as indicated by the fact that only a small fraction of the sum made available has been used the third mentioned form of direct government assistance to agriculture reduction of railway freight rates on agricultural products destined for export has been in vogue for some time it is however in effect more an agreement between a large shipperagricultureand a large transportation organizationthe state railwaysthan a form of government assistance to agriculture besides the three abovementioned forms of direct marketing assistance the presentday government aid to danish agriculture takes the form shown in the

agriculture 10 944 466 practically all of it for agricultural education in production agriculture as is generally known occuies a dominating position in the danish economic scheme of things and the agrarian party the left has fora long period been the largest single political party in the danish parliament this party out of consideration for the export interests of agriculture has always supported the freetrade principle and domestic tariff rates have therefore never played any important part in the development of danish agriculture norway norwegian agriculture owing to the unfavorable geographic and climatic conditions has always labored under a handicap especially as far as grain raising is concerned this fact together with a natural desire to further national selfsufficiency and independence of foreign sources has had a strong influence upon the norwegian governments attitude toward agriculture in the past as well as at present and has led to the enactment of various laws intended to encourage domestic grain raising and agriculture in general the most important example of government assistance to norwegian agriculture is found in the socalled grain monopoly enacted largely as a war measure in 1914 but kept in force until the present time more or less as a direct subsidy to norwegian grain growers what the monopoly has done and still does is in effect this it encourages domestic grain growers by paying to the farmer a price for his grain corresponding to the world market level for imported grain a price which the domestic grain because of its rather inferior quality due to adverse climatic conditions could not otherwise obtain the monopoly after having been in operation for about 12 years is now to be replaced by another arrangement authorized by law of june 16 1926 this law which will go into effect before july 1927 provides that the import and sale of grain and flour except oats of which 15 000 tons must be purchased each year by the government shall be free to all who secure authority for such importation and sale from the appropriate government department and who have fulfilled the requirements regarding purchase of a fixed ratio of domestic grain the law further provides that the state shall purchase all norwegian grain fit for human consumption at prices which correspond to the price of imported grain f o b norwegian port without duty imported grain shall pay a duty of 4 ocre per kilo and the state shall further pay to each farmer a trygd subsidy of 4 ocre per kilo for homegrown grainup to 200 kilos per year per personground by the farmer for his own use of other provisions of the new law the following are of chief interest 1 domestic grain bought by the state is accepted at the same price at all centers designated by the state and for freight from outlying districts to these points the state shall pay a certain compensation 2 the corn trygd of 4 oere per kilo used in own household is payable to the farmer upon presentation of receipt from millers showing amount of grain ground for the farmer 3 importers of grain must buy domestic grain or flour in a certain ratio to the imported amounts the norwegian food administration which now has charge of the temporary import monopoly of grain and flour was organized under the authority of a government decree of august 4 1914 which authorized the establishment of a government foodstuffs commission the foundation of the foodstuffs commission was in the decree defined as follows 1 to regulate the countrys supply of grain flour and other articles of necessity among which coal and coke 2 to regulate the distribution to the various districts of the country and the prices on the various articles the government foodstuffs commission was abolished in september 1916 and it was decided that the matters which had been taken care of by the commission were to be transferred to a temporary government food administration the difficulties which were involved in supplying sufficient food for the countrys needs at that time during the war blockade necessitated the rationing of the most important foodstuffs under these conditions a decree was published making the import of grains flour and sugar a government monopoly after the close of the war all commodities with the exception of grains the importation of which had been controlled by the government during the difficult war years were released as soon as conditions permitted the sugar monopoly being abolished in the government food administration is therefore now only in charge of the importation of grains and flour which still continues as a government monopoly and the present activities and functions of the food administration are therefore confined solely to this monopoly the functions of the monopoly during the war years and as long as it was difficult to secure the necessary supplies of foodstuffs the most important function of the monopoly was to take care of the countrys supply and maintain as large reserve stocks as necessary next in order came the consideration of the domestic production of grain and the state effort for the promotion of agriculture when there no longer existed any danger of shortage of foodstuffs it became the most important duties of the monopoly to extend the cultivation of grain in norway maintain reserve stocks of grain and to care for the purchase and importation of the quantities required by the country according to the decision of the storthing the monopoly must purchase all rye wheat and barley of good quality offered by domestic producers at prices corresponding to those at which foreign grain can be delivered to the producers the difference thus arising between the prices paid for norwegian grains and that paid for imported grains has declined considerably and now only amounts to 2 75 kronen per 100 kilos the purchases of the monopoly as it appears from the foregoing does not include oats this article however as products thereof is subject to an import embargo and dispensation for import of this article is not granted in so far as norwegian oats can be obtained at prices which in comparison with prices on foreign oats can be considered reasonable as there are more than enough mills within the country to satisfy the demand for rolled oats the importation of that product is also generally prohibited the proposal for a permanent grain monopoly which is now before the norwegian storthing provides that prices on grains of domestic production bought by the monopoly must be the same as the monopolys selling price of whole grain import of foreign grains and flour the purchases of the food administration takes place along ordinary business lines the purchases are effected at a moment when the market is considered most favorable and the grains are purchased frop the market offering the most attractive terms thus alternatedly from the united states canada argentine and now also from russia likewise purchases have been made occasionally also from australia and india the rye imports have for a nimber of years taken place from the united states and partly from canada of late purchases have also been made from russia which country has delivered rye of a very satisfactory quality at competitive prices barley has been purchased from the united states as well as fromn european countries wheat flour has chiefly been taken from the united states and canada of late a very considerable portion of the norwegian wheat and wheat flour purchases has been made in canada due to tihe ability of that country to offer the most attractive terms from the foregoing it will be seen that it is only strictly economic and businesslike considerations which determine the government purchases of grains and flour grinding and sales the grains imported by the government as well as the grain raised within the country purchased by the state monopoly is placed in the hands of the mills for storing grinding and sale the state has closed contract with all the mills in the country these mills grind exclusively grains delivered by the monopoly when the imported grain reaches the country it is generally delivered direct to the mills which against a certain compensation receive the grain from the ship transport it to the mill keep it stored and do the grinding selling and shipping at their own risk the mills pay for the grains they receive and colect the money for the sales themselves the resale prices are stipulated by the government food director in the same manner imported flour is left in the hands of the association of grain and flour dealers which distribute the flour to the cooperative selling societies district food commissions and some wholesale dealers not members ofthe above association the business in flour done by the district food commissions is very small and most of them have now discontinued doing business for the wholesale distribution of flour a fixed compensation per 100 kilos is given prices the selling prices for grains and products thereof are fixed by the food director after conference with the minister of agriculture all grain products for human consumption are sold at the same price over the entire country the government bearing all transportation costs in fixing prices the greatest possible stability is sought the prices thus are not changed according to the daily fluctuations of the market quotations and exchange rates but an effort is made to regulate the prices in accordance with any large movements in the world mar ket and as far as it is possible the prices are kept at a level not higher than the world market prices the government changes its prices whenever important movements take place in the world market and likewise whenever changes are deemed practical and desirable this price policy will naturally result in that the monopolys prices in a rising market will be on a lower level than the world market prices and vice versa finally the principle is followed that the state is to have no profit in operating the grain monopoly but on the other hand is not to have any losses because of this it therefore depends entirely upon the purchase dispositions made by the monopoly whether prices can be kept in conformity with world market prices our problem is overproduction in norway it is underproduction and overconsumption there are at present several proposals under discussion in the norwegian parliament aiming to solve the grain question whether it will be solved by monopoly or in some other way it is impossible to say at the present moment the question is under debate by the agricultural committee of the norwegian parliament"], [0.9031350910663605, 0.09686490893363953, 1, "i

the judiciary committee of the house on the impeachment resolution introduced by the gentleman from texas clearly shows that frederick a fenning is absolutely unfit to continue as commissioner of the district of columbia and his removal at the earliest possible date is imperative honest lawabiding citizens who believe in justice must be distinctly disappointed that congress has adjourned and commissioner penning continues in office following adjournment the full responsibility of this existing condition rests squarely upon the president of the united states and his administration the american public can not but reach a conclusion that commissioner fenning is continued in office subsequent to the adjournment of congress due to the fact that the administration desired to save the face of this coolidge appointee it is my opinion that commissioner penning holds an impeachable office as set forth in clear minority reports of the committee on the judiciary even if the congress of the united states would hold after having considered the fenning matter that the office of commissioner is not impeachable action should have been taken to remove penning from office and the department of justice at the direction of the president should have brought penning before the courts in criminal action as by his own testimony and remission of the bond premiums he has not only looted the estates of his incompetent wards but has committed an offense in so doing which warrants imprisonment in a penal institution the exploitation by penning of his incompetent helpless wards alone shows his unfitness to act in any public capacity either as a fiduciary attorney or district commissioner penning entered upon his duties as district commissioner on june 5 1925 and without hearing or trial this 12 day old commissioner demoted inspector headley who had rendered faithfully the duties of his position before the judiciary committee there was introduced a confidential memorandum to mr penning prepared by traffic director eldridge in the nature of a postmortem defense this memorandum as was admitted by fenning and his counsel was prepared subsequent to the demotion of inspector headley with a view of presenting it to a congressional investigating committee the statement is based on hearsay and is without substance in fact it shows clearly the guilt of fenning as it was manufactured subsequent to the demotion and in order to be used as a defense the arbitrary removal of dr edward c wilson to create a vacancy for a physician who was ineligible but personally desired by ferming also can not be defended these two actions are reprehensible in the extreme and show a tyranny and brazenness which could only be expected from officials under the old czar of russias rdgime as commissioner of the district of columbia penning approved contracts which resulted in commissioner rudolph receiving financial benefits amounting to thousands of dollars the letting of these contracts and resultant financial benefit to rudolph which fenning approved is not only immoral from a public standpoint but incompatible with the public interest and illegal in passing i may state that commissioner rudolph should also be removed from his office patients from all sections of the country have been hospitalized at st elizabeths a governmental institution for the care of the insane dr william a white the head of that institution testified on page 614 of the hearings before the judiciary committee that in the lunacy proceedings since january 1 1919 the total number of cases at st elizabeths hospital in which penning has appeared was 209 that of these he appeared as attorney or attorney and guardian in 206 and as guardian alone in 163 it is further revealed from the testimony before the judiciary committee pages 23 to 35 that from january 1 1919 to may 24 1926 the time the report was made by the director of the veterans bureau penning was serving as committee for 76 veterans bureau incompetent beneficiaries on may 24 1926 the date of the report and that from the estates of such 76 veterans bureau beneficiaries penning had received in fees 75 688 10 in 44 cases of veterans bureau beneficiaries in which penning had acted as fiduciary from january 1 1919 to may 18 1926 the date of the report and discharged as committee by reason of death of the ward or otherwise he had received as fees 13 379 03 making a total which he has received on world war veterans cases alone from january 1 1919 to may 24 1926 of 89 067 13 it must be also understood that penning received thousands of dollars in fees from other wards for whom he was acting as guardian during the period in question it may be interesting to note that page 46 of the hearings show that fenning was discharged from the quartermaster corps united states army on march 15 1919 and that page 24 of the record shows that penning was appointed guardian of joe grabowski on march 14 1919 on pennings petition therefore exhibiting the sorry spectacle of an officer of the united states army appearing in court to petition for his own appointment as guardian of a world war veteran when he had no moral or legal right so to do let us consider a typical case of pennings immoral and illegal exploitation of the estate of one of his many wards i will cite the case of samuel fizel a beneficiary of the veterans bureau under compensation claim no c 212388 who was discharged from the military service of the united states a complete mental wreck on may 15 1919 frederick a fenning was appointed committee for this veteran by the supreme court of the district of columbia upon petition executed by the brother george fizel then a resident of wisconsin and filed by penning in the testimony before the committee much stress was laid by fenning and his counsel upon the fact that these veteran cases in which he was subsequently appointed guardian were called to his attention by the bureau of war risk insurance it is very clear from the letters forwarded to penning by the bureau advising him that an incompetent had compensation due and was in need of a guardian that there was an undercover man of penning an employee of the bureau who was closely cooperating with penning to notify him promptly of the fact in order that he fenning might take steps to have himself promptly appointed guardian in order to exploit the incompetent veterans estate there was no excuse for the bureaus notifying penning in the fizel case that this veteran needed a guardian as the bureau had official record of the name and address of the veterans brother george fizel boyceville wis and had official record of the fact that the veterans father was living in europe the initial letter in the fizel case from the bureau to fenning did not request that fenning be appointed guardian letter june 6 1919 p 1097 hearings however fenning transmitted a letter to the wards brother in wisconsin in which he inclosed a blank petition for the brother to sign requesting that penning be appointed guardian in his said letter to the brother who was next of kin to the veteran fenning suggested that he penning be appointed guardian and pointedly inclosed the petition pennings letter above described was on his letterhead stationery of his law office and is clear and unmistakable evidence of soliciting guardianship business a practice shunned by upstanding and honest members of the legal profession see pp 1081 and 1082 hearings pennings statement that he did not solicit business is absolutely false the petition for the appointment of penning as guardian to samuel fizel signed by his brother george fizel was printed on the office folder of frederick a penning attorney and counselor at law the petition was filed in court on june 24 1919 by penning and after a verdict of a jury on june 27 1919 penning was appointed committee by the court on that date see exhibit 14 hearings from the time of his appointment to this day penning as committee has filed six accounts the last one being filed on october 20 1925 see exhibit 14 hearings during the period of fennings guardianship ending october 20 1925 the date of the lastaccounting it appears that fizels income amounted to well over 11 000 of this penning as guardian allowed to fizel for clothing dental work and spending money 710 52 but during this period penning as committee took unto himself commissions amounting to 1 183 07 more than half again as much as fizel received out of his own estate a clerk in pennings office received 7 for notarial fees and the bonding company for which mr penning was agent received 153 67 in premiums on fiduciary bonds of this 153 67 penning as bonding agent for his own bonds personally received 38 77 it is clear therefore that under his administration of guardianship penning arranges to receive more benefit from the wards estate than the ward himself receives this ward was transferred to a wisconsin hospital almost 1 000 miles away from penning on april 22 1920 and according to pennings own testimony he has not seen the ward since that date even while the ward was at st elizabeths from june 17 1919 to april 22 1920 penning failed to render the personal attention due a ward from a fiduciary in pennings statements of accounts during the period fizel was at st elizabeths he sets forth that he saw the ward frequently this is a stereotyped assertion set forth in a stereotyped form umsed in each one of his cases of his various wards and his assertion is in no way substantiated by facts p 1082 hearings pennings own testimony shows that his personal contact with all of his wards while hospitalized at st elizabeths was negligible in pennings stereotyped form of accounts in which he asks for his commission he mentions purchasing clothing at a discount pennings testimony clearly shows that in every expenditure of this nature for any of his wards penning himself did not personally purchase the clothing but his activity in attending to his wards personal needs consisted in signing the checks to pay for the clothing and a government employee of st elizabeths on government time made the actual purchases for pennings wards page 1083 hearings during the many years since fizel has been in wisconsin pennings contacts with his ward have all been through some casual third party and up to this time he has no actual firsthand knowledge as to what clothing has been furnished whether the expenditures were judiciously made or whether in fact the ward received any benefit from the funds expended for said purpose in order to bring to the attention of the house the excessive fees demanded by penning i would respectfully refer you to pennings account in the fixel case filed october 20 1925 a date subsequent to fennings assuming his office as district commissioner this accounting covers the period from the date of filing the prior account october 22 1924 to october 20 1925 for this period penning asks for a 10 per cent commission or 180 40 which was allowed by the court in setting forth the services performed by him upon which this commission is based fenning stated thatthe committee has conducted correspondence throughout the year with the wisconsin psychiatric institute where the ward is an inmateand stated that he also has conducted correspondence with the united states veterans bureau and with the american red cross service at the wisconsin psychiatric institute in the testimony before the committee penning stated that he had had no direct correspondence with his ward page 1089 hearings immediately upon the printing of the hearings carrying the above evidence i wired the wisconsin psychiatric institute the american red cross service at that institute and the wards brother george fizel at menominee fails wis to ascertain the extent of pennings correspondence during the year referred to the wisconsin psychiatric institute wired me as follows three letters writtefi our institution from october 22 1924 to october 20 1925 by frederick fenning guardian samuel fizel the american red cross at the wisconsin psychiatric institute wired me as follows we received two iciters from samuel fizels guardian frederick a fenning between dates mentioned the american red cross at menominee falls replied to my telegram to george fizel as follows last direct correspondence fenning re samuel fizel to george october 1922 according to files i directed an inquiry on june 15 1926 to the veterans bureau to ascertain the extent of pennings correspondence with them in the case of samuel fizel as testified to by penning and received the bureaus reply on june 19 1926 as follows in reply to your other communication of june 15 requesting information as to the total number of communications that the bureau received from mr fenning as guardian of this claimant during the period from october 22 1924 to october 20 1925 you are advised that the files indicate that one letter was addressed to the bureau it is incontrovertible that pennings statement that he maintained close contact with his wards is absolutely false it is monstrous that on this kind of alleged guardianship he should claim a 10 per cent commission or that the courts should allow it the fizel accounting above described is typical of all of pennings accounts in all cases in which he has been appointed guardian on june 18 1926 frederick a penning as guardian of samuel fzel filed a petition in the supreme court of the district asking that the wards estate be credited with the 38 77 which penning had personally rveived as commissions collected on the fiduciary bonds which were filed at the expense of the estate to the amount of 153 67 this is a clear admission of appropriating for his own use funds which morally and lawfully he was not entitled to the department of justice should undertake proceedings against penning for violation of criminal law by reason of embezzlement of funds of his ward not only has the estate standing to the account of the veteran fizel been looted by penning but it has also suffered financial loss through maladministration to wit penning was appointed guardian on june 17 1919 claim for compensation had been filed prior to that date and a temporary total rating was allowed upon assuming his duties as guardian penning continued to pay the premiums on the veterans warrisk insurance he failed to request the veterans bureau to rate the man permanent and total until november 26 1920 more than 18 months after his fiduciary appointment the veteran was entitled from the date penning was appointed guardian to care for his estate to a permanent and total rating which he should have had and which would have given fizel monthly payments on the warrisk insurance and permitted cessation of payments of the premiums for 18 months fizels estate was drained of insurance premiums by reason of pennings negligence and for 18 months the estate failed to receive the insurance payments due it under the law even after november 26 1920 when penning finally requested the bureau for a permanent and total rating for fzel his ward penning exhibited an absolute lack of diligence in caring for this phase of the claim on december 2 1920 the veterans bureau acknowledged pennings letter above described fenning did not take further action in the matter for two and a half months and on february 17 1921 he wrote the veterans bureau a followup the bureau replied on march 28 1921 and one month and a half later may 13 1921 penning again followed up p 1097 hearings on june 3 1921 the permanent and total rating was made by the bureau and the insurance made payable on june 21 1921 an adjustment check of 1 849 58 was sent penning as guardian on july 31 1921 to cover retroactive insurance payments see second account exhibit 14 under capable guardianship a 25 months delay would not have occurred to complete this proceeding and the ifisurance premium payments to and including july 1921 would not have had to be made it is clear beyond a shadow of doubt that through maladministration incompetency and gross neglect the veterans estate has suffered a financial loss as the money unnecessarily paid out for this length of time on premiums as well as the money which should have been received prior to july 31 1921 on the insurance would have produced income in the fizel case the original petition in lunacy filed by penning shows that this ward had a father joe fizel residing in europe penning repeatedly states that a fiduciary should act in the same capacity in which the ward would act were he not of unsound mind up to the time of the closing of the hearing before the judiciary committee frederick a fenning admitted before that committee that he did not know whether his wards father was living or dependent see p 10911092 hearings under legislation enacted for the care of disabled veterans of the world war and their dependents this father would be entitled to certain compensation benefits were he alive and dependent this dependency has not been determined through the gross negligence of fenning furthermore under the act of june 7 1924 as amended by the act of march 4 1925 an incompetent veteran who has been hospitalized by the bureau for six months has his compensation reduced from 100 to 20 monthly in case he has no dependents this veterans compensation has been so reduced effective january 1 1925 and fenning has admitted that he has not protested the reduction and has not determined whether the reduction was legal for he has not determined whether his ward has a dependent fennings testimony on pages 1091 and 1092 sets forth that the veterans bureau should ascertain whether the ward has dependents it is well known that the bureau does not conduct investigations and present dependency claims the veterans themselves make claim for dependents and the bureau merely makes an adjudication of the evidence submitted by the claimant it is a wellknown legal and moral principle that a guardian should not derive pecuniary profit from his wards estate other than the fiduciary commission allowed by the court the evidence clearly shows and it is admitted by fenning that the funds of this ward and all others have been deposited in a bank in which fenning is a director and stockholder p 1084 hearings plainly he has a pecuniary interest in his wards estates on tleposit in a bank in which he has financial interest furthermore he has pecuniarily benefited from his wards estates as the fiduciary bond premiums paid out of fizels and all of his other wards estates were paid to a surety company where fenning the guardian became fenning the bond agent and received a 25 per cent commission on the bonds he sold to himself fenning and his counsel in their testimony before various committees of the house made the flaccid defense that fenning did not return these commissions to the estates of the wards because he would violate certain statutes which prevent rebating that fenning ever had such an altruistic idea is altogether doubtful but if he had there are plenty of other bonding companies from whom the bonds could have been purchased in order to escape the rebating clause the decision in the adolph adler lunacy case 7742 shows the fallacy of his claim to the bonding commissions and a conscientious honest guardian would not have permitted himself to act as bond salesman to receive commissions from bonds bought with his wards money fennings receiving commission as bondingcompany agent is reprehensible also since fenning became commissioner as the commissioners of the district of columbia have jurisdiction over bonding companies and bondingcompany agents according to fennings admission since a bondingcompany agent must investigate and pass upon the reliability and integrity of the person to whom a sale of a bond is being made a bonding company which permits its agents to write bonds for themselves is acting in contravention of sound business and public policy and should not be permitted to do business in the district of columbia pp 10931095 hearings the evidence clearly indicates that fenning became an agent of a bonding company solely for the purpose of selling bonds to himself and pocketing the commission iis attempted justification of his questionable business methods on the ground that it simplified and expedited his work is ridiculous since a telephone call would bring in many bonding company agents only too anxious to sell fiduciary bonds volume i of modern treatment of mental and nervous diseases by white and jelliffe contains a chapter numbered 17 entitled the application of legal measures in their remedial bearings by frederick a fenning ll b ll m in this chapter fenning states on pages 723 and 724 the fiduciary appointed regardless of whether he is serving as to the person or the estate or both is simply the arm of the court and all that he does in performance of the trust reposed in him is subject to the review of the court for acts which do not meet with the courts approval he is likely to be reprimanded or removed from office and for losses incurred through neglect negligence incompetence or fraud he is liable to punishment or suit for damages on page 724 fenning further states the fiduciary is expected to keep the lunatic in as much comfort as regards lodging board and surroundings as the finances of the estate will permit the two fundamental obligations upon the fiduclary in caring for a lunatic are first to see that the ward gets every comfort attention a1 pleasure in keeping with his station in life and with his desires and within the bounds of his financial ability and second to endeavor to act for the ward as the ward himself would act were he mentally normal on page 725 he further states the fiduciary properly to discharge his trust should frequently visit the ward the actual reasonable expenses of such visits are a proper charge against the wards funds and the fiduciary will be credited with the same there must be no abuse of privilege in this respect the visits being made solely for the purpose of a proper performance of the duty of the fiduciary on the same page also appears the following if the fiduciary fail to account at the time required by law or when so directed by the court the court may properly refuse to allow compensation to him for services and compensation will be denied a fiduciary who is guilty of any manner of neglect in the discharge of his duties fenning states on page 726 for services faithfully rendered the fiduciary will be allowed compensation from the funds of the ward the rate of such compensation being fixed by the court this rate is usually in the discretion of the court although in some jurisdictions it is regulated by statute whether regulated by statute or not the compensation of a fiduciary in a lunacy case is generally from 3 to 10 per cent of the funds received by him for the ward the evidence clearly shows that fenning a professional fiduciary for incompetent wards fails to practice what he writes the journal of the american medical association of february 18 1911 volume 16 pages 489492 contains a paper entitled the discharge of lunatics by habeas corpus proceedings by frederick a fenning ll m of the bar of the district of columbia this paper states in part certain leeches of the legal profession exist in every community and there is a form of this species which fastens itself on hospital patients if there ever has been a leech among the legal profession which could compare in viciousness to the man who made the abovequoted statement he is yet to be found the fizel case which i have centered upon is only typical of hundreds in the grasp of this master leech the preponderance of unrefuted testimony shows fenning to be a professional unprincipled exploiter of those incompetents who should receive every consideration through improper and reprehensible methods he has diligently and ingeniously connived to exploit incompetent citizens in such a manner as to wring financial gain from their misfortune his acts are unethical immoral and illegal he is wholly unfit for any official position of trust or responsibility and is unfit to continue as a member of the bar any decent upright american citizen must revolt at the thought of a man who so flagrantly violates tl~e law of the land and its moral principles and exploits poor helpless incompetents including those whose incompetence and helplessness was caused through their faithful service to the american people and government in time and stress of war fenning asserts that in his capacity as committee or guardian he is the arm of the court the american people must look to the courts who have created fenning their arm in their fiduciary capacity to remove him from such capacity without any delay he is wholly unfit to act as fiduciary for one incompetent human wreck not alone the hundreds for whom he is so acting for his own financial gain i wish to again state that frederick a fenning commissioner of the district is an impeachable officer and should have been impeached by congress before its adjournment in the absence of congress acting he should have been immediately removed by the president of the united states the supreme court of the district of columbia should immediately remove fenning from all fiduciary capacities in the accounting and turning over of assets to new fiduciaries the supreme court should require that every penny received by fenning as committee fees should also be turned over with the estates of the wards in cases where he has profited from his wards estates by diverting the bond premium commission to his own personal use and where he has failed properly to protect the interests of his ward it will be a sad period in american history when the people of the nation lose faith in the judiciary in order that they may not lose this faith should the supreme court of the district of columbia permit the cunning exploiter to continue to act as fiduciary the congress of the united states should act toward a change of personnel of that court if this congress does not act to protect these unfortunate incompetents i have full faith that the american people will change the makeup of congress so that congress will act the millions of veterans who have served the nation in times of war will not permit the exploitation of their unfortunate incompetent comrades to go unchallenged they will show the same determination and indomitable spirit at the battles of the ballot box as they showed on the battle field of war"], [0.889190249145031,
