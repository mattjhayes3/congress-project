as lio has stated his objections to the house i must address a few words to him in the hearing of the house upon his criticisms on the penal sections of the bill the committee with the single exception of the gentleman from georgia agree that the bill is right he says he would not have the penal sections of the bill because we are to give foreigners the benefits of those provisions where we do not give then to our own citizens i ask his attention to the language of the first section which provides that owners of trademarks used in commerce with foreign nations or with the indian tribes provided such owners shall be domiciled in the united states or located in any foreign country that is in treaty with us may obtain registration c who are the two classes of persons to be benefited by this penal legislation first owners of trademarks resident in the united states secondly owners resident in other countries bound to the united states by treaty that is all i care to say upon that point i think the gentleman will see at once that our citizens are in this respect placed upon an equality with citizens of foreign countries in the next place my friend says that the punishment is too severe let me follow his reasoning he instances the case of seduction on the high seas the punishment for which is provided in section 5349 of the revised statutes lie says that the criminal upon conviction for this offense is punished by a fine of 1 000 or by twelve months imprisonment but what says my friend from georgia in the next sentence death he says would be too good for the scoundrel if we had him in georgia he says we would put him in the penitentiary for twenty years what is the logic of that that in section 5349 the penalty is not severe enough the trouble is not that our proposed legislation in this bill is too severe if the penalty in section 5349 is not severe enough for the case of seduction i will join him in making it severer i think he will see the logic of his own remarks in the next place his criticism is while imitations under the patent laws are punishable only by a penalty of 100 and that is the fact yet we provide a severer penalty and more stringent measures hereafter to reach imitations so we do but let us compare the two under the trademark law you have the civil right against the party who pirates or adopts your trademark but there you are limited except under the penal sections then you follow the person who counterfeits or who fraudulently uses your trademark but go to the patent laws you not only have the right to prosecute the man who infringes by manufacture by imitation but you can follow every individual user the country over and you and i are liable to the suit of any patentee on the smallest article we may carry in the pocket if we have it contrary to the rights of the patentee therefore it is not necessary that the patentee should be protected by such stringent legislation in addition to what is now provided and there is therefore abundant reason why the trademark provision should be supplemented by some penal statute and it is true that the provisions which are ingrafted in this bill as the penal sections bear a strong resemblance to the provisions punishing the counterfeiting of money and they should from the very nature of things the attempt of a party who seeks to pirate my trademark is in the direction of an imitation by counterfeiting you punish somebody for counterfeiting the current money of the united states right you also would punish a man under this provision who would counterfeit my property in the trademark he ought to be punished it is a form of theft it is insidious it is secret it reaches out into the trade and not only wrongs me but is an imposition on other men who purchase the article relying on my commercial signature otherwise called my trademark therefore there ought to be some stringent legislation my friends objection after all is not sound when he says there should be no penal legislation attached to this bill and he intimated he would move to strike it out i beg his attention to this that every state except three that has given us trademark laws has attached to those laws the penalty of imprisonment for their infraction every one why in nebraska it is not exceeding twenty years if i am right about it and the other states range down i believe in kentucky and indiana there is a money fine only but if it is right to protect the trademark at all theo we should give the owners of trademarks that protection which will be efficient every state which has legislated on it has found it necessary to have penal legislation for the enforcement of the law therefore by abundance of reasoning and by experience we should if we have here a trademark law make it efficient by the same class of penalty but my friend says you are multiplying offenses before the united states courts and he regrets that prosecutions are multiplied no man regrets more than i that the courts are troubled anywhere in this land state or national for the prosecution of anybody for violation of the law but in the gentlemans state as well as in my own there will be found i presume for many years to come men who are not sufficiently mindful of the rights of their neighbors men who will take what does not belong to them and it has always been the policy of the law to restrain them by the strong arm if necessary therefore if it is sonnd we should have this legislation it is also only logical we should go forward and maintain it by sufficient provisions i submit to my friend when he says the states have lone right in their lcgislaion that the state legislation seems to be efficient and sufficient the country over mainly it is because that penal legislation has been sustained and when he and i therefore find it necessary to supplement the state legislation by national acts we shall also go forward of course to make our congressional legislation efficient as well i will not of course go into the punishment of these persons and where they are sent or the presence of united states courts or the frequency of the visits of the marshals i want to say that i believe that when the whole people of this country become better acquainted with the united states courts and the evidences of their power and authority they will have a great deal more respect and reverence for them i hope the time will come when everywhere in this country the power of the united states shall be just as highly respected and just as ardently and fondly cherished as the power of any citizens own state it is the state and the union together and i know my friend joins with me in that he has none of that unpleasant distrust for the united states courts carry them if you want to every mans door so that he sees their salutary operation every day and i think he will rise in the morning and go to sleep at night proud in the presence of the power of the nation i would not therefore strike out these provisions of the bill because they arenecessary to give life and force and strength and success to it and i would not strike them odt again for any narrow reason that we may sometimes if we should offend against this law be called upon by the national power to respond for that disobedience i have nothing further to say in advocacy of the bill

cur with the gentleman from indiana in the policy of erecting or in augurating a highschool system in this district i believe it i proper for every government to furnish school facilities for all the children within its borders i believe that these facilities ought to be equal and offered equally to all classes of its children but i do not believe that any special privileges should be offered to any if this high school is inaugurated as proposed by the bill then some hundred or it may be a greater or less number of the children of this district will have afforded to them highschool privileges while the balance of the children of this district must be content with commonschool privileges and it will make a distinction between the children of this district which will breed discontent between the poor who enjoy only the commonschool facilities and those who enjoy the higher school facilities i believe it is the policy of this government and of the district of columbia to afford the best commonschool facilities to all and when a student in one of these common schools desires to pursue the higher branches of education he ought to do it at his own expense therefore i think it is eminently judicious and wise that this highschool feature of the appropriation bill shall be stricken out and that the 70 000 in the washington schoolfend bonds shall be appropriated to building schoolhouses for commonschool purposes and that sum of 70 000 will build two most excellent schoolhouses of the ordinary style having twelve rooms each furnishing twentyfour additional schoolrooms for the accommodation of the children of the district and i trust that this committee will not take from the amount necessary to carry on rapidly the replacement of the rotten pavements of the district by appropriating that amount to highschool purposes or any other the next provision of this bill to which i call the attention of the committee is on page 4 it is for support of the indigent insane in the district of columbia in the government hospital for the insane in said district as provided in sections 4843 4844 and 4850 of the revised statutes 80 000 now until last yeari am not certain i am right in thatthere was no appropriation in the district appropriation bill for the support of the indigent insane in the government hospital but it was a government institution supported by government contributions alone last year the committee on appropriations introduced this item into this bill and after a long conference between the committees of conference of the twq houses after hearing evidence and having all the parties before them they fixed upon the sum of 37 000 as the proper sum to be paid by the district of columbia in this appropriation bill and that amount was inserted in the last appropriation bill for the district of columbia this bill departs from that agreement thus entered into between the two houses and puts the amount up to the sum of 80 000 which is greatly beyond the share which the district of columbia ought to pay in regard to these asylums and charitable objects i desire to call the attention of the house to the provision of the organic act which will be found on page 104 of the statutes at large second session fortyfifth congress volume 20 i need not remind the committee that this act called the organic act providing a government for the district of columbia provided what should be paid for by the district and what should be paid for by the federal government and what should be paid for jointly by the district government and the federal government it was provided in this bill that all the appropriations made for the support of the district government should be paid onehalf by the federal government and the other half by the districtgovernment thecommissionerswere to estimatewbat would be necessary for the expenses of the district for each fiscal year at the beginning of each session of congress and were to send their estimates to the secretary of the treasury the secretary of the treasury was to pass upon those estimates and send them back to the district commissioners and the district commissioners were then to send them to the house now what were they to estimate for under the organic act the said commissioners shall submit to the secretary of tile treasury for the fiscal year ending june 30 1829 and annually thereafter for his examination and approval a statement showing in detail the work proposed to be undertaken by thee during the fiscl 3ear nxt cnsuiug and the estinated cost thereof else the cost of constructing ropairing and maintaining all bridaesauthorized by law across the potomac river within the district of columbia and also all other streams in said district now follows the clause to which i desire to call the attention of the committee specially the cost of maintaining all public instituitons of charity reformatories and prisons belonging to or controlled wholly or in part by the district of columbia and which are now by law supported wholly orinpartby the united states or dis trict of columbia so that the only institutions of charity reformatories or prisons which the commissioners for the district had a power to estimate for by law were those belonging to or controlled wholly or in part by a the district of columbia and which are now by law supported wholly or in part by the united states or district of columbia so that to bring within this appropriation bill any charitable object or the support of any prison or reform school or anything of the sort two things must concur it must at the date of the act have belonged to or been controlled wholly or in part by the district of columbia and must have been provided for prior to that time either wholly or in part by the united states or the district of columbia now i think gentlemen will find upon consulting the statutes that this government hospital for the insane in the district of columbia is a federal institution not belonging to or controlled wholly or in part by the district of columbia and if that bo the case then the commissioners of the district and the secretary of the treasury have no right to include it in the estimates of appropriations for the district of columbia and i take it neither the gentleman from indiana nor any other gentleman on the floor of this house can show anywhere in any of the statutes that this was an establishment owned by or controlled either wholly or in part bythe district of columbia at the date of the passage of the act a clause of which i have just read if that be the case it is not within the power of this house according to the law as it stands to appropriate anything for the indigent insane in this government hospital bnt if the committee should think otherwise then i say do not raise the appropriation from 37 000 the amount agreed upon in a conference between the two houses at the last session of congress to 80 000 which is greatly beyond what ought to be paid by the district for this purpose under any circumstances then there is an appropriation in this bill for maintaining the jail which is not embraced within the organic act at all and which i believe i can say with some degree of certainty has never been introduced into an appropriation bill of the district of columbia well now what is this jail does it come within this organic act unquestionably not the jail is a federal institution regulated entirely by federal laws and with its government the district of columbia has nothing whatever to do if gentlemen of the committee of the whole will tarn to page 124 of the revised statutes of the district of columbia they will find that the jail is entirely under the control of the federal government the district government has no part or lot in controlling or owning the jail in this district unless it is embraced in the terms of the organic act the appropriation for its support cannot properly be embraced in the bill making appropriations for the support of the government for the district of columbia i call attention to these things to show that the committee on ap propriations depart from the law when they undertake to makethe district of columbia pay its part forthe support of the indigent insane in the government hospital and for the support and maintenance of the prisoners in the government jail i beg leave to state to the committee of the whole that the committee of which i have the honor to be the chairman has considered all these questions with some care and i believe i am speaking the sentiments of the

points of difference conceded by the house were embraced in what is known as the vetoed legislative appropriation bill the committee on appropriations in preparing this bill did not put into it everything that was included in the vetoed bill the senate rather insisted upon tmbraeing a great many things which were in the vetoed bill and come of those items which were nonconeurredin by the house have been conceded by the house conferees in this report and we have grred to most of them first we have given two watchmen as an addition to the capitol police force we have done this upon the application of the architect of the capitol building the sergeantatarms of the senate and the sergeantatarms of tfie house this is deemed necessary for the protection of the capitol and of the public property within the capitol building the next point and one of the most important perhaps is this the house made an appropriation for stationery for this extra session for aembers of the house it was the intention to have embraced in that amendment stationery for senators but by accident that was left out that made no difference however for the senate nonconcurred in that amendment and it is left out by the conference report an amendment of the senate gave 4 000 additional for the forenen and laborers on the public grounds last year the sum of 24 000 was appropriated for that purpose in the legislative appropriation bill in the enrollment of the bill only 20 000 was inserted and afterward in the sundry civil bill 4 000 was appropriated in reenacting this year the legislative appropriation bill of last year this item of 21 000 was inserted in this bill although it really was intended to give l4 000 for that purpose this report supplies that deficit we added e500 for the contingent expenses of the court of claims the soenate insisted upon 5 000 for the library of congress for works of art in which the house nonconcurred that item however the conferees have conceded the senate insisted upon 1 500 additional pay for the postmaster at tucson territory of arizona as a depositary for the government by the conference report that sum is reduced to e800 the salary of that postmaster is now 1 700 a year but as there is no depositary for several hundred miles around that point the conferees on the part of the house thought that we had probably batter give that additional sum to him to act as a depositary for the government in regard to the patent office the senate added fourteen additional copyists tome folders and one or two laborers the report of the committee of conference divides the number and gives half the proposed increase the senate conferees receded from their demand for five principal clerks for the land office they already have three we give to the secretary of thointerior upon the very urgent demand of fhatofficer a stenographer at 1 100 a year additional force is also allowedto the assistant attorneygeneral in the interior department that force was provided in the vetoed bill but was not embraced in the legislative bill which passed the house a few days ago the senate insisting upon it the house conferees have agreed to it in tlie matter of the bureau of education the senate insisted upon 1451tl 011 as necessary for the distribution of books and publicationsby the bureau of education to the various educational institutions of t x130 the country last year 9 000 was given for that purpose but that was not considered sufficient and the house conferees have agreed to the amendment of the senate these are the material pointsi may say they are all the pointsof difference so far as money is concerned the house conferees agreed to the amendment of the senate no 33 that portion of the bill which the senate struck out proposed to amend the law for the disbursement of the 75 000 appropriated in the sundry civil act the last but one for the laborers of the district of columbia that has always been considered bya great many gontlemen as a mere bonus to these labarrs our reason for doing this i will state it seems that the parties representing these laborers disagree among themselves the very counsel who have appeared before the conmittee of conference and who appeared before the committee on appropriations of this house have always disagreed as to the form in which a law on this subject should be drawn having had so much misunderstanding being unable to arrive at any definite form of enactment by which the meritorious laborers should get their pay if any is due them or by which the persons to whom congress intended to make a donation should receive their money without the intervention of intermediaries or counsel receiving large fees the committee on the part of the house agreed to the demand on the part of the senate and strnck out that section of the bill leaving the law as it stands to day in the sundry civil appropriation net this bill as agreed to by the committee of conference embraces appropriations to the amount of 15 780 272 50 this amount is 33 879 in excess of the amount of the appropriation act for the legislative executive and judicial expenses of the

in any way the only question is what is a fair number for this legislative body what number can you take and what can you fairly give where there are very large fractions you are not bound to give any for fractions it is a matter of equity you may arbitrarily divide the population and leave the matter there and in a long series of years the injustice to the various states would be equalized the individual member grows less and less in importance as the body grows larger in numbers his state has no more power from her increased number of representatives and he himself has less the body the legislative unit itself becomes less effective both the body and the individual member as the number increases you gain nothing in the average by increasing the whole number as you run along up the numbers from two hundred and ninetythree to three hundred and one three hundred and seven three hundred and eleven three hundred and nineteen three hundred and twentyfive and three hundred and twentynine there are states all the way up which obtain certain advantages but they are obtained at the expense of other states i care very little whether at a certain station the republicans gain four or the democrats gain four in the end the gains amount to very little in comparison with the whole looking over the ten years to come the gains are small are temporary are mere accidents of the elections the next election may give twentyfive republican majority here i hope it will give at least fifteen or it may give a small democratic majority but in laying down rules for the good of the whole nation i do not care to regard that matter unless i find a disposition to adopt a particular number for the sake of gaining some advantage of that sort in that case i might feel driven to meet that disposition with an attempt to adopt another number which would give no state any advantage for example between the numbers two hundred and ninetythree and three hundred and eleven i would take three hundred and nine but i am content to stop at three hundred and one with the gentleman from new york whom i thank for his statesmanlike speech gentlemen forget sometimes that running along up in the numbers their states lose largely so long as the number of the representatives of your state remains fixed you lose power by the increase of the total of the house take my own state of connecticut fortunately in one sense we retain our four members by a very heavy fraction there is no change in the representation of connecticut at any point in raising the total from two hundred and ninetythree to three hundred and twentynine i called upon my friend mr elliott the statistician of the treasury department to verify and accurately extend certain calculations i find that as we go from two hundred and ninetythree to three hundred and twentynine connecticut loses 10 94 substantially 11 per cent of her proportionate pow~r because the total increases while her delegation remains unchanged i call attention to a table prepared by mr elliott which i will print with my remarks because it may be interesting to some gentlemen it shows proportionate losses during the successive stages of an increase of the total we study long in order to ascertain how we may gain a member in this state or that state forgetting that in order to reach that gain we proportionately rob some other state toil

bill is a proper commentary on the history of our dealings with the sioux tribe of indians which is one of the most disgraceful in the long story of our dealings with and treatment of the indians in this country in 1868 a commission composed of intelligent highminded and philanthropic gentlemen was sent out to the plains they had no earthly knowledge of the indian country or of the indian question but were filled with christian zeal and philanthropy they gave to these sioux indians lands which never belonged to the dakota tribes they removed the poncas from lands which did belong to them they also entered into the treaty with the ute indians and gave them the vast reservation which has caused the government so much trouble under that treaty they gave to the sioux indians a large portion of the crow reservation and settled the crows upon lands that were occupied by the whites consequently with the very best intentions in the world through the ignorance of the country and the questions they have managed to bring more complications into oe dealings with the indians than any and all other indian commissions which have brought trouble and difficulty time out of mind under that treaty we abandoned a line of road from cheyenne to montana arid we abandoned it after the massacre of fort fetterman when these indians without warning surprised and slaughtered a great number of our soldiers we abandoned that country we gave up our forts we tore down our flags and the sioux followed our retreating army and scouted at it in contempt asit marched away that surrender led to all the indian complications we have had there since it led to the indian war in which custer was killed to be sure there was only a portion of these indians engaged in that battle those under crazy horse the rest of the hostile indians having gone north of the line are still hostile and still making incursions upon our border but ar chairman we did buy this peace with these indians our government was stampeded and we agreed to pay the sioux this tribute just as the old roman empire in the time of its decadence paid tribute to the horde of barbarians which ravaged its border we purchased this peace and i presume the best thing to do now is for the government to pay the purchasemoney i never believed in the policy of purchasing peace in that way and do not believe in it now

certainly ought to be cheaper notwithstanding the general revival of business in the east more flour and beef is produed in the neighborhood of these tribes bet we of the west want such provision made as will prevent complications we do not want indian wars it has often been said here upon this floor and it is flippantly asserted in the newspapers that the people on the frontier want indian wars because they make money out of them gentlemen who talk that way do not know what an indian war means and not onlydo they fail to realize the terrors of an indian war but they do not know even what horrors follow in the train of even the rumor of an indian war it means homes deserted crops loft rotting in the fields stock abandoned in the pastures and war itself means murder rapine and destruction everywhere it means emigration checked and the whole tide of development rolled back it means everything ruinous and destructive to the opening prospects of new settlement it means years of distrust fear nights of horror to children and women and of dread and apprehension to their natural defenders why sir when i have heard gentlemen flippantly say your people on the frontier want an indian war i have felt like turning to them and replying that when the people of chicago for instance shall buradown their nagnificent commercialpalaces and theprincelyresidences which line their avenues in order to get the charitable contributions of the world or when the people of the south shall invite into their midst the yellow pestilence which during the past year has turned their homes into hospitals and their religious shrines into charnelhouses and their cities into cemeteries of the deadwhen they shall themselves introduce this dread disease in order to obtain the gifts of the
