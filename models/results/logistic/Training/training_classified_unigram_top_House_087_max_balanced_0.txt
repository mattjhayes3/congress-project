that our government does less toward the support of art and culture than any civilized nation in fact almost nothing soviet russia spends a great deal on cultural programs and all the free nations of europe subsidize to some extent their art and artists to win the cold war we must gain ascendency over the minds of men we have sorely neglected the role a nations art and culture play in accomplishing this we have impressed people by our intellectual attainments material possessions including armaments and power but it is only through a nations arts and literature that other nations discover it has a soul although we have created a great political and economic democracy we have not yet created a great cultural democracya democracy that vigorously consciously and purposefully helps bring the enduring values of the arts into our own daily lives as well as to the peoples of other lands i think however that the united states is on the eve of a tremendous and fruitful cultural explosion which could be triggered by government recognition and support of the performing and other arts congressmen have been battling public apathy and private pressures ever since i can remember in an effort to provide federal encouragement to cultural activities a great deal of legislation has been introduced in congress toward this important goal in his 1955 state of the union message president eisenhower said the federal government should do more to give official recognition to the importance of the arts and other cultural activities he proposed a permanent federal advisory commission under the department of health education and welfare the proposal passed the senate but was too late for action in the house this editorial by the brilliant and distinguished mrs luce comes at an especially interesting time just this week on thursday after a debate on wednesday the house voted 173 to 166 against enacting into law the federal advisory council on the arts which as mrs luce points out was recommended first by president eisenhower in his 1955 message on the state of the union it is extremely interesting that the bulk of the opposition to this bill was provided by members of general eisenhowers own party while the major support for it came from the democratic members of the congress the crucial vote against the bill to establish the federal advisory council on the arts was cast by the minority leader the gentleman from indiana mr hallecki who was personally chosen and was handpicked by president eisenhower in the leadership contest with the gentleman from massachusetts after all of the excellent national publicity which president eisenhower received for his sponsorship of this particular legislation to advance the fine arts during his two terms in the presidential office and indeed that he is still getting witness mrs luces article in mccalls to which i have referred it might be thought by some hardy souls concerned with the arts that the republican party was rendering only lipservice to the arts it may be recalled that it was due to president eisenhowers sponsorship of legislation to establish a federal advisory council on the arts that the cultural leaders of the country formed the committee of the arts and sciences for eisenhowercasein the fall of 1956 to insure his reelection the case committee was very persuasive and extremely effective in view of the republican performance on wednesday and thursday of this week in opposing the federal advisory council on the arts and in making the major contribution to its defeat it may well be that the cultural leaders of our country should now review this performance and make a critical analysis of why it is that the republican leaders talk one way and vote another perhaps mrs clare boothe luce herself could lead in making this analysis it is long overdue because all of the republican leaders are guilty of misleading the people with regard to their devotion to the fine arts during the presidential campaign last fall you will recall that the then vice president richard m nixon wrote a letter which was published in the saturday review of october 29 1960 in which he declared in my opinion it would be better at this time to appoint an advisory council on the arts composed of the best qualified americans in all the cultural fields than a secretary of culture in this way the views of a large number of competent professionals in the several arts could be heard nationally this council should make recommendations to the president and congress as to the best line of federal action in support of artistic endeavor it might also be helpful in suggesting steps by which state and local governments might stimulate private cultural activities legislation to create such a council has been introduced in congress with broad bipartisan backing i support this idea and will work for its passage in equity magazine published by actors equity association again during last falls presidential campaign vice president nixon reiterated the republican partys support of president eisenhowers proposed federal advisory council on the arts the actors equity association is headed by the great actor ralph bellamy and helen hayes is one of its most distinguished members this major cultural organization is affiliated with the aflcio vice president nixon told its members thati wholeheartedly support the objective of stimulating the advancement of the performing arts and promoting increased public appreciation of their important role in our national life i think that a good first step toward meeting that objective would be a proposal by this administration to create a federal advisory council on the arts within the department of health education and welfare the council would explore all aspects of the questionincluding the proper function of the federal government in cultural developmentand make recommendations as to the best methods by which we can encourage activity in the performance and appreciation of the arts as well as fostering participation in them it seems to me that laying this groundwork is necessary before we go on to consider specific proposals such as the establishment of an independent unitedstates art foundation to undertake operating programs as provided in the javitsclark bill once we develop the basic guidelines we can then study alternative programs and choose the one that will effectively promote the full development of our performing arts this then was the cultural program with which the republican party went to the country and for which it obtained more than 30 million votes it is high time that the cultural leaders of the nation particularly clare boothe luce helen hayes howard hanson and those who were instrumental in setting up the committee of the arts and sciences for eisenhowercasein 1956 and celebrities for nixon in 1960 examined the republican partys voting record with regard to the fine arts and not just stop with an examination of what the republican partys candidates for president and vice president say about the arts to paraphrase the immortal words of al smith let them look at the record for it is indeed performance and not lipservice that counts if they will look at the record on the federal advisory council on the arts they cannot fail to take notice of the determined and courageous way in which our distinguished and brilliant colleague from new jersey has fought for this proposal since 1955 when it was first proposed by former president eisenhower under his leadership it has been the democrats in the congress who have consistently and capably fought for the establishment of the federal advisory council on the arts i know that the democratic members of the congress will continue to work for the establishment of the federal advisory council on the arts it is particularly important at this time for the senate to take this legislation up and hold hearings on it and pass it there with the help of the nations cultural leaders and president kennedy whose interest in the fine arts is well known this legislation could be enacted into law early in the next session there is no reason why after the vote this week our cultural leaders should not be discerning as to which members of the congress and which political party is really serious and honest in their statements and actions in support of the arts and which members of the congress and which political party is not in her article in mccalls magazine to which i have been referring mrs luce calls for support of the national cultural center and i should like to note that the legislation to establish this longneeded cultural facility was sponsored by our colleague from new jersey and by the distinguished chairman of the foreign relations committee of the senate senator j w fulbright both are democrats mrs luce writes in her mccalls article that the money for erecting the center was supposed to be privately raised in the next 5 years i suspect that without government help this project will never materialize i think it would be readily apparent to almost everyone including mrs luce that since more than 100 million has been raised from private sources and in particular from the ford and rockefeller foundations for new york citys lincoln center of the performing arts during the past 3 years that it is possible to raise whatever sums are necessary to build the national cultural center in washington d c it is necessary however to appoint to the board of trustees of the national cultural center men and women as capable as those who are heading up the lincoln center of the performing arts i would like to urge at this time that mrs clare boothe luce would be for a number of reasons an ideal person to be a member of the board of trustees of the national cultural center not the least of which is her position within the republican party she undoubtedly would as a member of the board of trustees of the national cultural center be in a position to begin to match republican performance with republican promises as for the democrats i would urge at this time the appointment of mrs thomas bayard of the great du pont family of delaware as a member of the board of trustees of the national cultural center with appointments such as these the national cultural center could soon become a living thing and make its contribution to the advancement of our nations cultural life i include as part of my remarks the article by mrs clare boothe luce from mccalls

would set up a separate agency which would in effect take over the traditional function of the department of state in the field of foreign policy to say that the people i represent are concerned over the ramifications of this bill would be a mild understatement and in my opinion after studying this bill they have reason for such concern in my opinion creating such an agency is but driving a wedge between the president and the secretary of state in the delicate balance of foreign policy at a time when we need cohesion and strength it is interesting to note that since 1946 our efforts within the field of disarmament negotiations have been conducted within the authority and the framework of the department of state which in turn is fully responsible to the president and to congress i cannot see the need to change this now for in my opinion the unitedstates disarmament administration created by former president dwight eisenhower is well able to function in this field furthermore in my opinion passage of such a bill by congress could well be interpreted across the world as a sign of weakness a sign that we are preparing to capitulate on all fronts across the world in face of communist

bargaining position on berlin on laos or red china or the other pressure points of communist penetration in fact if it accomplishes anything it tends to weaken our position history has taught us that

resource i am in full accord with h r 8028 for which s 279 was substituted this bill is comprehensive and realistically confronts the problem nevertheless i had hoped that the committee would broaden the legislation by establishing the kind of machinery i believe necessary for directing youth programs on a national level i refer to the provision in my own legislation h r 8260 which i urged the committee to consider and which i fervently hope will be given priority action now that this important phase of the delinquencyabatement program is moving forward ever since i came to this house and for years before that i have advocated cooperation among governmental agencies on all levels in connection with youth programs as a new york state senator for many years i was close to the state and local approaches to this problem i was the sponsor of legislation that created the new york state youth commission and the enabling legislation to establish the new york city youth board i am fully aware of the responsibilities of all levels of government in this field none can be effective without the other human behavior is not confined to local or state lines the role of the federal government is important if the problem is to be met head on federal leadership is vital holding this view in 1959 i introduced a bill calling for the establishment of a federal youth office to be administered under an assistant secretary in the department of health education and welfare a subcabinet position especially created for the purpose i firmly feel the problem is vital enough to warrant such highlevel status only through such government recognition can proper leadership be given in this field my original bill is not dissimilar to h r 8028 as a matter of fact there are many sections in it that are nearly identical because of this and in view of the assurances i have been given that the differences will be considered as a separate matter i have joined in fully associating myself with h r 8028 and have introduced supporting legislation my bill being h r 8343 i am privileged to be a cosponsor of this measure and i feel its overwhelming approval will serve notice that uncle sam is ready and willing to roll up his sleeves and do something meaningful about the delinquency problem now to get back to my further recommendation which i urged the committee and the members of this house to give their every evaluation and their consideration among the added features to my original bill is the provision to establish the new unit in hew to administer an effective program surely we all agree the field of youth activities is highly specialized and essential to the strength and health of america our nation of tomorrow can be no better than our youth of today then is not the subject worthy of such agency recognition the federal youth office as i envision it would provide the required leadership for intergovernmental cooperation to strengthen state local and private efforts in youth problems it would develop formulas and standards for federal grants to states localities and private agencies on a sharethecost basis it would assist the states in the establishment and operation of juvenile delinquency control and prevention programs moreover the office would encourage research in and demonstration of new techniques in dealing with teenage behavioral problems and crime and would provide for the training of personnel to staff programs for the control and treatment of juvenile delinquency the agency would also provide a national clearinghouse for exchange of information on youth problems and on methods and techniques for dealing with them the youth office therefore through its efforts with state local and private agencies would enable a complete fully coordinated attack on the serious problem of juvenile delinquency we must have more accurate data on the nature and amount of delinquency in different areas we are seriously hampered by not being able to secure an accurate national report on delinquency the federal bureau of investigation provides statistics on juvenile delinquency as a part of its overall crime reporting program and the childrens bureau gathers some statistics from certain juvenile courts throughout the country but neither of these agencies has the resources to develop the type of information collection and dissemination which will aid the communities most effectively the federal youth office would be able to provide such comprehensive information and thus it could indicate which correctional agencies and local areas most need the technical assistance provided for in the bill in the new attack on delinquency we need such new resources to manage the increasing demand for technical help on matters of general policy and procedure my bill also makes provision for close cooperation with the presidents committee on juvenile delinquency and youth crime such cooperative work at the federal state and local levels of government is vital for any successful preventive work the federal government is spending 126 million a year merely for the custodial care of 40 000 child delinquents contrast this figure with the proposed cost in the juvenile delinquency bill of 10 million this money will be spent for the prevention of crime and not merely for bigger enforcement and correctional programs our main objective should be the prevention of those early law violations that begin criminal careers and we must pour as much money labor and thought as possible into achieving this aim we can no longer sit back and believe that this is just a temporary situation that will pass juvenile delinquency is a grim stark reality we cannot coddle it any longer we must face it squarely the federal government is spending billions abroad to strengthen our position in the free world we are spending billions to keep america strong on the homefront yet what are we doing to prevent the deterioration and moral breakdown of so many of our youththe backbone of our strength our country should reflect to the rest of the world an image of human decency dignity and government by law what do they think of these continuing stories of teenage crime and violence the way we can convince them that this does not reflect america is to do something about eliminating it and to do that you must have the tools for prevention and cure certainly this condition involves only a small percentage of our young folks the vast majority are good clean fine boys and girls but pointing to percentages is not going to stop these rampages the problem unfortunately is growing worse j edgar hoover reported in march 1961 that crimes by youths increased some 6 percent over the previous year and at this rate of increase a million or more youngsters may be arrested in the year 1962 in the fact of these tragic statistics again i emphasize congress cannot shun its responsibility it is time that the government of the united states assumed

missouri and pennsylvania maintain aid to the blind programs entirely financed by state funds which are more liberal in their eligibility requirements than those allowable under federal law and regulation these same states also maintain aid to the blind programs in accordance with the provisions of title x of the social security act which are financed jointly from federalstate funds these latter programs are operated in compliance with the very stringent eligibility standards set forth in the federal law and regulations for more than 10 years the completely statefinanced aid to the

would finally resolve the following issues which have been raisedand would continue to be raisedin title x of the social security act first it would secure the states in their right to use their own funds in the establishment and maintenance of improved and enlightened social welfare programs for their blind citizens second it would protect missouri and pennsylvania in their right to continue to maintain permanently their rehabilitatively directed solely statefinanced aid to the blind programs free from further federal interference and it would allow other states wishing to do so to establish similar programs with the unique features of the missouri and pennsylvania state plans for aid to the blind third the amount of each states federal grant for its federally supported aid to the blind programs would continue to be measured by the present federal standards and on like terms to all states the means test that is contained in clause 8 of section 1002 a as amended would apply to all states for the purpose of determining the part of any states expenditures that would be covered by the federal grant fourth no limitation or requirement on the allowance exceptions from the means test in the direction of greater liberality would be imposed upon any state plan in order to retain a title x federal grant for federally eligible cases in order to prevent the states from circumventing the minimum standards of the federal program by transferring blind aid recipients to a drastically less adequate state program the states would be permitted to increase but not decrease the extent to which the recipients earnings income or other resources might be excepted from the means test fifth it would certainly serve to encourage other states to develop their plans of aid to the blind toward the high goal of rehabilitation rather than the static goal of providing for the barest minimum physical needs of blind persons in 1950 congress incorporated the rehabilitation concept into the provisions of title x of the social security actby requiring that the first 50 of the monthly earned income of blind aid recipients be exempt from meeting their cv156 needs in the 86th congress this exemption was increased to 85 plus 50 percent of monthly earned income in 1956 congress proclaimed selfcare and selfsupport to be among the purposes of the public assistance provisions of the social security act these congressional actions were taken to convert the federalstate aid to the blind programs into programs which not only gave a person in need minimum food shelter and clothing but and this is of very great importance it offered those who must apply for help the opportunity gradually to work their way from reliance upon public funds to selfreliance from demeaning economic dependence to satisfyingly selfachieved economic independence sixth my bill if adopted by congress would restore to the states their right to establish if they wished to do so aid to the blind programs with standards more liberal than those allowable under present federal law and regulations it would restore to the states their right to spend their own money as they choose in such programs all this could be done without any cost to the federal government this would be so since the provisions of my bill specify that the federal government would only make available participating funds for those cases which would qualify under the present stringent federal definition of need not only would the enactment of my bill not cost additional federal dollarsvery much the contrary would happen i believe that by assisting blind persons in need to return to work to resume economically productive lives by making aid to the blind programs a means of achieving rehabilitation by operating such programs in accordance with a philosophy of hope and helpthen i think and only thenwill the many able bodied employable blind persons be rescued from perpetual dependence upon public supporta drain upon the resources of the nation a loss to the economy to the total life of the nation the experience of the more liberal blind aid programs in my state of missouri and in the state of pennsylvania i believe fully justifies my conviction and my contentionthat when programs providing public assistance to the blind are operated as a force for rehabilitation then a substantial number of rehabilitated and restored lives results i do not believe that men and women who are able to work who have many years of working life remaining to them should remain upon public assistance for the rest of their lives nor do i believe they want to remain there my bill enacted into law would give to these people the opportunity they want the opportunity they needand the opportunity they deserveto regain their lost dignity their lost independencefor this will come to them only when they again earn their own daily bread when they can again provide for the needs of their family"], [0.00017112493515014648,

has been mentioned my good friend mr frank kemp has been mentioned of course the state of colorado itself probably produces more sugar from sugarbeets than any other state in the united states except california and we are tremendously interested in this bill great western sugar co is not only active in the state of colorado and particularly in my district but in a number of other states holly sugar co is very active in colorado in california and other areas american crystal sugar co has its home office in denver and the only independent single plant company in the whole united states national sugar manufacturing co operates in congressman chenoweths district and in kansas why do i bring this up we have heard a lot of talk about what the industry has or has not done i thought perhaps it was time to put into the record what the industry means it not only means the processing companies that are processing sugarbeets into sugar it also means the domestic cane manufacturers of sugar in the southern states it means the beet growers of colorado california minnesota and all the other places that have been mentioned it means the cane growers in the southern states it also means the refiners on the eastern shores of this country those people who are bringing in sugar from other areas in the world and processing it in this country for sale in this country one man mr kemp president of great western sugar co represented all branches of this great industry in an agreed statement to the agriculture committee i have been closely in touch with sugar legislation for over 12 years and i can tell you that there is no more competitive industry anywhere in the world every single segment of it has a different viewpoint different angles and different interests any time anyone can get an industry encompassing that many interests working together for a single position to get over a bill which will give them the stability upon which they can build from year to year means that we have got something good that true statesmanship in the sugar field has been exercised a program proposed which should be passed by this congress having said that i also want to emphasize that it is obviously necessary to compromise in order to get any agreed program with such diverse competitive interests involved we in congress are not satisfied with all provisions some in the beet sugar industry are not satisfied i am sure there are some in the domestic cane industry who are not satisfied with it i would suspect that the hawaiian islands are satisfied with it only because they are growing so fast that they really do not have very much more room to grow any more cane sugar there anyhow there are in fact very few people who are going to be completely satisfied with all provisions but if you have an industry as a whole that says give us this bill so that we can have a stable program for a period of 5 years on which we can build and not be caught in a simple 9month extension or 15month extension as we have been for the last 5 years then it seems to me that it is up to this congress to go ahead and pass it there is one provision that i think should have been included that is the provision which would have given preference to those foreign countries which sell sugar to us where they would agree to use the dollars created by this activity to buy wheat and other surplus commodities from this country at the very least this provision could have been included in reallocating deficits in quotas assigned to foreign countries under the act i think such a provision could help our agricultural surplus situation as well as give an opportunity for us to create more markets in those areas for the sale of agricultural commodities which are presently in surplus in conclusion i want to add this in support of the amendment of the gentleman from kansas i think this is one provision we can truthfully say has not been considered and has not been put in with the consent of the industry i think it can truthfully be said that we are injecting into the sugar bill which is beneficial to the entire industry a provision for a giveaway of 22 million of taxpayer funds which in fact represent a private relief bill for certain indicated companies it has been said that this is a moral obligation that we should give this money away but there have been no hearings before the judiciary committee which generally considers an equity bill of this kind only the proponents of the bill were heard by the agricultural committee the other side of the question has not been even presented and while we in congress are doing this the united states is defending a lawsuit in the same amount of money in the court of claims it strikes me that con"],

which this government cannot safely ignore while i realize the grave dangers of hasty and illconsidered action i am convinced that the route of vacillation and inaction could be even more perilous certainly any broad policy with respect to cuba individually or latin america as a whole would be fraught with uncertainties many different factors must be taken into consideration in establishing

filled all but five of these positions that research and development teams are never easy to organize and i hope that the other body will restore these positions and give nasa every chance to succeed in accomplishing their most difficult mission this is a new organization there is no real history to go by but the personnel problems have been very carefully worked out within the executive branch of
