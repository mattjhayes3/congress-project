for an incometax law and then provide also for an amendment to the constitution which could be resorted to in the event the supreme court declares the new incometax law unconstitutional if you should do this there would be no longer any question as to your sincerity in the matteryour friendship for the measure this incometax proposition is purely a democratic measure and it is the fairest and most just method of taxation ever devised by the genius of man i am in favor of amending the constitution if it needs amending in order to obtain an incometax law but i believe that an income tax is constitutional and that the supreme court as 11ow constituted would declare it so if we had an incometax law it would bring millions of money into the treasury and those paying it would scarcely miss it and it would aghten the burden that now rests so heavily on the great body of consumers the republican party is not in favor of an income tax and the submission of this amendment to the constitution instead of voting straight on thp income tax is your plan of procrastination the republican party always moves against the lines of least resistance and when that party can not defeat a measure it makes promises and postpones action the gentleman from missouri said that when we elected the first democratic president after the war between the states that we talked about an income tax because according to his statement we thought of tearing down the customhouses and would need revenue from that source to run the government i want to tell the gentleman that the customhouses have not been destroyed and the republican party has been in power in every branch of the government for more than twelve years and your tariff tax is the highest that it has ever been and yet you have not the revenues now with which to meet the extravagance indulged in by the republican party we have had a panica republican panicthe evil effects of which are still with us i have heard various reasons assigned for the panic and the gentlematn from kansas now tells us that the bankers caused it well some of these bankers are among the millionaires whom we want to reach with an incometax law and if the gentleman wants to punish that class of citizens on whom he wishes to throw the blame for this republican panic let him join us in voting for an incometax law now i am not going to make a lengthy speech at this time for i discussed at some length the payne bill when it was up for consideration in the house in passing however i want to give you a sample of what this aldrich bill is going to do to the american consumer here is what the editor of the birmingham ageherald says and says truly riec or clothing hereafter to those who are compelled to buy moderatepriced clothing the aldrich scheme of duties brings these results namely a suit of clothes which cost 10 last spring will cost 12 50 next spring the cost of the 10 suit will be advanced to 18 the cost of the 18 suit will be advanced to 22 the cost of the 20 suit will be advanced to 25 does this look like revision downward and now here is a notice sent out by a wholesale sugar dealer who is a friend to the consumer i am indebted to the barfieldgreen mercantile company of lineville ala in my district for sending me this notice notice with no duty on sugar sugar would be 2 cents per pound cheaper write your senator and congressman that you favor free sugar the aldrich bill strikes hard the necessities of life all along the line and if gentlemen here think that the people are ignorant of what you are doing you will find in the next election that you are entirely mistaken the states wisely and justly provide that every taxpayer shall know the exact amount of taxes that he pays every yeartaxes on money loaned or hoarded so much on personal property and so much on real estate the taxpayer knows as he has a right to know just how much taxes he is required to pay to the city county and state government but under your mysterious tarifftax law you tax the citizen and you refuse to let him know just how much he is taxed by the federal government the tariff tax is hid in thb price of the things that he must buy and at the end of the year he knows that the cost of living has increased but he does not know how much you have taxed him under the system of a high protective tariff this is wrong and you should amend this tariff bill now so that it will require that on every article upon which you have laid a tariff the amount of the tariff tax shall be stamped so that the consumer may know as he buys the necessities of life what the tariff tax is and at the end of the year he will know the amount of tariff tax that you have compelled him to pay for instance if the tariff on a wool hat is 1 50 and the tariff on a pa ir of shoes is 25 or 50 cents and on a piece of machinery 50 when the machinery cost only 100 to begin with bear in mind the consumer would begin to see how you hold him up with one hand and rob him with the other if he could only realize how he is being imposed upon and robbed by the present tariff system it would not be long until the republican party would be driven from power in every branch of the government and then a just and equitable tariff law would be passed by the representatives of the democratic party the man of small means with his goods in sight and the man who has to struggle for the necessities of life bear the tax burdens of the government those least able to pay are forced under this republican system of tariff taxation to divide their earnings with the tariff barons and an extravagant federal government the man whose income amounts to several thousand dollars a year and the man whose yearly income runs into the millions will be reached by an income tax and they will be forced to contribute to the support of the government of course the law should provide that a mans yearly income must be so many thousand dollars before you begin to tax it the purpose of such a law is to tax those most able to pay taxes and lighten the tax burden on those least able to bear it let us put the greatest tax burden in the form of an income tax on the man who is most benefited by the tariff protection that the government gives for he is most able to bear it from the man who has much in this worlds goods much should be expected and demanded in the way of taxes to pay the expenses of the government under which he lives just here i will include in my remarks a statement from robert ellis thompson in the irish world in discussing the evils of indirect taxes in england he says the only real corrective to this injustice has been the income tax devised by william pitt when england was lighting and revived in 184 by peel and gladstone as a means to save the country from annual deficits until within thirty years past seveneighths of the british revenue came from indirect taxestaxes which tend to make the rich richer and the poor poorer by an unjust distribution of the public burdens an income tax seeks to reach the unearned wealth of the country and to make it pay its share so much for that now this capitol is the civic temple of the people and we are here by direction of the people to reduce the tariff tax and enact a law in the interest of all the people this was the expressed will of the people at the polls and you promised to carry out that will but you have not kept faith with the american people the dingley law carries the highest tariff tax of any law that was ever enacted by congress and you gentlemen were electedagain intrusted with poweron the distinct nuderstanding and in the firm belief on the part of the people that you would reduce the tariff tax and lower the dingley rates and yet the payne tariff bill that passed the house increased the tariff tax and carries a higher rate than the dingley law and now comes the aldrich bill which is the most obnoxious and burdensome tariff scheme that ever found sanction in either branch of the american congress the tariff barons are in complete control and the american people have been deceived the republican party is going to be called upon to give an account of its stewardship at the judgment bar of the people you must account for your broken campaign promises and your violated platform pledges and all signs indicate that you will hear the dread sentence depart from power you unfaithful servants your failure to reduce the tariff tax is an admission that your party is absolutely in the hands of the favored few who profit by a high protective tariff your failure to revise the tariff downward as you promised you would do stamps you with deceit and unfaithfulness to the amerlican people and brands your party as unworthy of their confidence any longer this is plain talk but no plainer than the facts justify your declarations that you would revise the tariff downward sounded from every stump in the last national campaign and yet your promises have not been kept your platform pledges to revise the tariff downward were printed in all the newspapers of the country and carried by your literature into the homes of all the people but alas those pledges have not been fulfilled i derive no pleasure in calling attention to this situation because it helps the democratic party i deplore the miserable condition that it reveals my heart is made sad and a sense of shame and humiliation steals upon me when i see the purseproud barons of hightariff protection write the statute laws by which they become enormously rich and politically powerful at the expense and to the great injury of the masses of the people and these men around whom the operation of your unjust tariff laws has piled millions reveling in luxury retire from business at will and say in their hearts soul take thine ease but sir i would remind you of a struggle out yonder among the bread earners of america this struggle is unceasing no field is cleared in the battle for bread no bugle sings truce to the toiling millions and yet under this miserable aldrich bill the industry and skill of the man who toils are taxed but the fortunes of the idle rich escape the scrutinizing eye of the republican party the great body of consumers struggling for the wherewith to buy the simple necessities of life are taxed and heavily taxed by this aldrich bill not only to raise revenues to meet the extravagant expenditures of the republican party but taxed for the benefit of those who profit by the republican policy of high protectionthose who furnish the republicans with campaign funds with which to corrupt the ballot and debauch american manhood the simple wants of the plain people are taxed beyond all reason while the comforts and conveniences of life are placed beyond their reach the man who is not willing to work who drifts aimlessly through life does not deserve much consideration by anybody but sir the man who is willing to employ the powers that god mas given him in the effort to better his condition to gratify his legitimate wants deserves the commendation of every honest man and in the name of justice i demand for him a fair chance in the struggle for existence when you by tariff taxation lay heavy burdens upon the things that this man needs and must have to make his wife and children comfortable and happy you are working injury to this man and his familyyou are standing between them and a worthy existence and you are committing a crime against the american home the great god who so bountifully blessed this old world in the things with which to feed clothe and shelter the people never intended that a few men should claim all the increase from ocean soil and air and the fathers never dreamed that a few millionaires in america would become the arrogant dictators or bosses of the national government nor did the builders of the republic believe that the time would come when the barons of high protection would scorn the rights and wishes of the people and tax them at every turn in their existence in order to enrich themselves but that time has come i want some one on that side of the house to tell me the difference between the bold robber who holds you up on the highway and robs you of your money and the government that does the bidding of a band of robbers who prescribe the conditions by which you shall come and surrender your money i will tell you the difference one takes his chances and runs the risk of losing his own life in his efforts to rob others while the other gang uses governmental machinery to hold up and plunder the citizen and in the name of law commits its crime against humanity their patriotism is measured by the size of the fortunes that you permit them to filch from the american consumers the stars on the flag resemble dollar marks to them and the stripes represent the special favors that they enjoy at the hands of a government controlled by the republican party the republican party regards the presence of a few money kings as evidence of americas prosperity but not so these men are the product of governmental favoritism the creatures of unjust tariff taxation the laws that made them millionaires have robbed millions of people of the necessities of life but in spite of subsidized newspapers that keep the truth from the people in spite of the disgusting aristocracy of the dollar that controls the government through the republican party we shall continue to proclaim that the comfort the happiness and wellbeing of the american itizen is the surest sign of genuine prosperity the highest end and aim of constitutional government"], [0.010298967361450195, 0.9897010326385498, 1, "it is useless for me to say that i favor this proposition no democrat can consistently vote against this amendment while many of us believe that under the present provisions of the constitution there is abundant authority for the passage of an incometax law yet we shall not hesitate to vote for this amendment as the only thing along this line we are permitted by the party in power to consider the supreme court it is true held that the wilson incometax law was unconstitutional but we all remember the influences surrounding that tribunal at that time and the fact that it was rendered by a majority of only one judge who changed his opinion in a few hours in this manner a judicial construction of the constitution that had existed since the days of chief justice marshall was reversed many of the best lawyers in the country are outspoken in their belief in the error of that decision president roosevelt evidently had but little respect for it as is shown in his message to congress just read by the gentleman from kentucky also president taft must have regarded it with contempt at one time for in his speech accepting the republican nomination for president in 1908 he said the democratic platform demands two constitutional amendments one providing for an income tax and the other for the election of senators by the people in my judgment an amendment to the constitution for an income tax is not necessary i believe that an income tax when the protective system of customs and the internalrevenue tax shall not furnish income enough for governmental needs can and should be devised which under the decisions of the supreme court will conform to the constitution how does the language that in my judgment an amendment to the constitution for an income tax is not necessary and that an income tax can and should be devised which under the decisions of the supreme court will conform to the constitution compare with his recent message to the senate advocating the substitution of a tax on corporations for the proposed income and inheritance tax measure then pending in that body before his election the incometax law would be constitutional now it is unconstitutional what has brought about that sudden change in the mind of this great lawyer can it be that he has been hoodooed by the machinations of the grand high priest of republicanism now engaged in writing the tariff bill but this is not the only beforeandaftertaking performance ofthe president in his campaign speeches he proclaimed from every stump in every section of the country that if he were elected there would be a revision and a revision downward of the tariff the people believed him to be honest then and they do not seriously question his honesty now but they do believe that he is guilty of cringing cowardice in permitting certain leaders of his party to belie every promise he made the people how anxiously are millions of our republican friends wishing for the return of the big stick now being used in clubbing varments in the wilds of africa they believe that if this hero of the jungle were again in power the samson of the senate would be shorn of his locks let me here read you a few utterances made by mr taft in his last campaign in a speech at cincinnati on september 28 1908 he said another thing the republican party pledges itself to fixes the date when it will do it and tells you how it will do it is the revision of the tariff the dingley tariff has served the country well butits rateshave become generally excessive they have become excessive because conditions have changed since its passage in 1896 some of the rates are probably too low due also to the change of conditions but on the whole the tariff ought to be lowered in accordance with the republican principles and the policy it has always upheld of protection of our industries now mr bryan is greatly concerned and says that no such tariff revision can be made in view of the fact that the protective industries control the republican party i deny this if there are protective industries enjoying too great profits under the present tariff then they would have opposed revision altogether the movement in favor of revision has arisen with the republican party and is pressed forward by members of the republican party the revision which they desire is a revision which shall reduce excessive rates i wish there to be no doubt in respect to the revision of the tariff i am a tariff revisionist and have been one since the question has been mooted at milwaukee on september 25 1908 he said the encouragement which industry receives leads to the investment of capital in it to the training of labor to the exercise of the inventive faculty of which the american has so much and in practically every case in which adequate protection has been given the price of the article has fallen the differencein the cost of producing the article abroad and here has been reduced and the necessity for maintaining the tariff at the former rate has ceased it is intended under the protective system by judicious encouragement to build up industries as the natural conditions of the country justify to a point where they can stand alone and fight their own vatties in competition of the world it is my judgment as it is that of many republicans that there are many schedules of the tariff in which the rates are excessive and there are a few in which the rates are not sufficient to fill the measure of conservative protection it is my judgment that a revision of the tariff in accordance with the pledge of the republican platform will be on the whole a revision downward though there will probably be a few exceptions in this regard also in his inaugural address on march 4 last which we all heard he said a matter of most pressing importance is the revision of the tariff in accordance with the promises of the platform upon which i was elected i shall call congress into extra session to meet on the 15th day of march in order that consideration may be at once given to a bill revising the dingley act the proposal to revise the tariff made in such an authoritative way as to lead the business community to count upon it necessarily halts all those branches of business directly affected and as these are most important it disturbs the whole business of the country it is imperatively necessary therefore that a tariff bill be drawn in good faith in accordance with promises made before the election by the party in power and as promptly passed as due consideration will permit the eyes of the nation are turned upon this capitol and the question of the hour is whether the solemn pledges made the people by president taft are to be redeemed by the defeat and overthrow of the infamous aldrichsmoot tariff bill it is up to the president alone to act his p~grty in both houses it seems is under the domination of the speaker and one senator the lay members are as powerless as babes in the hands of these astute leaders in one breath these emasculated republicans will advocate a decrease of taxation and in the next they are forced by the bosses to vote for anincrease if all the republicans who have denounced the aldrich bill as a travesty upon jtistice and right would unite with the minority i dare say the conference report would not receive onethird the votes of the house it is a wellknown fact that the tariff law will bethe product of the brain of one senator and however infamous the measure 7 may be it will receive the unqualified support of enough republicans to pass both houses the 10 patriotic republican senators who dared to vote against the bill are branded as traitors and in due time will be excommunicated by the moguls of the party but will there ever be an end to this outrageois legislation will the time never come when the people of the uni ted states are to have a voice in formulating the laws by which they are to be tax6d it seems that the republican party has permanent control of the government and that senator aldrich absolutely dominates this party as long as it triumphs he will be czar of the nation compared with his influence and power in the enactment of legislation the influence and prerogatives of the president are as fruitless and abortive as would be the edicts of a country schoolmaster but returning to the subject of this controversy let me say to my friend from st louis who contends that he is opposed to a system of taxation that exempts small incomes and not larger ones from the tax burden because it would be inequality in the system of taxation that i am indeed glad that he is beginning to realize that there is such a virtue ds equity in bearing the burdens of government ie is certainly reforming in his older age for it is quite impossible to under stand how one who has been wedded to the discriminating doctrine of protection for so many years can conscientiously advocate a policy of justice and equality in taxation except upon the idea of a complete conversion to a new political faith his soul must have been cleansed by the saving grace of that justice not found in the doctrine of protection its very name means inequality of tax burden it means a tax upon consumption and not upon wealth upon what one eats and wears and not upon his property it means that the citizen who can scarcely provide food and raiment for his wife and children contributes as much or more to the support of the government as does the multimillionaire and it means that the consumer is not only taxed for the support of his country but is compelled to contribute five times more to swell the fortunes of millionaire manufacturers and trust manipulators well does my friend know that every time a dollar tax is voted upon any article imported into this country that the domestic producer of such article adds the same as an extra profit on his product this was once denied by the advocates of protection but it was conceded by the most stalwart republican senators in the recent great tariff debate i would like for him to tell the couiitry wherein is to be found equality of taxation under such a system one man is not only taxed for the supl ort of the government but for the benefit of his fellowmaii while he pays 1 to the government he is compelled to pay from five to seven times this amount to his neighbor who is engaged in a manufacturing enterprise for instance the american farmer consumes 25 000 000 worth of agricultural implements annually the tax thereon is 20 per cent the government in 1907 collected only 3 600 in revenue but according to admissions of republican senators the 20 per cent dingley rate was levied in favor of the manufacturer on the 25 000 000 consumed at home amounting to a tax of 5 000 000 so the american farmer while he paid 3 600 to his government was compelled to donate 5 000 000 to the agriculturalimplement trust another illustration only 3 per cent of the lumber consumed in this country is imported from that the government derived a revenue of about 3 000 000 while on the 97 per cent of the domestic product consumed at home he was compelled to pay the lumber trust and the lumber manufacturers more than 65 000 000 now how does this strike the gentleman as equality in sharing the burdens of government this same injustice is true on the iron steel wire glass shoe leather meat products hosiery clothing gloves cotton goods and many other articles necessary to human life were i a republican and advocated such a fallacy as equality of right under the protective system my hours would be haunted by visions of the judgment that overtook ananias and sapphira again i would like to say a word or two in reply to what the gentleman from kansas has just said in his speech advocating the adoption of this measure he for the first time in his whole political life urges the south and the west to unite in the adoption of this measure to thwart the aggressive vandalism of new england i am too proud of his conversion and when i think of such a speech coming from a republican from kansas i am forcibly reminded of the old camp meeting song as long as the lanp holds out to burn the vilest sinner may return these strange doings on the part of our republican friends if sincere certainly are ominous of much good when a kansas republican is willing to clasp hands with a mississippi l emocrat for the good of the common country i think it is time for the people to rejoice and offer praises to the almighty my friend need not be uneasy about mississippi or any of the other southern states on this proposition i dare say that no state south of the mason and dixon line will hesitate for one moment to ratify this amendment it is right in principle it means equality in taxationthat every man shall contribute to the support of the country in proportion to the wealth with which lie has been blessed this has always been the 1paramount doctrine of the south and even the southern republicans who understand only the a b cs of political honesty will accept and support this amendment my friend should look out for the wayward in his own state for i have always understood that the republicans of kansas were the most ubiquitous in principle of all the tribealways fleeing from one wrong to embrace another ilu my opinion the greatest danger confronting democratic success in the next election is the political thievery of the republicans in appropriating wholesome democratic doctrine a few years ago you purloined the democratic idea of more rigid supervision of transportation companies and now with unblushing audacity you propose to adopt et literatim the most sacred tenet of our faith you have denounced bryan in season and out of season in this house and upon the hustings as a dreamer a socialist and an anarchist for advocating the policy you now embrace with impunity he wrote in the denver platform this remarkable language we favor an income tax as a part of our revenue system and we urge the submission of a constitutional amendment specifically authorzing congress to levy and collect a tax on individual and corporate incomes to the end that wealth may bear its proportionate share of the burdens of the federal government you are compelled in order to save your political scalps to make his favorite theory the law it is indeed a bitter pill but you know that something must be done to assuage the increasing wrath of thepeople on account of the grievous wrong that is now being perpetrated by the tariff conference committee but i am afraid that the unanimous passage of this measure through the senate and the favor with which it is being received in this house by your party is too hopeful of good to be accepted with a full measure of confidence i am afraid that this is a case of greeks bearing gifts it was introduced in the senate for the avowed purpose of defeating the baileycummins incometax bill and i am apprehensive that after it shall have been rushed through this house and goes to the states for ratification all the power and influence that can be marshaled against it by sordid wealth and republican chicanery will be used to compass its defeat it is only necessary to debauch the legislatures of 12 states to secure its rejection and the same evil influences that have corrupted and carried so many elections have already started a crusade against its adoption by the states we were warned by the gentleman from connecticut in his speech a few moments ago what oppopition mightbe expected from new england he boldly contends that it is unjust to tax the wealth of those favored states for the sup port of the common country stating that that section becauseof its great prosperity was now compelled to contribute more than its part of the internalrevenue tax the inconsistency of such an argument is only excelled by the seeming avarice that prompted it new england that has bled the country of its wealth for quite half a century that has her millionaires by the thousandsmade so by virtue of the infamous policy of protectionshould be the last section of the union to reject this righteous measure with her millions invested in manufactures protected by the tax of from 50 to more than 100 per cent it would be the height of political ingratitude for any statesmen from that section whether democrat or republican to act otherwise than to urge a speedy ratification of this amendment let me ask my friend where he imbibed such strange ideas of political economy as to contend that taxation should not be based on the wealth of the country what statesman ever advocated that a poor man without property should contribute as much to defray the expenses of the government as does the millionaire the former has nothing to protect save his life and liberty while not only the life and liberty of the latter is shielded by the government but his broad acres and long lines of factories are made secure by the courts and great armies the former costs the government nothing while upon the latter it ofttines spends thousands of dollars in the time of war the former bares his breast as a target to the enemy while the latter hires a substitute and hikes away to the mountains of switzerland but the boldest declaration in opposition to the income tax yet heard comes from the distinguished gentleman from massachusetts it is indeed hard to understand how a statesman possessing his known intellectuality could advocate such a political principle as to oppose this measure upon the grounds that it is violative of the principles upon which the government was founded he discussed at length the proposition that the fathers of the republic to make secure democratic equality among the states intended thaft when a direct tax was levied it should be apportioned among the several states according to their population this doctrine might have appealed to reason at a time when the pro rata wealth of the states was practically equal had the framers of the constitution known that the present policy of spoliation and greed would have been so long saddled upon the country that one state would have been drained of its wealth to enrich inother i dare say that no such provision would have been in the federal constitution can anyone believe for a momient that when our patriotic forefathers founded this republic they thought that the time would ever come when by a system of unjust taxation the per capita wealth of massachusetts wvould be increased to more than 1 500 while that of mississippi would be reduced to less than 150 or that they intended that the individualowning 150 should be forced to contribule as much to the support of the government as one owning 1 500 in tile light of these facts anyone who now advocates a direct tax leviea on the several states according to the population thereof exemplifies a statemianship as tyrannical as it is indefensible sir there is another reason why this direct system of taxation by states should and must be forever abandoned when the constitution was adopted our vast negro population was in slavery and was not counted as a basis upon which this tax should be levied against any state now there are more than six millions of them in the gulf states alone made citizens by the constitution and who however penniless they may be must be counted in estimating the population of any state against which a direct tax is sought to be levied such a system of taxation would force the white property owners of the south to contribute ten times as much as those living in other sections of the union we should remember that since the adoption of the constitution many changes have taken place in this republic this system of taxation was adopted to make steadfast the doctrine of state sovereignty but the integrity of statehood was partly destroyed by the results of the civil war and now it has been completely annihilated by republican executive and judicial encroachment upon the constitution at one time the union existed by the grace of the states now the states survive by the mercy of the federal government the states were the source of all power but now they have been reduced to mhere boroughs in the great federal system sir if your party will give back to the south the constitutional privileges she enjoyed fifty years ago and i do not mean african slavery either if you will give her the right to administer her own affairs unhampered and unmolested by the usurpations of the federal government if you will give her back that system of tariff taxation under which she grew rich and powerful i dare say that but few statesmen from the south would oppose the present constitutional provisions as to direct taxation however much i may favor this measure and however much i may advocate the corporation tax now pending in the conference committee still i must confess that i am at a loss to know how either measure is going to profit the great masses of people in this country unless the tax burden imposed by the tariff is decreased in proportion to the amount of revenue derived by the income and corporation taxes my idea of an income tax has always been that its adoption would relieve the necessity for high tariff taxes and unless it accomplishes this purpose in my judgment but little good can or will come to the masses of the people if the rich are to be taxed by these measures to run the government and the poor are to be taxed by high protection to enrich the manufacturers and tiusts then in the name of reason what good can you expect from this legislation the income tax is right and it is the only fair means to raise revenue to run the government and when it is adopted it is to be hoped that the american people will rise in rebellion against your infamous protective system which is designed for no other purpose than to enrich the rich the proposed tariff measure is the limit of high protection and yet you say that it will not produce sufficient revenue for the government in this contention you are correct and the reason for it is as plain as the noonday sun you have taxed everything out of the country by high schedules scarcely anything is imported and hence the government gets nothing while the manufacturer puts the full amount of the tax in his private purse it is conceded by the best authority on this subject that if you will reduce your tariff schedules onehalf the government will receive twice the revenue therefrom and the people will be relieved of a tax burden for the benefit of the manufacturers and trusts to the extent of not less than 7 000 000 000 then there is another thought the reckless extravagance in the appropriations under the republican rule is appalling to the nation in the last decade it has almost doubled amounting to quite a billion of dollars annually by your reckless extravagance you have increased the burden of taxation so greatly that your most experienced financiers in this house are at a loss to devise ways and means for the maintenance of the government you are levying the highest tariff tax known to the world the corporation tax and the income tax if adopted together with the increase of the internalrevenue tax will in the judgment of many of your own party be necessary to meet the growing expenses of the government it is already noised in the atmosphere that two or three hundred millions of dollars of panama bonds will have to be sold to fill the already empty coffers of the government when your party took control of this government it took less than 100 000 000 to defray its annual expenses from official statistics we learn that in 1860 there was appro priated 71 718 943 in 1880 it was increased to 29s 163 117 in 1900 it amounted to 590 068 371 in 1907 762 488 752 and it continues to increase it now being a billion dollars or more these startling figures unfold the story of your reckless extravagance xliv277 now sir is it not time for the people to become alarmed is it not time for your party to be dethroned and for the party of the people to take charge of the government in order to save it from the maelstrom of bankruptcy and ruin another decade of power by the republican party means the indissoluble union between the government and the trusts it means that centralized wealth will subordinate every function of the government to the behests of avarice this is as plainly written upon the destiny of this country unless there be a radical change as was the handwriting upon the wall of the babylonian palace

was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every day lazarus had not where to lay his head was clad in tatters and rags and fed upon the crumbs which fell from the rich mans table dives doubtless contributed princely sums to republican campaign boodle funds lazarus could give nothing but we have the assurance of holy writ that when they died the spirit of lazarus was borne aloft on angel wings to the god who gave it while old dives was cast into hell my friends on the other side of the aisle i beg you to heed the warning history may again repeat itself he unarmed me with his fervid and impetuous eloquence intimidated me with his fast furious and vehement gestures and then figuratively speaking walked all over my prostrate form with unconcealed pride and evident consciousness of his mighty triumph he held aloft a newspaper article containing a summary of importations of certain goods on the free list including hides and skins after a brief exploration of the regions above he returned to earth shouting vociferouslylet us take the question of bides and skins 104 000 000 worth and if that is not a necessity that goes into the home of every american workingman i would like to know what it is what hides and skins a necessity that goes into the home of every american workingman no i am almost forced to conclude thatjudgment has fled to brutish beasts and men have lost their reasonwhen such arguments are advanced the gentleman seemed to rejoice in the fact that hides and skins are on the free list a change has evidently come over the spirit of his dream since when was he converted last april he wanted to put a tax on hides the payne bill as reported to the house carried hides on the free list on april 9 1909 while that bill was under consideration the gentleman from kansas offered this amendment hldes of cattle raw or uncured whether dried salted or pickled 10 per cent ad valoremand demanded a vote by yeas and nays strange to say the congressional record shows that the gentleman from ohio voted for the scott amendmentvoted to put a tax of 10 per cent ad valorem on hides hides were as much a necessity last april as now i voted for free hides why did not the gentleman vote then as he preaches now has he seen a new light i fear he is in the predicament that claudius king of denmark found himself when be said my words fly up my thoughts remain below words without thoughts never to heaven go shoes harness and other products of leather are necessities which in truth do enter into the homes of all the people why did not the gentleman from ohio and his colleagues vote for cheaper shoes for the working men women and children of their districts and for the millions of poor men women and children throughout the land why did they not vote for cheaper harness in the interest of american farmers those hornyhanded sons of toil who have produced the wealth of this republic and whose brawn and muscle and patriotism have made it the grandest the richest and the most glorious country under the shining sun on april 9 1909 the gentleman from missouri the minority leader moved to recommit the tariff bill with instructions to the committee to report it back at an early day with this among other amendments seventh amend by placing leather harness boots shoes and all other products of leather on the free list a roll call was had on this motion and the gentleman from ohio voted against putting these articles of necessity that go into the home of every american workingman on the free list with the price of shoes going higher and higher everyday with the cost of clothing bounding skyward with harness and all products of leather on the rampage with the unprecedented and phenomenal increase in living expenses with tens of thousands of oppressed and suffering citizens appealing to the president of the united states for relief with the old party embarrassed by shortages frauds embezzlements and general incompetency these conditions all tend to make confusion worse confounded for you republicans i fancy the distinguished gentleman from ohio together with many of his colleagues before the ides of next november will have occasion in the language of king richard the third to cry out in the anguish of their souls ily conscience hath a thousand sevral tongues and evry tongue brings in a sevral tale and evry tale condemns me formy vote on the tariff bill the republican senate took hides off the free list where the house placed them and restored the dingley rate of 15 per cent ad valorem and also increased the rates on boots shoes and other products of leather in this shape the bill went to conference when it became notorious that the party recently intrusted with power had deliberately and willfully determined to ignore violate repudiate and cast to the winds its solemn platform pledge to revise the tariff downward the president flourished the big stick so often and so effectively used by his predecessor and demanded of the conferees that they reduce the rates on boots shoes and other leather goods and give the grand old party free hides to wrap about its putrifying and dying carcass to shield it from the righteous assaults of a betrayed and infuriated people do not you republicans wish way down in your anatomies where human hearts ought to be that the president had brandished his big stick once more and compelled you to vote for free boots shoes and harness as well as free hides the tariff issue is not settled it requires more than mere executive indorsement to convince american consumers that the highest tariff we ever had is the best i pray the omnipotent one in his infinite goodness to have compassion on us and spare our country another like affliction you solemnly promised downward revision but gave us upward revision at the behests of special interests like the cowards you are you deserted the people who confided in who trusted and who honored you and to the everlasting shame humiliation and disgrace of a once great political party you surrendered them to the merciless remorseless and conscienceless trusts of the country you will utterly fail to deceive the public by the hypocritical pretense that you increased the rates of duty on luxuries and decreased them on the common necessities of life neither can you woo and win the confidence of the masses nor calm the raging seas of discontent with siren songs dedicated to articles on the free list true the free list is a marvel of perfection a splendid monument to republican patriotism and statesmanship it is the product of the combined wisdom of your party and it defines your ideas of common honesty and a square deal blankets are heavily taxed hence i presume they are classed as luxuries the cheaper the blanket the higher the rate of tariff this is an unfair discrimination against the poor which can not be justified the rich who buy highpriced blankets pay only 71 per cent to monopoly while the poor who buy the cheapest blankets or none are compelled to give 165 per cent ad valorem to appease the insatiate appetite of greed for every dollar of actual value they are required to pay 1 65 for tribute by the use of the taxing power of government the republican party has practically excluded blankets from the homes of the poor and robbed millions of good citizens of one of the comforts of life with such a burdensome tariff on blankets the republican party realizing it must do something to win the gratitude and secure the votes of the millions whom it has oppressed has graciously and generously placed on the free list an article of universal usean indispensable article in every american householdand that is dragons blood no wellregulated family should be without dragons blood and i am glad it is as free as the air we breathe cheap flannels like cheap blankets are taxed higher than the costlier grades but flannel is treated and taxed as a luxury and poor people know or must learn that while the republican party is in power they have no right to indulge in luxuries i rather think the country should tolerate and endure without complaint the very small tax of only 143 per cent ad valorem on flannels just as long as a wise beneficent and patriotic party responds to pathetic appeals from millions of homes asking and begging for free dividivi everybody uses and must have this prime necessity of life children cry for it breathes there a man with soul so dead who never to himself hath said give me my dividivi free or give me death clothing is an expensive luxury these days the old party stood pat on dingley rates and left readymade clothing taxed at only 76 59 per cent ad valorema very moderate rate when we consider that all persons rich and poor indulge in the luxury of wearing clothes the latest available statistics show that in 1907 we imported readymade clothing to the value of over 1 000 000 by reason of the tariff this value was automatically increased 760 000 as soon as the goods crossed our border thus forcing consumers to pay 1 760 000 for the imported goods and by reflex operation of law to bear an additional burden of over 76 per cent ad valorem on all domestic readymade clothing but my friends you can with characteristic republican duplicity say to your murmuring constituent this fallbe still sad heart and cease repiningfor while it is true that we have bound you hand and foot and invited rich manufacturers to rob pillage and plunder you we have not forgotten our solemn duty to the millions of american citizens who consume the everyday necessities of life tell them truly that you patriotic statesmen knew the price of clothing would be exorbitant that food products would go beyond the reach of the poor that even in the great city of chicago thousands of little boys and girls would nightly retire to humble couches suffering with hunger tell them also that as a panacea for highpriced food and raiment you have placed on the free list two great household necessities dried blood and fishskins great is the republican party and great will be the fall thereof the paynealdrich bill increases the tariff on ladies stockings to 86 per cent ad valorem i shall not even criticise the distinguished gentleman from new york for this fingallant discrimination against american beauties he convinced me that he is a true friend to the ladies and not really opposed to their wearing stockings provided they can afford them when he made that gallant and successful fight which secured to our mothers our wives and our sweethearts the right to have and enjoy forever free stuffed birds provided the darned things are not fit for any kind of use the american citizen who cares to indulge in the luxury of wearing a wool hat must pay a tribute of 86 per cent ad valorem for the privilege but against this unjust and oppressive tax we point with pride to the fact thanks to the republican party that it is possible for us without paying tribute to any trust to enjoy one of the most sacred gifts of god to manfree fossils republican fossils outfossil all the fossils in the universe revenues must be raised to defray the enormous and rapidly increasing expenses of government the republican party claimsand we should try to believe itthat it favors a high tariff on luxuries and a lower tariff on the necessities of life both along protection lines sugar must be regarded as a luxury used only by the very rich because it is heavily taxed in 1907 we imported sugar to the value of 91 818 829 and the rich people who consumed it paid to the customhouse officials duties aggregating 60 134 181 a portion of this vast sum found its way into the treasury of the united states while the balance was stolen by republicans in charge of the customhouse just how much was stolen only the lord and republican officials know perhaps they would have stolen it all if the men higher up had been more liberal with those lower down but it is necessary to levy a high tax on sugar blankets flannels hats stockings shoes harness and all other like articles which only a few people use in order to avoid the necessity of enacting an incometax law which would impose an unjust and an unbearable burden on the toiling millions of poor people who are today staggering and falling beneath the weight of high prices the policy of the republican party may be rightimpose a high tariff on sugar to satisfy the demands of the sugar trust and thereby secure future campaign contributions but give to a patient longsuffering confiding people free catgut whip gut and worm gut with broken promises insincerity pomposity and guts on the free list the republican partys capital stock in trade is immune from taxation the country is not satisfied with your tariff law nor with the party that enacted it true and loyal citizens in all parts of the united states are aroused as they never were before they have diagnosed the case and found that the grand old party is infected with a malignant form of political leprosy known as cannonisman intolerable and incurable disease a heroic remedy has been prescribed and will be heroically administered that great tribunal of last resort the sovereign citizens of our country have solemnly and unalterably decreed that cannonism together with all those who have aided abetted or assisted cannonism must go too late for you gentlemen to rush into print now and from the teeth out attempt to repudiate and discredit your friend and benefactor your constituents know you have become inoculated with this poisonous virus and they are determined for public good to remove you to the pesthouse of political obscurity the day after the next election some republican marc antony will

purpose to add another line to the debate on the pending tariff bill but sir i am so deeply impressed by the iniquitous provisions of the bill as it came from the senate that in justice to myself and in justice to the constituency i represent i take this opportunity to offer my protest against its enactment into law four months ago congress was called in extraordinary session to revise the tariff ill pursuance of a sacred pledge made to the people by the party in power the evil effects of the dingley law were so apparent to everybody that its repeal was demanded by men of all parties the duties fixed by that law were so high that it had not only resulted in building up gigantic trusts controlling almost every line of business piling up tremendous fortunes wrongfully taken from the pockets of the people but it also had depleted the government treasury until we were facing a deficit of 100 000 000 the cost of the necessaries of life had soared so high that those who work for wages were ground down to a meager living the small manufacturers all over the country were being driven to the wall by the trust combinations and the people finally awakened demanded an honest revision of the tariff downward all political parties in their platforms pronised to carry out the demands of the people if intrusted with power the president declared in the east and in the west that the tariff should be revised downward and the people took him at his word and elected him to the highest office within their gift now let us see what has been done toward a redemption of that pledge we met on the 15th of march and the house proceeded to consider a revision of the tariff and those in charge who evidently were not in sympathy with the president or the promises he had made forced the bill through the house under a rule which prevented the offering of amendments except as to four items leaving nearly 4 000 items standing in the bill as fixed by the standpatters who comprise the majority of the ways and means committee the payne bill as passed by the house instead of being a revision downward was a revision upward and carried a higher average duty than the dingley bill while the bill was under consideration in the house protests against its passage caie from all parts of the country and it was bitterly denounced by the democratic as well as the republican press from one end of the country to the other as being a travesty upon justice and a palpable violation of a party pledge made to the people instead of reducing the duties on the necessaries of life in order that the burdens of taxation might fall more lightly on the poorer people and increasing them on the luxuries consumed by the rich the policy of those in charge seemed to be to make the taxes as high as possible on the masses and as low as possible on the special interests it is a shamne and a disgrace that under our systens of taxation the poor laboring mlan who has a wife and four or five children to support contributes more toward the expenses of the government than does the millionaire who is too proud to raise a family and has no one to clothe and feed except a wife and a poodle dog the state of new york has a tax commission consisting of 15 members and that commission has made a report showing that the wealthy class of that state only pay tax on 1 out of 30 while the poor man who can not cover up his property pays tax on every dollar he is worth there are no more loyal and patriotic people on earth than those who work for wages and they are willing to pay their just share of the government expenses but they do object to the wholesale discrimination against them through the enactment of legislation intended to confer special privileges on a class of people whose hearts are as hard as granite and whose milk of human sympathy is more bitter than gall i hope i am not misunderstood i am not an enemy of wealth i want every mas rich and poor old and young high and low to have the same opportunities and privileges and the same protection under the law i have great admiration for the man who through honesty economy ability and progressiveness accumulates a large sum of money and under no consideration would i support a tariff bill which would tend toward striking down the industrial institutions of our country a large amount of capital in the hands of honest men with good intentions and purposes is a blessing to labor and a help to the country and to mankind the fact is modern civilization demands the employment of a large capital in carrying out our stupendous industrial enterprises it is not the existence but the abuse of capital that meets condemnation and denunciatioin and calls for remedial legislation when combined capital in any hands abuses its legitimate powers becomes oppressive or assumes the form of monopolies it beconies detrimental and dangerous to the nation it then affects injuriously every citizen unless it be the few who fatten at the expense of the many it then becomes greedy extortionate monarchical in its tendencies and practices and not only controls the industrial field but invades the political field as well and the legislative halls and seeks to corrupt both i believe the future of this country depends on the enactment of legislation that will give equal rights to all nen and special privileges to none under our present system of tariff taxation and in the absence of effective antitrust legislation stupendous trusts and combinations have sprung up which have transferred a majority of the wealth of the country into the hands of a few people there surely is much alarm in the fact that 4 000 men now own over 85 per cent of all the wealth of the country and each one of the balance of the 90 000 000 people owns less than 500 in property the records show sir that 51 men who have been the beneficiaries of special legislation now own 4 000 000 000 of this countrys wealth it is a lamentable fact that one thirtyfifth of the entire wealth of the united states is therefore concentrated in the hands of 51 men and these men are today dictating the legislation of this special session of congress ah is not this a dangerous condition and does it not demand the immediate attention of the american people every member of this house must answer to his constituency and let him be judged not by what others have done but by what he himself has done if he has shown by his vote during this special session of congress that he is in sympathy with those who seek special privileges at the expense of the tolling millions he does not deserve an indorsement by his constituency and should be left at home where he can do the country no harm no matter from which political party he comes while the bill was in the house i made the best effort i could in my humble way to secure an honest revision of the schedules keeping in mind the rights of both the producer and the consumer every vote i cast was either a vote to lower the duty below the dingley rate or to place the item on the free list not in a single instance did i vote to continue the dingley rate or for a single increase and i voted against the bill on its final passage for the reason that it was a revision upward instead of downward and was a violation of the pledge made to the people the bill then went to the senate and that body has made it so much worse than the house bill that the people who denounced rightfully and vigorously the house bill would now be glad to see congress adjourn and let the dingley rates stand vicious as they are the dingley bill was bad the payne bill was worse and the aldrich bill is infinitely worse than either of them and has justly aroused the indignation of the people who were promised and expected relief from excessive taxation through a reduction of the schedules below the present rates i heartily commend both democrats and republicans in the senate who made a terrific fight for an honest revision and i earnestly denounce both republicans and democrats who joined with senator aldrich in the passage of a bill which is the most wicked of any tariff bill ever passed by an american congress i am exceedingly glad of the fact that only one democratic senator voted for the bill and am also pleased to note that senator beveridge was one of ten republican senators who voted against it and assigned as a reason that it was a violation of a party pledge and an injustice to the american people i was also pleased with the active interest taken by sellator snively toward the reduction of duties all along the line the action of the senate in dealing with the tariff emphasizes the fact that we have too many millionaires in that body and that a few highprice funerals would be a good thing for the country as i am informed there are now in the united states senate 38 millionaires representing over 140 000 000 what can the people expect at their hands but legislation designed to aid the specialprivileged class i surely hope that the day will soon come when senators will be elected by a popular vote of the people and that the united states senate will no longer be the dumping ground for millionaires who have nothing in common with the plain people the past twentyfive years has witnessed the enormous increase of individual and corporate fortunes in this country until the millionaire is no longer a rarity this fact has served to develop the insolence and arrogance of wealth until intellectual endowments are dwarfed in its sordid presence and moral character lies prostrate in its ruthless path tile power to rule men by intellectual and moral force the test of statesmanship of a former day is fast passing away while wealth the uncrowned king oftentimes lacking both and coveting neither arrogantly seeks to rule in a domain where it is only fitted tb serve its altar has been erected in every community and its votaries are found in every household patriotism has given place to material expediency and the love of country is supplanted by the love of money an aptness for percentages and the successful manipulation of railroads and stock boards are often regarded as the most essential of senatorial equipmnents there is another element more dangerous to the liberties of the people than that of individual wealth in its influence on the election of senators the wonderful growth of our country has been greatly accelerated by the combinations of wealth in corporate forms these in their proper spheres are to 1e encouraged rather than condemned but when they leave their legitimate fields of operation and seek to control against the interests of the people the legislation of the country whether they be railroads corporations or trusts or combines they will meet with the indignant protests of all true friends of the people the nuimber of employees in their control the concentration of great wealth in their treasuries render their advances most enticing and their approaches most insinuating their interests are guarded by the ablest men of each community ald if public rumor be true they can lay their hands on representatives of the people in many of the legislatures and claim them as their own if the people dare to seek relief from their exactions they are met by the agents of the corporations who attempt to thwart them at every step all that slrewdness audacity and money can suggest is readily at their command the legislature is invaded and the rights of the people give place to the exactions of corporate power while he who can serve the corporations by his control of a legislature by intrigue artifice or persuasion against thedenmands of the people is regarded in modern days as fully equippd for service in the united states senate where in that larger field his powers can be utilized for the benefit of the corporattions be serves the standard for the exalted position of united states senator is thus debased by corporate influence the wirepuller and the intriguer are often preferred to the statesman and the patriot and the proud title of united states senator has lost much of its power in the suspicions which lurk in the public niind as to the mode conditions and requirements of their selection i hope the day will soon come when the united states senate will be composed entirely of men who represent more loyalty and less wealth more patriotism and less plutocracy men who love their country more than their money when that body is so made up such tariff bills a the one we are now considering will never emanate from that end of the capitol the bill as it comes to us from the senate will bear heavily on practically all the people and especially those who work for wages senator la follette has shown that on clothing alone the people will be robbed of 120 000 000 annually and this is but one of a thousand items where similar extortions will be practiced this bill will materially increase the cost of living all along the line and those who are now struggling to make both ends meet will find their task still harder practically all the necessities of life are heavily taxed under this bill and the burdens are heaviest on the cheaper class of goods consumed by the poorer people the cotton manufacturers are given a prohibitive duty and have an absolute monopoly on their finished product on 6 25 worth of cotton cloth such as is used by the plain people there is a tax of 1 57 under the dingley law 100 yards of unbleached sheeting was taxed 4 while under this bill it is taxed 6 06 and the same is true all through the cotton schedule three dollars worth of ordinary cotton stockings is taxed 1 65 while the cotton schedule is bad the woolen schedule is worse on a woolen suit of clothes costing 15 there is a tax of 6 80 25 yards of worsted valued at 60 are taxed 7 10 25 yards of cheap flannel valued at 8 75 are taxed 5 25 7 50 worth of cheap woolen hats are taxed 4 76 and so it goes all through the woolen schedule these are only a few of the 4 000 items of the bill but they show the extent senator aldrich and his followers are willing to go for the benefit of the highly protected industries of the new england states it is estimated by those who are in a position to know that the duties carried in this bill will yield annually to the woolen manufacturers over 100 000 000 in excess of what would be a fair profit that the cotton schedules will enable the cotton manufacturers to charge 90 000 000 each year for their products more than would be a reasonable profit and that the manufacturers of hosiery and gloves will be able to charge as long as they can hold their breath without danger of foreign competition you have sent this bill to conference without giving us an opportunity of vot4ng against the senate amendments and what may we expect from the conference even if that committee had not been packed with standpat members of both the house and the senate the best we could expect would be a compromise between the payne bill which is a higher bill than the dingley bill and the aldrich bill whichis 20 per cent higher than the payne bill to be sure however that but few of the 847 senate amendments may get away the speaker has appointed on the conference committee only those on the republican side who at all times have stood for the highest duties and who are in hearty sympathy with the aldrich bill instead of selecting the house conferees in the order of their seniority as was done in the senate the speaker ignored representatives hill of connecticut and neediiam of california who have stood for some reductions and appointed representatives calderijead of kansas and fordney of michigan who are standpatters of the most pronounced type therefore it is safe to say that the bill as finally reported will be substantially the aldrich bill and the name of the hon sfrno e payne will forever be forgotten so far as tariff legislation is concerned when the bill is finally acted upon i shall vote against it to the end that i may not be held responsible for such vicious legislation imposed upon an outraged public i shall watch with much anxiety the action of the president who assured the country that the tariff should be revised downward while i am exceedingiy anxious to get away yet if the president will veto this outrageous measure i will gladly remain indefinitely and stand loyally by him until his pledge is fully and completely kept if this bill becomes a law thesugar trust will continue to rob the american people of 55 000 000 annually and the woolen manufacturers will continue to exact from the consumers over 100 000 000 each year in excess of what is a fair profit the united states steel company will continue to exploit the people of millions annually while the 400 trusts set out in moodys manual will build up colossal fortunes wrung from the pockets of the working people on behalf of the laborer who with his dinner bucket in his hand finds his way to his daily work who will be tjul 12 compelled to pay more forthe necessities of life and who already has a hard time to feed and clothe his family i protest against the passage of this bill on behalf of 9 000 000 poor working girls who will be compelled to pay more for their dresses more for their hosiery and gloves more for everything they wear i earnestly protest against the passage of this unjust measure in the name of the farmers who will be compelled to sell on a freetrade market and buy on a protected market and in the name of the retail merchants all over the country who will be compelled to pay more for what they buy and charge more for what they sell which will involve them in much embarrassment with their patrons i now protest against the passage of this iniquitous measure and confidently hope the president will keep his plighted faith with the people and veto the bill the action of congress is a keen disappointment to the american people and especially to the toiling millions who were expecting at least partial relief from the burdens of excessive taxation"], [0.013510584831237793, 0.9864894151687622, 1, "it is my purpose to discuss today the record of the present administration i shall do this without commenting in any manner whatever upon the personality of the distinguished gentleman who is now president of the united states the white house today represents the highest type of the american home for in the family circle of the president are to be found that gracious womanhood that innocent childhood that lofty integrity and sterling manhood which together have made the american home the highest type in all the world and i think none will deny that the same virtues equally vigorous and strong adorn the home of the distinguished opponent of the president in the last campaign the country is therefore to be congratulated that the two great parties nominated for the greatest office in the world men whose personal virtues are so high that the muckraker could find no employment in the contest between them at the commencement of every national campaign it is customary for political parties to enter into a compact with the people of the nation this compact or contract as you may please to call it is in the form of a platform in the campaign of 1908 the two great parties of this nation solemnly contracted with the people to do certain things set forth in their respective platforms the republican party in national convention solemnly made certain pledges which constituted the consideration of its contract with the people and the people on their part intrusted the administration of the nation to that party on election day the contract was consummated on both sides the party made certain pledges or promises and the people conferred power to execute those pledges or promises upon the present administration it is my purpose today to discuss briefly the manner in which the party in power has lived up to its contract there is something peculiar concerning the two contracts of 1900 and 1904 it is true that in both those years the same party successfully contracted with the american voters but with an implied understanding which was well expressed by the elder statesmen of the party and which for the time being appeared satisfactory to the people for instance the platform of 1900 was interpreted to mean simply stand pat and the platform of 1904 was interpreted to mean let well enough alone those were halcyon days for the party in power stand pats and let well enough alone were platforms easy of execution both might mean anything or nothing but they captured a majority in this house and in the other chamber they placed a republican president at the other end of the avenue there was pie for all what more could be added to the sum total of republican happiness and contentment just here i pause to make this observation when i take the republican platform of 1908 and read that paragraph headed accomplishments of theodore roosevelt and the following paragraph entitled countrys great prosperity i wonder that the brain of man could evolve anything additional that any human being could do to add to that which they proclaimed colonel roosevelt as having already done in promoting the happiness and prosperity of the people of this nation now listen the greatest accomplishments of theodore roosevelt have been first and foremost a brave and impartial enforcement of the law it was probably deemed necessary to make this announcement because the republican party felt guilty of having enforced the law in a different manner for that party had been in absolute control of every branch of the national government for eight years we are told in the next sentence that illegal trusts and monopolies have been prosecuted what more could any man do that which many people believe to be the most difficult undertaking of the century had been already accomplished by colonel roosevelt all the illegal trusts all the illegal monopolies had been prosecuted the law had been vindicated henceforth no illegal trust or monopoly can live in the country for colonel roosevelt has already brought them to justice has already made of these offenders such fearful examples that never again will any one of them violate the law still reading i come to this as one of the accomplishments of the expresident the more effective xegulation of rates and services of the great transportation lines the complete overthrow of preferences rebates and discriminations why has this congress been wasting time in passing additional railroad legislation according to this statement deliberately inserted in the platform of the party in power colonel roosevelt has already completely overthrown preferences rebates and discriminations which for years have 831 5 been building up certain cities or communities to the injury of other cities or communities how utterly useless this new bill of the administration and think what a reflection this railroad bill is upon the accomplishments of the expresident for weeks we have been wasting time in attempting to pass a bill to remedy certain evils which can not exist for if colonel roosevelt accomplished the complete overthrowmark that word complete if you please of preferences rebates and discriminations then we have i repeat been wasting time in passing the bill sent in here by the administration i would like to know what our friends the republican insurgents have been insurging about anyway in this chamber and elsewhere hours days and even weeks have been spent in discussing measures intended to prevent discriminations by the railroads of this country some of you insurgents were perhaps elected because of the stand you took on this question and lo i we find in the republican platform that the whole business is a much ado about nothing for colonel roosevelt himself long ago completely accomplished the overthrow of preferences rebates and discriminations what mean all these telegrams which have been pouring in all these resolutions and petitions from boards of trade and chambers of commerce i hold in my hand certain resolutions adopted by the merchants association of the city of ilaleigh in my district and the very heading of the resolutions is discriminating freight rates these merchants express themselves in favor of so changing the law as to prevent discriminatory and exorbitant rates in favor of certain communities and points known as gate cities and so forth and reading further these merchants say whereas all north carolina is suffering on account of discriminatory rates they pray congress to pass some law whereby these intolerable conditions will be remedied have any of you gentlemen received anything that reads like this how are you republicans replying to such resolutions your platform says that all these things were completely overthrown by colonel roosevelt all of the foregoing being applied means what that the republican platform tried to humbug and in the last campaign did actually humbug the voters of this nation and i will make a prediction here and now i voted for your railroad bill because i was willing to take the chance that it might do some good but i very much fear that the bill i voted for will not be the measure which will get to the president the railroad bill has been sent to conference and the people of the country have come to know what sending to conference too often means the secrecy of the conference room is the hope of the interests you will pass some sort of a bill after it is passed and the president has signed it i venture the prediction that the very people who are sending in these telegrams and resolutions and petitionsthe people who know that these preferences rebates and discriminations do exist in spite of these highsounding phrases in your platformwill never know that the law as it now exists has been changed a party pledged to maintain the policy of protection is the last agency in the world sane men should expect to accomplish a revision of the tariff to a lower plane a political party which has itself been the beneficiary of all manner of unjust preferences and discriminations whose very basic principle is one of preference and discrimination is the last party in the world which sane men should expact to pass effective legislation against such evils a political party which breathes itself the very atmosphere of discrimination is the last party which sane men should expect to make the same practice by others unlawful the dayupon which a law is passed making it impossible for one man to be taxed to make another man rich that day the party in power will go out of existence and when in the life of this nation the day comes when some party or agency shall have so reformed the laws under which we live that all men will enjoy equal opportunity when all unjust practices and discriminations shall be overthrown that day the mission of the party in power will be at an end for during its lease of life and power these evils have appeared and prospered under its fostering care and protection the illegal trust bears upon it the birthmark of the republican party can that party be expected to kill its own offspring the railroads of the country we are told have been discriminating between cities and communities can anyone wonder that they follow the example of the party in power let me read a little further i find also that the workers of this nation are absolutely without any grievance for among the accomplishments of mr roosevelt we find the arbitration of labor disputes what about all these petitions we have been receiving from the workers all over this nation what about these strikes of which we are continually hearing there can be no excuse for strikes any longer for among the accomplishments of the expresident we find the peaceful and proper settlement of labor disputes by arbitration but now i come to something still more interesting what investigation is that which has been pending for the past four or five months among the accomplishments of the expresident i find enumerated the conservation of our national resources i gladly give colonel roosevelt the credit for sounding the tocsin of danger the conference of governors was held at the suggestion of the expresident and i would not withhold from him one iota of the credit to which he may be entitled but what do we behold today we see men upon whom theodore roosevelt very largely depended to carry into effect this splendid suggestion dismissed from office and for what because they were false to their trust not at all because of any wrongdoing not at all were they not doing what they could to make it impossible for monopoly to acquire the nations oil timber minerals and water power will any gentleman on this floor allege that these men were false to the interest of the people i leave this matter merely observing that the american people are anxious to hear whether colonel roosevelt thinks his conservation policy is being enforced congress was convened in extra session to enable the present administration to redeem its pledge for tariff revision it has been stated on this floor by a distinguished republican statesman that almost without exception the great manufacturing concerns of this country are monopolistic in character it has likewise been repeatedly charged by republican statesman in another chamber that these great interests were enabled to combine and fix prices by reason of the protection against competition afforded by tile dingley tariff law i believe that ninetenths of the information upon which the majority of the ways and means committee acted in framing the present law was furnished by the manufacturing interests of the countrythemselves more vitally interested in the bill than any other persons could possibly be whether the party in power has kept faithfully its pledge to the people can best be learned from the independent and republican press of the country let me read extracts from a few of these papers the minneapolis journalsaid to be republican in political tendency thus describes the manner in which the present law was framed the tariff we are about to have like the tariff we at present have is a political tariff that is to say the payne tariff like the dinglcy tariff resulted from consultaiion with manufacturing interests what doyou want was asked of each as much as the trafflc would stand but political tariffs no longer fill the bill they are too inaccurate too arbitrary too oppressive what the future demands is not a political tariff but a scientific tariff a tariff that fits the economic forces closely that affords the country the advantages of protection and yet avoids the injustices of such overproduction as caddles monopolies and again the review of reviews an independent magazine of september 1909 speaking of the present law says the reduction of rates in so far as the consumer is concerned were more nominal than real the great protected interests were all well looked after the nominal reductions in iron and steel were little or nothing as compared with what the great american steel industry could readily have borne it does not seem to us that the payne aldrich bill can compare favorably with the dingley or mckinley tariff the san francisco call independent republican on august 4 1909 said the standpatters have succeeded in defeating the wishes of the people for a revision downward of the tariff the bill which will come out of conference is not a revision downward but upward no such tariff will be accepted by the american people as a settlement of the question the new york tribune admittedly the most reliable as well as the most influential republican journal in the country had this to say the tribune does not hesitate to say that it would have preferred a somewhat larger measure of reduction the interests opposing revision of any sort were entrenched in both houses of congress even the new york sun we hear heaving this despairing sigh well let us make the best of it all and be glad it is over and again the providence journal said to be independent with republican leaningson august 8 1909 in speaking of this law declared it not only falls to meet the views of intelligent democrats it does not measure up to the hopes of most republicans it is a patchwork a compromise that was inevitable but it is also a tissue of injustices and inconsistencies it does not accord with the republican partys professions of a year ago whether the political faith of these journals has been stated correctly or not it can at least be said they are not democratic in sentiment if time permitted i could give you many pages of just such comments as these not from democratic but from republican and independent journals and magazines of the country and this is the bill which president taft says is the best tariff law ever passed by congress this is the bill which you republicans insist fulfills your pledge of tariff reforma bill which has given to the manufacturer all he asked and the consumer nothing a bill which was drawn not in the interest of all the people but in the interest of a few people a bill which is the very shield of monopoly which taxes millions not for the benefit of the national treasury but for the benefit of the treasury of nearly every trust and monopoly in the land that is the bill which according to the president is the best tariff law the country has ever had and which makes good the pledge of his party to the people just a year ago in this chamber it was my privilege to submit some observations respecting the manner in which the present law was framed i venture to repeat today that this great question should not be treated as a political football to be kicked hither and thither the question is of such vital importance that its consideration should by common consent be placed high above any political party no just man wants success as the price of injustice to the humblest of his fellowcitizens the day will come when protected interests will not be permitted to come before the ways and means committee of this house and get what they want by telling us what they must have we do not treat our river and harbor bills or our publicbuilding bills as partisan measures i trust the day will come when the people of this nation will demand that tariff bills be treated as nonpartisan measures when the demand will be so universal that tariff bills can not be drawn by the friends of protection or the enemies of protection but by those only sent here pledged to consider no special interests all political parties may as well be warned that conditions which now prevail can not endure the average man is an individual of small means the cost of living in the united states according to bradstreet has advanced 60 per cent since 1896 this enormous increase in cost has put some of the necessaries of life beyond the reach of the average citizen many of the comforts and nearly all of the luxuries the dollar buys less today than ever before unless in times when the influence of war affected prices according to the bureau of labor wages have increased 20 per cent since 1899 but taking 14 of the leading articles used by the people there has been an actual decrease of 374 per cent in the purchasing power of the dollar considering therefore the purchasing power of the dollar there has been a decrease instead of increase in wages and salaries to render the increase in wages and in the prices of these necessaries of life the same instead of an increase of 20h per cent there should have been an increase of 50 to 60 per cent in wages the net result is that there has been a decrease instead of an increase in the surplus dollars which many wageearners and salaried men of the country have to spend or save the high cost of living is a most serious problem this increase in the cost of the necessaries of life is to some extent at least attributable to the killing of competition between the great concerns which control prices how a condition so serious so oppressive can be fully remedied i will not venture to discuss at this time but one thing i believe can not be denied and that is the payne bill has tended to make these conditions worse and not better there are one or two other matters which i wish to discuss of course we all know that the great staple which the south produces has advanced in price during recent years the republican party points with pride to the advance in the price of cotton the wonder is that it was not mentioned as one of the accomplishments of the administration of colonel roosevelt when the price of that staple was low clevelands administration was blamed by our republican friends there is no import duty on cotton and hence it can not be contended that protection puts up the price what the southern planter needs is a wider market with all the world and protection tends to contract not expand that market protection has almost succeeded in driving the stars and stripes from the bosom of the seas instead of expanding our commerce it tends to provoke measures of retaliation when the republican party tells the southern farmer that in any manner whatever protection tends to put up the price of the great southern staple or in any manner whatever tends to open up new markets it assumes that this farmer is a man very easily deceived since the late war between the states the lowest average ever paid for one entire crop of cotton was in 189899 the average price of good cotton in new york city during that season was 6 cents per pound and mr mckinley was president with a republican congress behind him that price in new york city meant 4j to 5 cents per pound to the farmer but you never hear our republican friends allude to 5cent cotton under mr mckinley with apologies to those who may do me the honor to read this speech for alluding to a claim so full of demagogy i will dismiss this matter with the statement that i will append to my remarks a table showing fluctuation in prices during recent years prices have been high the world over but the lowest average touched for a whole crop of cotton was under a republican administration and while the highest tariff law ever enacted up to that time was in force the south has suffered much endured much she has drunk to the very dregs of the cup of bitterness stripped of herwealth prescribed enduring discrimination she knows that there are some things of which she can not be deprived the smile of god which brings peace and prosperity which none can destroy is upon her it seems to have been ordained by providence that the south must always be the land of cotton the british government tried to produce it in africa and failed there is little increase in the crop in egypt and we are told that there never can be very much other sections have the climate but it seems they have not the soil the southern planter knows that the price of his staple product is fixed first by the size of the crop and second by the demand if he is wise he will always keep this in mind i am going to append to these remarks a table showing that prices touched their lowest point under a republican administration and under a republican high tariff when the republican party explains in a satisfactory manner why this occurred then and not till then will the southern planter pay attention to its claim for credit for the advance in the price of cotton the republican pary is making the plea it has made every two years for support in the south my state is being flooded with letters and documents from republican statesmen claiming that the country is in a state of great prosperity for which that party is entitled to credit i for one have not been aware of this unprecedented prosperity i am told that our cottonmilling industry is in a condition far from satisfactory indeed some of our best managed mills are today standing idlenot a wheel turning employees without work others are running on less than full time i had not heard until these letters and circulars were sent out that this particular industry was at this time enjoying such wonderful prosperity but my good friend and colleague from my own state has been announcing the existence of this great prosperity in numerous letters to the voters of north carolina and in a speech recently delivered on this floor likewise he has been repeating the old republican fallacy that clevelands administration was responsible for the low price of farm products and what is called country produce in 1896 that succeeding administrations are entitled to the credit for the higher prices which farmers have been receiving for the same commodities in more recent years a sufficient answer to his claim of prosperity for the cottonmilling industry of the state is i think contained in some replies which my colleague has been receiving to his letters i will publish two of these replies as a part of these remarks together with a portion of an editorial from the news and observer the leading daily of the state as to his claim that republican administrations are entitled to the credit for the high prices of country produee while mr clevelands administration was deserving of blame for the low prices of 1896 i merely observe that if mr cleveland must be blamed for the low prices of 1896 then mr harrison must be held responsible for the low prices of the very same things from 1888 to 1892 the democratic party has only had control of this government for two years during the last fortyfive i submit that it is so utterly unfair to chargo the low prices of country produce to mr clevelads administration that i am ready to apologize for alluding to it i would not do so but for the dignity of the position held by my colleague and his standing as a member of this body equally unfair is the charge of my colleague that the democratic administration of his state was responsible for the decrease of 12 000 000 in the taxable property of the state he says this decrease occurred between the years 1s91 and 1897 but he skillfully refrains from designating the particular years during which this decrease of 12 000 000 actually occurred i will merely observe with respect to that charge that the republican party had control of the state during the years 1895 1896 and 1s97 it is known of all men that the credit of north carolina suffered more in the estimation of the world during the russell administration than during any other period of the existence of the state except when the same republican party had control once before the scandals of the period between the years 1894 and 1 898 were only surpassed by the scandals which occurred in the period between the years 1868 and 1872 while our republican friends are blaming the democratic party of my state for a decrease of 12 000 000 in the value of the taxable property of the state which decrease occurred when the democratic party was not in power surely they will not deny credit to the same democratic party for the increase of 161 090 098 between the years of 1904 and 1908 when the party had complete controlthe greatest increase during any four years of the states history it is my purpose for a while to discuss without prejudice and fairly if i can the claims of the two great parties to the support of the voters of my state and section for one i do not admit the power of the party lash nor do i believe that tradition or inheritance should dominate the judgment and reason of the voters of this nation i deny that there is any binding influence in a mere name i maintain that the voter is and ought to be the sovereign and that party is and should be the servant of the voterthe medium whereby the principles of the voter are applied to governmental administration if the democratic party has not been a faithful servant to the people of the southand i speak of the south because in that section the party has been in controlit should be dislodged from power at the first opportunity so far as the administration of the republican party in that section is concerned but a word is necessary there are hardly words in the english language which can adequately describe the administration of that party in the states of the south i know the history of republican rule in my own state when i say it was incompetent when i say it was corrupt i give you but a faint idea of what my state endured the rule of the republican party directly after the civil war is a byword the world over the historical novels which have been written do not paint the picture darker than will the impartial historian when he comes to write the record of events of that period but thirty years after the civil war ended the people of my state decided to give the republican party another chance in 1894 both branches of the general assembly were republican this gave to the party complete control inasmuch as the governor of the state is not under our constitution vested with the veto power but two years thereafter in 1896 a republican governor was elected and for two years every department of the state government was under republican control in both branches of the general assembly the majority was overwhelmingly large with a governor in the executive chair and two senators in the united states senate the control of the republican party was complete with what result scandal and incompetence almost everywhere scandal in the agricultural department scandal in the administration of the state prison scandal in the office of the state treasurer yes scandal in the office of the governor himself it is amazing to reflect now how much scandal appeared in so short a time most of our towns had been protected against the possibility of negro rule from time to time by the action of democratic legislatures but those two republican assemblies proceeded to change the charters of some of our most important cities with the certain result that many responsible municipal offices were at once filled by colored men in the year 1898 nearly a thousand negroes were holding official positions in north carolina alone the effect of this on the white race was of course bad while the effect upon the other race was still worse the danger of race conflict was in many places constant and imminent the humiliation of the state was so compltee that to this day respectable republicans are seldom heard defending the administration of their party from 1894 to 1898 it was not possible that this order of things could last very long many good men had been deceived into supporting the republican ticket when they saw the result they were not slow to act in 1898 the republican party was driven from power in disgrace and two years thereafter the people of the state elected a democratic governor upon the threshold of this campaign we are again hearing the oldtime republican plea that the only obstacle in the way of republican success in the south is prejudice and heredity with utter disregard of recent history republican statesmen are telling the people of our good old state the republican party is your best friend if you will only put aside prejudice and give us a chance we will prove our friendship for you even the president himself has invited the people of the south to sit down at the republican table and participate in the good things always to be found there dont hold aloof cries the president come over and help run this great government which belongs to us all if the southern people cherish any prejudice at all it is not against the republican party as a party but against the administration which that party has given to that people whenever it has had control i deny that there is any prejudice at all in my state against any man mierely because of his political affiliation come over and be a part of the nation pleads the president and yet this distinguished gentleman went to north carolina in 1906 and having before him the state convention of his own party proceeded to say in my judgment the republican party of north carolina would be much stronger as a voting party if all federal offices were filled by democrats when all hope of choice by the people is abandoned and everything is given over to influencing a distant appointing power to choose partcular men to perform official functions 11 a community politically hostile to thosemen the result is not good to the men or the community as long however as the republican party in the southern states shall represent little save a factional chase for federal offices in which business men and men of substance in the community have no desire to enter and in the result of which they have no interest we may expect the present political conditions of the south to continue in 1906 just four years ago president taft very correctly described his own party in north carolina as representing little save a factional chase for federal office has that party changed since 1906 the people of my state would like to know whether the president has changed his opinion and if so what has occurred to justify such change certainly the very same leaders who were in control then are in control now indeed i speak the truth when i say that some of the very leaders who were in control in 1898 are in control now and yet we are told if we will only put aside our prejudices and give the republican party another chance it will guarantee a better state government than the people enjoyed under the administration of such men as aycock and glenn and are enjoying now under governor kitchin a claim so preposterous will hardly be heeded if president taft were a resident of my state he would not i believe support the state and local tickets put up by his own party yes the people of my state do cherish a prejudice it is a prejudice against incompetence in office a prejudice against scandal in administration a strong abiding prejudice against the things they saw in 1894 and 1898 if the p9ople of the south should accept the invitation of the president what guaranty will he give them that his party can do better in 1910 than it did in 1894 the president for whom i entertain very great respect can not himself administer his party affairs in the south he must do that through others william h taft can not be governor of any southern state the general assembly of my state which will be elected next november will not be controlled by mr taft and it will be composed of north carolina democrats or north carolina republicans what guaranty can mr taft give us that a republican legislature elected in 1910 will be any better than was the republican legislature elected in 1896 four years ago he told us candidly that his party in the south represented little save a factional chase for federal offices and i undertake to say that if such a calamity should befall my state next november as the election of a republican general assembly that assembly would be to a very large degree composed of the very men mr taft was denouncing in his greensboro address in 1906just four years ago but let us examine briefly what inducement if any the president himself holds out to the southern people to come over and participate to cast aside prejudice or in plainer language to join his party after all that is what the invitation means when the president goes down south and laments the stubbornness of the people of that section in holding aloof from participation in running this government he is lamenting the fact that that section is democratic and not republican and up to this good hour i submit he has not given us any sufficient reason why we should change our party allegiance before the president was inaugurated and for a while thereafter we were led to believe that his appointments in the south would be absolutely in accord with the sentiments of the people of the community in which the appointments were to be made the taking of the new census was to be nonpartisan supervisors were to be divided between both parties the wishes and the sentiments of the people would be respected and considered rather than the wishes and sentiments of the republican machine in my state the president has appointed one democrat a federal judge for this action he has and is entitled to the thanks of the people but barring that appointment i make the charge here and now that the voice of the republican machine has in my state at least been all powerful not one democratic census supervisor has been appointed the administration of the civil service i believe to be largely a humbug the inducements held out by the present administration to the southern people to change their political faith are i submit hardly sufficient more than this it would not be creditable to the intelligence or virtue of the people of that section or of any section if they allowed themselves to be persuaded to change their political faith merely to participate in the distribution of patronage i am proud to believe that the people of the south will never be influenced in their political affiliation by any such consideration these republican statesmen who are advising the voters of the south to abandon the democratic party boldly proclaim that such change in political faith is necessary in order to enable the party in power to give to the south that to which it is entitled we are told that the republican party has no incentive to heed our appeals because the south has refused to fall in line with the procession ofrepublican states they even tell us it is good business to vote the republican ticket if the south must barter away her honest convictions in order to receive from this administration or any administration that consideration to vhich she is justly entitled as a part of this union thenshe is content to submit in the future as in the past to that discrimination which even republicans admit has been practiced against her and her people if the republican party has not treated the south with justice in the past for the sake of pure simple justice it will not do so in the future in 1904 13 southern states had more than oneseventh of the entire wealth of the nation and more than onefourth of the population what has been the treatment which those states have received from the party in power in fortytwo years they have had five members of all the cabinets of all republican presidents during nine administrations of republican presidents the south has had five members of all nine cabinets this union is a family of states united bound together by ties which no power but the great god himself can ever burst asunder it is indeed fitting that the members of the presidents official family shall be distributed as the years go by as nearly as possible among all the states of the union no state should ever be made to feel that her sons are shut out from representation in the presidents official family but in fortytwo years out of more than 80 appointments only five have been accredited to the south and out of that five several could hardly be said to represent the states to which they were accredited a very recent compilation brings out these striking facts of our ambassadors and ministers not one is from a cotton state of our consulsgeneral only three are from cotton states of 323 men in the entire consular service only 31 are from the south ohio alone is better represented in that service than all of the 12 cotton states put together these statistics indicate the treatment which the south has received from the party which is now inviting that section to change her political faith it is not disputed that the south has been denied her proper and proportionate representation because she has been democratic and not republican and this is the plea of the republican party to the people of the south translated into plain english because you have received such treatment as this from the party in power come over and unite with that party because you have been thus ignored by the republican party you will find it to be good business to vote the republican ticket because you have been thus denied by the same party the representation to which your section is justly entitled come over and align yourself with the republican party this i repeat is the plea that party is making to the people of my state perhaps it would be mpre correct to call it a threat whatever it may be called i hardly think it will be heeded 0 if there is a man living who thinks the people of the south will ever heed such an invitation as that i will tell that man here and now he does not know the people of that section he is a stranger to their tradition and ignorant of their history if in order to get the representation to which she is justly entitled the south must turn traitor to her principles she will be content to remain in that political isolation which has been forced upon her she will neither sell her honor for office nor will she be intimidated by the threat of continued isolation she does not believe in your paynealdrich tariff bill and in my humble judgment never will she can not accept the opinion of the president that this is the best tariff the country has ever had she does not believe your invitation is welltimed anyway for in the north and west the indications are that your own people are deserting the standard of monopoly and high protection she hears echo of protest from the sixth missouri district against your paynealdrich lawa democratic majority increased by 2 000 votes she hears an echo from the fourteenth massachusetts which tells of a protest against your party and its policiesa republican majority of 14 250 changed to a democratic majority of 5 640 and more recently she has heard still another echo from the thirtysecond new york congressional district which tells of a republican majority of 10 167 converted into a democratic inajority of more than 5 000 the south thinks this is not the year to listen to these seductive republican whisperings if she ever had any intention of doing so she has a faith strong deep abiding that her principtas are right and that under god sooner or later they must prevail she asks little and expects little her living sons do not dream of filling the presidents chair they neither ask it nor expect it they are willing indeed to support any one of a number of men i might mention not because she expects patronage but because of the principles for which they stand she is willing to support the distinguished minority leader of this house if he is willing to put aside the certainty of being speaker of the next house of representatves she is willing to support the present mayor of the metropolis of the nation unless that jurist and statesman feels that duty requires him to complete an administration of that city which so far has not only silenced just criticism but has challenged the admiration of foes as well as friends she is quite willing to support that sou of the presidents own state who is held in such high esteem by his own people that the prestige of the president himself and the influence of the former national administration combined could not prevent his election as governor of the state of ohio talk about prejudice and sectionalism the south of all sections of this union is entitled to be exempt from the charge she knows perfectly well that she has sons who in character fitness and intellect rank with the nations greatest men our own charles b aycock and other southern men i might name are the peers of any man mentioned as the candidate of either party for the presidency but the south is suppressing any aspirations which may be entertained by her own sons out of deference to sentiments which she fears are still cherished in other sections her attitude is one of magnanimity exactly the opposite of prejudice naturally she is drawn to the democratic party because she has been treated with justice by that party she prefers not to change her allegiance to a party in whose principles she does not believe and which has treated her in the manner described in conclusion the south politely but firmly declines the invitation of the present administration she can not tell you that she feels flattered at the reasons offered by the friends of the administration for the acceptance of this invitation by her for she can not help feeling that these reasons imply a not very lofty estimate of her political honor and intelligence content with her democratic state administrations which are ever without scandal afraid ever to trust your party to again administer her state affairs being warned by past experience the south ready every minute to respond when there is danger to national honor is helping as best she can to fulfill the destiny of the greatest of all the nations of the earth"], [0.01640009880065918, 0.9835999011993408, 1, "i have listened with interest and amusement to the speech of the gentleman from ohio who has just taken his seat i was much amused at some of the things he said for instance he said that the payne tariff bill was the best tariff law ever written in this country and later in his speech he said that if he had had the writing of that bill he probably would not have framed it up as it was framed and put upon the american people as the gentleman was eulogizing the republican party and speaking of the great things it had accomplished in congress i thought of another distinguished republican who at the other end of the capitol on yesterday pronounced this great product of the republican party to which the gentleman refers the payne tariff law the most colossal fraud ever perpetrated upon the american people the gentleman from ohio at this end of the capitol eulogizes the republican party while the able senator from iowa deplores the fact that the republican party has betrayed and deceived the people in the payne tariff law but within the camp of the republican party we find standpatters like the gentleman who has just taken his seat and we find insurgents at the other end and at this end of the capitol making the effort to break away from the special interests fostered and fattened by a high protective tariff a great movement is on amongst the people of this country the individual is waking up to the fact that he has been imposed upon and deceived by the republican party the handwriting is on the wall and he who runs may read what that writing means the gentleman has referred to mr lincoln and says that he was the father of the republican party lincoln would not recognize the republican party of today if he could return to this earth upon one occasion lincoln said the crisis that i see approaching unnerves me and i tremble for the safety of my country if he could be here today and could look upon the large ad pitiful army of the unemployed in this government asking for equal rights to all and special privileges to none and begging for a fair chance in the struggle for existence if he could see the millions of people in this republic organized into clubs and associations declaring that they will eat no more meat becaus3 of the cruel and merciless meat trust which has driven this character of food beyond the reach of the man of small means if he could see the toiling massesthe plain people of this countrybowing beneath the burdens of the payne tariff law as we see it today he would exclaim in the sadness of his soul the condition th e i behold unnerves me and i tremble for the safety of my country lincoln stood for the doctrine that puts the man above the dollar but the republican party has reversed that doctrine and you stand today for the aristocracy of the dollar you have placed the dollar above the man and today it is a notorious fact that special interests and privileged classes control the republican party the patriotic citizen be he democrat or republican is yearning for deliverance from these dreadful conditions all signs point to a democratic house in the sixtysecond congress god speed that day it will give me great pleasure to serve in that congress with my democratic brethren under the splendid leadership of that great democrat from missoarl cheamp clark as speaker of the house and then we will change the gag rules that you have written by which honest legislation is prevented in this house lhe gentleman from ohio says they talk of c annonism whatever that means i will tell you what cannonism means it means gag rule in the peoples house of representatives it means tyranny under the guise of parliamentary procedure in the house the speaker of this house for years served upon the rules committee composed of three republicans and two democrats the speaker suggesting such a rule as would give him more power and take more power from the body of the house his two partisans have voted with him in season and out the two democrats have opposed those rules the speaker has virtually made his own rules the two republicans on the rules committee followed his suggestions and when he came into the house his two partisans submitted the rule as coming from the unanimous vote of the republicans on the rules committee and you gentlemen on that side the republicans of this house sat there and voted for that rule little by little i have seen the power going out of the hands of the peoples representatives into the hands of the speaker of this house and i have seen the will of the people defeated by the exercise of the power in those rules which are unjust and unfair and which constitute an insult to the intelligence the courage and honest purpose of the american people you are going to face the issue of cannonism in this campaign you are going to meet the tariff issue in this campaign we are going to call upon you about some measures that you have not given us an opportunity to vote on the gentleman from ohio said whoever heard of a man dealing in horses when he did not have any horses you are permitting today the gamblers of wall street to speculate in cotton to handle a hundred million bales in one season and sell stuff that they do not ownthat is not in existenceand you permit them to use that paper stuff to destroy the legitimate profits of that great product which brings to america the balance of trade we have come to you in the name of the cotton farmers of the south and asked you to give us a law to prevent this gambling in farm products i have advocated this legislation for years we have succeeded in getting a bill favorably reported from the committee on agriculture it hangs upon the calendar today and in my judgment youexpect to let it die there why because the interests affected by that bill in wall street will contribute to the republican campaign fund we ask that you give us a chance to pass this measure will you do it will you give us a chance to vote on it i will wait and see now the democratic party is responsible for the investigation of the land frauds in the wstthe ballinger investigation it was a democrat mr glavis who gave the information that led to the criminal scheme to place the peoples landa part of the public domainin the hands of a conscienceless and avaricious land syndicate it was a democrat from nebraska who introduced a resolution calling for the investigation it was a democrat the able missourian who started the fight on cannonism it was the result of democratic preachment of democratic appeals to the people that forced you to call an extra session of congress to revise the tariff i could go through a long list gentlemen showing to you and to the country that no legislation that seeks to benefit the masses of the people is ever suggested by the republicans of this house it is sometimes true that after we have worked up public opinion and aroused the people on some measure you take away from us the credit and put a republicans name to the bill but it is the result of democratic work in this house we have exposed the doings of the republican party until insurgents on that side view the political situation with alarm and they are trying to escape the approaching storm and to them i say it is not far to our camp come and help us drive from place and power the enemies of the republic some of you insurgents are pretty clever republicans but the trouble is you will not insurge long enough just when you could render valuable service to your country the gentleman who presides over this house the speaker has some mysterious power by which he can manage to control you upon matters of importance to the interests i call to mind the postal savingsbank scheme by which he got you into caucus by which he bound and tied us by the gag rule you brought into this house you are going to hear from that rule and the way you denied us the opportunity to amend and perfect that postal savingsbank bill you will hear from it during this campaign you brought into this house a rule which said that no amendment could be offered to make that bill of so much importance to the people just what it should be why because the interests that wanted the opportunity to withdraw from the locality where the deposits will be made the money of the people and take it to wall street or chicago knew that we would amend the bill and strike that provision out not only that but you put into the hands of the man who presides over this house the power to make his oldtime rulings and in that special rule you cut off the right of appeal from the speakers rulings during the consideration of that bill yes that is what you did insurgents and all how will you insurgents explain that vote for a cannon rule we made considerable headway toward destroying cannonism when we took away from the speaker the power to appoint the ballinger investigating committee yes this house took away from him that right and we elected six members later on we changed the rules committee and justly took the speaker off but what did you do you increased the number to ten and four democrats and six republicans are on that committee what did the republican members do on this gag rule which denied us the right to amend the postal savingsbank bill and denied us the right to appeal from the speakers rulings voted solidly for it that is what you did and the democrats on the committee voted against it so it seems that the speaker still has his rabbit foot and used it on insurgents as well as regulars for they all looked alike on that day and the speaker smiled as they all voted for that shameful and arbitrary rule i want to say to my friend from ohio that cannonism is an issue and the people of this country understand what cannonism means i want to read now from a very interesting document it is a speech delivered at st paul minn june 11 by mr gifford pinchot formerly chief forester ofthe united states here is what he said in part all monopoly rests on the unregulated control of natural resources and natural advantages and such control by the special interests is impossible without the help of politics the alliance between business and politics is the most dangerous thing in our political life it is the snake that we must kill the special interests must get out of politics or the american people will put them out of business there is no third course because the special interests are in politics we as a nation have lost confidence in congress this is a serious statement to make but it is true it does not apply of course to the men who really represent their constituents and who are making so fine a fight for the conservation of selfgovernment as soon as these men have won their battle and consolidated their victory confidence in congress will return but in the meantime the people of the united states believe that as a whole the senate and the house no longer represent the voters by whom they were elected but the special interests by whom they are controlled they believe so because they have so often seen congress reject what the people desire and do instead what the interests demand and of this there could be no better illustration than the tariff the tariff under the policy of protection was originally a means to raise the rate of wages it has been made a tool to increase the cost of living the wool schedule professing to protect the woolgrower is found to result in sacrificing grower and consumer alike to one of the most rapacious of trusts the cottoncloth schedule was increased in the face of the unqontradlcted public testimony of the manufacturers themselves that it ought to remain unchanged the steel interests by a trick secured an indefensible increase in the tariff on structural steel the sugar trust stole from the government like a petty thief yet cong ress by means of dishonest schedules continues to protect it in bleeding the public at the very time the duties on manufactured rubber were raised the leader of the senate in company with the guggenheim syndicate was organizing an international rubber trust whose charter made it also a holding company for the coal and copper deposits of the whole world every man who knows congress well knows the names of senators and members who betray the people they were elected to represent and knows also the names of the masters whom they obey a representative of the people who wears the collar of the special interests has touched bottom he can sink no further a new life is stirring among the dry bones of formal platforms and artificial issues morality has broken into politics political leaders trust bred and trust fed find it harder and harder to conceal their actual character the brassbound collar of privilege has become plain upon their necks for all men to see they are known for what they are and their time is short but when they come to be retired it will be of little use to replace an unfaithful public servant who wears the collar by another public servant with the same collar around his neck above all what we need in every office is free men representing a free people the motto in every primaryin every electionshould be this no watch dogs of the interests need apply this nation has decided to do away with government by money for profit and return to the government our forefathers died for and gave to usgovernment by men for human welfare and human progress what do you say to these staggering statements 0 ye of the protection faith now i wish to read from a newspaper report of another speecha speech made at the other end of this capitol on yesterday by senator dolliver of iowa he said in part that one of the trusts of this country whose capital ten years ago was 50 000 had increased now to 10 000 000 he resented this legislative privilege as an outrage on the public and raising his hands exclaimed"],

some final action by the force of public opinion and the insistence to some immediate conclusion by the whip of the white house have at last reached an agreement among themselves the democratic conferees from the beginning having been completely ignored in the matter hence the tarifftax bill as it is finally agreed to and doubtless as it will be written in the statute books will be a republican tax measure in whole and in part and tile republican party can not in the future escape responsibility for its enactment and its many iniquities manifold inconsistencies and unjust discriminations there is not a line in this outrageous paynealdrich tarifftax bill as embodied in the conference report that will give the promised relief to the overburdened taxpayers of the land there is not a paragraph in this iniquitous tarifftax measure that meets the long delayed expectations of the oppressed consumers of the country they demanded bread the republican leaders in congress now give themn a stone it is the old old story will the plain people of the republic never listen will the consumers never learn sir i warn the makers of the paynealdrich tarifftax bill against the dangers of further unduly imposing on the patience and the credulity and the confidence of the american people it is a fact which can not be successfully denied that the plain people of the country are greatly dissatisfiel with present conditions and with existing tarifftax laws they have been hopelessly demanding relief for years they are anxiously seeking to escape the tyranny of the selfish beneficiaries of republican protection staggering as they are under the burdens of class taxation they are greatly disappointed with the provisions of the paynealdrich tax bill the members of the house are now hearing from their constituents in no uncertain tones the paynealdrich bill is the merest pretense the protests against it are coming in fast and furious from the corn lands of the west from the cotton fields of the south from the miners of the intermountain states from the people on the pacific slope and from the taxpayers and the consumers generally from one end of the country to the other all crying out against the iniquities of the paynealdrich tarifftax compromise bill in which nearly every schedule is written for the few selfish beneficiaries and against the general welfare of all the people for years the consumers of the country have been clamoring for a recduction of unjust taxation on the necessamies of life the republican party promised relief it was an issue in the last campaign the republicans promised to revise the dingley tariff schedules iii the interest of the consumers and the taxpayers it was to be a revision downward in order to lighten the burdens of the poor and with the view to bringing the necessaries of life within the realm of just and reasonable prices how have the promises been kept how have the peoples expectations b~en met instead of legislating for the consumers the republicans have again legislated for the special interests and have to a greater extent than ever before enthroned special privilege instead of reducing taxation and cheapening the necessaries of life they have increased the taxes and added greater burdens to the backs of the helpless and the struggling consumers it has been a tarifftax revision upward instead of downward a betrayal of the people let the facts speak for themselves the payne bill as it passed the house was a higher tarifftax measure than the present dingley law instead of lightening the burdens of the consumers on the necessaries of life it materially increased them nothing to help the consumers in the payne bill when the payne tax measure went to the senate the senate substituted for it the aldrich tax bill the highest and the most iniquitous tax measure in the history of this or any other country so far as the consumers and the plain people of the land are concerned the two bills were then sent to conference and the result of the conference is a contemptible compromise tax bill brought aboutthrough the instrumentality of the white house which gives us a tarifftax bill a little better than the aldrich bill and a great deal worse than the payne bill if this conferees tax bill is now enacted into law it will increase the tax burdens of the consumers beyond the calculations of the finite mind and enrich the few at the expense of the many to a much greater extent than the present and existing dingley law i cry out against this barefaced betrayal of the people i denounce this gross injustice to every consumer in the republic i plead for a equare deal for the plain people and hope that enough republicans will join the democrats in this house to defeat this iniquitous conference report it would be much better for the people we represent for us to stay here until next december than to allow this outrageous betrayal of the rights of the peoplethis odious compromise conference tax schemeto be enacted into law it would be much better in the long run for the people to go on paying taxes under the dingley schedules than to enact into law this conference report it will be wiser in my opinion for us to now adjourn and go home and take the whole tarifftax matter up again next december than to permit the consummation of the paynealdrich abomination sir if the paynealdrich bill becomes a law in its present shape it will burden beyond the calculation of the human intellect for years to come the struggling people of our country during the past ten years the cost of living has increased nearly 50 per cent the paynealdrich bill will increase the cost of living about 25 per cent more it taxes every necessary of life from the cradle to the grave it is a bill to foster monopoly to make a few rich men a little more prosperous it will create more trusts it will take from those least able to pay and give it to those most able to pay it robs the many for the benefit of the few and does it all under the cloak of law it is replete with legal trickery full of concealed jokers ambiguous in phraseology and nearly every schedule contains a subtle discrimination against the people incomprehensible to the ordinary mind i say again that one of the most important questions before the american people is honest tariff reform along the lines of a material reduction of the taxes on the necessaries of life in order to cheapen the cost of living and to make wealth as well as toil pay its just share of the burdens of government i am in favor of a fair a just and an equitable revenue system that will support the government wisely and economically administered with equal justice to all and favoritism to none having a jealous care for our farmers and our toilers i believe in taxing the luxuries of life and exempting the necessaries of life in so far as possible and to this end as i have said i favor a graduated income tax along lines that will obviate any constitutional objection sir i am in favor of genuine tariff reform in the interests of the consumers of the country and for the benefit of the wageearners of the land i am in favor of reducing the tariff taxes on the necessaries of life and wherever they foster trusts or shelter monopolies i would tax wealth more and toil less the people less and plutocracy more i would reduce the tariff taxes on all goods wares and merchandise manufactured in this country and sold cheaper abroad than at home i would revise the dingley tariff schedules in a business way in the interests of all the people the paynealdrich bill violates every principle of democracy it is the highest protection measure ever attempted to be written on our statute books it is a bill for protection for the sake of protection and not for the sake of revenue the paynealdrich tax bill violates the cardinal principle of jefferson equal rights to all and special privileges to none tir speaker for more than ten years the increasing cost of living mounting higher and higher each succeeding year has been the most immediate the most pressing and the most universally observed fact about economic conditions in this country during all this period while the cost of the necessaries of life has been growing more and more oppressive the promise has been held out by the republicans that when the country got around to tariff revision something would be done to remedy these conditions and what is the result the mockery of the paynealdrich tax billto make matters worse instead of better the people are tired of being humbugged they are done with republican promises they have lost confidence in the willingness of invested capital to divide up on an equitable basis with productive labor sad experience has taught them better the tremendous development of the great trusts the annual multiplication of multimillionaires the heaping up of what mr roosevelt so aptly called swollen fortunes the systematic overcapitalization of all kinds of enterprises the consolidation of management and the centralization of ownership the advancing of prices in too many cases out of all reason of the necessaries of lifeall these things have caused a widespread distrust of the longheralded philanthropic spirit of the greedy beneficiaries of protection now sir i reiterate that i am opposed to these unjust discriminations they must cease wealth as well as brawn must be taxed and pay its just share of the burdens of the government i am in favor of true reform in tariff taxationa revision that will do substantial justice to all interests concerned and not rob the many for the benefit of the few and saddle all the burdens of government on the poor mans back the selfish ness of the beneficiaries of the protected industries of the country who have waxed fat during the past quarter of a century through the unjust discriminations of republican tariff policies was never better illustrated than in the paynealdrich tax bill reading the bill in the light of these unjust exactions one is forcibly reminded of goldsmiths line laws grind the poor and rich men rule the law"], [0.018200039863586426,

tariffprotected trusts shall rule the country and today i am more thoroughly convinced that my contention is correct as has been verified by the recent wonderful democratic victories in missouri massachusetts and new york all of which were won on this issue only yesterday we received such happy news from ohio as to make many believe that halleys comet had struck the republican party in that section sir you may talk about railroad bills commerce courts and other like measures but the real issue is whether tariff taxation should be levied for revenue only or for the creation of millionaires and trusts it is free trade with the world for our congested commerceprotection or antiprotection upon this we won victories in the days of tilden thurman carlisle mills and that great man from indiana daniel w voorhees when we appealed to the country on the question as to whether the government had the right to permit one man to rob another we won victories but when we left this and began to kneel at the altars of strange gods we were shipwrecked upon this issue and this alone we are going to the country in november and drive out the money changers some days ago i introduced house bill no 24264 providing for the removal of the tax on cotton and woolen goods gloves hosiery readymade clothing certain food products and other necessaries like other measures of this kind it is dying in the ways and means committee but few bills were ever presented to this body more deeply affecting the public welfare it contains a message of gladness for every home and if enacted into law it would give comfort and food and raiment to millions who are now half clad and hungry why should it not become a law is there any plausible reason why it should not does not every merciful consideration for the poor and hard pressed in every quarter demand it have we not seen the cost of necessaries rise so high that to live means a struggle for existence to many this tax is unnecessary for revenue purposes in 1909 85 000 000 of raw silk and diamonds were imported free of duty and if the rate levied on many articles in this bill was placed upon these luxuries quite as much revenue would be realized then why not transfer it from the clothes and food of the masses to the sparkling diamonds and rustling silks of the rich for another reason this tax could be dispensed with and that is economy in the public expenditures you have doubled the expense of running this government since you came into power in 1897 not only have you nearly trebled the war and navy expenses but the present budget carries an appropriation of 155 000 000 for pensions and that too in the face of the fact that it has been fifty years since we have had a war of any consequence the republican party has fully mastered the art of tariff taxation alexander hamilton said protection to be available must be got out of the belly and back of the great mass of the american people the present advocates of this policy appreciate this principle more thoroughly than did hamilton for it is illustrated to perfection in the schedules of both the dingley and paynealdrich laws if there is any part of the human anatomy left untaxed it is yet to be discovered the common citizen is branded by it from his head to his heels inside and outside in sickness and in health in life and after death his winding sheet his tomb and the chisel by which thereon is inscribed a simple tribute to his memory all bear the stamp of the tariff and i dare say that if it were possible to exploit the next world the tariff robber would lay tribute upon the keys of st peter by which the honest soul is admitted to that place void of plunderers many are taught to believe that the tax on the luxuries was made much less than on the necessaries to make living cheaper for the rich but this is not the true theory they care nothing for this tax even though it were twice the present rate what does the millionaire care for the difference in the price of a diamond or an automobile no the true reason for increasing the tax as you approach the necessaries for the american home is just as hamilton said for the purpose of making the system more available to swell the fortune of the plunderers more rapidly a thousand per cent on wines jewelry automobiles rosewood and other like products would scarcely produce amillionaire in a century for the reason that only the rich could afford such luxuries but sir when you lay the hand of taxation upon the stomach and back of the people the cash must and will come and no one knows this fact better than those who wrote the schedules of the tariff law as long as the sun shines and the wind blows the poor must eat and be clothed the tax on luxuries exacts tribute from the rich only but on necessaries it reaches every man woman and child in america let me here read you the tax on a few articles indispensable to life in every home cotton cloth per yard 8 cents and 30 per cent provided no such cloth shall pay less than 50 per cent cotton clothing and wearing apparel 50 per cent stockings 1 per dozen 70 cents per dozen stockings 1 to 1 50 per dozen 85 cents per dozen blankets 33 cents per pound and 40 per cent lannels 7 to 8 cents per square yard and from 50 to 55 per cent readymade clothing wool 44 cents per pound and 60 per cent shawls wool 44 cents per pound and 60 per cent knit goods wool 44 cents per pound and 60 per cent refined sugar per pound 1 91 cents butter per pound 6 cents bacon and hams per pound 4 cents feats prepared and preserved 25 per cent chickens dressed 5 cents per pound it will be remembered that in this list are to be found many items bearing both a specific and an ad valorem duty for instance on readymade clothing it is 44 cents per pound plus 60 per cent ad valorem now a suit of clothing weighing 6 pounds and worth 10 in a foreign market is taxed 2 64 plus 6 or 8 64 now it is a wellknown fact that the tax levied on these articles is unnecessary for revenue purposes and was never so intended those who enacted it well knew at the time that such products are not imported in any considerable quantities and hence do not produce revenue it was intended for the direct purpose of enabling the trusts and manufacturers of these articles to add it to the cost of production as additional profit and this they have done beyond a doubt let me here call the attention of the house to the enormity of the outrage being perpetrated upon the public we annually manufacture cotton goods to the value of about 490 000 000 in the fiscal year ending june 30 1909 we exported cotton goods to the amount of 34 414 860 leaving for home consumption 455 585 140 under the tax levied in the foregoing schedules the consumer is compelled to pay annually on this amount more than 200 000 000 to the cotton manufacturers and too this estimate isbased upon the lowest rate mentioned it is estimated that our production of manufactured woolen goods in 1909 amounted to 450 000 000 of this amount we exported 2 123 165 worth leaving for home consumption 447 877 835 on which this outrageous tax was likewise charged by the trusts and manufacturers compelling the american consumers annually to pay them tribute to the amount of more than 250 000 000 as i will show you later the entire rate of the woolen schedule is manipulated by the wool trust that controls 60 per cent of our manufacturing industries of this class it has absorbed 27 independent woolen mills and has been in existence since 1899 the only proof necessary to show that every cent of this tax is added and collected by this heartless trust is to ask in any market the price of a decent suit a blanket or any other product composed in whole or in part of wool but it is contended that all of the high tax rate thus levied is not added to the domestic price of the product if not why not who can prevent it if the trust did not intend to levy all of this tax why did its representatives spend their time money and brains beseeching the ways and means committee during the long tariff session of congress to increase these duties if the rate is not to be added to the price of the home product why would not 20 per cent do as well as 150 per cent is it not conceded that the difference in the cost of production here and abroad is a mere trifle as to many articles named in both the cotton and woolen schedules it is to be hoped that no one will be so silly as to believe that humanity has reached that high plane of honesty where selfinterest is willingly sacrificed for public good or to believe that the trust organized for the avowed purpose of graft will not extract the last shilling from its victim"], [0.020920157432556152, 0.9790798425674438, 1,

purposes too numerous to mention of which the american people can never hope to know or understand this bill contains some 4 000 items on which the duties are arranged it contains a bond issue of fifty million outright and an authorization for two hundred and fifty million more of treasury certificates which is worse for it is larger in amount it provides for an inheritance tax which will collide with the local laws of more than threefourths of the states 36 states having laws in operation on the subject hence a duplicate tax it is a taxing of the dead who are but moderately well off

than without the close scrutiny of an expert can be ascertained it contains a maximum and minimum rate provision that is a delegation of power conferred by the constitution of this nation on congress alone it is a dangerous provision and will doubtless involve us in a trade war that will be otherwise than beneficial to this nation and last but not least it is a raising of the dingley rates when we

frankness it mystifies and makes difficult of understanding through its countervailing and compounding of duties that which could be made plain of understanding at will by its framers it is a strictly partisan measure where the democratic members were not even permitted to sit in their presence while the bill was being drawn it is an abandonment of statesmanship and the exaltation and summit of partisanship it is an instance where the people were promised bread and are asked now to accept a stone it is more than they should bear it is more than this republican majority should inflict i believe it is safe and saie to predict it is more than they will endure and this is said having due deference to the soothsayer and the false prophet and the attendant admonition that attends them so

platform on the stump in his campaign literature or elsewhere he even admitted much less promised the people a higher rate of tariff than the dingley law affords is there anyone here that openly confessed in platform in literature or speech that they did not intend to reduce the rates perceptibly i feel sure there is not but on the other hand is it not eminently and even notoriously true that

plunders drive away and eliminate the mysticism attendant upon this measure by reason of those countervailingduty clauses and the gliding and shifting of rates incident thereto it was unfair to the government under the dingley bill for it has yielded no revenue in the past it is unfair to the producer for it is admitted that the present duty amounts to from 150 to 250 per cent protection and the revenue it has afforded this nation shows it to be absolutely prohibitive as it was unwise then so it is unwise now this enormous percentage of protection only enables the oil producer of my state to receive 38 cents a barrel for the crude petroleum as it flows from the well a price inhuman on its very face as is patent to all this is tariff without profit to the government tariff without advantage to the producer tariff that ravishes the consumer lo it is tariff with a vengeance one that can hardly be fathomed or understood we can but conclude that it is but a fattener for the trusts

how do you expect the cattle grower on highpriced land to compete with the grower of hides on cheap and undesirable lands why take from everybody and give to somebody and after the taking from everybody is all exhausted then what will the losing corporations do as the time approaches when there will be naught with which to plunder and make unto his own if a manufacturer can not make moneythis being their contention and for arguments sake alone we will grant itwhy come to congress and ask that he be given money why should he more than the artisan or the laborer ask that something be taken from all of us to give any particular one of us there is but two ways to get a thing it must be either by an individual effort earned or by an individual effort taken and the republican party in further protecting these swollen fortunes seems to share most of the theory of taking retrace your steps republican members of the ways and means committee and bring in a committee amendment putting boots and shoes on the free list if you can not pass it in committee you of the committee on rules of which the speaker of this house is supreme can and of right ought to bring in a rule that will let us vote in committee of the whole house as to whether boots and shoes shall be on the free list along with hides then if this be done and lost by will of a majority of this house the american people may know who to look to in the future for friendship and who to look to as their enemy they will at least know how they voted and may draw their own conclusions i hope the committee and the republican side of this house may not longer hide under the shelter of a rule that but blinds the eyes of the voters as to the votes and activities of their representatives come out like men and if the majority wants boots and shoes on the free list let the ameriean people have them if they do not want them free it is not too much to know a vote is not too much to ask purge this republican management in this house of what seems to me to be unfairness and a skulking and shirking disposition of common duty let the senators of the united states again if they will renew the distaste of the american people for their activities for the trusts and their inactivities for the rights and interests of the people let us ever and constantly hope that the american people may be able to condone their frailties of the past by their future activities in the peoples behalf retrace your steps republican members of the ways and means committee and move to strike out the inheritancetax provision and insert in lieu thereof an income tax to the end that we may seize upon the swollen fortunes of the living rather than upon those of the dead shake from your party counsels the ever haste and desire to invade the rights of states shake from your party edicts a law that will admittedly collide and run amuck with more than threefourths of the states yea tax the living thrice rather than the dead once one is able to protest the other not it is a new venture for this government it is purely within the province of the states and as i believe quite if not entirely outside of the federal it differs widely from the income tax both from a legal aspect and from a moral aspect as well it is not a tax within the purview or contemplation of our fathers who drew the constitution and i might and do gladly say of them that they wrote wiser than they knew i know and the nation knows that republican exigencies are often great we have witnessed it before but this is a more striking example of what republican extravagance purchased prosperity false theory and wild abandonment of economy will lead to i had hoped however that it would not require a bond issue an inheritance tax and a stamp act all within less than a month from the retirement of that once very much soughtafter president the like of whom historians have not written the half of whom has never yet been told the repetition of whom we hope we will never hear retrace and retrench on this abandonment of the constitution this invasion of states rights this extravagance without parallel even in time of war this unusual and unprecedented action and return to that sweetvoiced bird economy the sweetest note that seraph ever sung economy in this day and age will soon be a soothing ill for all ailments it will tower above other issues like the historic washington monument towers above the marshes of the sea lo it is today as grave a necessity as the preservation of our honor as a nation and the preservation of the liberty of our citizens that comprise it the drawback provision in the payne billif i properly understand it and i have tried faithfully to do sois by far the most farreaching and misleading clause in the bill it is the most direful in the effect upon the interests of the people i represent i feel quite sure this clause permits the american manufacturer to go into the markets of the world and purchase where he can purchase best and cheapest the raw materials of the world this clause then lets him import them paying but temporarily the duty prescribed by the act it then permits that after they are used and these or other goods which he may manufacture are sold in whole or in part abroad he may then return to the customhouse keeper and secure the return of his every duty so paid what is this but the stripping of the american producer of every vestige of protection this measure on its face purports to give and afford its effect can not be otherwise however much its friends may claim for it retrace your steps republican members of the ways and means committee and strike that clause from the bill while it is true the protection your bill on its face gives to the producer is more of an idle recital than of value to him still it is your duty not to tamper or strip him of that which you tell him is of value to him as long as the protective theory prevails and obtains it is a remarkable provision and its effect must be even more marvelous than the provision itself let us look at it study it worry over it and marvel at it together both democrats and republicans this provision is of no avail to the producer or the consumer at any time but is of infinite advantage to the factory all the time it denudes and strips the producer of whatsoever protection the bill makes recitals of and leaves him unattended and alone throughout spring fall winter and summer save at election time when the recitals in the bill of so much per bushel for wheat and so much per bushel for corn are very noticeably called to his attention the farmer not knowing of the existence of such a clause that daily strips and divests him of whatever the effect of the recitals would have been believes trusts and votes for you at election time while you chuckle in your glee at the deception you inflict you of the republican faith why not once more return to the style of abe lincoln and be honest and frank why not let this frankness at least prevail and be extended to the american producer why speak in parables to him why abuse his confidence with fiction and enshroud his hopes aspirations ambitions and desires in a cloud of mystery which he can neither fathom nor unfold it is the american producer who does more and gets less than any person in all this thinking busy throbbing world he pays more for laws and derives less benefit and needs laws less than any other class it is the american producer and toiler who defends this country and its welfare when danger clouds threaten or peril is near by frank legislation we cement their hearts to the nation by mysterious legislation we legislate them away retrace your steps rise in your seats and move to strike out that drawback clause to the end that the producer may at least have the protection the face of your bill purports retrace your steps and ignore the cunning and vice of the american manufacturers who through greed avarice and conscienceless activity in giving testimony have brought about this bill i again repeat the trusts are willing and ready to adopt a theory the effect of which is where they can not make they will take their pages of testimony is asking that the taking be made legal the ways and means committee has framed a bill that indulges in the latter more than it encourages the former come like men unmasked from behind a rule of this house that clouds in mystery your actions and your innermost and best theories and beliefs and let the american people know for what you stand and what you in fact accomplish by such a bill vote yes or no on each provision do not hurdle the bad with what little good there may be and make the nation and this congress swallow it whole i do not i can not for the life of me understand this weird theory of protection as advanced by the payne bill in theory and in fact it is a proposal on the part of american manufacturers to have this government pay them for going into unprofitable business if it is wise and judicious to pay men for going into unprofitable business why would there not be more wisdom and more sound sense in paying men to go into business that would be profit yielding i submit i can not understand the logic they seem less fortified from every aspect that i can view the equity of thdir demand i merely mention it that the american people may know of it and be amazed at it together we must for arguments sake at least proceed on the theory after reading their testimony that without the protection afforded by this bill the manufacturers of the country can not longer prosper or survive this is their contention and this is their sworn testimony this is the burden of their song on this there is no dispute an unprotfiable business may in the eye of the protectionists be as good for a community and for a nation as one that is profit yielding but surely it is not better nor excels in virtues if you can offer logic for one then why not the other the doctrine of protection i had heartily assumed would never reach such proportions that it would be better for the people of a country to engage in a losing business than to embark in a profitable one but this bill overthrows my ardent hopes in that direction for as we shall observe all of the industries when legislation is nigh are running at a loss and none of them profit yielding the steel trust the standard oil trust the leather trust and the lumber trust are some of the losing industries which appear prominently in the hearings i do not believe the gentleman from new york hardened patriot and statesman though he be could subscribe to such logic and such thought not even the gentleman from michigan who was characterized by mr clark as the greatest protectionist of the age or the gentleman from washington whose humor and wit edifies and elevates us all could stamp their full approval on such logic as their theory advances if it be advisable to pay men to manufacture which according to the advocates of this bill must otherwise be at a loss why could we not with the same logic pay the merchant the artisan the farmer or the laborer for his daily toils when they were insufficient to maintain him in luxury and splendor and if it be proper to pay one line of business for entering into and conducting its business why not with the same propriety pay all until the platter was bare and then issue bonds and borrow money as this bill provides this must be done to the end that we may again take on a prosperous hue and fully maintain republican prosperity now we can readily lay hands on the whole theory of protection we can well see its innermost vitals and its unhealthy effects for if some industries must be encouraged protected and subsidizedthat is to say the losing onethen there must be others that must be run on a paying basis from whose earnings the subsidies taxes and tariffs must be paid to the one that is running the losing business money must come from some source money must be had from somewhere or some place before it can be paid out and dispensed to anybody for as we shall all see if all of the witnesses before the ways and means committee were engaged in losing businesses as they testified before the committee they would all soon be bankrupt and none could protect or be protected this being true it is apparent that the profitable must bear the burdens of the unprofitable this is so apparent that it seems almost selfevident unnecessary of enlargement or explanation we may all feel thankful and all rejoice together that there is one industry in the land today that needs no subsidies that needs no tariff that needs nothing but brains and brawn to maintain itself it is the industry arising from our fertile soil the business of agriculture here then must be one of the industries that must divide that which it hath with he who hath not this is protecting the farmers interest as the thief in the night protects the stable protects the farmer as the unfaithful shepherd protects his masters flocks the protectionists of course will hardly subscribe to this argument for believing as they do that protection is a beneficent mantle so broad and so expansive that it covers everywhere and everybodythat is to say we may all help ourselves to each others property and distribute it under this bill and nobody pays the bill it is an instance of dealing in wild generosity before practicing the elementary principles of common justice it is the rifling of the pockets of the many to the advantage and enrichment of the few it is the heaping of swollen fortunes the divesting from the many to dump into the lap of the few who are made beneficiaries under this bill this theory of theirs is alluring and seductive but as faulty and defective as it is alluring and entreating tariff and its protecting wings do not come like bounteous showers of springtime but they must of necessity and of reason come out of somebody and from somebodys pocketbook they must we fear in truth and in fact come from the threadbare pockets of the needy who toil and slaveyea from he who denies himself and his family the comforts that their industry and energy would otherwise richly warrant and entitle if such a theory be pursued to the end we must again agree that those of us that are prosperous in business from energy and thrift must divide with that business which is not prosperous and this can but cast an untimely blight upon industry and vigilance thrift and prosperity that is the flower and growth and the grandeur of this american republic it would be but to penalize industry and success that inefficiency and failure might be rewarded its practical operation can not be otherwise its effects are more farreaching than we know if protection were as equally distributed as the republican theory contends then no additional relief would be afforded to anyone and hence no purpose accomplished no one would be benefited no one would be injured and there would be no protectionist who would show his head on either side of this house or in this country and the scheme would be a bubble not long to maintain its prismlike colors and grandeur it is quite true in the very nature of things that only some articles are susceptible of being imported for reasons that are quite apparent to us all hence a statute may recite protection for a commodity without avail agricultural products are in truth and in fact imported into this country scarcely at all hence the placing of a tariff wall around them does not send their price upward or downward but it remains the same the farmer gets nominal protection in the statute books but none whatever at the customhouse or granary it is a recital without an advantage a hope that never comes true the very nature and character of the things produced by the farmer makes it impossible for him to receive benefits under protection while he must from the laws and the schedules contained in this bill bestow bountifully protection upon another we of the democratic faith believe that the good things of the nation should be equally divided among those who produce them we believe the corner stone of this nation rests on the theory that no law should be passed by the federal congress that makes the task more difficult for one and beneficial for the other we believe that zeal energy and industry should be the test we can not subscribe to the theory of legislating away from the masses into the hands of the few to the end that they in turn may issue prosperity to us as they desire there is no issue present between the two parties as to prosperity and antiprosperity as the eloquent gentleman from washington would have us believe for on that theory and on that issue there can be no difference between americans nay not even between human beings all men enjoy crave and seek prosperity this is true of white and black educated and uneducated civilized and uncivilized no heated partisanship can arouse a difference on that issue the difference is in the various methods and theories of accomplishment the republican party will have prosperity if they have to borrow money to have it as before said even if they have to take it what have we in this bill but a glaring exhibition of the very thing just named both taking it and borrowing it in describing the different theories as to what real prosperity is it has often been defined by democrats but is well worthy of repetition it does not mean as some republican gentlemen of this congress seem to think high prices for worthless securities a few millionaires enriched by successful speculation nor does it mean the erection of a few places without any improvement in the dwellings of the poor nor does it mean an increase in the number of private equipages additional pomp in public ceremonials or new splendor in private display no sir because all these are possible and indeed frequent where the masses are sunk in abject misery poverty and want the sound democratic conception of prosperity is framed on an entirely different idea prosperity as democrats understand it is an abundance of commodities fairly distributed among those who produce them it means improved cottages housing and sheltering healthier and happier people it means better clothing and better shoes covering sturdier limbs it means more schools with wider instruction imparted to them it means more parks and libraries and museums with more intelligent people using and enjoying them it means every resource of civilization brought into greater abundance within reach of those who create the wealth of a country republicans in their protective theory believe that prosperity may be legislated we as democrats believe in order that it be lasting and of avail that it must be created by effort in some form you of republican faith believe it is right to tax the masses for the protection enrichment and benefit of the few to the end that they may distribute prosperity among us as to them of right appear we believe in collecting revenue for the expenses of the government in strict conformity with the constitution and that the success that attends each life each factory each corporation should rise or fall with the perfection and excellency of the product produced to the success attained the democratic theory often used and i might say often worthy of repetition that equal rights to all and special privileges to none should be and is the watchword of all free government yours as is shown by the inequalities of this bill is that of another hue that of another type the doctrine of equal rights old as it is grows with beauty luster and grandeur as the years speed by build your nations hopes upon it pin your faith to it it is thrice everlasting it is thrice evergreen it is broad enough grand enough and comprehensive enough for us all let us subscribe to it"], [0.02188950777053833, 0.9781104922294617, 1, "why that was my contention as a democratic conferee and i came back to this house and made the same contention when the department of commerce and labor was organized and the attorneygeneral does me the honor to quote from my speech in opposition to the measure it will hardly be denied that any tariff bill ever before ally congress of the past history of this government has met with the same distrust suspicion and want of confidence by the public in the sincerity and honesty of those charged with snaking this bill that this bill has met with the public mind became imbued at the outset with the suspicion that the tariff would not be reduced according to the letter and spirit of the promise made by the republican party then what is the real attitude of the republican party before the country at tilis time the party stands discreditedas a party they give us a bill that authorizes the issuaimce of 250 000 000 of certificates of indebtedness if the occasion arises to meet and defray necessary expenses of the government it winds up its last fiscal years business with having used nearly one hundred lillions more money during that fiscal year than the governileut collected statistics give us this significant information to enable us better to understand the present attitude of the republican party the extravagance of the republican party is simply appalling with what wonderful strides this unbridled spirit of reckless extravagance is growing we find that the yearly expenditure of the federal government for tie past eight years has reached the sum of 555 000 000 each year we are assured now that the bill will come out of conference entirely acceptable to the president the greeks bearing gifts encounter discouraging doubts i have never taken any part in the opinion that the president would veto the paynealdrich bill the people i admit look to the president for relief and the fulfillment of party pledges more than to the republican leaders composing the conference but the real question is can he single handed and alone cope with the astute men who have so long managed these matters the distinguished tariff manipulators of the senate and the house have carried this bill too far to turn back i read most cheerfully for the benefit of the republicans and some few democrats how the truth of prophecy uttered in the last denver democratic platform has sized up the situation as it is today we welcome the belated promise of tariff reform now offered by the republican party as a tardy recognition of the righteousness of the democratic position on this question but the people can not safely intrust the execution of this important work to a party which is so deeply obligated to the highly protected interests as is the republican party has not the republican party by its acts and declarations more than justified this warning given in our democratic platform the paynealdrich bill is in the nature of a decree pro confesso at the bar of the public that the bill is cunningly drawn in the interest of the manufacturer and against the consumer in nearly every instance an additional tax is placed on the articles used by that great class of american citizens who are neither rich nor poor but who constitute an overwhelming majority of the voters of this country and let the wealthy escape the bill is a reckless defiance of public opinion during this tariff tinkering by the republican party since the 15th day of march we find the leading lights of the republican party unblushingly and brazenly denying that their platform or their public speakers ever promised to revise the tariff downward in their blind infatuation under the hypnotic influence of nlawful combines and syndicates they would have us believe that the demand of the people was to urge the taking of more money out of their pockets to aid the trusts can the people longer trust so important a work to such a party have not the people from all sections of the country asserted and publisheddemocrats and republicans business men in allthe walks of lifea lack of confidence almost universal distrust in having an honest revision of the tariff it is a spectacle to behold how words are juggled how classifications are confounded how by a hocuspocus now you see it and now you dont articles in the lowest class of duties are transferred to the highest dutiable list in the twinkling of an eye the people demanded that the duties of the dingley law be reduced yet we are advised that under the aldrich bill 75 per cent of our dutiable imports will continue to come in under the dingley bill15 per cent raised higher and 10 per cent lowered the entire body of the people of the country well understood that this extraordinary session was called for a twofold purpose it was called to reduce tariff taxation and at the same time to raise revenues enough to run the government the very general desire and indorsement of the call upon congress to revise the tariff downward came frqm the masses of the people who believe that congress should do something to reduce the cost of living through lower duties on the essentials of decency and comfort the people demanded at least to live they were will ing to let the protected interests live but not at the pains of suffering continued extortions what has the republican party done in response to unmistakable demands it has started out above all things to preserve the principle of protection the affair of the average cost of living being the vaguest incident of their endeavor the republican party of both houses and with the carefully weighed counsel of president and cabinet have failed utterly to accomplish the two great purposes of the extraordinary session that it has failed to provide revision downward the whole country well knows that it has failed to provide sufficient revenues or any reasonable hope of sufficient revenues is borne in the very face not only of the payne bill but of the aldrichized payne bill and that too notwithstanding assurances of retrenchment in every one of the executive departments but after all the extra session has disclosed one service to the country by the present republican management for which we should be profoundly grateful it has exposed the irredeemable fallacy of the whole system of protection what else could have been expected here we came to be confronted with a deficit and a demand for reduction of taxation these difficulties were to be met by the enactment of another tariff law in whose construction the protective principle must be carefully preserved it was impossible it was absurd xliv280 we came here to revise the dingley rates downward not to make payne rates or aldrich rates and then revise them downward toward the dingley rates and i say they have given us at last and at least something for which the whole country and democrats especially should be deeply thankful they have showed the protective system for protections sake is not right that it never was right that it never can be right that repetitions of it are only degrees of what is bad and these repetitions of badness have been progressive wickedness from the morrill tariff to this aldrichized payne tariff the worst of them all i do not hesitate to say that there is one feature of the payne bill as it passed the house that has attracted favorable attention recognizing that some answer had to be made to the universal demand of the country for reduced rates the payne bill in a very modified form proceeded to mhake the reduction along lines of least resistance free raw material was accepted as the best policy for leveling tariff duties coal and iron ore petroleum and hides were put on the free list and lumber reduced 100 per cent the aldrich bill has turned down all those reductions and that policy the country is watching this tariff legislation with the keenest interest the republican policy of protection for protections sake which the party has wantonly upheld for years past against the interest of the masses of the people and emphasized in every line of the paynealdrich bill is facing a battle before the american people that it never fought before broadminded eminent and distinguished republicans have warned their party that the paynealdrich bill with its increased duties means defeat before the people it must be something in the nature of humiliation to us as democrats when the republicans consider the wrong and injustice they perpetrate on the people and then calmly scan democracy and say what are you going to do about it the democratic party is the only party that the people can turn to for relief we are forming today the lines for the greatest strugglethe capture of the house of representatives elected next year followed by the election of a democratic president in 1912 the paynealdrich bill makes the issue for us the democracy never had such an opportunity to win as this legislation gives us other issues during the existence of our historic party for more than a century and a quarter have been successfully maintained before the people but the question of the tariff as upheld and enforced by the republican party since the close of the civil war culminating in the presentation to the country of the paynealdrich bill now more than any other issue appeals to and arouses the lifeblood the dormant energies and the ancient invincible courage of the national democracy the real question that the american people will pass on is shall the fruits of the toil and labor of one man longer be taken from him under the form of law to build up and help some one else in the race of life we are not unmindful of the obligations of every citizen to contribute his just portion for the expense of the government no one doubts but the tariff as presented in the paynealdrich bill will be the real and ought to be the only issue in the campaign to elect the sixtysecond congress and a democratic president in 1912 i congratulate democracy that denocratic national platforms are not made by the speeches in congress but a national platform is made by the delegates chosen by democrats to attend national conventions and embody denocratic truths and principles in the platform that is tile only standard by which democrats are to be governed i may be mistaken my opinion is this tariff discussion has presented to the american people the wrongs and oppression of the doctrine of protection of this generation and time as they never saw it before the original theory of protection to give such aid to our home industries and home interests as would enable them to grow and wax strong enough to compete with foreign imports as upheld by henry clay has been entirely discarded under the immunities and favors granted by our tariff statutes we are building up a dangerous class of citizens who are getting into their hands the controlling wealth of the country no man needs to be told that this is a dangerous menace to the independent life and spirit of the citizen and means the sure decay of the vital principles of our free institutions it seems to me that anyone ought to know and see that the overshadowing problem of today is to find some way to properly check and correct the unequal distribution of wealth among our people the chief remedy is a wise prudent gradual and conservative reduction of tile tariff rates to a revenue basis and let the policy be that practically every dutiable article except some few of the prime necessaries of life should be made to yield some revenue to aid in defraying the expenses 4465of the government which ought to be conducted on an honest and economical basis this would eventually destroy monopolies it is worse than idle for democrats to contend that we can successfully assail the vicious and unjust theory of protection for protections sake when by our votes we have under the coercion of local or home industries and interests aided the republicans in a political tariff policy that the democratic party has earnestly condemned throughout its honored history the democratic party must have the confidence of the country to win the great political battle to be fought for equality and justice for the people in 1912 unfaltering allegiance to the great mission of our party the greatest good to the greatest number will be the voice of the national democracy in that great struggle the people of this country are tired of the rule of the republican party they would gladly welcome a change but it must be a real change from existing conditions a change that will rectify the cruel discriminations made by the republican tariff under the cover of law an unjust and unrighteous share of the earnings of the people to enrich the special and favored interests this is the real issue some despondent men tell me that the democratic party is in a hopeless state of disorganization some thoughtless people say the country has no confidence in our party i do not believe it it needs but an emphatic ringing declaration of its

chairnmn my friend and colleague from the fourth north carolina district maks a speech on this floor which purports to be a reply to some remarks made by m a mr hurilreys speech was held for revision until june 18 xlv519 on may 14 1910 i pointed out at that time the progress and prosperity of our whole country in general and of north carolina in particular i showed that never before in our history has every class of our citizenship and every section of our country as a whole been more prosperous in every way than at the present time i further showed how in my opinion these wholesome and progressive conditions were either caused or fostered and at least supplemented by the beneficent influences of a protective tariff and the other great progressive and constructive policies of the republican party i also contrasted the conditions of the country under democratic policies and under republican policies i read from official documents and from reports of duns commercial agency and other reliable authorities to support my statements indeed i gave briefly some of the potent and pregnant facts seen and known to all men that have existed and now exist which facts have caused me to feel it my duty to no longer affiliate with the democratic party in which i was born but to lend my allegiance to and my efforts in advancing the principles of the republican party my feeble effort was an appeal to reason and to the highest and broadest patriotism now what kind of answer does mr pou my colleague from the fourth north carolina district make does he take up the facts and conditions presented by me and my arguments based on the same and attempt to show that i was incorrect or that i made an unjust application of any fact or condition no not in a single instance why because he can not what he does is to avoid the issue and resorts to the old democratic method of appealing to passion and to prejudices his appeal is for the south to remain solid it is clear that this speech was prepared and delivered strictly and solely for campaign purposes but even as an appeal to the voters from the hustings i am constrained to say that it is not on a high plane it is appeals like this on the part of certain politicians in the south and the waving of the bloody shirt by similar men in the north that have been used to keep a solid south and a solid north my colleague in his desperation to call attention from the facts and arguments which would appeal to and convince the voters which i tried to present attempted to revive sectional feeling and the ghost of negro domination in the south his speech i am constrained to say is a typical democratic speech but it is i am glad to say ten years behind time ten years ago just such a speech by him and others over the whole south and similar speeches waving the bloody shirts in the north would have been sufficient to cause the voters of both sections to be blinded by prejudice and to line up on sectional grounds but that day has passed forever fortunately the condition of the wageearner the farmer and all wealth producers and every class of citizens has so improved in home comforts and educational advantages supplemented by the extension and beneficial influences of free rural delivery that today the average citizen in what was formerly called the backwoods is well informed as to facts and draws his own conclusions he reads and hears both sides in a campaign forms his own convictions walks to the ballot box on election day and casts his vote as a free emancipated american citizen this brief statement is a sufficient general answer to mr pous speech because i feel sure that every thoughtful and wellinformed voter who may take the time to read what he says will concur in the view that i have just expressed there are however a few statements made by him to which i will reply in order to set forth at this time the facts which every voter is entitled to know 1 he read from the last republican platform reciting the great achievements of the roosevelt administration and then attempts to ridicule the present administration and the present congress in its efforts to amend some of the laws enacted under the roosevelt administration and to pass other remedial legislation he asks if the railroad bill passed tinder the roosevelt administration was perfect why was it that this congress was passing a law that would still further strengthen the same he further says that if roosevelts administration enforced the antitrust law against all the criminal trusts why is it necessary for this administration to be strengthening the antitrust law and to be starting new prosecutions against some of the same trusts my answer to mr pou is that if the republican party was a bourbon party that never forgot anything and never learned anything and that if it were a party long on promises and short on performances that if it were a party of inaction and negation that mr pou would not have cause to make such a complaint but the republican party is not a bourbon party it does inot live in a dead past nor thrive on calamity ryhe republican party while justly proud of its past record yet lives in the present and ever stand facing the duties and responsibilities of today and of the future a party fit to control the destinies of such a great people must be a progressive party that will ever stand on guard with both the wisdom and the courage to meet every new or changed condition incident to the growth and progress of the development of so great a nation with so many diversified interests and complicated problems the last republican national platform while reciting with just pride the marked achievements of the roosevelt administration recognized the fact that there was still other work to be done recognized that some of the laws already passed would need to be strengthened and that additional laws would be needed to meet new and changing conditions therefore the republican party in its last national convention pledged itself to the enactment of much additional legislation the people at the polls approved the record and achievements of the roosevelt administration and also recommissioned the republican party under the leadership of president taft to carry forward its great constructive programme th19 recoan of achievements we are now in the closing hours of only the first year of the fouryear term of this administration and let us see how far and how well its pledges to the people have been redeemed the record of achievements at this present session alone to say nothing of the last extra session of congress are indeed remarkable and may be briefly summarized as follows a the most important law enacted at this session was the amendment to the interstate commerce law affecting common carriers that act created a commerce court to adjudicate differences between the valilroads and shippers compelled railroads to secure the assent of the interstate commerce commission to proposed increases in freight rates granted the commission enlarged authority over classifications and regulations authorized the commission to institute proceedings against railroads without waiting for complaints by shippers brought telephone and telegraph companies under the commissiofi and in a number of ways increased the control of the federal government over the railroads looking to the future was a provision in that act providing for investigation of capitalization of railroads so as to give information upon which possible legislation can be based to prevent the watering of stocks of common carriers b the second most important new law was the creation of the postal savingsbank system in this country copying the systems in vogue in some foreign countries the aim of which is to encourage savings of small sums by the people and intrusting them to the government which in turn deposits the savings in banks for general use in trade and industry this will prove to be as great a blessing as has rural free delivery c the admission to statehood of two territories arizona and new mexico was authorized d the demand for conservation of public lands was met by authority granted the president to withdraw from public entry valuable mineral and forest lands and prevent monopolies gaining control of natural resources this is a measure to carry forward the important policy inaugurated by president roosevelt for the conservation of our great natural resources e in the same line was authorization of an issue of 20 000 000 bonds for reclamation purposes in the west this is to be followed by a plan to drain the swamp lands of the south f authority and means were given the tariff board to investigate the difference between the cost of production here and abroad looking to possible changes in the tariff on imported articles to meet altered conditions such information is necessary for future revisions of the

california further protected x a law was enacted requiring political campaign committees to publish the source of contributions to campaigns for the election of representatives in congress y in addition to the foregoing principal enactments of law there was a great amount of other work pension bills bills to authorize construction of bridges rights of way and of a semiprivate character were passed z the session also bore fruit in the partial preparation of laws which will be completed at the next session bills that passed one house and were not acted upon by the other some important measures are in this category such as the bill to establish a merchant marine the appalachian forest reserve bill and others the appalachianwhite mountain forest reserve bill will i feel sure become a law at the next session the same is true of the ship subsidy or merchant marine bill the same is true as to the antiinjunction bill this record of achievement during the first year of an administration is the most remarkable ever made by any administration in the history of our country few administrations have been able to carry into effect the majority of their promises during a whole fouryear term this administration has redeemed ninetenths of its pledges during the first year it will redeem every pledge and will also stand ready to meet every new condition president taft has more than made good and such will be the verdict of the people at the polls i submit that it is not in good taste for a democrat to attempt to misrepresent and criticise such a record for partisan purposes and that it will not prove to be good judgment for that forces a contrast with the democratic record did mr pous party when it was in power pass a single antitrust law or a single law to regulate railroad rates or to regulate any of the other great combinations of capital did it pass a single law to protect labor and to secure equity between labor and capital no on the other hand it did not enforce the republican laws which it found on the statute books in this connection why did not mr pou turn to the record of the present and past democratic administrations in north carolina and point to the state antitrust laws and the laws to regulate freight rates and to secure equity between labor and capital and the enforcement of the same he did not because he dare not the fact is that a former democratic legislature in north carolina passed an antitrust law which was conceded by everybody to be a miserable humbug and the attorneygeneral of the state did not attempt and did not dare to attempt to enforce the same the democratic party then promised to amend and strengthen this law at its next legislature and as every speaker said on the stump to put teeth in it the next legislature did amend this law and it is generally admitted to be wanting in teeth and as ineffective as the former law and the present attorneygeneral has not brought a single action under the same why did lie not point to the laws passed in our state for the protection of labor he did not and he could not for the record is blank in short the record of mr pous party in the state of north carolina on these questions has been as ineffective and incompetent as was the record of the last democratic administration on great national questions 2 mr pou in discussing the tariff said that the republican tariff law and the other republican laws were so framed as not to put money in the treasury of the united states but to tax the people and put the money taken from the people in the treasuries of the great trusts if this statement is true in any respect or even to the least extent then how much more did the democratic tariff law take money out of the pockets of the people and put it in the pockets of the trusts for everybody will admit that the people are not now under the burden of debt and mortgages and with empty pocketbooks as they were then but that the democratic mortgages have been paid off and the people now have comforts in their homes and money in the bank mr pou further indignantly denied the statement of president taft that the present tariff law is the best one the country ever had it is noticeable in this connection that mr pou did not dare to say that the wilsongorman tariff law was the best the country ever had so if this present republican law is not the best then the best is some republican law and the worst is the democratic law 3 mr pou next complains that the dollar buys less today than ever before and proceeds to denounce the republican party for this crime against society let us analyze this grievous charge which mr pou makes against the republican party which is such a crime against mankind mr pou complains that the dollar buys too little and buys less now than ever before then mr pou unquestionably wants the dollar to buy a great deal and would like to see it buy more now than ever before to illustrate he would like for 1 to buy 25 pounds of cotton at the rate of 4 cents a pound which it did under the cleveland administration and all other products in proportion the wealth producers of the country have to buy dollars with what they produce therefore when the wealth producer has to give more pounds of cotton more bushels of corn and wheat and oats more beef and pork more eggs chickens and turkeys for the dollar then he is not able to get enough dollars with his toll and his products to pay his taxes school his children support his family and hence the mortgage goes on the farm never to be lifted as long as mr pous dear dollar reigns and the wealth producer slaves mr pou wants a dear dollar and a cheap man mr pous position is the position of every gambler and money changer on the face of the earth the money changers that christ found in the temple were for a dear dollar and a cheap man when we had the dear dollar and the cheap man under the cleveland administration then we had business stagnation and hard times from one end of the country to the other 4 the next charge which mr pou makes against the republican party as being a grievous crime against humanity is the high cost of living indeed this seems to be the new democratic paramount to which they are pinning their faith in the coming campaign the democratic party has gotten in the habit of having a paramount but they have not been able to stick to the same paramount in two campaigns in 1896 their paramount was sixteen to one the people repudiated them and their paramount in the next campaign their paramount was imperialism and they attempted to frighten the people with the cry that the constitution and the declaration of independence were being trampled in the dust and that our liberties were gone the intelligent voters of the country laughed them to ridicule and buried them under an avalanche of votes at the election they at once deserted this paramount and in the next campaign it was the guarantee of bank deposits they have now deserted that as an impractical iridescent dream and are now looking for a new paramount as their sheet anchor of hope and lo and behold here it is the crime of the high cost of living chargeable to the republican party this charge is based on the same false theory that the dear dollar and the cheap man is the correct economic principle for the progress and prosperity of our people and the development and advancement of our civilization the foundation stone of the success and progress of every people and every nation depends upon a sufficient reward to those who are the wealth producers of the nation it is probably true that the wealth producers today are being more fairly compensated for what they produce than ever before in the history of the country and that necessarily makes the cost of living higher than ever before because we live on what the wealth producers create if the republican party is responsible for this crime then it glories in its achievements there are but three classes of people in our country and in the world who have or can make any just complaint against what is known as the high cost of living they are the officeholders and the salaried clerks and the money changers if the officeholder is dissatisfied with his salary the country can no doubt dispense with some of them or find a better substitute i do not mean by this that i am in favor of low salaries because i believe that every efficient public official should be honestly and justly compensated for his services and when the wealth producer is prosperous the country can afford to increase such wages where justice requires it the same is true as to the salaried clerks and already wages are being advanced from one end of the country to the other to a greater or less degree in proportion to the increased prosperity of the country as for the money changers we leave mr pou and his party to concern themselves about them 5 my colleague next complains that i should call attention to and dilate upon the prosperity of the country and claim that the policies of the republican party had any connection therewith in reply i want to ask that if the republican party and its policies deserve no credit for any of the progress and development or this country then what party deserves the credit does he claim that the democratic party is in any way responsible for it he next complains that i should allude to the hard times that the country suffered under the last democratic administration and vehemently denies that the democratic party was in any way responsible for those conditions in reply i ask if the democratic party was not responsible then who was mr pou seemed to be aggrieved because the country always is more prosperous when the republican party is in power than when the democratic party is in power i should not think that my friend would want to admit that providence and the republican party were in partnership no the fact is that the republican party stands for the great progressive and constructive american principles and ideas it is the policies of the republican party that has made this the greatest the richest the most powerful country in the world today here we have not only the greatest prosperity for each citizen but the greatest liberty and the greatest voice and power in government every poorpaid laborer in the old world today and every downtrodden human being who is hungering for a larger measure of liberty and the comforts of life has his eyes turned longingly toward the shores of america they are not only yearning to come by the thousands and tens of thousands and millions but they do come as fast as we will receive them ten times more would come if we would let down the bars it is the republican party which has created the prosperous conditions which makes them want to come but it is also the republican party which has put up the bars to keep out all who are undesirable mr pou and his party declare that these people are coming to america to be robbed by the republican protective tariff and the republican trusts and to have their liberties abridged and crushed but still they come for they are yearning for such robbery and oppression of which the republican party has been guilty in this connection it should be noted that the democratic party has never favored the republican policies of restricting immigration but has always been in favor of letting down the bars to all desirable and undesirable as i have already shown one of the achievements of this administration is a law putting up still higher the bars against undesirable immigration on the other hand are there any american citizens with their eyes fixed longingly upon any of the countries of the old world where labor is better paid and where there is ahigher standard of comfort for each individual and a higher plane of citizenship than here not a single one in short here in america today under republican policies is the very top notch of the worlds ambition and hope for prosperity for progress and for liberty in this connection mr pou complains that his party has not been in power but two years during the last fortysix years i want to say to him that if the country should make the mistake to give them another two years that then for the next fortysix years the country will continue to repent it as they have for the last fortysix 6 the gentleman next quotes an extract from the speech made by president taft at greensboro about three years ago in which the president pointed out the evil effects of the republican referee system in the south as being one of the chief causes that prevented the growth of the republican party and then mr pou asks how cana democrat even if he should believe in protection or all republican principles be able to join a party that was ruled by the class of men described by the president who are controlling the destinies of the party in the south mr pou then proceeds to say that he agrees with the president that as long as the republicani party in the south is so governed or misgoverned it is not a competent party to manage the affairs of any southern state in this connection i must remind the gentleman that while what the president said was true it was only half the truth as to the causes that prevent men in the south from voting their honest convictions the democratic politicians who are eternally painting pictures of reconstruction days and of the bitter sectional feelings and arousing the ghost of the negro question in order to hold the democratic party solid and prevent any independence of thought or action are even more responsible for this condition of political slavery in the south than the republican referees indeed this class of democratic politicians and the republican referees in the south described by president taft are political partnerstwo souls with but a single thought two hearts that beat as one the democratic politician plays his part of the game in order that he can stay in office regardless of results the republican referee does the sameplays his party in order that he too may hold officeand i trust i can be pardoned to say that neither one of them seems to think of the welfare of his state as being of any importance in comparison to this paramount purpose of the two political partners when the dark and horrible days of reconstruction were being enacted i and my people were in the democratic party and were no part or parcel of the infamous reign of crime and political darkness at that time some who are now democratic leaders were in the republican party and a part and parcel of what was being done in this connection to state all the truth i must further say that there were some democrats who are still democrats who were participants to a greater or less degree with the carpet baggers in my state the leaders in that awful rdgime have either all left the state or died or gone to the democratic party mr pou attempts to attach the name of the republican party to those days the republican party as it exists today was no more responsible for the crimes and abuses of that period than is the democratic party as today constituted the rank and file of oldline republicans are as honest and as patriotic citizens as there are in the state but the fact is that the majority of the republican voters in north carolina today are men who were born in the democratic party and who have had the manhood and the courage to leave the party of their birth because their sense of duty and the highest call of patriotism demanded it in the last campaign president taft assured the people of the south that if he was elected the old referee system would go that the political piecounter machines would be demolished and that the doors of the party would be thrown wide open to welcome every american citizen who believes that the principles of the republican party were best for himself and his country this utterance appealed to the growing independent and patriotic spirit of our people especially to the new generation that has come up since the dark days of reconstruction and was responded to by 31 000 recruits to the republican party nearly if not every one of this 31 000 had never before voted a republican ticket it is this avalanche of recruits which is growing larger each lay that has frightened mr pou and other democratic politicians in north carolina into making a last desperate effort to arouse again the feelings of prejudice and hate following the war they dare not meet us and discuss principles and issues and facts their only hope is nigger and reconstruction as shown by mr pous speech mr pou in a further effort to try to break the force of the appeal and promise of the president to the people of the south to emancipate themselves from political slavery asserts in his speech that the president has not kept his promise but declares that every single appointment which he has made in north carolina has been dictated by these same republican referees in answer to that statement i challenge him to show a single instance where the president has refused to heed the appeals of the people of any community when they have asserted themselves and protested against an unfit appointment asked for by the referees in every such case the man selected by the referees has been turned down and a man of high character has been appointed who represented the wishes of from 90 to 95 per cent of each community i point to newbern n c as a shining example and i could have pointed to the gentlemans own home town as an illustration if he and the people there had continued to demand what they first said they demanded mr lou next says that if the republican party were to carry the state the legislature would be filled up with men of the very type that the president denounced in his speech at greensboro in answer to that reckless statement i want to call attention to the fact that when the republican party carries the state as it willfor less than 31 000 more recruits will do it and they are comingthe republican party will then be controlled by the flower of the brains and manhood that has in the past been in the democratic party in short twothirds of the party when it becomes a majority party will be composed of men born and raised in the democratic party but who have had the manhood and patriotism to leave it because of its utter failure to give good government in both nation and state 7 the gentleman next complains that the south has not been treated fairly by the republican party in the matter of appointments and proceeds to show how few cabinet officers how few foreign ambassadors and ministers have been appointed from the south in reply i have to say that for once mr pou has stated the facts correctly but his political partners the republican referees are responsible for this they have not desired or have not had the political influence to secure such positions for the south that is why the president wants to get rid of the old referee system and it is why my friend mr pou does not want the republican party to get rid of it the referee system is the greatest asset that the democratic paity has in the south today and nothing can keep the democratic party together and keep mr pou and the democratic politicians in power except the continued existence of the republican referee system when the best part of the democratic party walks out of itself and into the republican party as it is doing then that condition will be changed in north carolina and we will no doubt have a cabinet officer and a number of firstclass appointments but above all of that when north carolina goes republican the offices that it will get will be the smallest consideration the state will take a new lease on life and its present prosperity will be doubled it will mean the coming of much more capital and the most desirable immigration to develop our most wonderful natural resources indeed with north carolina in the republican column it will rapidly become one of the richest and most powerful and progressive states in the union if mr pou does not know this there are enough voters in the democratic party who believe it to come and make the state republican 8 lastly mr pou paints a picture of some imaginary republican making an appeal to the south to come to the republican fold for some selfish and sordid reason and then having set up a man of straw of his own creation and to his own liking he strikes a tragic air and with an appearance of righteous indignation says 0 if there is a man living who thinks the people of the south will ever heed such an invitation as that i will tell that man here and now he does not know the people of that section he is a stranger to their traditions and ignorant of their history if in order to get the representation to which she is justly entitled the south must turn traitor to her principles she will be content to remain in that political isolation which has been forced upon her she will neither sell her honor for office nor will she be intimidated by the threat of continued isolation this pseudotragic performance instead of being tragic is actually laughable if not a subject for ridicule and pity who has offered to buy the south and who has authorized mr pou to speak for the south mr pou proceeds on the theory that the south and the democratic party are one and identical and that he speaks for the democratic party when arguments and facts are advanced to show why this policy or this principle or that is better for the south than another and the reason and the judgment and the patriotism of the voters appealed to and mr pou and his colleagues are not able to answer such facts and arguments then they are driven in desperation to such a performance as this besides mr pou fails to state what are the principles of the democratic party which he says aire not for sale the people generally are fast coming to the conclusion that it has no fixed principles it puts on a new coat of socalled principles in every campaign to try to fool and catch voters and then proceeds to desert them as soon as they fail to fool the voters no one under heaven can today tell what the democratic party stands for its paramount in the next campaign is sure to be different from what its paramount was in the last every gpvernment that is governed by parties needs a minority party and such a party should be more than a party of negation the democratic party only poorly serves the purpose of a party of opposition in fact it so poorly serves that purpose that it is in danger of going to pieces and another party being created to serve in that capacity the sum and substance of mr pous whole speech is keep the south solid keep it solid by appeals to prejudice and passion keep it solid as a party of negation and inaction keep it solid so that the politicians can ride on the backs of the voters into office i want to submit to the candid thinking and patriotic people of my state that in a republican form of government necessarily controlled by parties as ours is that the best resultsthat is the best government for all of the peoplecan be secured both in the nation and in the state by having two strong aggressive parties facing each other contending keenly for the mastery so that when one party fails of its trust even to a moderate degree that party will be immediately displaced and the other put at the helm a strong active party of opposition is absolutely essential for good government whatever shortcomings or faults the national republican party today may be guilty of are due to the fact that the national democratic party is so dead and so hopeless that it does not perform its functions as a party of opposition and so in north carolina today the democratic party has been guilty of many breaches of faith with the people within the last few years the increase of crime its failure to enforce the law its desertion of the great and fundamental principle of local selfgovernment and its general incompetency have been due largely to the fact that its leaders have felt they were secure in power and that there was no fear of democratic defeat and republican success the present democratic administration in north carolina and its predecessors would both have given far better government if the republican party in the state had been standing on guard with enough soldiers to step in and take charge at the first betrayal of trust by that party i submit that this proposition is true and that it is fundamental this being so then should not every man who is a patriot before he is a partisan in my state join hands in wiping out the twin evils which i have pointed out above and which have tended to make the state hopelessly democratic and the south hopelessly solid i submit that it is the duty of every citizen to lend his efforts to accomplish and bring about those conditions which will insure the best results from party government no matter whether that party for the time being shall be the democratic or the republican party it was this great basic truth that president taft had in mind when he appealed to the people in the south 9who believed in republican principles to align themselves with that party and make it a bold progressive party when he declared that the doors should be opened and that the referee system should no longer block the way i submit that no president ever uttered a more patriotic sentiment or made a more patriotic appeal or one with a higher sense of duty and friendship to the south and to all of its people when so doing mr pou instead of criticising the president should be patriotic enough to stand up and applaud his utterances and uphold his hand in this respect and so should all democrats and all republicans north and south as american citizens now another one of my north carolina colleagues mr webb of the ninth district has within the last few days delivered a speech in this house which also purports to be a reply to my remarks that district is one of the strong cottonmill districts of the state mr wen denies that the cottonmill industry of his district is in a prosperous condition and attempts to show that it is actually suffering rather than being helped by the republican tariff law and contends that if the republicans can not pass a tariff law that will be more conducive to the success of the cottonmill industry then there is no reason why a republican should be sent to congress from that district"], [0.9170048236846924, 0.9170048236846924, 0, "i crave the attention of the house and ivould be pleased if i could be permitted to conelude my remarks without interruption if i have any time left at the completion of my remarks i shall be glad to answer any questions that may be propounded in the last three or four congresses i have consistently voted for one additional battle ship at each session on the theory that every year one ship goes out of commission and that by an annual addition of one our navy will always be kept at its momentary strength i propose to pursue the same course with respect to the pending bill believing as i do that for purposes of defense our present naval forces are fully adequate and in fact would be equal to all possible emergencies even if no addition whatever were voted at this time from every standpoint a further increase of armaments seems to me both inadvisable and unnecessary we are at peace with all the world and what is more we enjoy the confidence and respect of all governments and nations and even if any unforeseen international complication should arise i believe the enlightened sentiment of this country to be strong enough today to compel its peaceful settlement by arbitration the annual japanese war scare which comes so regularlyin fact too regularly to be accidentalhas lost its terror and appears the less 6ffectual the more we compare our naval strength with that of japan but even if we did not have twice the number of battle ships we know that that oriental country wants to be and is sincerely our friend so that we can safely say no trouble will ever threaten us from that source as long as reason and the good common sense which fortunately are now guiding the destinies of the two nations are not supplanted by mob rule consequently from the view point of national security there is at this time no excuse for increased naval expendituresand this is the only ground upon which they ever could be excusedwhile upon the other hanal there is every reason for the practice of the strictest economy at a time when corporation and income taxes have to be imposed upon the people to make both ends meet in the national household when the expenditures of the government still exceed the revenues and when the sustenance of life is more expensive than ever before already the legitimate activities of the government for peaceful development have to be restricted in order to meet the present vast expenditures for needless war preparations and a further increase might easily mark the limit of the peoples patience a great metropolitan newspaper said the other day america now has the opportunity to lead the world to peace or war this is literally true it is true because by now calling a halt to further unnecessary naval expansion we shall set an example which in the interest of peace and economy the taxpaying millions of other nations will force their governments to emulate while a continuance of our warlike preparations will and inevitably must some day lead to actual war it may therefore be fairly said that at this particular juncture of the worlds history the american congress holds the decision of peace or war in the hollow of its hand it is a great opportunity gentlemen of the house and you will agree it is one that rarely comes to mortal man peace or war can there be any doubt in the mind of any true american which it should be yet you wonder why the honor and glory of such a decision should rest with the united states i will tell you the reason in the language of an unknown essayist whose tongue is more eloquent than mine we are at peace he says we profess peace and yet we prepare for war today over 4 000 000 of men are confined to the routine drudgery of barracks while millions more labor to support them the increase of armaments goes on until it means slow destruction in time of peace or swift destruction in the event of war an ominous hush hangs over europe in the silence we can hear the clang of the hammer in the shipyard as bolt by bolt and beam by beam the mighty engines of destruction take shape and in a confused discordant manner arises the discontent of millions who robbed of the very necessities of life strive in vain to keep together body and soil the royalty of europe living in the glory and pride of the past watching each other with envious eye can not or will not hear the cry of defenseless humanity against the awful burdens of taxation crushing out its very life shall that cry be forever unheeded is there no one to raise a voice against the awful tyranny of war has america no share in this world problem shall she stand idly by and view with unconcern or even vie with monarchs in the creation and growth of mighty armies and mightier navies until the whole world becomes a vast earthquake of destruction does she feel no throb of pity no call of love to lighten the burdens of militarism america is consecrated to liberty she is the holme of freedom at lexington at saratoga and at valley forge americans proved that their ideal of freedom was no passing fancy and when their ideal was realized at yorktown they made justice the corner stone of the constitution which they dedicated to liberty why may not america lead in the movement for peace the same spirit of justice and freedom points us to our duty leads us onward to our mission the nations of europe can not lead america must lead europe is a center of entangling alliances and inherited feuds america is alone surrounded by 3 000 miles of ocean on either side europe is scarred by marks of countless conquests americas virgin prairies are blessed with peaceful industry europe has an inheritance of militarism america has a birthright of freedom the states of europe are separated by selfishness the commonwealths of america are united in love surely we are people chosen to teach mankind a lesson of justice and lead the nations in the way of brotherhood these are the reasons gentlemen why the decision of that momentous question rests with us and this is not a party question rampant militarism respects neither individual presidents nor individual parties disregarding party lines and politics it shrewdly places its insatiable demands upon the high ground of national duty and patriotism and upon that plane you will have to meet them not as politicians but as statesmen nor has this question as formerly been made a test of loyalty to the admifiistration and thanks for that it leaves the way open to an individual conception of patriotism and enables each man to vote his honest convictions and from the standpoint of personal conviction i say again if at this particular juncture congress votes for a further increase of armaments it will deal a deathblow to the hopes of the toiling millions the world over for its action will signalize a continuance of the mad rivalry of the powers a rivalry which at the end and after the sacrifice of billions is bound to leave the relative strength of the nations exactly the same as at the beginning as we all full well know if on the other hand the american congress calls a halt here and now the command will be heard and heeded the world over the voice of the people everywhere is for lasting peace but unless the congress of the united states speaks the redeeming word it will not be spoken for the simple reason that in a democracy alone the voice of the people can find free and untrammeled expression it is true that since the spanishamerican war military influences have become most powerful in our country too and much more so than is conducive to the health of a republic but thank the lord these influences can not as yet control congress whenever that time should come the republic will fall and be supplanted by a monarchy with the man on horseback in control therefore i say let us now stop aping war lords and royalty and no longer follow their false maxims you are telling the people that battle ships are not for war but for peace for the preservation of peace but there is a growing doubt in the minds of many especially those who have read history as to whether this is true if armaments were a guaranty for peace why is it that the nations of europe though armed to their teeth have been forced to wage so many wars the belief is gaining ground and the best thought of the world supports it that there is a better way a way vastly more economical and humane to preserve the peace and that is by simple agreements to keep the peace the people have seen a new light on this subject and are satisfied that battle ships are no longer essential to the maintenance of peace since a world tribunal has been established for the peaceful settlement of international disputes the united states has given its assent to the establishment of this high court of nations by which it is proposed to extend the rule of law beyond the boundary lines of the several countries and to international relations more than that the american delegates to the hague have been largely instrumental in bringing about this splendid achievement and the sole question now is will the governments resort to this instrument of peace which under the pressure of public opinion they themselves have forged for one i do not want it said of my country that it was insincere in this great international question and that it refuses to live up to its solemn agreements you may talk about national prestige depending on the number of guns and battle ships but to my mind such prestige depends much more largely upon the honorable conduct of a nation upon the sincerity of its purpose and upon the virtues and virility of its citizenship nothing in my judgment will contribute more to the honor and glory of this republic in the eyes of the world than its plain honesty and sense of justice and the sincerity with which it adheres to its international obligations and no one can convince me that it would be an act of sincerity to extend your one hand to the nations for a pact of common brotherhood and to keep on building engines of war with the other you may answer that we are compelled to do as the others do this excuse would have some force if we were in the same position as the others but you all know we are not we can afford to be honest our geographical isolation is a protection which no other country enjoys and we have it from expert testimony that each fleet no matter how large and wherever it may come from can be blown to atoms by our submarines before it could ever reach our shores the european and asiatic powers are not so fortunate but while this may excuse their naval armaments why should we stubbornly insist on sharing their misfortunes by imposing upon ourselves unnecessary burdens instead of aiding them because of our position of providential isolation in lightening theirs he must be feebleminded indeed who can not glean from this the lesson of americas greatest mission in the politics of the world it is possible that the american people have been indifferent to a degree as to the exactions of jingoism aye the unthinking may even have felt flattered because of the alluring prospect of the united states becoming the greatest naval power on earth mistak ing physical power for greatness and shallow vanity for patriotism they always readily responded to the appeals of the jingo with that enthusiasm which is often born of a false conception of national pride but public sentiment is rapidly changing and a better thought is getting the upper hand if it is true what goethe says that man is but an animal with a soul the tricks that stirred the animal are losing their charm and the appeals to the soul of man are more readily heeded we are learning that power is not greatness war preparations in time of profound peace are not synonymous with honor and prestige and that the animal spirit to fight and kill is not necessarily patriotism in other words we are beginning to think and reason and the reasoning process is to the jingo what the cross is to the evil one i can point to a hundred facts as evidence of the growth among the people as well as the governments of a sentiment in favor of curbing the passions and fighting propensities of man by a regulation of the intercourse of nations in accordance with the rules of law justice and reason the same as obtain in all civilized countries last year there was a protest here of 230 massachusetts clergymen against further naval increases today there is before us a remonstrance signed by over 700 ministers of churches and leaders of religious organizations from the city of boston alone and before i continue my argument let me read from this remonstrance we ministers etc constantly made aware of the hard financial struggles of the people due to greater cost of living express our approval of the decrease in military and naval expenses recommended by the president in his recent annual message and earnestly remonstrate against further increase of the navy the fact that the united states which has no enemies bnt is on friendly terms with all nations is spending more than 30 per cent of its revenues postal receipts not included on preparations for war and nearly 70 per cent for war purposes if the expenses of past wars be included or nearly 400 000 000 a year should in our judgment cause the national government to take immediate action for the reduction of militaxy and naval appropriations we believe that the legal system already embodied in the hague eonentions is adequate to meet the requirements of international justice on an honorable equitable end economic basis we therefore urge the government to use its utmost influence to encourage resort to law in all cases of international dispute and to assist in improving the legal system of the nations by all means within its power we commend the efforts of the department of state to secure the establishment of the international court of justice projected by the second hague conference and we urge the employment of all practicable means for the promotion of more perfect friendship between the united states and other countries in order that money now spent on preparations for war may be devoted to the necessities of peace and build up the prosperity of the people there are hundreds of other petitions from all over the united states one from the american peace society an organization with branches in all parts of the country and members in every congressional district reads in part we desire respectfully to express cur approval of the action of the house committee on naval affairs last year in reducing the number of battle ships recommended from four to two and we hereby earnestly protest against further increase of the navy this year we believe that our general government especially in view of the successful operation of the hague peace system where it has been faithfully triedmediation commissions of inquiry and arbitrationis capable of managing the international relations of this country in such a manner as to make further extensive armaments on our part unnecessary insisting upon respect for the law of nations as embodied in the international conventions made by the civilized powers at the hague we believe that the time has come for the united states government which has always stood for peaceful and legal settlements of international questions to be consistent with its traditions we urge the government to make a serious attempt to lead the nations in limitation and reduction of armaments in order that as soon as possible the vast gums of money now taken for their construction from the people may become available for peaceful civic uses we also express our approval of alt reasonable measures that may be adopted by our department of state for the constitution of the new international court of justice recommended by the second hague conference confident that its establishment will complete the legal system of nations by giving them a court that from the nature of its structure will be accessible at all times permanent judicial and equitable i trust we all realize that the patriotism of those good americans who signed these protests is not less intense because it is of a higher order than that of the jingoes but let me continue my account of what is going on in the world a few months ago secretary of state knox with the consent of the president addressed a note to the powers proposing to invest the international prize court recently created with the jurisdiction of a court of arbitral justice the plan was an inspiration and will immortalize its author while the second hague conference had unanimously approved the principle of obligatory arbitration as well as a continuance of the hague court as a court of arbitral justice with permanent judges the question of distributing 17 judges among 45 nations had divided the conference and as no agreement could be reached the matter was left to future diplomatic negotiations in the meantime an international prize court with permanent judges had been established by consent of the nations and the american proposition according to the knox plan therefore is to invest this court with jurisdiction in arbitration as well as prize questions and so sensible and practical is this proposition that the powers one by one are now signifying their assent to it this assures us a permanent high court at the hague for the settlement of all controversies which the nations may see fit to submit to it and if this institution means anything it means that every nation can have its rights protected by law and judicial decision and that armaments are no longer necessary except for the enforcement of the courts decrees is anyone to believe that our stite department did not realize this logic and did not draw the same conclusion when it sent its circular note containing that proposal to all the nations of the earth and does not the navy department by its insistence on further naval increase and the more so by its latest phantastic plan of leading the world in naval construction i refer to the proposed 18 000 000 dreadnoughts actually repudiate our department of state and negative not to say give the lie to its peaceful professions and would not congress by approving the new naval programme serve notice on the world that the american proposition heretofore mentioned was not made in good faith and that our promises official though they may be axe mere pretense and sham the honor of the american nation is involved in this matter much more than in any difficulty which may cause a jingo to shout for war and i plead for its vindication but let me continue my enumeration the federation of the world is by many still considered as a beautiful dream yet it is a reality and has been ever since the nations met for the first time at the hague and in solemn council made laws for all the people of the earth and these laws are aimed at the establishment of lasting peace the governments one by one are officially recognizing the interparliamentary union that brotherhood of lawmakers now comprising over 2 000 members of national legislative bodies all united in a joint effort to have arbitration substituted for war while no pledge of any kind has been exacted from them and while they are free to vote as they please on questions of this kind will it be consistent for them to vote for armaments when they know that only the will of the governments is necessary to keep the peace by resorting to arbitration i am glad to say that the american congress too is about to recognize that organization by contributing its share toward the maintenance of its international bureau here is the nucleus of an international legislature to cooperate with the international judiciary already established for the preservation of the worlds peace the united states has negotiated arbitration treaties with 14 different nations outside of the latinamerican countries with which a general agreement has been entered into providing for the peaceful adjustment of all differences in this connection it should also be remembered that the hague treaties have relieved us from all real and fancied responsibility with regard to the debts of the governments south of us by providing that these obligations shall no longer be collected by force many other burdens have been lightened which we had to carry even before we had a navy worthy the name the united states has a gentlemans agreement with japan which recognizes the mutual sphere of influence of the two powers enables both to keep the peace and in case of any dissentions renders easy an amicable understanding all our differences with great britain are now in the process of adjustment by arbitration and a treaty to resort to the hague court in certain contingencies is in force between the two great powers there is the strongest possible evidence not only of the desire on the part of the governments to reduce armaments if the united states were to make the start but also of their positive disinclination to go to war even under strong provocation in the british french and japanese parliaments and even in the german reichstag representatives of these governments recently gave assurances of their readiness to reopen negotiations for the reduction of naval armaments and motions to that effect arepending in nearly all the parliaments of the world since the russianjapanese war there has been no bloody encounter between the nations it was a terrible lesson namely that that frightful conflict could have been avoided by arbitration the same as itwas ended the world has fairly staggered under a perception of this fact and what has happened since while the english jingoes shouted for war on account of the dogger bank incident the governments of great britain and russia ordered an investigation as a result of which explanations followed and trouble and bloodshed were avoided then the morocco affair was settled at an international conference france and germany referred the casa blanca incident to the hague court and both governments have since accepted the verdict of that tribunal in the balkans where there always has been enough inflammable material to set europe on fire even a radical change of the map could not induce the interested nations to draw the sword while in former years much more trivial causes would have surely brought on war yet today the preparation of nations for war is much greater than ever before why then do they not fight why their eagerness to investigate and arbitrate instead of summoning their battalions to battle it is nothing else but the power of an enlightened public opinion which is determining their course the strong and growing sentiment against that relic of barbarism the killing of men and in favor of a higher order of things the autocrats of the world may rule their subjects but that sentiment born of civilization and humanity rules the rulers will we americans living as we do in a democracy where the people themselves are supposed to rule disregard it the saying is where there is a will there is a way for eighteen hundred years the human family looked in vain for a way to more permanent peace until it was finally discovered and what a wonderfully simple way it is to lay it bare in all its simplicity i will cite a historical precedent which is so instructive as to merit mention in all our schoolbooks on history the coast line between canada and the united states from the st lawrence river to lake superior is about 2 000 miles long in the year 1812 there were 46 forts big and little on the united states side and about the same number frowned on us from canada at fort niagara alone there were at one time 6 000 troops altogether we had on the great lakes over a hundred craft devoted to the act of fightingin the interest of peace of course suddenly but very quietly two men got together in washington and made an agreement one man was acting secretary of state richard rush of philadelphia the other was charles bagot minister to the united states from england the document is written on one side of a single sheet of paper and is dated april 28 1817 it can be seen in the archives of the state department it reads as follows 1 the naval forces henceforth to be maintained upon the great lakes shall be confined to the following vessels on each side 2 on lake ontario one vessel not to exceed 100 tons burden carrying not more than 20 men and one 18pound cannon 3 on the upper lakes two vessels of same burden and armed in a like way 4 on lake champlain one vessel of like size and armament 5 all other armed vessels to be at once dismantled and no other vessel of war should be built or armed along the st lawrence river or on the great lakes this agreement has religiously been kept for ninetythree years its effect was to at once stop work on the fortifications and cause disarmament along the great lakes so far as is known the agreement will continue for all time here is an example for our friends the jingos to study it is a complete refutation of their theory that a lack of armaments invites invasion and attack on the contrary it is a safe prediction that if these forts on the frontier had been maintained and had the ships of war continued to sail up and down the great lakes nothing short of a positive miracle would have saved us from fighting and from a war with england and now i ask you what is there in the way of a similar agreement between all the nations only the will of the governments and rulers selfishness envy and fear have so far prevented them from choosing this avenue of relief and lifting from the peoples shoulders a burden under which they all groan is americafree majestic isolated americato be baffled by the same petty impulses it is just one hundred years that the worlds peace movement was born and its birthplace was the united states i could not imagine a more gloriobs celebration of its centennial than by a declaration of the american congress through its vote on the pending bill that this free and mighty republic relying on its international agreements for the settlement of its differences and believing its present armaments to be ample for defense has once for all called a halt to further wasteful expenditure for their enlargement it will mean sunshine and prosperity on this hemisphere and the dawn of a new emancipation on the other"], [0.9038509130477905, 0.9038509130477905,

the danger of prosecution must be in the same jurisdiction and if it was in another jurisdiction he could not refuse to give the testimony the case of hale v henkle was where the witness was called upon to produce certain information concerning alleged combinations in restraint of trade by the american tobacco company the witness refused because he said that his answvers would subject him to prosecution in the state courts the supreme court of the united states reaffirmed the doctrine laid down in the case of brown v walkter holding that he could be compelled to answer and that the fact that he might be prosecuted by the state authorities on the information disclosed afforded him no legal reason for refusing so i take it that the provisions are fully vindicated by all of the authorities and i think no case can be found holding to the contrary by any of the federal courts but the real controversy upon this bill centers around the first four sectionls of it sections 1 2 3 and 4 those are the portions of the bill that are claimed to be an invasion of the reserved rights and police powers of the states i have before me here a paper signed by some of those who are opposed to this legislation styled the views of the minority and which sets out the reasons upon which that opposition is based i think it coul he aptly called the visions of the minority because they see visions of state autonomy destroyed of state rights roughly ridden over a consolidated government and the police powers of the states absolutely set at naught the gentlemen who signed this paper are lawyers of learning and ability and i take it have put their contention as strongly as it can be stated i want to invite the attention of the house to the cases upon which they rely to sustain their position the controversy between the advocates of this measure and its opponents is not so much upon what tihe law is but it turns upon the application of the law to my mind these views of tile minority when applied to the real legal propositions at issue come about as near striking the law of the case as the speech of sergeant buzfuz came to approximating the facts in the case of bardell v pickwick let us examine now with franigess and candor the authorities upon which they rely it will take but a short while to refer to them they first itte in support of their contention that this bill is an illegal invasion of the police powers and reserved rights of the states the case of barbier v conally reported in one hundred and thirteenth united states supreme court reports i am perfectly sure that no man favoring this legislation would contend for 011 moment that congress has any right or power to invade the reserved rights and police powers of the states we make no claim of this sort but we do say that this bill does not attempt to accomplish anyting of that character and that it is clearly within the powers of the general government contained in the commerce and treaty making clauses of the federal constitution now the case of barbier v conally was where the city of san francisco acting through its board of supervisors and under the authority of the legisla ture of the state in attempting to regulate the intiscriminate establishment of public laundries in that city end believing that it imperiled property to allow them to operate between 10 at night and 6 oclock a n prohibited them from so doing this attempted regulation of these laundries by the local authorities was assailed upon the ground that it wls a violation of the fourteenth amendment to the federal constitution the court in deciting that the regulation in question was valid used tis language but neither the amendment broad and comprehensive as it is nor any other auedmeint was dsigned to interfere with the power of the state sometimes termed its police power to prescribe regulations to promote the health peace morals education andgood order of the people and to legislate so as to increase the industries of the state develop its resources and add to its wealth and prosperity anjid yet gentlemen rely on this case to sustain their contention that this bill which simply proposes to regulate the transportation of persons which provides that no man shall be allowed to transport or aid in transporting a woman from one state to another for the purpose of prostitution and debauchery is unconstitutional could anything be more wide of the mark the case they cite was an effort by the local authorities to regulate a matter of purely domestic concern the regulation in the barbierconally case was limited to the city of san francisco the bill before the house is one of interstate application it concerns a matter in which all the people of the united states are interested and rests upon the power of congress to regulate commerce among the states well let us examine the next case mentioned in these views of the minority the second case they cite is the case of the united states v de witt reported in 9 wallace at page 41 that case involved the constitutionality of the twentyninth section of the act of march 2 1867 that section made it a crime punishable by fine in the federal courts for any person to mix for sale or knowingly sell or keep for sale or sell or offer for sale any illuminating oil which was inflammable at less than 1100 fahrenheit de witt was indicted under this section it being charged that he offered for sale in detroit in the state of michigan oil of the prohibited description the case reached the supreme court of the united states on a certificate of division between the judges of the circuit court for the eastern district of michigan chief justice chase in delivering the opinion of the court among other things said the questions certified resolve themselves into this has congress aower under theconstitution to prohibit trade within the limits of a tate is this the proposition involved in the bill now before the house does this bill propose to prohibit trade within the limits of a state does it propose to regulate in any way any of the local and domestic affairs of the states by no fair intendment can any such purpose be evolved from this bill it shows clearly upon its face that it is confined solely to regulating commerce among the several states this statement is sufficient to show that the de witt case is not at all in point the chief justice in the opinion proceeds that congress has power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states and with the indian tribes the constitution expressly declares but this express grant of power to regulate commerce among the states has always been understood as limited by its terms and as a virtual denial of any power to interfere with the internal trade and business of the separate states except indeed as a necessary and proper means for carrying into execution some other power expressly granted or vested and then speaking further of the act then under consideration the court used this language as a police regulation it can only have effect where the legislative authority of congress excludes territorially all state legislation as for example in the district of columbia within state limits it can have no constitutional operation and yet gentlemen rely upon that case to support their contention that congress has no right to regulate the interstate transportation of persons for the purposes denounced in this bill can you imagine a more farfetched line of decision than those they have brought here they come as near striking the law of this matter as did the candidate for admission to the bar as described in baldwins flush times in alabama and mississippi when the committee asked him what is a chose in action the fellow quickly replied squire that is where a man has two actions to fetch and he chooses one of em he will fetch well let us see the other case they next rely upon the slaughterhouse cases reported in 16 wallace at page 36 those cases involved the constitutionality of an act of the legislature of the state of louisiana passed march 8 1869 entitled an act to protect the health of the city of new orleans to locate the stock landings and slaughterhouses and to incorporate the crescent city live stock landing and slaughter house company the caption of the act fairly expresses its scope and purpose the court held that that act operating solely within the state and intended for the protection of health within the state was a police regulation and therefore was within the power of the state government exclusively that the act in question did no violence to any section of the federal constitution and that the federal govemment could not prevent its enforcement gentlemen upon the other side of this question then cite us to the license cases reported in 5 howard at page 504 in those cases the constitutionality of certain statutes for the regulation of the sale of intoxicating liquors in the states of rhode island new hampshire and lmassachusetts was under consideration each of those states has passed acts intended to restrict the sale of liquors and those acts were assailed upon the ground that they were violations of the constitution of the united states in each case the act in question was confined in its operation to the particular state which passed it the cases were argued at length and carefully considered the chief justice and several of the justices delivered opinions in which the police powers and reserved rights of the states were discussed the court held that each of the acts then before the court were but exercises of the police powers of the states and therefore the federal government could not interfere with their execution by the states which passed them i am sure that i have fairly stated the point involved and the question which was decided by the court in these license cases i content myself with reading from the concluding portion of the opinion of justice grier he says it is not necessary for the sake of justliying the state legislation now under consideration to array the appalling statistics of misery pauperism and crime which have their origin in the use or abuse of ardent spirits the police power which is exclusively in the states is alone competent to the correction of these great evils and all measures of restraint or prohibition necessary to effect the purpose are within the scope of that authority there is no conflict of power or of legislation as between the states and the united states each is acting within its sphere and for the public good and if a loss of revenue should accrue to the united states from a diminished consumption of ardent spirits she will be gainer a thousandfold in the health wealth and happiness of the people gentlemen who signed the views of the minority also cite us to the trademark cases reported in 100 u s page 82 in 3 876 congress passed an act making it an offense for any person with intent to defraud to make or have in his possession any trademark of another in passing upon the constitutionality of this act the supreme court heldi read from the syllabus of the opinion if an act of congress can in any case be extended as a regulation of commerce to trademarks it must be limited to their use in commerce with foreign nations and among the several states and with the induan tribes the legislation of congress in regard to trademarks is not in its terms or essential character a regulation thus limited but in its language embraces and was intended to embrace all commerce including that between citizens of the same state that legislation is void for want of constitutional authority inasmuch as it is so framed that its provisions are applicable to all commerce and can not be confined to that which is subject to the control of congress ow this is the line of cases which my brethren have brought here to sustain their contention that this great body is without power to pass legislation regulating a matter of interstate commerce surely there is not a case which i have read that bears on the great question involved i press upon the house the point that this bill is not an attempt to regulate the morals of citizens of the several states it does not attempt to interfere with any state statute it does not attempt to exercise a single power which the states themselves could exercise but it does attempt to regulate commerce between the states the power of congress to pass this legislation must be found in two articles of the federal constitution congress shall have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states and with the indian tribes congress shall have power to pass all laws which are necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers and all other powers vested by this constitution in the government of the united states or in any department thereof upon these

this bill and i think in justice to my constituents that i ought to give my reasons i come from a state that has a population of 950 000 540 000 of whom are depositors in savings banks with aggregate deposits of 255 000 000 so that counting every man woman and child in my state more than half of them have savings in the bank of about 500 each under these circumstances we have little use or call

whole united states while i think that this legislation can well be dispensed with in many respects i hope that it will be productive of a large amount of good the reason that we have savings banks in new england and large deposits in the eastern portion of this country is that we are economical and prudent and have been compelled to be so for the last two hundred and sixty years we have no rich prairie soil from which we can derive large crops and great profits we have no unearned increment in increased valuation of land from 1 25 an acre to 150 an acre and what we have gentlemen we saved by hard economy now the very fact of your prosperity of your wealth in land and of your wealth in crops will be detrimental to you in producing the same condition of affairs that we have so that i think

compels us to vote for this bill or compels you gentlemen o that side to vote for the democratic bill both party platforms call for a postal savingsbank system but i am bound to vote for the senate bill which the republican party in that body has passed and which in my judgment is a socialistic measure pure and simple what am i to do must i vote for this one or that one the party platform calls for a postal savings system but i do not see that the party platform makes it incumbent upon a man to vote for any particular measure if that is so then every one of you gentlemen on that side if you can not get your bill passed must vote for the republican measure in order to comply with your platform which demands a postal savings bank speaking of party platforms let me suggest to my democratic brethren what your party platforms have said on this subject i go back to 1856 to the faith of the fathers your action here today would make the corpse of andrew jackson roll over in his grave as i will show you before i get through this is what you said in 1856 that the separation of the moneys of the government from banking institutions is indispensable for the safety of the funds of the government and the rights of the people yet fiftyfour years afterwards you make this declaration we favor a postal savings bank if the guaranteed bank can not be secured and believe that it should be so constituted as to keep the deposited money in the communities where the depositors live the very identical thing that you declared against in 1856 and it would seem to me that the shades of andrew jackson and the old fathers of the democracy ought to hover over you nov in condemnation of your proposition that 950 000 000 of the peoples money under this democratic substitute proposition should be put into the banks of the country interest paid to the people at 2 per cent loaned to the banks at 2j per cent and loaned out by the banks at rates varying from 6 to 10 per cent how can you go home

introduced having for their object the repeal of the law taxing oleo colored to imitate butter that extensive hearings have been given on the subject and because of the activity on the part of the friends of oleo and the possibility of having these bills come up for consideration and determination in this congress i wish now to offer a few observations protesting against the repeal of the present law and to advocate the strengthening of it rather than the weakening of it the argument advanced in favor of its repeal is that the price of butter the genuine article is high therefore that oleo the counterfeit should go untaxed the present law puts a tax of 10 cents per pound on oleo except when oleo is free from artificial coloration which causes it to look like butter of any shade of yellow in which case the tax shall be onequarter of 1 cent per pound hence the tax on the real article in its natural color is onequarter of a cent but whenever colored to imitate butterthat which it is not and which makes it possible for the dishonest vender to palm it off for butter which has been and is so frequently being donethe the counterfeit is taxed 10 cents per pound nobody so far as i know objects to the quartercent tax on the article in its natural state if so nobody would object to reducing that quarter of 1 cent to the lowest possible denomination the 10cent tax is not a tax on oleo as a legitimate article of manufacture as alleged it is simply and only a tax on fraud and deception and for revenue purposes for where no fraud and deception is practiced no tax is levied or practically none hence the claim that the tax is a tax on the consumer of oleo and a hardship comes with poor grace and is unfounded for tile tax on oleo in its natural state is a nominal one and no hardship to the consumer nobody objects to the sale of oleo because it competes with butter nobody objects to the sale of oleo in its natural state or garb and when sold for what it is but every fairminded and reasonable man objects to counterfeiting and making this article in imitation of the genuine articlebutterand to sell it as such i contend that counterfeiting butter is just as wrong and unjust as the counterfeiting of dollars one is as bad as the other you might as well contend that the price of gold dollars is high and that congress should repeal the law prohibiting the counterfeiting of dollars if tfie contention that this substitute for butter may be made in imitation of butter for the purpose of deceivingand it can not be for any other purposewhy not permit the substitution of lead zinc and silver to be made and colored in imitation of gold dollars that would be just as honorable and less harmful that would affect the victim or the purchasers pocket only but when you undertake to permit counterfeiting and deception in food products and its wholesomeness is in question it involves not only the swindling of the innocent purchaser and consumer out of dollars and cents but their health as well will anybody contend that the repeal of the present law will reduce the price of oleo certainly not nor is it so contended or intended it will simply make it possible for manufacturers and dealers in oleo to sell it for butter and at butter prices or nearly so hence there will be an increase in price and not a decrease as was the case before the passage of the oleo bill for instance 5 492 dealers sold 62 825 5 82 pounds of yellow oleo out of the total product of 86 000 000 pounds in 1899 every pound of the 62 000 000 pounds was sold in violation of the laws of the 32 states in which it was sold not only was this sold in violation of these state laws but it was sold for butter and at butter prices i bought a number of packages myself in every instance calling for butter and 19 times out of 20 i got oleo that condition is corroborated by the government reports and reports made by manufacturers to the secretary of the treasury in fact nobody has ever taken occasion to deny it hence the contention that this 10cent tax should not be imposed is not to reduce the price nor is it in the interest of the consumer but it is for the purpose of enabling the man ufacturers to color their article to look like butter and to enable them to palm it off to deceive to defraud and to rob the inocent consumer as everybody knows this tax was intended not only to produce revenue but to take away the incentive to commit this fraud on the consumer to tax oleo an amount equal to the difference of cost of the natural oleo and butter removes the incentive to fraud in coloring it in imitation of butter and selling it for butter oleo colored in imitation of butter was sold for butter before the passage of the present law and that is exactly what will take place if the law is repealed as is proposed in this burleson bill i submit to youthat rather than to encourage fraud deception counterfeiting and the ruination of health life and property by legislation would it not be better for congress to strengthen the law as suggested by the commissioner of internal revenue and make it possible for the government officials to enforce it and prevent this fraud deception and counterfeiting we are told that the oleo law is now being violated and for that reason the law should be repealed and to strengthen this contention the commissioner of internal revenue and a number of other officials were called in to testify as to the gross and flagrant violations going on what was the result the commissioner an able honorable and conscientious official not only told of the violations but pointed out the defects of the law as well as suggesting the remedies i invite your attention to the testimony of not only commissioner cabell but other officials all of them introduced as witnesses of the oleo interests you will find that the law has been grossly violated you will find those now violating the law have gone so far as to kill in cold blood officials trying to enforce the law you will find that government officials are now in hospitals on account of wounds inflicted by these lawbreakers you will find that the violations of the law are increasing you will find that a number of these people engaged in this business have been fined and sentenced some of them now serving their prison sentence it was reported in the papers some time ago that several of these distinguished gentlemen in chicago were fined some of them to the extent of 15 000 and imprisoned gentleman these are the facts they are the arguments set forth and this is the evidence produced by their own witnesses i ask you in all candor is it good and sufficient reason for the repeal of this law are these lawbreakers entitled to special privileges over those engaged in the counterfeiting of dollars why should this fraud be immune from taxation are these people of greater consequence than the farmers why should the dairymen be imposed upon why rob him of a market for his genuine and legitimate article the wholesomeness of this article i do not care to discuss this is a question that has already been discussed and at the hearings there was a tacit understanding that the two articles should stand on their merits and that that should be a matter for the consumer to determine i would not now refer to it had it not been for the

speech of my colleague would receive no notice from me had lie not violated the privileges of the house aid of a member of the house by making statements reflecting upon the fidelity and official integrity of a distinguished citizen recently an honored member of this body which statements are misleading and which i believe the gentleman from missouri intended and desired should mislead when he wrote them into the record at the general election held in november 1906 the good people of the fourteenth district of missouri chose joseph j russell to represent that great district in congress he was born and has always lived in the district that honored him the people know him well they know he has been faithful to every trust and that he never neglected a duty violated an obligation or sought to traduce a rival during his service here brief though it was he won the confidence and friendship of all who know himrepublicans as well as democrats quoting from his alleged speech my colleague says of the 12 000 agricultural bulletins furnished mr russell to distribute more than 11 000 were transferred to my credit which he did not send out to his farming constituents members are each furnished annually 900 yearbooks of the department of agriculture for distribution among the farmers there are also books on diseases of horses and on diseases of cattle furnished every member my predecessor mr russell thought so little of the interests of the farmers that he failed to send out 797 of his quota of these books and hence they fell to my credit for distribution among the farmers who want them so eagerly does the gentleman think these slatelnents are fair is he dealing candidly with those whose votes he is seeking pr is he purposely attempting to deceive them why did he not state the fact as it is known or ought to be known by him and frankly tell his constituents that a retiring member is entitled to all publications printed and allotted until the new congress convenes and no longer why lid he not do his distinguished predecessor the justice to state that on march 2 1909 the house passed house joint resolution 263 giving to all members whose terms expired with the close of the sixtieth congress until the first monday in december 1909 to distribute their documents why did he not state that mr russell in the interest of his constituents spoke in behalf of said resolution and that it passed i quote the resolution in full resolved etc that all documents and books ordered to be published by the sixtieth congress which are actually printed prior to the first monday in december next to which members of that congress not members of the sixtyfirst congress would have been entitled if published prior to the 4th day of march shall be allotted such members and the term allowed to distribute the same shall be extended to the first monday of december next why did not my colleague state that mr russell believed and had a right to believe that he had until december to distribute the books and documents referred to by him why did he not tell the people whose confidence he seeks to win that on april 5 the house adopted this resolution entitled house joint resolution 38 that the joint resolution entitled jtoint resolution to provide for the distribution by members of the sixtieth congress of documents reports and other publications approved march 2 1909 be and the same is hereby repealed why did not the gentleman tell his constituents that when this last resolution was introduced and passed mr russells term had expired and lie was in missouri confidently relying upon the rights given him under the resolution passed march 2 and that without notice to his predecessor without giving him the least opportunity to distribute the documents credited to him the resolution of march 2 was repealed thereby taking away from mr russell and by operation of law transferring to him all these documents which mr russell had been so diligent in gathering and so careful in preserving for distribution among the people of his district having failed to advise mr russell of the pendency of house joint resolution 38 as it seems common courtesy would require and thus afford him an opportunity to distribute these documents it ill becomes the gentleman who is the beneficiary of his own silence to criticise mr russell for not doing that which the resolution adopted april 5 expressly prevented him from doing continued silence would have been commendable my colleague also wrote these strange words into the record by their fruits shall ye know them i believe the fruits of my hard and persistent work which has brought unheard of results in my district let me say to him the fruits of the hard and persistent work of the gentleman from missouri and those who voted with him at every opportunity to increase the burdens of an extortionate tariff upon the millions of toiling men women and children in the united states and against every effort to reduce the tariff on the common necessities of life have been heard of in the sixth district of missouri they have been heard of in the fourteenth district of massachusetts they have been heard of in the thirtysecond district of new york and they will be heard of in the fourteenth district of missouri in november i warn him the fruits of legislation he assisted by his votes in enacting will not be unheard of on the day of the next election the people of his district have heard and will remember that by his votes he assisted in increasing the cost of clothing of flannels of cotton cloth of hats of stockings of school books and of numerous other articles of absolute necessity to them and their families the people will again repose confidence in a man whose sympathies are with the masses and who will not yield to the solicitations of mighty trusts and combinations in servile obedience to the dictates of any man i seriously doubt if the independent progressive citizens of his district will indorse my colleagues record as heartily as he seems to expect i do not believe they will indorse his vote for the speaker who presides over this body nor his vote to adopt the gag rules of the house without opportunity to amend them nor his vote against the norris amendment by which the speaker was removed from the committee on rules and that committee was made elective by the house instead of appointive by the speaker nor his vote against the amendment offered by my colleague to amend the tariff bill which amendment i quote amend by placing leather harness boots shoes and all other products of leather on the free list why did he do it let him explain to his constituel~ts if he can i do not believe an intelligent people will longer stand for or indorse any standpat record the bill carrying an appropriation for a public building at poplar bluffs had not been reported to the house on june 16 hence no reference is made to it in the article inserted in the record by my colleague he will doubtless refer to it when he returns to his district and when he does i cordially invite him to also mention the fact that congressional recognition of poplar bluffs was first secured and the ultimate appropriation for a building made absolutely certain when his predecessor the hon j j russell got an appropriation to purchase a site for a federal building there i wish he would also state the fact that mr russells loyalty to the people of that city and county did not cease with the expiration of his office but that he appealed to missouri senatorsor one of thenand had every reason to believe that his efforts in behalf of that city would result in a senate amendment to the public buildings bill making an appropriation for a building at poplar bluffs if such item should not be carried in the house bill on june 2 1910 the gentleman from new jersey offered to amend the the sundry civil appropriation bill which carried an appropriation of 100 000 for the enforcement of the antitrust laws by adding a proviso which i insert provided further that no part of this money shall be spent in the prosecution of any organization or individual for entering into any combination or agreement having in view the increasing of wages shortening of hours or bettering the condition of labor or for any act done in furtherance thereof not in itself unlawful my colleague was in his seat when the vote was taken on this amendment why did not he vote for it in the interest of the thousands of workingmen and the labor unions in his district when tellers were ordered on this vote why did he remain quietly in his seat and refuse to walk between the tellers and le counted what influence caused him to refuse his vote in behalf of a struggling people true the corporations did not want this amendment adopted did that fact give him an acute attack of locomotor ataxia and prevent his giving one vote during his whole term in the interest of men who toil for their bread and for the support of the children they love let him explain to his constituents these and other things he failed to mention in the letter he published in the congressional record the hughes amendment exempting labor organizations or members of such organizations from being dragged into a federal court and prosecuted as common criminals for merely attempting in a peaceable and lawful manner by cooperation to secure fairer wages shorten their hours of toil or otherwise improve their condition was adopted by the house without the aid or vote of my colleague in the senate the bill was amended senate amendment 76 struck out the hughes amendment to the bill on june 21 the conference report on this bill was under consideration in the house and the gentleman from new jersey sought to restore his amendment by instructing the house conferees not to agree to senate amendment 76 i quote the resolution of instruction resolved that the house conferees be instructed to refuse to agree to senate amendment no 70 every vote for this resolution was a vote directly in the interest of the millions of men who labor every vote against it was a vote against the welfare of the man who works on the passage of the hughes resolution a roll call was ordered and strange to say my colleague who has the honor of representing the greatest industrial district in the imperial state of missouri and who numbers among those who have heretofore given him their confidence thousands of good men who earn their daily bread by toil voted against the adoption of this resolution as shown at page 8656 of the congressional record of june 21 1910 how will my colleague explain this vote against the interests of his constituents my colleague also wrote into the record i have given the record of my party and myself honestly and fairly to the best of my knowledge etc as i have no means of measuring the quantum of his knowledge i shall not challenge the correctness of this statement that is

his thoughts to the best of his knowledge into the record when my colleague returns to the people who elevated him to high and exalted position he will be called upon by voters of both political parties to explain the charge of wholesale election frauds he recently made on the floor of the house against his constituents the lawabiding people of his home city county and district will not soon

histories biographies memoirs and pamphlets which i found in the congressional library but when it became known that the president had signed the treaty there was a perfect torrent of vindictive abuse that flowed from the pens of the partisan journalists and pamphleteers of that day and generation the aurora one of the most rabid of the newspapers of that period declared the president has violated the constitution he has made a treaty with a nation that is the abhorrence of our people he has treated our remonstrances with pointed contempt louis xvi in the meridian of his splendor and his power never dared to heap such insults upon his subjects the answers to the respectful remonstrances of boston and philadelphia and new york sound like the omnipotent director of a seraglio as he has been disrespectful to his people let him no longer expect them to view him as a saint one writer who signed himself a calm observer in publicly accusing washington of being a thief for having drawn from the treasury for his private use more than the salary annexed to his office asked what will posterity say of the man who has done this thing will it not say that the mask of political hypocrisy has been worn by cxsar by cromwell and by washington alike another who styled himself pittachus wrote happily the public mind is rapidly changing hitherto the name of washington has been fatal to the popularity of every man against whom it was directed now it is as harmless as john onooke or tam ostiles to be an opposer of the president will soon be a passport to popular favor one who assumed the nom de plume of valerius attacked him becausehe no longer indulges in the manly walk nor rides the generous steed he no longer continues such exercise he receives visits and returns none are these republican virtues do they command our esteem he sententiously demanded from this time on till his retirement from the presidency the attacks became more and more vitriolic in reviewing these tirades against our first president a writer of a little later period said that his antagoniststhrew aside all reserve and under the abused name of the liberty of the press assaulted his fame with a virulence not inferior to that with which they could have attacked the meanest defaulter his military his civil his political his private domestic character were all arraigned and he was asserted to be destitute of merit either as a man or as a soldier 0 having once made the charge of peculation against washington the imposters stood their ground and undertook to support it by extracts said to be taken from the treasury accounts the secretary of the treasury testified that the appropriations made by the legislature had never been exceeded still the charge was repeated with an effrontery which passed with some for the firmness of conscious rectitude to endeavor to prove that the writer of those lines did not overstep the bounds of truth when he characterized the attacks on president washington in such forceful language i will as i proceed quote a few extracts from the newspapers and pamphlets that were issued toward the closing days of his administration the aurora of march 23 1796 printed this if ever a nation was debauched by a man the american nation has been debauched by washington if ever a nation has been deceived by a man the american nation has been deceived by washington let his conduct then be an example to future ages let it serve to be a warning that no man may be an idol let the history of the federal government instruct mankind that the mask of patriotism may be worn to conceal the foulest designs against the liberty of the people what will posterity say of the man who has done this thing will it not say that the mask of political hypocrisy has been worn by caesar by cromwell and by washington alike it seems almost incredible that in the days of president washington such language could have been printed in any pewslpaper in this fair land but the president resented this kind of attack how could he do otherwise how could any man who had at heart the love of his country that our first great president had do otherwise how could any man of his patriotic nature have remained silent under such abuse and so he wrote a letter to his friend governor lee of virginia and i commend to this committee the language of that letter for it well may be taken as an excellent model of remonstrance against the vile attacks that are being made upon public men in our own day the president said that there are in this as in all other countries discontented characters i well know as also that these characters are actuated by very different views some good from the opinion that the measures of the general government are impure some bad and if i might be allowed to use so harsh an expression diabolical inasmuch as they are not only meant to impede the measures of government generally but more especially to destroy the confidence which it is necessary the people should place until they have unequivocal proof of demerit in their servants for in this light i consider myself whilst i am an occupant of office and if they were to go further and call me their slave during this period i would not dispute the point with them but in what will this abuse terminate for the result as it respects myself i care not i have a consolation within me of which no earthly efforts can deprive me and that is that neither ambition nor interested motives have influenced my conduct the arrow of malevolence however barbed and pointed can never reach my most valuable part though whilst i am up as a mark they will be continually aimed at me the publications in freneaus and baches papers are outrages on common decency and they progress in that style in proportion as their pieces are treated with contempt and passed over in silence by those against whom they are directed their tendency however is too obvious to be mistaken by men of cool and dispassionate minds and in my opinion ought to alarm them because it is difficult to prescribe bounds to their effect every american is proud of this city of washington with its superb capitol and its modest but architecturally beautiful white house the construction of these buildings was authorized and commenced during the administration of president washington hark now to this extract from one of the publications of that period ninetyseven thousand dollars have gone into the presidents house and as much more is wanted eighty thousand dollars spent upon the capitol and the building scarcely above the foundation wa is and this wastefulness is encouraged by a government that can not raise money to pay the interest on the debts it is each year contracting has not that a familiar ring to it but who today begrudges a single dollar that was expended upon either building some of the charges of theft were summed up in this fashion general washington went to the treasurysome future president may go to the bankthe one step will not be a jot worse than the other if truth or reason or the public debt had been at all consulted the house would have begun by asking the executive why he took from the treasury 1 100 000 without their leave and in contempt of the constitution the fact that washington as a general rule treated these calumnies with disdainful silence was construed by his enemies as a confession of their truth but that the attacks sank deep and embittered the life of our first chief executive is evidenced by this extract from a letter written to thomas jefferson to this i may add and very truly that until the last year or two i had no conception that parties would or even could go to the lengths i have been witness to nor did i believe until lately it was within the bounds of probabilityhardly within those of possibilitythat while i was using my utmost exertions to establish a national character of our own independent as far as our obligations and justice would permit of every nation of the earth and wished by steering a steady course to preserve this country from the horrors of a desolating war i should be accused of being the enemy of our nation and subject to the influence of another and to prove it that every act of my administration would be tortured and the grossest and most insiduous misrepresentations of them be made by giving one side only of a subject and that too in such exaggerated and indecent terms as could scarcely be applied to a nero to a notorious defaulter or even to a coninon pickpocket in the letter to governor lee and also in the letter to jefferson of which the foregoing is but an extract washington referred to a notorious muckraker of that day whose name was benjamin franklin bache he was a grandson of benjamin franklin had political aspirations but failed to receive a coveted appointment from the president he forthwith became a sorehead and in season as well as out of season this blackguard hurled his miserable abuse at the then executive as early as 1777 a cabal had been organized against general washington when he was commander in chief of the continental army in order to destroy his influence in that army and to poison the public mind a number of forged letters were cunningly devised so as to arouse a suspicion of his fidelity to the american cause they were intended to convey the impression that he was attached to the cause of england in order to spread a belief in such an act of treachery the conspirators circulated a story that these letters had been captured from washingtons mulatto boy near fort lee they were shown to be rank forgeries at the time the story was first circulated but this muckraker bache now reprinted them as being absolutely genuine i doubt whether we can find anywhere a more nefarious instance of bitter vindictive partisanship other opponents of washington reprinted the story and it spread so rapidly and was repeated so persistently that at the very end of his administration on the day of his retirement from the presidency washington felt compelled to write a denial of the genuineness of the forged letters and requested that this denial be placed among the archives of the department of state in order that future generations might not be deceived by the wicked designs of his enemies it is but proper that i quote a portion of that statement at this time at the time when these letters first appeared it was notorious to the army immediately under my command and particularly to the gentlemen attached to my person that my mulatto man billy had never been one moment in the power of the enemy it is also a fact that no part of my baggage or any of my attendants were captured during the whole course of the war these wellknown facts made it unnecessary during the war to call the public attention to the forgery by any express declaration of mine and a firm reliance on my fellowcitizens and the abundant proofs they gave me of their confidence in me rendered it alike unnecessary to take any formal notice of the revival of the imposition during my civil administration but as i can not know how soon a more serious event referring of course to the probability of his early death may succeed to that which will this day take place i have thought it a duty that i owed to myself to my country and to truth now to detail the circumstances above recited and to add my solemn declaration that the letters herein described are a base forgery xlv 240 and that i never saw or heard of them till they appeared in print thic present letter i commit to your care and desire it may be deposited in the office of the department of state as a testimony of the truth to the present generation and to posterity it almost passes belief that george washington the president of the united states should have felt himself constrained to place among the public records of his country in order that future muckrakers might not revive the stories this effective denial of the truth of assertions contained in the papers of his day and generation and oh what a pman of rejoicing arose from these muckrakers when our first president relinquished the reins of goverminent listen to this from the aurora lard now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace for mine eyes have seen thy salvation was the pious ejaculation of a man who beheld a flood of happiness rushing in upon mankind if ever there was a time which would justify the reiteration of that exclamation the time is now arrived for the man who is the source of all the misfortunes of our country is this day reduced to a level with his fellowcitizens and is no longer possessed of power to multiply evils upon the united states if ever there was a period for rejoicing this is the moment

legalize corruption a new era is now opening upon us a new era which promises much to the people for public measures must now stand upon their own merits and nefarious projects can no more be supported by a name when a retrospection is taken of the washington administration for eight years past it is a subject of the greatest astonishment that a single individual should have canceled the principles of republicanism in an enlightened people just emerged from the gf it of despotism and should have carried his designs against the public liberty so far as to have put in jeopardy its very existence such however are the facts and with these staring us in the face this day ought to be a jubilee id the united states and this from the new york daily gazette now should the people rejoice exceedingly and let their hearts be glad for now is the source of all misfortune brought down to the level of his fellowmen now will political iniquity cease to he legalized by a name herd is still

offense but on the 11th of march 1797 he was actually accused of murder in a letter of the vox populi sort which was published in the aurora of that date it is so vicious and so insidious that i am

prisoners but the welfare of the community at large it is for the purpose of protecting society that men are upon conviction of crime imprisoned and when we have convicted them when we have imprisoned them we should not permit a condition to arise that will permit these convicts to be an injury to the community at large the question of utilizing convict labor in my judgment will never be properly and satisfactorily settled until we create a condition in our prisons where we have the greatest possible diversity of labor men from all walks of life are convicted of crime and sent to prison and after they have been gathered from various walks of life their line of industry within the prison is centered in some one given channel the result of it is an undue competition in that one particular line of industry the method of solving the problem is to so thoroughly diversify labor within our prisons that it will not come in competition with any one line of free labor to any greater extent than it would if outside the prison walls in the case of the amendment now pending a proper diversity of labor could not be had when those within the naval prisons are required to labor upon certain lines of work solely upon the direction of an executive order the only work that they can compete in is in the work within that prison or jurisdiction of the navy department hence there is no possibility of diversity of labor in our naval prisons it has been said that the naval prisoners should be utilized for the purpose of reducing the expense of the government as a matter of economy if that argument is a correct economical argument the same thing would apply to every public building every public work that we engage in the proper method of getting cheap labor upon those works would be to enter into a conscription policy and compel the workers to go to work upon the public works at the actual cost of living in competition with free labor which is unjust it has also been said that these prisoners are different from other prisoners that they are not the ordinary convicts that you find in the prisons throughout the country that they are men who have been sent there as a means of enforcing discipline in the navy and that it is because of the various violations of that discipline that they have been imprisoned but that is true of every other class of convicts they are in prison because they have violated some law some rule or some regulation and they are placed there primarily not for the welfare of the prisoner but for the welfare of the service and if it becomes a question as between the welfare of the prisoners and the welfare of the public at large then the welfare of the public at large should be taken care of as against that of the prisoners there are other methods by which these men can be given exercise other methods by which they can be kept interested rather than by coming in competition with free labor they are kept interested on the ocean in the ships that they engage in by drills and things of that kind and it would be a great deal better for the community at large a great deal better for the public at large that they should be kept busy in that line than that their labor should be utilized for the purpose of depressing wages and making the condition of labor worse in the communities where those naval prisons exist then you have a condition such as exists in the neighborhood of naval prisons or any other large institution of like character you have a large number of men gathered from different parts of the country who are incarcerated there and they are working on special lines of labor directed by the secretary of the navy as the result of their working upon those special lines they are coming in contact with free labor in that vicinity they are required to work at carpenter work at painting at other skilled and semiskilled and common labor and in doing that they are not paid wages because their wages are cut off when they are in prison the only compensation that they get is the bare cost of their living the bare cost of clothing and of food performing that labor then under these conditions they naturally are able to undersell and undermine and undercut the wages of free labor and establish lower standards for the wages of free workmen than otherwise ought to obtain in my opinion this amendment offered by the gentleman from massachusetts is a good one and ought to be enacted into law we ought to require that when men enlist as seamen they shall perform the duties of seamen and not the duties of landsmen that when they violate the discipline required in the navy they shall be punished therefor but if we can not find them employment as such prisoners without infringing the rights prerogatives and privileges of free workmen without encroaching upon their rights so as to reduce their wages and make their condition worse then we ought to let them remain in prison without any occupation rather than injure the citizens of the ountry at large"], [0.00018683075904846191, 0.49981316924095154, 0, "i do not ask for a disposition of it now i simply desire to call the attention of the house to the resohltion"],
