tell at the moment whether it is accurate or not the gentlemans informant may be in error but i do know thisthat this kind of an argument has been made time and again and explained as often it is no doubt true thtit in order to introduce our products into new markets goods are often sold at a very low margin of profit or even at a loss to prevent this method of throwing the manufactured surplus of other nations at times of depression upon our market is one of the objects of a protective tariff every country that may for a time have a large surplus of some particular manufactured product prefers to send it to be sold at a sacrifice in some market in which their goods have not before been sold the effect is to give purchasers for a short time cheap goods and to derange prices so that the steady producer is driven from the field after which the prices rise again to a higher point than before whilst such incidents occur in our own export trade it is by no means true that it is a common thing for manufacturers in this country to sell goods abroad at a less price than at home patented articles may often thus be sold in countries where the patents have not been taken out or in which the patents may have expired i wish to request of the gentleman who has taken his seat after interrupting me that he will bring forward statements giving the names the facts circumstances and

be sold somewhere else he gives us figures on both sides of the rio grande i would be glad to have the names of the men who make the sales the merchants the exporters or the manufacturers that are thus making a discrimination i believe the gentleman will find that it is a mere matter of advertising and that its explanation will be covered by the statement that i made at the time i was

independence shall we depend upon australia for our wool and shiver if her ports are closed against us shall we depend upon england for iron and steel and buy our weapons of offense and defense from her or shall we solve the whole question by abandoning our rate of wages and level down to the european standard these are the problems that the democratic party has to face and they have something more serious yet to face they must meet a deceived people and account for the sacred trust of political power which was accorded them in november 1892 and how does the present bill meet these questions the certainty of its passage has paralyzed every industry and bankrupted thousands of happy and prosperous people the secretary of the treasury mr carlisle seems to be running the only prosperous industry in the manufacture and sale of 5 percents manufactured by the bureau and engraving and printing he is furnishing refuge for exiled capital but i imagine he is not quite proud of his new industry if he should attempt to convert any one now to the democratic party i think he would use the language of st paul before festus i would that all who hear me this day were both almost and altogether such as i amexcept these bonds we all feel sorry for the genial secretary of the treasury who begins to find that preaching democratic doctrines from the stump and on the floor of congress is a much easier task than the carrying out of the same principles in the united states treasury the administration came into power and found a prosperous people and a revenue ample to pay all current expenses of the government instead of permitting this condition of things to continue they at once commenced to convert a surplus into a deficit by deranging all the machinery of industry they now find that a revenue that may be raised with ease from a prosperous people is impossible of collection in times like the present having crippled the country by the proposed revenue tariff they find that it will not produce the revenue necessary to run the government the bill is an anomaly enough free trade is put into it so that republicans may blame all its errors on free trade it may have enough protection in it to condemn it and not enough to save it there is just enough protection in it to enable the free traders to charge its failure to protection it admits sawed planks free of duty and lays a protective duty on planed boards is it possible that the framers of the bill hold a grudge against the voters who sawed wood last november under this bill the consumer of raw material gets his material duty free but the manufactured goods are taxed manufactured material is an arbitrary title put upon any article upon which labor has been expended without any clear dividing line wool is

short haul and much of it the advantage of water transportation and the wilson bill proposes to relieve canada of all the burdens of which she complains it is true that cutting off of these revenues will require the issue of bonds to meet the current expenses of the government but canadians will not help to pay these bonds canada levies duties against even england herself what does canada want with reciprocity the wilson bill gives her all she wants and asks nothing in return the democratic majority in congress are kinder to canada than canada is to the mother country in all the various

talked to scholors and others who have studied them sufficiently to know that many of them are not seeking either citizenship an american life style or any of the other goals we sometimes assume of

unusually painful he was in the prime of life he had a pleasant home and was surrounded by a wife and children calculated to render life agreeable enough has already been said to indicate that mr shaw

of all who knew him he had those qualities of intellect and heart that always lead to success in life as a business man he was successful and he was the architect of his own fortune re was a man of

recognized that his popularity in this house was not confined ot his own party associates he was too well balanced and too just to he a bitter partisan he recognized the fact that political parties are essential to our government and that each citizen has a right to his political convictions unr shaw was essentially an american he was a liberal and highminded gentieman he had no prejudice

unbonnded and to him no good joke was spoiled because he was the subject of it he had the fine qualities which must necessarily combine in one man to make him the prince of good fellows wherever he went he was recognized as worthyto sit at the head of th e when companionship and entertainment ruled the hour he had good literary taste and loved to study the derivation of words to trace them through their changes in form and meaning and to note the historic and ethical facts which those transformations suggest w ne all remember with what earnestess he sought the floor to enter his personal and official protest against writing the name of his own loved cityin one word as had been proposed by the united states board on geographic names and had been done in some instances instead of expressing through its original form of an claire the beauty and sweetness which those who named it intended to imply his service an this house was brief but he had given ample proof of his capacity as a legislator and his ability to discuss with logic and power the buring issues of the day his speech on the tariff was a strong one full of earnest thought and patriotic purpose it bristled with argument fortified by statistics and the experience of history there was no doubt in his mind yet he was willing to consider any proposition or plan which others thought ofimportance the broad purpose of his legislative life is wel expressed by himself he said i do no for a moment forget that although elected asa republican lam here to represent my people regardless of party andl believe thait patriotism to countrytand loyalty o my ople demand that paisan advantage be sub ordin ed to consieratons o publc goom he did not quite reach the meridian of life yet he filled his brief

incense of a genial kindly life tir coushins those of the wisconsin delegation who are most familiar with the details and accomplist ent of the life of the late hon george b shawhave spoken well of them and i shall therefore follow my own inclination eimply record a brief tribute as a friend no word can add anything to the essential character of man but truthful tribute may not only cheer the hearts of those who loved him but may also emphasize those traits of character that are of lasting good to the community and of which this man had many in the first place he was a patriot reared in that loyal stimulating atmosphere of wisconsin which laid so many patriotic lives upon the altar of the union his ideas of his country were wide and worthy of it he thought of america not merely as a group of states but as a nationwith superior federal power he was therefore well grounded in that broad strong prinbiple which is so essential to a safe and wise legislator he appreciated likewise that magnanimous and truthful declaration of webster that whatever of merit or of enterprise should spring up or exist beyond the limit of ones own state is likewise a blessing and a benefit to the whole country no man can safely trust himself as a national lawmaker who has not come to a ful appreciation and sympathetic understanding of these two principles there is much more in them than is at first apparent they constitute the rock on which this nation has endured the greats trials and on which statesmanship can stand and hope to solve the lproblems of the future moreover this man was a sterling friend even without the injunction of longfellow keep thyself true to the sacred obligations of friendship he was naturally afriend heunderstood that word that gemof human language friendshipthat thought which winds and turns and runs through all the annals of the saxon tongue through the legends of the ancients through song and toil and battlefield through deedandthought and dream and understanding therefore did he appreciate such characters are usually wide and liberal therefore he had charity and could be safely differed with many were his attractions and accomplishments of mind goethe once said a chip burns becauseit has the right kind of stuff init georgeb shaw succeeded for the samo reason that a chip burnshe had the stuff he had amemorymostremarkable retaining anecdotes events and phrases which helped to make him most interesting and companionable he loved music and art and all those great and tender things that bring the sunlight into life and thattinge the shadows with soft color at the time of his death on the 27th of augnst i894 he had been building two edifices a most honorable reputation in his public career and a new home in eau claire where he had lived since childhood one was filled with the gratitude of the people of wisconsin the other with the love of wife and children with all of them we join in condolence and with profound respect and admiration he loved to live and loving life and honoring all he died such is the ultimate story of all true men 31r ellis of oregon 2r speaker i fullyrealize after hearing the eulogies which have already been pronounced that i can say but little as to the essential merits of the deceased but will content myself with a kindly tribute to his memory i well recollect sir during the closing hours of the last session of congress when our hearts were buoyant with the idea that we would soon return to our homes and meet those who were near and dear to us by the ties of nature and association when the news came over the wire that george b shaw of wisconsin was no more i remember at that time being in conversation with a number of the delegates of the supreme lodge of the knights of pythias of the world a body in connection with which the services of mr shaw have already been referred to on this occasion and recall how all of them were affected by the sad news thus received it was through the instrumentality of that order that i first became acquainted with mr shaw or knew anything of his life and character having been for years a member of the order and being familiar with his name as its supreme officer and associating him with the principles and purposes of that noble order which i love so dearly he was one of thefirst members whose acquaintance i made after becoming one of this body when i came to fully know the high ideal of the character of the man who stood at the head of that order and who had taken such great interest in its purposes and objects i realized that he in his life and character in every respect had lived up to the principles and teachings of that orderinits exemplification of true friendship george b shaw was a man with whom it was only necessary to become acquainted in order to be a steadfast friend there was a warmth of fiendship about him that to a western man like myself immediately gained my confidence and esteem and i felt at once as if i were in the presence of and in associatioil with an oldtime friend ihadi frequent occasion to discuss matters with him perfaining to the welfare of the order to which we both belonged and so much loved and i know the matters referred to by one of his colleagues today matters resting on his mind during the last few weeks of his life relative to the work which he had then in progress and the usefulness of that work such considerations being always uppermost in his mind and equaled only by his appreciation of the importance of the legislation then pending before the country iremember when lastisawhim little didlexpectthatl would stand upon this floor to pay a brief tribute to his memory little did i expect when he went forth buoyant with health that we should in a short time be called upon to honor his memory upon an occasion like this george b shaw was a man who as has already been said hated any hollow pretenses of mockery or veneering of things he was a man who could see and understand true manhood in its full sense no matter wherafound whether among the common waikf of life or in the higher councils of state he fully understood what it took to constitute true manhood and i think it has never been my fortune to meet a man who had such a full idea of what is meant by the true gentleman and true manhood certainly not to any greater degree than that possessed by our lamented friend and colleague it is not my purpose to enter into a discussion of his life and character that has already been well andfeelinglydone by those who are more familiar with them i only rise for the purpose of paying my brief mite as a tribute to his memory i realize and feel thatin the loss of him i have lost one of my best friends the state of wisconsin one of its ablest legislators this house a valuable member and the country aman who was a friend to all who needed to beheldup bythe strong arm of friendship may we all emulate the virtues thatsurroundedthelife of our departed friend and colleague and thus honor his memory 2a henderson of iowa as a member of the knights of pythias i will say a few words of brother shaw as a representative andmemberof that order perhaps if ihadanticipated the glowing tribute and the historic accuracy which have been devoted to that theme byhis able successor iwould not have thought of touching upon it q i wish that no secret oathbound association had ever been organized upon earth it would he more in keeping with my 6wn views if there were no brotherhood requiring any password but that of sterling character but as to this great pythian order i can say as a member of it that there is nothing in it which should alarm the state the church or the family it is purely an organization of affection i first knew george b shaw when as supreme chancellor of the world the highest office in the gift of that great order he visited my own city dubuque iowa to attend the meeting of the supreme lodge there i had not known him personally before although many of my neighbors had known him intimately for years i will only say touching that meeting that his wonderful presence that something which god has given to some men which nothing will describe a personality which attracts and draws and holds ones fellowmen so marked his relations to that assembly that when he left us he carried all our hearts with him he was a man who devoted a great deal of his time energies and talents to the workings of that order during the last few weeks of his life notwithstanding his other public cares he labored day and night preparing with a commission assembled here a revision of the constitutional work of the pythian order and i had frequent consultations with him on points that were disturbing his mind while a member of this body he secured federal legislation in the interest of that order when in his last illness he was scarcely able to work and when he went home to die he was devoting all of his talents and energies to the work it is proper to say here that he died working for the pythian order few men or brothers of my acquaintance understood better than did george b shaw the meaning of the cardinal principles of the pythian order he was constituted to understand its principles i am glad to say that after he came to this body i became his intimate friend stopping at the same hotel holding daily intercourse with him and getting to know him as i know but few here i can say that by nature he was gifted to understand the meaning of that great word jhriendship it was not with him atheory it was practice it was a part of his life his friends were near aud dear to him and in the assembling of the pythian knights wherever he met them his character and example permeated them with that wonderful quality of friendship few men hall more caution than george b shaw not th cau tion which makes cowards not the caution which makes men vacillate or hesitate but that caution which makes a man think slowly before he reaches settled convictions and makes him wise and prudent in expressing those convictions in the presence o his fellowmen he had bravery in an eminent degree not the bravery that may be found in the prize ring or even on the field of battle but that higher bravery which gives manly expression to convictions in the greater arena of life where mind meets in conffict with mind when george b shaw knew his duty he had the bravery to perform it i think no man in this country looked forward with sweeter or more glowing anticipation to the assembling of the grand lodge which met here last year he spoke of it often and urged some of us who thought we would have to go home on the adjournment before its meeting to stay and meet with our brothers in this city i was in the camp of the knights of pythias at the moment that the flag descended to halfmast on the dome of this capitol telling us that our brother had gone the flags over the encampment had just risen when the flag on this dome fell and there were many wet eyes in that encampmpent and the flags of the pythian brothers followed the example of the flag on this capitol he will never again meet us in our lodge room tender words i believe have been spoken of him or appreciative resolutions passed in every lodge room in the united states he has left us but he took with him a passport from the supreme power thatwill carry him to all that is good and beautiful and true beyond"], [0.9197266697883606, 0.9197266697883606, 0, "no he was a civilian and died about four years ago

against great britain has amounted to 14 000 000 000 by examining the statistics of that country you will find that that is twice as much as the value of all the lands in great britain which includes

according to the authority i have cited which was 12 000 000 000 i am speaking of the value of lands without houses so that if this was a real balance of trade against england it would have been a constant depletion of her wealth every year until after fortythree years of free trade she would have lost by this system according to the contention of gentlemen on the other side 14 000 000 000 in wealth which is more than twice as much as the assessed value of all the lands in the united kingdom now i insist that this difference was in favor of england that she was getting richer continually

upon wool has not benefited the woolgrowers east of the mississippi in the united states since it was put upon them because there are only about half as many sheep now in the united states as there were when the high tariff was invoked and this discussion has also exploded the theory of the balance of trade which protectionists are so accustomed to flaunt before the country as a justification of
