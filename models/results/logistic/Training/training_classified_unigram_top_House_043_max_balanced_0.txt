treasury within these eight years thaon was received from the foundation of the government down to july 1 1874 in view of these figures i ask this congress whether it is not high time thatwe should engage in the work of retrenchment and reform and cutting down our expenses furthermore the same report of the secretary of the treasury shows that on the 1st of july 1866 the debt of the united states was 2 773 236 173 69 thus we received into the treasury of the united states during those eight years the enormous sum of 700 000 000 more than the whole debt of the united states yet gentlemen tell us that we must still impose additional taxes upon the people of the united states it is further shown by the last report of the buroaunf statistics that our exports for last year were more than they have lien in any year since the foundation of the government yet we are told that we need more money that our treasury is not in as prosperous a condition as it should be on page 13 of the report

power by legislation to destroy vested rights nor to impair the obligation of contracts i know very well that the effect of the legaltender decisions was to subvert that doctrine and to declare that the power of congress in that case and perhaps generally to impair the obligation of contracts exists in all cases when not especially inhibited in the constitution if that was the effect of that decision then the firstthing in my judgment that the people of the united states should do should be to insist on so amending the constitution as to take away from congress any such power the people of no state in the union confers that power upon their legislature there is i believe no state in the union that does not limit its legislature in the exercise of their powers by providing in effect that they may not destroy nor impair vested rights the restrictions thus imposed by the people of the respective states upon their own legislatures are in addition to the general restriction contained in the constitution of the united states that no state should pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts that no such lhmitation upon the powers of congress was inserted in the fedoral constitution was because as it seemis to me every candid student of that subject nmst admit the framers of that constitution never supposed that the congress without express grant and by mre force of its choice of means to exercise the delegated powers would assume a power so destructive of the rights of persons and so at variance with the general natmre of our governments as well state as federal nevertheless the congress when it made treasury notes a legal tender did assume this extraordinary power and the judicial department of she governumnt has sustained it whetheras a genoral power or as on exceptional one existing only during the exigencies of ear may not be clear from the decision let uns hope the latter only but since this power has been recognized as existing in conpress i insist the constitution shall be so amended as to put the question at rest if it is a power not to be penitted to the state legislatures still less is it a power that should be permitted to the federal

the making and administration of the laws but may disrcgfrd vested rights and the sacred obligation of contracts such a government instead of being the best is likely to become the worst possible the gentleman from massachusetts insists that we ought not summarily to strike down the vested rights of even a railway company i agree to that but beyond that i insist as a general rule that congress ought to possess no power to disregaro or impair the obligation of contracts at all whether made between citizens and the government or between different citizens and that if this is not now clear the

invoked in the consideration of the present subject of discussion 7 if so then the dawn of a happier dayof peace prosperity and a genuine reunionis surely breaking upon the ameican people the power to pass this law it is asserted is to be found in the first section of the fourteenth article of amenuents to the constitution of the united states that section declares all persons born or naturalized in the united states and suhject to the jurisdic tien thereof are citizens of the united states and of the state wherein they reside no state shall make or enforce any law whichoahall abridge the

sought to b secured by this bill have always hitherto been regardei as subject to state legislation his section does not divest state authority but fixes a qualification to the exercise thereof the bill does not assume the states have violated that section or have failed to enforce its provisions but proceeds directly to divest them of all power and to prescribe penalties and to confer exclusive jurisdiction on the federal courts we are told that iii some of the states while the laws are ample the courts and juries are not disposed to execute them it is not pretended that this is true in all the states and yet all of them under this bill lose their power over the subjectmatter even downtrodden louisiana pinndered and ruled by her former slaves is told that this additional humiliation awaits her the american congress have by unconstitutional means forced a negro government upon them and yet we are told with all its machinery in their hands the negroes cannot protect their own rights the daring effrontery of this effort verifies the wisdom of the warning of mr madison and mr jefferson to the american people to gard against the dansger of usurpation hi the legislative department of the government for there lay the greatest danger of tyranny i know it has been said that if the section referred to gave no power save that of a negative upon the acts of the states there could be no legislation the constitution declares no state shall pass a law impairing the obligation ef contracts this is an individual right placed under the protection of the general government and in order to secure it conigress have l assed a law authorizing a writof cror to the supreme court wherever the right thus secured to the individual was drawn in question and all state laws impairing the obligations of a contract were void and yet no one has over doubted the right of a state to pass laws to enforce rights lelieving that it will meet the full issue with the bill i quotethe following paragraph and the opinion of the supreme court thereon tnor shall any state deny to anyprson within its jurisdiction the equal preteetie of the law4 iil the light of the history of the thirteentb fourteenth and fifteenth amendonts andthe pervading purpose of them which we hva already disctod it is not litlieult to give a mecani to this clause the existence of laws in the state where the newly emancipatei negroes resided which discriminated with gross iniustice mnd hardship against them as a class was the evil to be remedied by this clause and by it sneh laws are forbidden if however the states did not conform their laws to its requirement then by the fifth section of time fourteenth article of ainenliolet congress was authorized to enfore it by suitable legislation we doubt very uinch whether any action of a state not directed against the negroes as a elass oir on account of tiir race will ever ie held to come within the purview of this provision in the early history of ie formation of the government its statesmen seem to have divided on fite line which should separate the powers of the national government from those of the stat governments and though this line has novel been very well defined in public opinioi snch a division has continued from that day to this when the civil war irot o out it was then discovered the tu danger to the perpetuity of the

states are prohibited by the constitution from extending protection this being entirely and necessarily delegated to the general government whereas they may and ought to do so as between their own citizens again lie says he wants this law to prohibit a negro from being pitched out of a ear in cases where it is difficult to tell in what state the wrong was perpetrated if lee is serious in this i imagine that when thrown off the negro could as easily ascertain his whereabouts as he could find a federal court as to any difficulty from one state having no law and another having it to protect their rights i assert that in all of thela they have the same law as the whites again sir how is it to be expected that if juries will not convict in state courts they will be more virtuous in federal courts is the manner of selecting jurors to be so devised as to secure men in sympathy with these prosecutions i in my own state the jurors in the federal court are selected so that they are comprised of persons preeminently ignorant and prejudiced against the white people thereof a fair trial is despaired of by a white man if his controversy is with a negro in the name of christianity of civilization of liberty and law by the memories of the struggle of 1776 and the better days of the republic by the consciousemss that a common destiny awaits i all i urge you not to permit sectional feeling to prompt so great a crime and now i invite attention to the situation in my own city of the two races in connection with the subjects of present legislation which fairly illustrates my state the negroes have their own inns and neither seek nor desire entertainnment at those resorted to by the whites they have the same cemetery with the whites divided between the races and each portin eared for alike they have raiiroad facilities comfortable and satisfactory they have tasteful aed substantial churches erected largely by the contributions of generous white men and which are to them a source of pride they resort freely to places of public amusement and have assigned them comfortable seats they have equal educational facilities both as to schoolhouses and teachers with the whites and could this house know how fully they are provided for in this respect it would compel their warmest commendation often times they outnumber the whites in the jurybox i do not mean to say they are in the jurybox in all counties but do say that in niny counties not onefourth of the white voters have their names placed in it a kindly feeling exists between the races labor which had been demoralizcd by political excitement is beconing profitable to laborer find employer and mutual confidence and goodwill is in process of perfect restoration let our people alone and liberty wealth and hanuony will spring forth in young and vigorous life and commend the wisdom of your conduct but sir we are told the government owes it to the colored people that this bill shall pass there are it the southern states two races as distinct in their social feelings and prejudices as in color these have a natural force beyond the control of human law the sooner they are recognized by our rulers tie better for both races and the conutry force the negro into the common schools where the white children go and the whites will withdraw tse cominon schools will be abandoued and the only hope for the moral and intellectual elevation of the negro will sink below the horizon forever forcethem into public inns and the proprietor must sbmit to your prosecutions or abatdon his calling for the whitcs will not remain in such association piublic inconvenience follows but nothingt for the public good conimon carriers will be more or less aficcte by it what will be the result as to churches cemeteries and public amusements i cannot exactly delineate an unkind and ungenerous feeling will permeate all intercourse between the two races the deplorable consequences socially politically materially cannot be overstated this government cannot lay well these foundations for social equality the sovereignty of the states may be overthrown the pride of the people may be mocked their property may be swept away ernel imprisonment may afflict them the power of the government may be turned in fearful vengeance upon them but there is a law of the creator that for a time may cease to operate but can never become obsolete that governs this qtestion i assert sir that there is a disposition on the part of the whites to give the negro equal rights whatever inequality of public accommodations there may be is simply the result of an indisposition to social intercourse but this even is not to be found in their laws or their courts sir the whites naturally view this as an attempt at uiltimate amalga tation this necessarily involves their degradation a mean alliance always begets a progeny below the level of the better parent if this is inot trite why when equal facilities for mental improvement

people never complain of misrule without a reasonablo cause for such complaint they are interested in having stable wholesome just government honestly and faithfully administered and when they have this they are quiet prosperous and happy the people are never agitators without a cause both reason and experience attest the trath of these declarations that the people of the south of every class and condition have complained for years past of misrule that the grounds of their complaints have been of tic most grievous charactortoo grievous to be borne in patiescecanuot be denied by ally candid person acquainted with the facts and the history of that sectio of the union for the last ten years that their wrongs for the most part and in most material respeets ha ve gone and still continue to go imredressed is painfully true they have repeatedly and constantly appealed in vain to the federal and local authorities for relief their appeals have been slighted and rejected and insult and outrage have been added to injury their inportunities have bcit laaghed at and their calamities mocked at until in many sections they are hopeless and desperate and court any fate other than that to which they are abandoned those whose duty it has been by every obligation of the constitution and laws by every consideration of right justice patriotisu and sosnl policy to grant relief and reestablish time union ill law and as well in the hearts of that people have made their calamities and wrongs the football of political parties and have used the same to subserve the base cuds of party and faction that people have not only been thus injured but men in high official station and the leaders of a great political party in abuse of the freedom ofspeech have falsely aud cruelly denounced them as semibarbarous gi yen to critne and not fit to enjoy the blessings of free government these puissant gonilimetn forgetful of their high duties instead of consulting true statesmanslip have turned loose the violent passions of tlmir natures and poured out their wrath upon their downtrodden and helpless countrymen evet they cannot long enjoy pleasnre ill so eaipty a triumph humanity turns from them in disgust under such circnmstaces how natural that the people of the south should be indignant and restive however helpless how unnattral that they should love and respect the hand and the party that thus smites insults and injures them they io longer hope for redress of their wrongs from those in official place and power the reptblican ptrty has failed miserably failed to bring peace prosperity and a restored union to the american people but ot the contrary it has sown the seeds of discord and brought untold woes and sufferings to the people of the south though it has borne absolute sway continuously for fourteen years its statesmanship has proven a failure it has ignored and subverted the constitution and substituted for that sacred instrument as the basis of its revolutionary action the higher lawr w~ith this limitless chart it has gone wherever interest or ambition led it the only limit to its action when determined upon is the measure of its physical power its essential power has been and is armed force it has accomplished all its ends by revolutionary means and war it knows no policy of peace and hence now that the war is over and peace has indeed dawned upon the country its policy has not changed it talces no note of this important fact it still relies everywhere mainly on the army to execute its will the southern people no longer confide in the republican party they do not hope for relief from it on the contrary judging the future by the past they have fearful anticipations of increased injuries ad wrongs at its hands that people now appeal with conidence to the candid judgment and sympathy of the american people for that reasonable measure of relief that redress of flagrant intolerable wrong which they have heretofore failed to realize they ask for peace prosperity and a restored and perpetual union under the constitation of a common country they cannot they will not appeal in vain to this grand tribunal the thirty millions of freemen of the north surely will never consent to see twelve millions of their southern fellowcountrymen doomed to protracted outrage and anarchy simply to swell the triumphs of a political party they cannot afford in view of their own interests to see the south ruled by a military despotism and a standing army of many thousands kept there to enforce the lawless will of a political party and thus exchange our system of government for one of absolute powers they cannot allow this but let them remember that usurpation in the south today and for a long while in the past becomes a precedent and a strong foothold and may nay will one day if not arrested establish organized tyranny in all america at the close of the late war the republican party had complete control and charge of the government it was therefore charged by the constitution and the american people to restore the union to establishit upon enduring foundations to reclaim the southern peoplo and enablethem again to share freely in the benefits and blessings of national and local government under that system framed by the founders of the republic these were its high duties and a noble field of patriotic labors lay spread out before it but this party has proven faithless to this imposing trust through a period of ten years a train of unparalleled crimes and abuses have marked its career it has utterly failed in the grand work of restering the union upon that basis of peace aid goodwill contemplated by the constitution and so cessetial to it on the contrary reconstruction has been based npon force and the sword and the policy invoked has been one of absolute power it has not given the southern people peaceful and wholesome government nor has it pursued such a course as has been calculated to reclaim the affections of the people so far from this it would seem that it has exhausted its ability in devising ways and means to injure insult and provoke to wrath and violence that people and in some localities it has brought about a state of anarchy and public despair it has not only thus failed in the reconstruction of the union but its practices of fraud peculation and unparalleled extravagancee are without a precedent in the history of this or any country for the truth of these declarations i appeal to the observations of disinterested men for the last fourteen years and the history of this party the groundwork of all this public evil is this the republican party especially for the last ten years has looked to and worked for its continued aseendeny and the aggrandizement of many of its leaders more than the public weal an analysis of its workings will show the justice of this remark especially will this appear from an examination of its policy and practices in the southern states and now the legitimate result is about to transpire notwithstanding the stronghold this party hact on the popular confidence in connection with the late war the people of the whole country have at length taken cognizance of its abuses and dangerous tendencies and have rebuked it in a most significant manner many of its ablest leaders have abandoned it and others indicate a purpose to do so its condition is one that alarms its friends profoundly thi proud and arrogant party see that the scepter of power is about to depart from it and hence it must devise means of relief or all will be lost in the past and especially since the year 1868 one of the chief sources of strength and success of this party has been the false impression assiduously made by it upon the minds of the great body of the northern people that the white people of the south have ever since the close of the late war been hostile to the union desired and intended its overthrow that they are the enemies of the negro race and intend its extermination in this country and never intend that tie thirteenth fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the constitution shall be operative its misrule in that section of the union as the whole country knows has been intolerable it has long been the shameful scandal not only there but of the whole nation this and its revolutionary policy have stimnlated and produced disorders there that have in some instances and in several localities resuited in disgraceful and atrocious crimes partaking more or less of a political character in some cases it has been the direct cause of such disturbances and erimesgenerally it has been the indirect but the moving cause of them colored people have been taught to believe that the white people arce their deadly enemies and by false teachings and trainings they have in too many and lamentable instances been led to attack the white people in their persons or property under circumstances of great provocation and the white people so attacked have taken redress by violent means and thus perpetrated crimes shocking to humanity i undertake to say that in 90 per cent of all cases like those just mentioned the colored people have been the irst aggressors moved by the causes and incitements suggested that percentage of all the cases referred to in this debate began in that way i challenge successful contradiction let the facts in the cases cited be fairly ascertained and the truth of what i say will be made manifest unhappily generally the infamous and fiendish authors of these crimes and disorders manage to escape unhut this condition of tlhings has for years past been mnide the basis for the false republican cry of a conflict of races continued hostility to the union and a new rebellion in the south too long a majority of the people of the north have heard and believed this false and scandalous party clamor too long they have allowed themselves to believe that the republican party is aud has been the only union party in the country acid that especially the people of the south who would not indorso its policy and practices there were and are unfriendly to the union and the negro race so believing they hive sustained that party long aftr it had accotplished its mission and ought to have been dissolved as a political organization 1 have the strongest conviction that but for the crimes and disorders in the southern slates produced by reltublican misrule in the way indicated that party would have ceased in 1870 to control the country it ceased to be a party of principle before that time since that time its lifeblood has been official patronage and false clamor spread by it throughout the country as to the character and purposes of the southern people in reference to the federal government and the negro race by its policy and practices this party falsely taught the freed people to believe that the white people in the south were their enemies and thus were able to organize them solidly against them in everything political this teaching was unqualifiedly false and as pernicious as false the white people there were sot in fact hostile to the negroes on the contrary naturally the two races were friends they had a common interest the negro needed the protection and help aud encouragement which the white people there alone could extend and on the other hand the white people needed tholabor of the negroes their interests were common and there was no good reason why the great masses of both races should not entertain like political views there was indeed no reason and there would have been no difficulty but for the interested efforts of political demagogues and adventurers touse the negro vote for the purpose of promoting their own fortunes and placing them iu office often for dishonest purposes and for the further purpose of giving the repihtlican party of the nation the benefit of a million of negro votes butt for the desire to give this party ascendency in the southern states and the pirty of the tation the negro vote years ago the troubles in the south bad been settled the peace prosperity and hopes of the south the best interests of the union have been sacrificed cruelly sacrificted to prolong the ascendency of a political party this party have persistently taught the northern people to believe that the suitheru people as a mass have been and are hostile to the union this is likewise false the southern people are not hostile to the union they have no motive impelling them to be hostile to it on the contrary they have high and controlling considerations leading them to love support and maintain it they never were hostile to the union as a form of government the causes which led to the late war were nol such as affected the system of government i repeat the policy and practices of this party have not looked mainly to the restoration of the union aid the southern people to its blessings and stable wholesome just local state government it has looked mainly to its own continued ascendencyin the goveremeat of the union and the several states to this end it has ignored and perverted the constitution whenever it stood in its way and it has not hesitated to usurp any power or overthrow state governments in the south to accomplish its purposes its revolitimiry course of action has justly alarmed the public mind its misrule in the south and the misrepresentations of the southern people have at length arrested public attention everywhere throughout the union as a consequence the late elections indicate the complete overthrow of this party the most revolutionary this country has ever seen the commonest observer sees it tottering to its fall and extinction lit legitimate work was done several years ago now it has lost its hold on il blic confidesteeit is dying dying in disgracei if it saved the life of the union during the late civil war since its close it has wellnigh stifled its existence by a misrule and extravagance without a parallel if it had its day of merited glory that glory has been dinsted and blackened by the multitude and enormity of its crimes lf it made free five millions of slaves as a result of the war it has sought proct cally to enslave eight millions of white people by subjecting them to humiliation without a precedent in history despoiling them of their property and establishing over them a practical military despotism t and a political surveillance which contravenes every principle of free government but its votaries have resolved to make one more struggle to prop up and stay its sinking fortunes as in the past so now they seek to make disorders in the southern states serve their purpose they have made tbe disorders there they are responsible for them they are the legitimate fruits of their misrule and party practices they have overturned state governments and established military despotisms in their stead they have provoked and goaded the people to desperation and despair as a resultin some instances shocking and atrocious crimes have been perpetrated public complaint is loud and imploring for relief again this party seeks to mislead and deceive the northern people into its support again it endeavors to produce the impression that there is a war of races imminbnt in the south that the people there are hostile to the uiion and intend its overthrow that there is a new rebellion and particularly that the southern white people never in tend to allow the thirteenth fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the constitution to operate this is its plain purpose its only hope of again bringingthe northern people to its support it has gone about its work in earnest its great men and little men join actively and anxiously in this patriotic work can it again succeed i hope not i trust not i trust that the american people now understand the condition of the southern people too well to be again deceived by such cruel and unpatriotic political practices the peace and prosperity of the south the complete restoration of the union and harmony among the american people is worth more tsan this expiring party let it die let it disappear let its deeds of glory if it had any and its deeds of blood and crime pass into history but its friends arc not willing to see it thus pass away i regret and deplore more than i have language to express a manifestly concerted effort in and out of coness to revive and reopen malignant controversies of the past which have resulted so disastrously to the southern states of the republic and the unhappy and persecuted people who inhabit them daily we hear the people of the south misrepresented and denounced in unmeasured and often insulting terms anarchy prevails in louisiana and elsewhere and shocking crimes of a semipolitical character have been perpetrated all the essential fruits of republican misrule and unlawful efforts to retain political power in the hands of that party there these evils are held up to the country and the world as indubitable evidence of a lawless warlike and rebellious spirit on the part of the white people of the south the crimes so perpetrated are exaggerated in number and often in kind and degree and all painted in the darkest colors and garbled aid ex parte accounts are given of them without even the slightest reference to the facts of their origin or any circumstances of provocation or excuse connected with them these denunciations and misrepresentations are reiterated by most of the republican press throughout the country thus it is and by such means again proposed to rouse the northern mind against the south in the support of this party is it notplain that such a course of political conduct is unfair and unjust to the people so assailed and the whole country is it not as plain that it is done for some sinister purpose is it not manifest that it is done to save the sinking fortunes of a political party is it not as manifest that military despotism and anarchy are to be prolonged indefinitely in the southern st tes so that this party may continuo its arbitrary sway is it not plain to be seen by anybody that the purpose is that this party shall live though the country die a disinterested examination of the reconstruction acts and particularly the manner of their execution will show the striking truth of all i have said the reconstruction history of every state in the south shows a studied fixed effort of the republican party to maintain its own ascendency there at whatever cost or hazard but this occasion will not afford sufficient opportunity to bring even a considerable number of its revolutionary and despotic deeds and practices to bear upon this debate 1 shall confine myself mainly and partienlarly to its concerted and persistent acts of despotism and fraud in the state of louisiana for the last three years the reconstruction acts were passed by a congress overwhelmingly republican they contained grossly proscriptive features as i shall have occasion to show they were executed in louisiana as elsewhere under the supervision of a military officer and it may be truly said tsat the elections held in pursuance of them were held under and by direction of the sword the effect was to give th republican party the control of every convention to frame a constitution in every state in the south under these acts this was so in louisiana there that party had absolute control of the convention the constitution provided by it and the laws enacted under that constitution show clearly a studied purpose to continue that party in power in that state indefinitely one leading feature of them as the concentration of power in the hands of the executive of the state and those whom he might choose to appoint to office and place he had virtual control of the elections of the state if be chose to exercise the power and the most abundant means were provided for the successfill perpetration of frauds in the elections all tis as will be seen was done in the interests of that political party the first state officers and legislature under this constitution were republican their misrule has scarcely a parallel in the history of civilized government except in other southern states the officeholders quarreled about the offices spoils and the opportunity to rob and plunder the people and the state and what happened as a consequence at the election there in the year 1872 1 will have occasion to refer to in another part of my remarks in view of what i am about to say it is material here to cite certain provisions of the constitution of louisiana art 15 the legislative power of the state shall be vested in two distinct branches the one to be styleds the house of mepresentatives the other the senate and both the general assembly of tme state of tonisiana aot 16 the esobers of the house of representatives shall continue in office for two years from the day of the closing of the general elections art 17 representatives shall be chosen on the first mondayinnovemberevery two years aid the election shall be complcted in one day the general assembly shalt meet annually on the first monday in january unless a dilibront day be appointed by law and their sessions shall ie held at the scat of government at 33 not less than a majority of the members of each house of the general assembly shall form a quorum to transact business but a smaller number may adjorn from day to day and shall have full power to compel the attendance of absent members art 34 each isuse of the general assembly shall judge of the qualifications election ail returns of its members but a contested election shall be detorminiad in such manner as may be preseribed by law accordingly on the first monday in november 1874 an election was held in that state for members of the house of representatives and onehalf of the senators the house consisted of one hundred and eleven members and the senate of thirtysix senators at that election the commissioners to hold the election at the several votingplaces received the votes and counted them then after they so cosnted them supervisors of the parish in which they were so cast compiled the vote and ascertained the result in the parish the vote thus taken showed a majority in the house of representatives of twentynino democrats about this there can be no question these officers so ascertained and the fact was so proclaimed at the time through the newspapers of that state and the couniry generally besides a subcommittee of congressrecently examined into the fact so ascertained and reported they say the returns by the comnissioners of election compiled and forwarded by the suporvisors of registration gave the consorvatives a niajsrityaf twentynle loen bers out of a total of one hundred and eleven members in only a few instances were there any protests accompanying the returns under the election law the returns were sent to the retmnitig board which assembled at the capitol of the state this board consisted of five persons and the law directed that they should be selected from all political parties but in fact the board in question was composed entirely of republicans until one resigned when a conservative took his place the statute prescribed the duty of this board they were required to compile the vote of the state for all officers their simple duty was to compile the vote of the state except in one other case and that was this if a commissioner or supervisor of elections should send to them with the returns a full statement sworn by him and this statement sustained by that of three respectable citizens electors of the parish also sworn that any riot tumult acts of violence intimidation disturbance or corrupt influence had materially affected the result of the elections then and in that case only if such board should be satisfied of such statement they might refuse to count the votes of the place of voting so questioned and exclude it from the returns they by the statute could only in such cases reject returns but theyhad no power to decide upon the right of anybody they had no right to say that one claiming a majority was not elected nor ot the other hand to decide that one appearing to have a minority was elected they had no power to try the right in a contested case and decide the same for one party or another this is so in the first place because the statute creating the board did not undertake to con for any such power it is not conferred by terms or implicationindeed the statute makes reference in terms to cases of contest according to law in the second place if the legislature had undertaken to confer such power it could not do so because the constitution provides in these words art 34 fach house of the general assembly shall judge of the qualifications election and returns of its members but a contested electcon shall he determined in such nmncer as may be proscribed by law now this plainly means that the legislature may provide by statute for contested cases before its branches respectively else the main provision of this article that each house of the general assembly shall judge of the qualifications election and return of its members would be nugatory and inoperative charged with such powers and none others this returning board began its labors and continued them for nearly two months notwithstanding the returns as made up by the commissioners who held the elections and counted the votes and the returns from the parishes as compiled and counted by the supervisors and these showed in the state a majority in the lower branch of the legislature of twentynine for the democrats this board decided without any sanction of law in many eases when democrats were elected as the returns showed that republicans were elected this they had no authority in any case to do for the reasons stated they did this in several cases where there was not any suggestion of riot or disturbance as required by law for example in rapides parish the returns showed that three conservatives were elected there was no exception to the election at all much less such as the law required in case of riot or other disturbing cause to authorize the rejection of the returns on the contrary the united states supervisors swore that the clottion was in all respects full fair and free nevertheless in this case the board returned three republicans as elected the law further requiredthis board to file oie copy of the returns as made up hy them in the office of the secretary of state when they had completed their work the returns so filed showed that only fiftytwo democrats and fiftyfour republicans were elected in the cases of five members of the house of representatives they made no returns at all but referred this matter to the legislature in these five cases the returns of the commissioners and supervisors of election showed that conservatives were elected in each and there was no suggestion as the statute allowed of fraud or other thing which impaired the election in short there was io cause that in any way vitiated the election nor was any suggestedat all events any of which the board could take cognizance there was nothing that could authorize them to reject these five members these with the count they had made gave the democrats in the house fiftyeight members and the republicans fiftythree teimbers seeing this inevitably gave the democrats a majority of five they resorted to the subterfuge of referring these five cases to the legislature it is reasonable to infer that there was a motive for this action and this will soon be seen these thets must satisfy any reasonable person that this board or a majority of thum were dishonest and corrupt tle conservative who became a member of it resigned in disgust but the corrupt character of this board appears in another and a strong light a subeomcitntee of the house of representatives consisting of three gentlemen of high character for truth and honortwo republicans and one democratwent recently to louisiana charged to inquire among other things about the doings of this board tihey made a searching examination and they say of it in summing up their conclusions as follows without now referring to other instances we ore constrained to declare that the action of tho returning beard oa the whole was arbitrary unjust and in our opinion illaal anti that this arbitrary unjust anti illegal action alone prevented the return wy the beard of a majority of conservative members of the lower house its conduct was so flagrantly illegal and dishonest that i believe no one has yet ventured to offer a word of apology for it now are the live conservatives thus elected and so ascertained to be elected members of the lower branch of the legislature notwithstanding the returning board refused to return them they are and for three plain reasons first the essence of the election is thai according to law some person received a majority of the votes east in the parish and that this fact be ascertained by sonie lawful authority this is the material andsubstantial feature of the election the ba ance is matter of form and evidence then in these five cases each person claiming did receive a majority of the votes cast in the parish where he was a candidate and thisfact was ascertained by the commissioners who held the election and were charged to count the votes and also by the supervisor who was charged by the law to compile and count the vote in the parish thus they received a majority of the votes and this fact was ascertained by lawful and competent authorities they were therefore to all intents and purposes memberselect of the legislature but it is said the returning board did not return them as so elected as the statute requires this i admit but this is not essential they have only the duty to recompile the vote in the third degree after the vote was polled this is not material it is only an evidence or additional evidence that the person did receive a majority of the votes cast this is not the only evidence much less is it exclusive evidence there was no statement under the statute in any one of these cases that authorized the board to reject the returns showing these five or any one of them to have been elected i say so because the fact is so and besides if there had been such statement then they must have rejected the return as the law directs in such cases but they did not reject the returns they referred them to the legislature this they had no power to do the statute gave them no power to refer cases to the legislature secondly there was an election and return in each of the five cases referred to and there was no statement under oath as required by the law to raise the jurisdiction of the board which would enable them to reject the returns to them will any one pretend that the board could arbitrarily reject returns showiog an election surely not that is too absurd and it is as unreasonable to say that one was not elected because the board refused to do their office but thirdly this returning board cannot in any case have powor to reject returns because of violence or other cause assigned in the statute creating the board as impairing the election thisis so because this provision of the statute contravenes the constitution and makes the returning board judges of the election of members of the legislature if they only exercise the power which the statute confers they can decide that there was no election and reject the returns th is the constitution forbids it providesact 34 each house of the general assembly shall judge of the qualifications election and returns of its imnebers buta contested election shall be determined in such manner as may be prescribed by jaw then it follows that these five members whose ehction the returning board would not return but undertook to refer to the legislature were duly elected and in all respects members of the lower branch of that body and so there were fiftyeight democrats cud fiftythree republican members of the house of representatives iips was there any
