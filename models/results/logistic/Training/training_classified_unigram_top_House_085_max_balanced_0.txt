waging warfare at hiroshima and nagasaki all of the military and the entire world learned of this new force of tremendous military importance the natural and inevitable consequence has been that greater and ever greater emphasis is being placed on atomic weapons by all major powers the hydrogen bomb has only served to accentuate this revolution in concepts of warfare brought about by nuclear weapons with progressively greater emphasis being placed on atomic weapons there has been a relatively lessening of our effort to develop and expand the conventional methods of warfare this too is natural and understandable because each dollar of defense expenditure for nuclear weapons produces a military posture millions of times more forcible than if that expenditure were for conventional weapons all this has transpired under the plans and program of our professional military establishment the time has come i think for those having civilian responsibility in the military field to give a close but objective examination of the political implications of our increasing reliance upon an atomic arsenal in our examination we must consider not only our own national security but also the preservation of international stability throughout the world no doubt considerable thought has been given by some in the military department to these political implications but there appears to be no evidence of their having reached any conclusion in fact some charge that on the contrary there appears to be considerable confusion of thought on the relation of atomic weapons and international politics within the military establishment i have undertaken this discussion today to attempt some clarification of this confusion within the last 6 months a great change has occurred in power relationships of the world after hiroshima there was no doubt in the mind of any person even the soviets that the united states held unquestioned and exclusive nuclear superiority this nuclear capability was the shield which seemed to have slowed if not halted the expansion of russia immediately after world war ii and which has been the strong defense of the free world since that time today with the advent of apparent russian deliverable nuclear weapons and delivery capability the shield is beginning to tarnish and we can no longer continue to rely completely with safety upon it this great change carries portentous meaning for us and for the free world we and the world have not realized nor have we thought through the full implications of this change today all of us are nervously seeking an answer it is this nervousness and uncertainty pervading both our military and our national life that is creating the nuclear military confusion and resultant lack of welldefined military purpose the soviets have a nuclear capability this we know but we do not know the extent of that nuclear weapons capability we have only the evidence of their detected atomic tests however there are other factors which can tell much of u s s r nuclear progress the international conference on atomic energy at geneva in 1955 showed surprising advances by the soviets in other than military uses of atomic energy testimony before committees of the congress indicates an increasing capability by the soviets to deliver weapons either by aircraft or guided and ballistic missiles these help our assessment but still none of us can determine with certainty the balance between the two great nuclear powers this in itself is not necessarily bad the very fact of uncertainty restrains both nations from attacking each other for reasons of selfinterest if not for moral considerations and so long as both sides continue to believe that either can destroy the other no matter which strikes first there is a nuclear stalemate so far as a major war is concerned thus appears the world situation today what could bring nuclear war i believe that neither side is likely to initiate a major war until and unless it believes in desperation that its national security is at stake and national security is automatically at stake when either strikes first since there is no reliable assurance that retaliation will not be unacceptably destructive look at the situation from the russian viewpoint to the russian politburo what objective is worth the possible or probable loss of 50 or 100 or 150 million russian lives in return for similar numbers of american casualties and the probable destruction of the cities and industries of both nations conversely what conceivable circumstances would persuade the president who alone under the law has authority to determine when to use nuclear weapons to push the button which might bring similar consequences of retaliation upon american people and cities in my view there are very very few such circumstances and very few conditions wherein either country would regard the threat adequate to justify the use of nuclear weapons certainly korea was not of such importance probably stability in the middle east is not sufficient to justify a nuclear attack on the homeland of the enemy in fact it is doubtful that even stability in europe is of such importance i categorically believe that no president would initiate an atomic assault on the soviets or even that the soviets would initiate an attack on us each knowing that such a big step would be the open invitation to national ruination thus nuclear weapons have apparently reversed a trend of the last century in which limited or small wars have tended to grow into big ones undoubtedly there will continue to be small or limited wars in various parts of the world but because of this atomic weapons stalemate these are most unlikely to ever develop into a major war two conclusions can be drawn from this thinking first there is little chance that opposition to aggression in any part of the world would lead either russia or the united states to initiate an allout war no matter what weapons have been used in resisting that aggression second nuclear weapons may be used in small and limited military engagements without those same weapons being applied to an allout war thus we must strike a balance in our national military posture on one hand we must retain this nuclear stalemate to lose it would mean our probable destruction or eventual reduction to impotence by threat from the soviets on the other hand we must be prepared for the small war while deterring the big one if we can maintain this nuclear stalemate the soviets must pursue the only course remaining to them in their announced goal of world conquest it is the one in which they have proved skillful in the pastlimited aggression in various areas of the world where open aggression is deemed more profitable than their usual methods of infiltration subversion and clandestine operation to meet this situation we need capability for both all out and limited military action capability involving the strategic air command missiles submarines fast seaplanes with atomic weapons or any other future tools of warfare all these are essential for our survival and we must have them but to maintain such capability is difficult and costly particularly as we stagger under a defense burden of approximately 40 billion annually as the cost of armaments increases there inevitably will be pressure to fight the easy and cheapest way this reaction is likely to reduce conventional forces and place ever greater emphasis on atomic weapons for all aggression either limited or major it is this very significant and understandable trend which creates our militarypolitical nervousness and which must be resolved what then will be our military requirements if we are to continue our role of defender of the free world and resist by military action the open aggression which might occur in the world we will need flexible discriminating weapons which can be applied to military objectives without unintended effects upon nearby civil populations or free forces not only do we need the weapons but we must have the determination to use these weapons wherever appropriate to have these tools and the determination to use them we must take appropriate action now it is my purpose to point out what i believe this action should be conventional forces are essential for there are many instances in which atomic weapons no matter how flexible small or clean will not be suitable for example operations in which enemy concentrations either of facilities or men cannot be formed or found would make the use of any atomic weapon both extravagant and useless conventional weapons would be adequate we then require forces with dual capability in either conventional or atomic weapons as conditions may dictate but all forces cannot have this dual capability for many years to come because of the great costs what is needed is a gradual buildup and development of a flexible atomic capability thereby we can build slowly and rationally upon our knowledge of conventional weapons so that we will have both the understanding and the capability of using the right weapons in each situation in reaching a decision with regard to the increasing of our atomic capability to meet any unforeseen situation it is important for us to give some consideration to the widespread belief throughout the world that the atomic weapon is wanton indiscriminate and inhumane it is generally believed to be a horror weapon whose effects cannot be controlled and the use of which may result in the death of thousands or millions of local civil population including even neutral or friendly forces because of this general conception there is a corresponding prevailing opinion that the use of any nuclear weapon of any kind at any place would inevitably lead to an allout war because of its wantonness this may or may not be true depending upon the size and nature of the weapon used in relation to the location size and nature of the target more fuel has been added to this conception through the belief that atomic bursts spew out atomic radiationfalloutashes of death which may be carried to the four corners of the world bringing disease death and destruction i think it most significant that russia has constantly fed these flames of misconception regarding the ruthlessness of atomic weapons since russia has a distinct manpower edge over the west it is to her advantage to create a climate of fear of all nuclear weapons because thereby she would be free to pursue her usual methods of local aggression and fully put to use her vast superiority of manpower it is small wonder that she has sought from the beginning to ban the atomic weapons which have so far held her in check and which are so essential to the free worlds resistance to russias expansion in the area of weapons tests russia would like nothing better than to limit our atomic capability either by agreement or by suspension of these tests she has been astonishingly successful in this campaign of deceit and propaganda and if this campaign to outlaw nuclear tests and weapons were successfully continued without effective resistance we might as well throw away our nuclear capability for resisting local aggressions because the public even including our own would not permit the use of atomic weapons until convinced that the issue is worth the price of probable national suicide few issues will ever be that important particularly when the issues are so difficult to resolve thus we face a situation where we could be forced to inevitably retreat bit by bit until there is nothing left for us to defend to preclude our being backed away from the source of our military strength and protection we need two things above all else first an aggressive and determined program to perfect clean weapons which will release a minimum if any radioactive fallout this means without reservation that there must be no suspension or termination of atomic tests until the program of cleanup is completed i must confess that during the past several months a continuance of weapons tests without restraint or demonstrable humanitarian purpose has been more and more difficult to defend and therefore a matter of grave concern to me although the joint committee has been aware of considerable progress in the direction of making cleaner weapons it was not until quite recently that the great success of these efforts was made known we now have the unhesitating concurrence of all the most competent scientists engaged in the nuclear weapons program that their efforts could eliminate nearly 100 percent of the fallout radiation teller lawrence graves bradbury york and mills all seem to agree this being so and certainly none of us have any basis on which to dispute the judgment of these scientists we have but one course to follow all humanity decency and conscience demand that the tests continue until the weapons can be made clean to the end that if and when an atomic weapon ever is used in battle there will be no victims of innocent distant civil populations this does not imply that the disarmament discussion now in progress in london should be disrupted or modified in regard to a cessation of weapon testing we can still agree to a cessation of all further tests except those which may be needed to prove our success in eliminating radioactive debris this kind of limited tests can and should be done with united nations participation therefore that we may demonstrate our good faith in continuing the tests for the purpose of making them clean i propose that our government extend an invitation to an appropriately qualified group of scientists designated by the united nations including the russians to attend our tests and make the necessary scientific examination of the radiation and see for themselves the success of our efforts the scientists who vouch for the achievement of clean weapons assure me that such participation by foreign observers will not compromise our vital weapons information or national security in the slightest degree if the united states sets the pattern for production of clean weapons other nations should follow our example certainly world opinion would soon demand that they do so the second element in maintaining our national nuclear shield is that we relax our security barriers sufficiently to permit a program of public education through which we can demonstrate not only to the american people but to the entire world that atomic weapons are not as wanton and indiscriminate as they are thought to be our experts the scientists and the engineers are making constant progress toward reducing the size and yield of atomic weapons making them more and more precision instruments so that only the immediate military target will be affected or destroyed the honest objective of this program of experimentation tests and education will be that we have harnessed atomic energy to provide us with just another conventional weaponthat is one which uses blast and heat to destroy the target but with no amount of radiation atomic weapons can be discriminating and their effects can be confined to military targets when they are used to that end atomic weapons need not be wanton indiscriminate or inhuman they can be made as precise and humane as any other weapon there is no such thing as a strategic or tactical atomic weapon except in the exact manner in which they may be used it is most important that we understand and approve the use of atomic weapons so that we shall have both the weapon and the determination to use them to resist local aggressions it seems perfectly clear therefore that any unqualified agreement to suspend the tests of atomic weapons is both ill advised contrary to the advice of our experts and unheeding of the voice of humanity and conscience the world should know that our only purpose for continuing the tests is to remove the hazard which might befall innocent people if they are ever used as weapons to prove our intention and the success of our efforts to make them clean representatives of foreign nations should be invited to attend our responsibility as the leading nation of the free world our position as the pioneer and leader ir the atomic field demand that we fulfill that position of responsibility and leadership by a continuance of the tests as i have indicated overriding all we must remember that the greatest strength of nuclear weapons is in their being with nuclear weapons we can have both deterrence of the large war and winning of the small one without nuclear weapons we would be overrun by the hord of russian manpower nuclear weapons are the lever to apply our mental strength against russian massed manpower"],

gentleman will yield to me further i merely take this time to say this if the facts that have developed since the time of the gentlemans committee hearings are brought out in the other body to support the position that i took i hope the committee will look sympathetically on restoring this item in conference with the senatefor i believe the senate will restore some which i think is of great interest and which is absolutely necessary that is for this construction program to go forward the base must be in operation by 1960 or where will these vital and necessary planes be based"],

gods noblemen my secretary miss ella marice ryan was for a period of about 4 years secretary to congressman dempsey she is a lady of very high character and is one of the most efficient secretaries i have ever known a congressmans secretary knows him perhaps as well as if not better than anyone else because the secretary is in daily contact with him the secretary knows what his thinking is his philosophy in life the secretary knows how he operates generally the secretary knows whether he is efficient or inefficient knows more about him perhaps as i say than anyone else and miss ryan has told me so many times how noble was jack dempsey she has told me of the power of his mind his true greatness he was so kind and considerate toward those with whom he worked he was so magnanimous in his attitude generally he was so powerful in representing the people of his district and the people of our whole great country that is one reason why i know he was one of gods noblemen in addition to that just a few moments ago we heard the great speaker of this house tell us of his friendship for and closeness to congressman dempsey in addition to that may i refer again to miss ryan who has told me so many times how close jack dempsey was to the speaker and how the great speaker of this house admired him so much any member of this house or anyone else that speaker rayburn has such a high regard for i know is a man of extraordinary character and ability then the last point and i conclude i personally knew jack dempsey well as all members of this body did my personal contact with him was such that i came to a realization soon after i became acquainted with him that he was a man of extraordinary ability and of the very highest character the poet has said the night has a thousand eyes and the day but one yet the light of the bright world dies with the dying sun the mind has a thousand eyes and the heart but one yet the light of a whole life dies when love is done the light of congressman dempseys life will never die because his love was never done he loved this great country of ours with zeal and fervor he loved justice he loved all of those things all of us should love he was truly a great man to his loved ones i extend my heartfelt sympathy may god comfort them in this their hour of great bereavement"]]}
