in his preelection harlem speech in new york october 25 1952 when he stated never again shall we allow a depression in the united states the soviet communism is looking for one great victory that victory is the economic collapse of our country they want to see us go broke why then would a nation such as ours refuse to mobilize all its resources to defeat a depression as we would mobilize all our resources to defeat an invasion one is just as serious as the other so i pledge you this if the finest brains the finest hearts we can mobilize in washington can foresee the signs of any recession any depression that would put honest hardworking men and women out of work the full power of private industry of municipal government of state government and of the federal government will be mobilized to see that that does not happen i cannot pledge you more than that this is an excellent statement and there is no doubt in my mind that president eisenhower believes every word he said in this statement and there is no doubt in my mind he will make every effort possible to carry it out however if he waits too long to take action it will be impossible for him to carry out this pledge it is my hope that the president will give immediate and early consideration to the unfavorable signs that are appearing in our economy there is a lot being done today through federal agencies and private operations that will vitally affect our country not only in the immediate future but for generations to come in every paper headlines appear about hardmoney policy high interest rates depression no depression sound economy and so forth a few days agoto be exact april 21an article appeared in the newspapers concerning a speech that had been made by the secretary of the treasury george m humphrey which was his first public address in which he stressed the statement that we are not headed for a depression in this speech the secretary gave good reasons why there should not be a depression a few days ago president eisenhower assailed the stupidity of mass unemployment and pledged every useful measureprivate and publicto avoid it in the future the headlines indicate that the money market is getting tight that supply of funds shrink and interest rates are rising still further entirely overlooked seems to be the fact that the federal reserve system determines whether money will be scarce or plentiful it also determine whether interest rates will be high or whether they will be reasonable i do not believe that many people will contend that there is now or that there has been in the past 10 years a free money market in the united states it is a controlled marketcontrolled by the federal reserve board for more than 20 years every week i have prepared and furnished to the newspapers in the congressional district i have the honor to represent a weekly newsletter in which current issues have been discussed to the best of my knowledge and ability since president eisenhower took office january 20 1953 1 have made several references in these newsletters to the president and the economic situation in our country i am inserting herewith excerpts from most of them since that time they are as follows small towns and small business the value of small business is generally recognized in fact small business is looked upon as the backbone of the nation small business is not asking for special benefits and is not asking that big business be destroyed because it is big it is only when bigness is used unfairly to destroy small concerns and create a monopoly should regu lations or laws be imposed one good definition of small business is a business that is not financially able to have a lobbyist in washington it is my belief that the two major problems affecting small business are 1 financial help commercial banks can only make shortterm loans small business needs capital loans of a longer term than commercial banks can make big business concerns for obvious reasons have no trouble getting plenty of longterm financial capital without a reconstruction finance corporation the small concern has no place to go to get the same kind of financial aid that the big concerns can obtain without any trouble a few years ago the small townsthose under 5 000 peoplewere handicapped in a similar manner they could not sell their bonds to build needed improvements for convenience health and sanitation the rfc supplied this need by buying these bonds at par and gradually feeding them out to the financial market as they were proven if the reconstruction finance corporation is put out of business small towns will no longer have a market for their improvement bonds they will be hawked around among the financial slickers and construction companies which will result in the people paying exorbitant rates of interest which will retard necessary services the closing of the rfc will result in a cruel devastating blow to small business and small towns the rfc is criticized because the law of averages as it relates to ethics and conduct in public office has been disclosed to apply to its personnel the same as it applies to all other groups and classes a brooklyn bridge s sold in washington d c very frequently it is not in every such sale that the public is involved or harmed or that the wouldbe buyer of favoritism is helped no good citizen favors political loans the rfc does not compete with banks in fact i believe a poll of the banks would disclose a high percentage of the banks favoring its continuance some of the criticisms against rfc are doubtless justified they can and must be corrected the rfc has and does operate at a profit lets look at the record it started out with 500 million capital from the united states treasury since then it has retired 400 million of the capital paid approximately 400 million interest to the treasury and paid approximately 400 million in dividends to the treasury on top of that it has paid all its own expenses getting no money from the congress 2 preservation of the laws giving small business equality of opportunity just the same fair chance to buy as the big concerns under the same terms and conditions without discrimination small concerns even in the roughest hardest competitive businesslike the grocery businesscan compete with the biggest national corporate chains if the manufacturer or seller who deals with both is not allowed to discriminate against the small man strong efforts by influential people are being made to repeal the robinsonpatman act which is considered to be the best protection and security possessed by small business if this effort succeeds it will imperil the good of the entire nation i insist that small business is entitled to equality of opportunity in trading and finance and with that opportunity i apologize to no one for their ability to meet competition on every corner in america dzpression march the llth 1951 the federal reserve board violated its traditional policy of supporting government bond prices at par it is my belief that the federal reserve board would have never defied the president of the united states by taking this unusual drastic and devastating action unless the board believed that president truman had reached a point of unpopularity with congress so that they could make the move and get by with it they would not have dared such an action if the president had been stronger at the time this action was the commencement of what will be the worst depression in all history if it isnt stoppedif the action is not reversed and alternative methods used to prevent it it was at this pointmarch 11 1951that bond prices commenced to sag until now they are down to 93 the people who bought those bonds had a right to believe that the traditional policy of the federal reserve of supporting the market at par would continue on this datemarch 11 1951farm prices commenced to decline and they have become lower and lower right along with government bonds ever since except the decline has been proportionately greater that was the commencement of our trouble preceding the beginning of the last three depressions1920 1929 and 1937money rates were stiffened resulting in scarcer money and credit and higher interest rates the pattern being followed now is exactly the pattern that was followed before these three depressions a few people in our country who incidentally are pretty strong financially would like to buy it up for 10 cents on the dollar and sell it back for 1 10 on the dollar"], [0.004025518894195557, 0.9959744811058044, 1, "i rise in support of the amendment i was shocked and amazed when i learned that the president had issued a directive to the atomic energy commission to execute a contract with the dixonyates utility group to furnish the tva 600 000 kilowatts of power by constructing a steam plant just across the mississippi river from memphis tenn in west memphis ark the directive of the president did not call for open competitive bids or give any other private power utility group any opportunity to offer a bid the directive was tailor made and cut and dried for the dixonyates group it is an outrageous proposal a giveaway and a cloudy deal in the interest of the dixonyates group i firmly believe the president exceeded his constitutional powers in issuing the directive to the atomic energy commission which is an independent agency and which would destroy the integrity and independent judgment of the atomic energy commission which is not intended to be one of the executive depart4ilents of the government and to be under the direct control of the president it was established as an independent agency like the federal power commission the federal trade commission and the interstate commerce commission the directive makes a power broker out of the atomic energy commission which should only be permitted to contract for power for its own use and needs the majority of the atomic energy commissioners were opposed to this directive the acting comptroller general for the general accounting office protested because the directive eliminated competitive bidding it is a sad commentary that an independent agency such as the aec can be made to ignore its own judgment by the president of the united states and compelled to contract for power that it does not need and which will not be used in connection with the commissions activities the atomic energy commission is being misused by the president as a tool or puppet for the dixonyates combine and is being forced to carry the ball against its own will for this selfish greedy private power group in their efforts to weaken divide cripple and destroy the tennessee valley authority mr chairman the president in his budget message which he sent to the congress last january said in order to provide with appropriate operating reserves for reasonable growth in industrial municipal and cooperative power loads in the area through the calendar year 1957 arrangements are being made to reduce by the fall of 1957 existing commitments of the tennessee valley authority to the atomic energy commission by 500 000 to 600 000 kilowatts this would release the equivalent amount of tennessee valley authority generating capacity to meet increased load requirements of other consumers in the power system and at the same time eliminate the need for appropriating funds from the treasr ury to finance additional generating units in the event however that negotiations for furnishing these load requirements for the atomic energy commission from other sources are not consummated as contemplated or new defense loads develop the question of starting additional generating units by the tva will be reconsidered instead of following his budget message the president issued a directive for a contract to a private power group not to relieve the tva of any of its commitments to the atomic energy commission but to serve the city of memphis and that area the private power group for a long time have been trying to destroy the tva yardstick they have been eager to get control of distributing power in the city of memphis and they have finally succeeded in getting this directive ordering the atomic energy commission against its own will its own judgment to execute a contract whereby the selfish dixonyates group will be given the contract to give power to the city of memphis and not to the atomic energy commission for its own use and its own needs i appeal to the committee to adopt the amendment offered by the gentleman from tennessee"], [0.0045719146728515625, 0.9954280853271484, 1, "as i said they did not have the purchasing power that same problem is likely to face us again soon unless administration policies are changed i want to try to bring it up to date we have good times now we have prosperity and i presume we have fewer people unemployed in proportion to the employables in the united states than we have ever had right today we should not expect any better times than we have right now yet if we do not do something to keep these good times and keep these obstacles out of the way and keep from doing things that will scuttle our economy we are likely to go back to where we were at the time when the holc was absolutely necessary preceding every depression we have hadin 1919 and in 1929what was it that we had that were outstanding signs to warn us one was interest rates commenced to go up the rediscount rates of the federal reserve banks were going up they went up and up the farmers income was going down all the time that is exactly what we have today we have the rediscount rates of the federal reserve bank going up we have all interest rates going up interest rates on taxexempt securities have almost doubled the past year in fact they have almost doubled in the past few months that means that the big wealth of the country will be induced to go into taxexempt securities where the owners of that great wealth will not have to pay any taxes of any kind whatsoever to the federal government to state or to local governments they will be absolutely free and immune from any kind or sort of taxation relative to their investments it should not be that way we are following right now in the same footsteps that led to the major depression of 1919 1920 and 1921 the major depression of 1929 and the early thirties the same type of depression that hit us in 1937 it all started exactly the same way and if something is not done to stop it we are likely to have a devastating depression as good as times are today unless something is done to stop the trend in that direction prior to 1951 in march i believe it was the federal reserve board through its openmarkets committee supported united states government bonds at par that was done for more than a whole decade before that no one ever claimed then it was inflationary no one ever made that contention or assertion but now the federal reserve board has taken out its support of the government security market which is causing farm prices to go down that has caused some of these warning signs to appear that we always see preceding a major devastating destructive depression and they should again assume the power of supporting those bonds they say it is inflationary but for more than 10 years during world war ii and after world war ii the most dangerous inflationary period in the history of the united states of america they supported those bonds at par and they did

this house it has been my practice to recognize the birthday of polish independence by remarks on the floor of the house it is my high privilege therefore once again to make note of this epochal day in the history of a great people and to join with them their descendants in this country and in fact all over the world wherever they may be in hailing and celebrating the modernday establishment of their free government we are all reminded on polish independence day of three things first the glorious history of poland and the polish people secondly the unexcelled contributions of the polish people to our own great nation and the world and thirdly the tragic present plight of the polish nation and people who are bound firmly with the chains of an unspeakable bondage annihilating their free institutions and depriving them of their godgiven rights to liberty and selfdetermination i am saddened beyond expression by the stark tragedy of presentday poland where oppression and tyranny have taken the place of freedom where brutal force has stifled every semblance of selfgovernment and liberty there are many grave tragedies in world history there are many chapters written in blood barbarism cruelty and treachery there are many crimes flagrantly committed by arrogant despots and mantyrants but these are certainly none i know of which reflect more despicable tyranny more calloused betrayal or more cynical willful injustice than those to which the polish nation and the historic godfearing polish people have been so mercilessly subjected i have frequently referred to certain events concerning poland diplomatic as well as military as constituting one of the most outrageous political crimes of the ages but i fear sometimes that no language is adequate and no voice powerful enough to describe the true magnitude of the insidious betrayals which have lead to the unconscionable subjugation of poland by red soviet tyrants who is there among us who could question the perfidy and the sinister objects of some of the principals in this tragedy and the grossly unjust consequences of this wholesale delivery of a great godloving nation into the hands of ruthless atheistic godhating masters who would seek to defend the moral obliquity and political folly of the illfated policies of socalled enlightened statecraft and the unprovoked acts of aggression and the unwarranted illegal and unmoral methods by which the noble polish people were rendered captive to unspeakable world communist conspirators if there be those who would sanction and defend the diplomatic agreements at teheran and yalta and elsewhere by which this delivery of poland was consummated then i wish once again to record my unceasing voice of protest if there are those who seek to justify this colossal iniquity as a necessary compromise of those seeking to impose the cruel godless marxist system on the world in order temporarily to appease their insatiable appetite for territory power and dominion over helpless peoples and put them in a complacent mood then i wish once again to voice my unalterable opposition and to reassert once again my indignation and to reaffirm my purpose not only to question but to continue to oppose and denounce this palpable gross injustice directed against the rights of free men and women has this machiavellian and sordid diplomatic deal achieved its expected result of appeasing the reds and staying for a moment the campaign of constant infiltration and sporadic aggression against the democracies and the free world look around the world today and you will find the answer to that question you will find it in almost every nation where communist conspiracies besiege and threaten the domains of freedom you will find it behind the iron curtain where more than 800 millions of people are literally shackled in a debasing captivity you will find it written in blood on the battlefields of korea and indochina and you will find it in the dark clouds of deliberately inspired insurrection revolution and violence which are rolling across eastern europe the near east the plains of asia yes and even in some of the nations of the western hemisphere where american liberty has its proud abode is it any wonder that the american people are disturbed and worried as never before but there is no really satisfactory answer my friends at this time to the problem of poland because it is part and parcel by virtue of some of the very policies which our own nation so unfortunately pursued during and following world war ii that it is now inextricably bound up with the whole question of whether or not our nation and the free world are going to stand by idly passively and submissively while world communism develops atomic and hydrogen weapons stolen from us by traitors and spreads its power orbit and control over the rest of the earth some of our allies want to do so that is evident to a child but i am not convinced that the american people propose to accept such a verdict on the other hand it is my considered opinion that the american people as wholeheartedly as ever firmly intend to oppose by all means in their power the diabolical aims and activities of communism its patent conspiracy against liberty and its willful aggression against the weak and the helpless many times i have said that strength of purpose and strength of capacity and power are urgently required to meet the grave situation that now confronts us in the world it is clear that so long as tensions caused by communism are extant and they are growing daily in intensity it will be necessary for this nation to develop and maintain most powerful force of arms most powerful air components most powerful development of the abomb and the hbomb and other deadly weapons this is a deplorable but absolutely necessary requirement if we would be prepared to cope with the evils of communism including the threats and possibilities of aggression against this nation it is of the utmost importance it is in fact imperative that we should move with all practicable rapidity toward the goal of building such powerful armed forces and such overwhelming air complements and such great economic vitality and productive potential that no nation or combination of nations will ever dare to attack us because they will respect our power of massive retaliation or call it what you will which will enable us if the occasion requires it and god forbid to strike with swift fury and devastating power and destructiveness those who would seek the ruin and conquest of this nation we must then my friends be prepared militarily and economically to meet current dangers vital though military strength is and vital though economic strength and productivity are they will of themselves not suffice the enemy may well have these things though not so well implemented or developed but there is another element that is needed more urgently than the other two and this is i think fortunately for us the one ingredient which the potential enemy does not possess namely spiritual strength out of which springs and flourishes faith in our creator faith in our nation faith in our democratic institutions faith in our cherished freedom as well as all those other great values which derive from the nobility of the godbelieving human spirit it is from this strong faith which emanates from godgiven spiritual sources that we can weld the inflexible purpose receive inspiration and strength of will and power to meet every contingency to ward off every danger to throw back every enemy and to preserve our way of life the people without the will and determination to defend their freedom will not long enjoy it poland then is a part a vital part of the pattern which makes it necessary for americans once again to turn our minds and hearts with a sense of great urgency and a spirit of rededication toward the great problem of combating the enemies of freedom and freeing the oppressed we hail today the people of historic poland who throughout the centuries have gloriously fought bled and died for liberty we hail all the magnificent people of polish blood who are our respected and beloved friends and neighbors in this country for their unsurpassed contributions in war and peace to the sacred cause of our great republic on its natal day we proudly

and all of his santa claus projects and maladministration of public funds but for my great interest in the cause of american agriculture i would not now trespass upon the patience of the members of this house when i realize how many billions of dollars we have spent in the last 22 years on the peoples of other lands and when i realize how some of the people of this country are howling and growling about the money we have spent in supporting the prices of agricultural commodities here in our own country i feel thoroughly justified in bringing to your attention and to the attention of the people of america the facts concerning the one program which has meant more to the economy of our country than any other program which has been in effect in the past two decades we have been making history here in congress in the last few weeks i think it is very appropriate for me here and now to bring to your attention again some pertinent facts and figures in the hope that i might be able to provide some food for thought if my calculations are in error if my conclusions are inaccurate i earnestly hope that someone in some way connected with this administration will give the congress and the country the real facts and the truth i could talk on perhaps for hours about this great and paramount subject of agriculture i know that i shall not in this one feeble effort tell the whole story during the 20 years that i have served in congress i have been a member of the house committee on agriculture for 4 years i had the honor to be chairman of that great committee and i am now the ranking minority member my colleagues will bear witness that during that entire 20year period i have constantly and consistently tried to keep farm problems and farm programs out of and above partisan politics fortunately seldom if ever during the 20 years has partisan politics lifted its ugly head in our committee room the 30 members of the house committee on agriculture are all devoted to public duty and are interested in the welfare not only of the farmers of america but all of the people of our nation i am certain most of you know that on many occasions i have paid tribute to my longtime and beloved friend the present distinguished chairman of that committee cliff hope of kansas who has served on the committee for 27 long years and at the end of this year he too will have served as chairman of the committee for 4 years as current and positive proof of the fact that partisan politics seldom if ever enters our deliberations i need only remind you of the fact that just about 2 weeks ago when the general farm bill was being considered in the house the able and distinguished chairman of our great committee led the fight for the preservation and extension of the pricesupport program on basic agricultural commodities and as former chairman and ranking minority member i stood here by his side the same thing is true with regard to the agricultural trade development and assistance act of 1954 which was recently signed by the president in reporting the general farm bill every democratic member of the committee except one voted with the republican chairman i say all of this in the hope that what i shall now say will be accepted for what it is worth and that my colleagues may know that i am not now prompted by considerations of partisan politics as a member of the minority i claim the right to speak out in criticism but i assure you that i shall speak without bitterness or rancor farm problems like foreign policy should always be kept on a bipartisan or nonpartisan basis certainly all of the friends of agriculture are not members of the democratic party in both houses of congress there are members of the republican party who are devoted to the cause of agriculture i shall not attempt to list them by name but they are here and they are not newcomersnor are they flybynight friends they have been friends of the farmers all through the years and they will continue to fight for all that they believe to be right they too have tried to keep these issues out of partisan politicsthey too have tried to keep the promises of their party and their party leaders but what spectacles have we witnessed as legislation affecting the welfare of farmers has been brought to this house for consideration the leadership has turned on some of these great men these tried and trusted friends of agriculture but all of us know that there is no flaw in their armor and no blood upon their shields these friends of agriculture need never be afraid for they shall triumph in the campaigns to come no one segment of our economy has been singled out for such lambasting and for such cruel treatment as is now being administered to the farmers of america every blustering blundering bureaucrat seems to have turned against the farmer a deliberate willful wicked and wanton effort is being made to cause the consumers of america to revolt and to turn against the farmers of the nation the farm program has been distorted denounced and ridiculed throughout the length and breadth of the nation chief agricultural officials are going up and down the countryside trying their best to bring the farm program into disrepute and the american farmer into disfavor this laborious effort on the part of those in high places will fail because the consuming public now knows something about the facts of life on the farm front the consumers of america will not believe that the farmers of america are irresponsible and reckless citizens who are not interested in the general welfare of the nation consumers know that farmers are not trying to get something out of their government either by fair means or foul and intelligent consumers know that this price support program has not contributed unduly to the high cost of living the chief agricultural officer of the country has actually tried in devious ways to saddle the cost of our foreignaid program on the bending backs of american farmers he has presented fictitious fallacious facts and figures and arguments to the people of the nation he has spoken in terms of many billions of dollars when you and i know that according to his own calculations the entire pricesupport program conducted by the commodity credit corporation on all agricultural commodities basics and nonbasics perishables and nonperishables over a long period of 22 years has only cost slightly more than 1 billion the american people have the right to know the truth and they have the right to expect the truth from public officials in high places of trust and responsibility this is no time for fancy fiction fallacy or fraud this is the time for a fair frank fearless and forthright presentation of the true facts and figures involved in this much maligned program merely because i was elected a member of the house committee on agriculture and have served on that committee during the entire time that i have been a member of congress certainly does not mean that as a representative of a great congressional district i am not interested in the welfare of consumers actually i have tried at all times to represent all of the people and not just a part or a segment of our economy i represent consumersall of the more than 450 000 people of the district i represent are consumers and this includes of course all of the producers of agricultural commodities i am afraid that some of my colleagues are at times unaware of the fact that i am just as intensely interested in the welfare of consumers as i am in the welfare of producers who labor in the fields of america i can justify and i can defend the pricesupport program on basic agricultural commodities in this or any other forum i know that it is definitely in the interest of both producers and consumers and i know too that it has not increased the cost of living unduly perhaps the average housewife does not realize that the price of food today is cheaper in relation to the average family income than at any other time in the history of the nation for 18 percent of the average family income in the current year the housewife can buy better cleaner and cheaper food than she could have acquired in the period from 1935 to 1939 with 23 8 percent of the family income perhaps the average housewife does not know or realize that when the price of wheat was going down the price of bread was going up in early 1948 farmers were receiving 2 81 per bushel for wheat now the price of wheat is 1 91 per bushel yet in this period of time the price of a loaf of bread has gone up from an average cost throughout the nation of 13 8 cents to a presentday average cost of 17 cents a loaf while wheat prices declined 32 percent the price of bread was going up 23 percent since 1951 farm prices have declined 20 percent in relation to farm prices in 194749 but food prices have gone down only about 1 percent very little of the lower prices received by farmers since 1951 has been passed on to consumers in lower retail prices in 1914 the average factory employee could buy 3 5 pounds of bread with an hours earnings in 1929 he could buy 6 4 pounds with 1 hours earnings in 1953 he could buy 10 7 pounds of bread with an hours earnings an hours factory wage in 1953 would buy 1 9 pounds of round steak compared with 1 2 pounds in 1929 the same hours earnings will buy 2 2 pounds of butter now as compared with 1 pound of butter in 1929 7 5 quarts of milk now 3 9 quarts then 2 5 dozen eggs now 1 1 dozen then 32 pounds of potatoes now 17 7 pounds then and on down the line in food items the 1pound loaf of bread sells for 17 cents as i have just noted of that 17 cents the farmers part is about 214 cents for the total amount of wheat in the 1pound loaf the price a farmer receives for a bushel of wheat would have to be reduced 75 cents to reflect a 1penny reduction in the cost of a loaf of bread there is only about 30 cents worth of cotton in a 3 95 cotton shirt so if the producers and cotton farmers should give the wheat and cotton away there would be very slight if any reductions in the cost of a loaf of bread or a cotton shirt the tobacco farmers in 1953 received about 800 million for that part of their crop which was consumed in the united states now look what the consumers paid in tages on that tobacco federal state and local taxes on the 1953 crop by the time it reached the consumer amounted to approximately 2 100 000 000 a spokesman for confectioners who was urging our committee to remove peanuts from the mandatory pricesupport program was forced to admit that even if the pricesupport program for peanuts was reduced from 90 percent of parity to 75 percent of parity the price the consumer pays for a 5cent peanut candy bar containing about 1 2cent worth of peanuts would not be reduced at all confectioners are making higher profits than ever before and yet it is plain to see a change in the pricesupport program would not benefit consumers actually the amount the farmer receives for the raw agricultural commodities is so negligible when related to the ultimate cost the consumer pays for the finished product that the pricesupport program has practically no effect on the price consumers are required to pay again i insist that we must improve our distribution system to the end that the great distance from producer to consumer might be shortened and made less expensive the greatest cost of food is added after it leaves the farmers hand the cost of processing handling transporting and distributing is all added after the farmer parts with the title and receives his small part of the consumers dollar actually consumers have benefited by the farm program under the program on the basic agricultural commodities we have maintained a stability in supply and at all itmes consumers have had an abundance of all the vital foods and never has the program resulted in a scarcity which caused consumer prices to rise consumers suffer when there is a scarcity of any of the vital foods the program was designed to bring about an abundant supply at a reasonable price to the end that both producers and consumers might be benefited in the long run our committee on agriculture in its report to the house on the farm bill commented on this as follows it must be noted that the largest reduction in the price of food in comparison with wages has occurred during the years of the development of the present program that has as its aim a parity of income for agriculture it is evident therefore that consumers have gotten their greatest concessions in prices of food and fiber in the time of the growth of farmincome stability"], [0.008591830730438232, 0.9914081692695618, 1, "some weeks ago i went around the world as a member of the house armed services committee it was good to get back in america and my native oklahoma after several weeks of study and firsthand observation of conditions in

bringing order out of confusion strength out of weakness unity out of division and hope out of despair yet i must admit there is still much suffering poverty and illness in our allied nations i returned to america with a sense of rededication to the great principles of american democracy and with renewed devotion to serve and promote the general welfare of our citizens the adverse conditions of poverty ignorance disease the constant threat of war and the insidious influences of communism under which the people in most of the nations work are not conducive to a wholesome spirit of unity pride and productiveness it has been said many times that america is great not because of her natural resources and her rich land but because of her people who harness her resources and make the land bring forth its wealth we are proud of the fact that we have more than 60 million persons employed in the various areas of production but even in america there are people who suffer from disabilitiesphysical handicapssuch as the blind the deaf the lame and others with disabling diseases seven million of these work in spite of these handicaps however there are others2 million other handicapped persons who would and could work if they were provided with the needed medical treatment and taught a skill in keeping with their physical capacities oklahoma has its share of this group who due to disabilities caused by accident disease or other reason are not a part of the labor market what is oklahoma doing for its handicapped citizens who are of employable age and who have an employment potential a we could call your attention to hundreds of disabled persons within the boundaries of the sixth congressional district who through the specialized services of the vocational rehabilitation division of the state board of vocational education are employed and making their own way time will permit me to mention only a few i recall a fine young man who made a splendid record in the mangum high school he engaged in the school and community activities as any normal boy would he planned for an objective which would yield abundant returns in services to his fellow man but which also held rather rigid physical requirements a few years after he completed high school he developed arthritis which left its disabling effects he could no longer meet the physical demands of his chosen profession it was necessary for him to change to some type of sedentary work a counselor of the vocational rehabilitation service helped this young man to make an adjustment to a new vocation through the service of vocational rehabilitation he was trained as a draftsman he is now profitably employed by one of the major oil companies in oklahoma b in frederick we have an impressive example of a blind man working as a radio station operator blinded in youth this man has endeared himself to the people of his community and through the services of vocational rehabilitation and friends has become a valuable employee of a radio station c the switchboard operator in one of the leading banks in lawton had fought a 20year battle to regain use of her poliocrippled legs the oklahoma vocational rehabilitation division provided physical restoration and training for this person and assisted her in finding satisfactory employment it is estimated there are between 30 000 and 40 000 men and women of working age in oklahoma so severely disabled by physical or mental impairments that they cannot support themselves or their families each year the disabling effects of injury illness or congenital causes add to the growing number of disabled persons shall we neglect or correct these conditions neglected disability means waste of productive energy unnecessary unemployment dependency on family denying or curtailing opportunities for children or parents of the disabled dependcy on public charity and assistance a constant drain on the resources of oklahoma and the nation one neglected disability generally takes two people out of production usually the mother wife husband or child of the disabled person becomes the slave of the neglected disability neglected disability feeds upon itself continued disuse of physical and mental powers aggravates the impairment and weakens the will to regain lost abilities and to learn new skills corrected disability means salvage of wasted manpower more production for our state and nation in peace or in war reduced financial burdens on the families of the disabled expanded opportunities for the children of the disabled to develop into good useful and productive citizens the disabled whom we rehabilitate are the people who now live and will continue to live in oklahoma they will prove either burdens or assets to us they will either reduce or increase the wealth of oklahoma if these people are to lead reasonably useful lives if they are to become selfsupporting or useful to their families they must have some or all of the services provided through the statefederal vocational rehabilitation service which was made possible by an act of congress as one answer to the problem of disability we have a very effective vocational rehabilitation service in oklahoma during the past 3 years it rehabilitated 3 766 disabled persons i am pleased to report that of these 629 or approximately onesixth lived in the sixth congressional district these are your neighbors your friends or perhaps members of your family you know how the services made available to these persons through the rehabilitation agency have benefited these individuals and given them the satisfaction of employment which provides them with a self sustaining income in fact 15 percent of the number were taken directly from the public assistance rolls more important perhaps than the number of persons who have been rehabilitated is the fact that over the years many hundreds of persons have been kept from ever getting on publicassistance rolls as a result of having had the opportunity to secure vocational rehabilitation assistance when it was first needed ttfere are many indications that oklahoma is becoming aware of the tremendous possibilities and potentialities of vocational rehabilitation for instance the oklahoma a and m college stillwater okla has recently established a comprehensive rehabilitation center in connection with its school of technical training at okmulgee this center utilizing the medical techniques which proved so effective in the treatment of veterans following the last war will facilitate the rehabilitation and return to employment of our most severely disabled citizens it is of utmost importance that the most severely of our disabled be given a chance for they have much to give ruby fariss bonnell county superintendent of schools at sayre my friend and successful public official is doing a wonderful job in spite of a serious disability all of us know and admire people who have overcome the handicap of a physical disability and all of us take pride in what oklahoma is doing to help others the center at okmulgee is an example of the extent to which our state is taking the lead in this respect already 182 persons have been served at this center and an increasing number will be served as trained personnel and funds are available since the center is the first facility of its kind west of the mississippi river disabled persons from five of the surrounding states are now included among the patients and there are new inquiries from other states in the southwest almost daily the possibilities of this new facility where the best in medicine and vocational training are combined and integrated are almost unlimited provided adequate staff and funds are available the center provides services for the vocational rehabilitation division on a fee basis but limited funds for vocational rehabilitation places a definite limit on the number of disabled persons who may be served vocational rehabilitation through its various services attempts to bring about vocational adjustment for the individual who has a disability due to birth accident or disease which renders him at a disadvantage when preparing for seeking or applying for a job it is well to bear in mind that unless a person has sufficient capacities remaining so that he may be trained for or placed in some remunerative activity either in the home or in public employment the individual cannot be accepted for service during the past 3 years the vocational rehabilitation service of oklahoma has worked with 9 593 handicapped persons many of these are still in the process of rehabilitation three thousand seven hundred and sixtysix of the above number have been rehabilitated into employment"],

unbearable taxes the small taxpayers for the last 20 years i suggest since the democratic leadership has suddenly become the champion of the small taxpayer in this session of congress that the small taxpayer and the people take a look at the past of the party leaders and see what they have done to the little taxpayer for the 20 years they have been in power they say in this bill they want to raise the exemptions of the little taxpayer from 600 to 700 the record shows that when the republican party went out of power in 1932 a husband and wife had 3 500 tax exemption the democratic administration began reducing these exemptions until in the 15 years following they had whittled these exemptions of the husband and wife down to 500 each also they had whittled down the single persons exemption from 1 500 under the republicans to 500 exemption under them and to make it tough on those small taxpayers the democrats increased taxes in hundreds of different ways until they had all of the little taxpayers paying heavy excise or hidden taxes on everything they bought by comparison when the 80th republican congress came to power in 1947 our first move was to give the little taxpayers in the lower bracket an increase of 100 in exemption raising it from 500 to 600 in that tax bill we also gave all people their first tax reduction in 15 years of about 6 billion gave them the 100 extra exemption and gave the older people over 65 years of age each an additional 600 tax exemption this removed over 6 million people from paying any taxes the democrats then took the same position of opposition they are today taking on the floor of this house when we are trying to give the people a total tax reduction of 7 billion the same leaders of the party fought that tax bill for the same apparent political reasons they are fighting this tax bill today they are employing the same tactics they offered a motion to recommit that tax bill and the same leaders will offer a motion to recommit this tax bill these leaders and 159 democrats voted to recommit that republican tax relief bill while 258 republicans voted against recommitting the tax bill and it was sent to the senate which upheld the republican action in the house and it then went to president truman the president vetoed the bill and the same leaders and 88 democrats voted to uphold the president to give the people at that time no tax relief however all republicans supported by a number of democrats voted to override the presidents veto with a total of 311 votes and the little taxpayers got a general reduction of about 11 percent plus the extra 100 exemption for every taxpayer plus the 600 exemption for all of the older people over 65 which they have all been enjoying for the last 8 years as the result of the action of the republican 80th congress they said then as they are saying now and the labor bosses that were working with them then as they are working with them now said that it was a rich mans tax bill even though they knew that the small taxpayers got in every instance a much greater percentage reduction than did those in the higher brackets while the small taxpayers got over 11 percent reduction those in the highest brackets got as little as 2 percent reduction for 20 years their party was in power following a policy of tax and tax and spend and spend at the close of their tenure of office 1 year ago they had laid more and more taxes on the people until no housewife or other person could buy anything over the counter unless the price of that article had been inflated by direct and hidden taxes which has brought to the american people the highest taxes in their history directtax collections from individual citizens under their leadership has gone up from only 427 millionnot billionto 30 billion70 times as much tax collections from corporations are 35 times as much salestax collections on everything everybody buys have gone up 20 times as much under the democratic administration may i say here that the dkmocrats tried to recommit and failed the bill we passed last week in this house which will cut the excise or sales tax the people have to pay by over 915 million let me show you what they have done to the average family when the democrats came to power in 1933 if a married man with two children had to pay on a net income of 5 000 his taxes were 68 but in 1952 when democratic rule ended the same man had to pay 461 nearly seven times as much he had to pay 10 times as much taxes on some articles 25 percent more on cigarettes more than 3 times as much taxes on his auto twice as much on gasoline twice as much on radios and he was paying federal sales taxes on thousands of things that were untaxed in these spenders that are trying to defeat this tax bill today ran the national debt up to 256 billion and by resulting inflation got the cost of living so high that it cut the peoples dollar in spending power down to 50 cents food went up nearly 4 times clothing more than double housefurnishings went up 21 2 times for the past 20 years the democrats have been shouting for higher spending and higher taxes for the past 20 years they have constantly raised taxes and never once reduced them they apparently lost their voice so far as reducing taxes was concerned but now in this election year when they want to return to power they have suddenly found their voice and for the first time are shouting about reducing incometax exemptions knowing their past record has been so bad they have no worthwhile issue to present to the people in their mad scramble to get back in power they are suddenly full of compassion for the little fellow but apparently not for the little fellows children and grandchildren who will have to pay an increased national debt they would pass on to them if they have their way which they will not they will prevent the people from having a balanced budget which will start another wave of inflation that will cost the little taxpayers each year in higher prices twice as much as the small amount they would save in taxes by securing an extra 100 tax exemption the people asked for a change after 20 years of waste extravagance and corruption in government the people lost confidence in the leaders of the democratic party and voted in 1952 for a change under the reckless spending and the heavy burden of taxes the confidence of the people was destroyed to the point in the past administration that they were selling their bonds by the hundreds of millions of dollars a year into the federal treasury faster than the federal treasury could sell bonds back to the people they voted to put president eisenhower at the head of this nation by a tremendous majority and elected a republican congress they want him and his party to lead the way and clean up the mess we inherited within 1 short year under this new leadership the people have regained their confidence which is indicated in the fact that they are buying hundreds of millions of dollars worth more of savings bonds today and keeping them for investment more than are being turned in and cashed by the federal treasury they have seen the war stopped by the new administration and they are grateful throughout the nation they have seen the application of honesty integrity and economy in government and they like that change i will have more to say about that economy in a minute may i say to the minority leaders who have been claiming in the past that they want to support the president that the position they are taking on this bill when the chips are down which the president the republican leadership and the bestinformed people in the nation know will mean so much to fight off a recession and to put the country on a sound prosperous and expanding economy and making jobs for millions of people certainly refute your former statements they want the president to lead they want you to follow and help him you have had your try and failed in the past campaign we told the people that our policy on the domestic front would be at the earliest possible date to reduce taxes and balance the budget we are keeping that promise in the campaign your party declared we could do neither of them is it the policy of you of the minority party to disregard the intere of the people and the nation by trying to prevent president eisenhower and the people from having a balanced budget and a reduction of taxes we cut the truman budget last year which he said cou d not be cbt by approximately 14 billion that was our first step to give the people tax relief and the hope of giving them a balanced budget had we not done that we would not be trying to reduce taxes by 7 billion in this session but we did it and if the minority party will cooperate in this tax bill and for a further reduction of the cost of government we may yet in this session be able to reduce the cost of government sufficiently to have a balanced budget this coming july 1 we have reversed your past spending policies to the extent that we will be within striking distance of a balanced budget and at the same time give the american people 7 billions in tax relief if you are able to force this additional 100 tax exemption it will give no benefit to the people in the lower bracket it will start a wave of inflation which will raise the cost of living more than enough to wipe out the 20 or 30 a year they would get in tax reduction it will increase the budget deficit by 21 2 billion more at a time when our party and the people not only want a tax reduction but want a balanced budget that will prevent further inflation at this time when we are making a transition from a war economy to a peacetime economy and have before us sound policies including tax reduction so far as our economy will stand in an effort to make this transition from a war economy to a peacetime economy and prevent a recession this is a time with world conditions as serious as they are for the members of this house on both sides of the aisle to have the courage to do the things they know to be right to have the courage to tell the american people the truth this

to do with the owner of a large body of land who leases out to several individual tenants what effect this reduction will make does it not mean that those tenants will have access to that much less of

today in opposition to public housing as such i am merely following out a position that i have consistently entertained from the very beginning of this program in fact i have voted and worked consistently each year against the continuation of the program which in my judgment is inimicable to the very existence of the government under which we live frankly out of the new fair deal program there have been some good and bad features for instance i think that the rural electrification program is the best of that whole setup and has been a great boon to the rural peoples of this country and has contributed to the preservation of this glorious young republic it has done a job that private enterprise refused to do but out of all of this new and fair deal program it is my considered judgment that this socalled public housing is the most inimicable to the continuation of the republic it strikes at the very bulwark of the republic it is unamerican it is socialistic in the truest sense of the word it would destroy if permitted to continue to grow the principle of individual home ownership which after all is one of the basic principles upon which our government is founded it eats at the foundation of free and private enterprise it destroys the initiative of the individual citizen and in the end if its proponents should prevail in their ambitious plans could end only in a socialistic state or even worse a dictatorship this country is builded upon and has grown to its status of world leadership upon the american principle of home ownership this housing program would lead to something entirely different for instance one has only to point out that communism is foreign and repugnant to home owners we cannot continue this program without endangering the very foundation and the basic principles upon which the government is founded therefore i have proposed here by this amendment that if this program must be followed if this house is to reverse itself by renewing this iniquitous program after only last year killing it by a vote of approximately 2 to 1 then it would be better for our common country from every angle considered to give these houses to the occupants thereof while i naturally will be charged possibly with some justification of being facetious in offering this amendment i believe that if it must be done that it is better to do it this way it would be to the best interest of all concerned if the federal government should make a straightout gift to the proposed occupants and in that i am very serious in the first place we would thereby make homeowners out of these proposed tenants having the responsibility of home ownership they would naturally be more interested in their government they would no longer be under the compulsion to remain in the lowincome class in order to have a place to live thus their initiative would be restored they would no longer be subjected to governmental regimentation for i am sure that those who have studied this program will bear me out in the assertion that in these large public housing subdivisions these tenants are often required to vote according to the dictates of the prevailing governmental authorities under threat of eviction on the other hand under my proposal the government that is to say the taxpayers would no longer be required to subsidize the housing project in fact as i pointed out in a colloquy with the distinguished gentlefilan from texas on yesterday that if this ambitious program as originally proposed were carried out that the government would save in excess of 14 billion by deeding the property over to the tenants as soon as the houses were constructed in other words under the basic law governing the public housing the treasury of the united states is required to subsidize the rental operations of these houses taking as a basis 11 000 as the cost of each unit the subsidy over the 40year period would be 8 800 per unit this 8 800 per unit representing the subsidy from the united states treasury would be saved to the taxpayers if the houses were given away in the first place but as a matter of fact the latest figures that i have been able to obtain are to the effect that these units are costing now more than 14 000 therefore the cost to the government is that much greater all that one has to do therefore is to multiply this 8 800 or 10 000 or whatever it figures out to be under the latest figures by the number of units to be built and one can see just how much this program is costing the taxpayers i come back to the proposition that aside from the cost that the program is unamerican and could in the end only destroy our system of government for instance in my effort to analyze the situation i have often thought of two men who worked sidebyside in a given industry one is frugal soberminded industrious and possessedof a keen desire to own his own home and go forward on his own initiative he works regularly down in my country when his 8 hours of work are over he goes home and with his own hands and often with the assistance of his wife builds himself a modest home out of his savings he becomes a homeowner and a good citizen with initiative unlimited for advancement his companion is not of a sober industrious disposition he works only when he feels like it and wastes his earnings in beer shops and otherwise therefore his income is lower under this housing program the government builds the notsoindustrious ambitious worker an 11 000 or 14 000 house to live in at whatever rental he was able to pay while at the same time the sober industrious fellow worker who has built his own home would be taxed to furnish the other fellow a better place in which to live than he himself could afford i opposed this program as i stated before under both of my democratic presidents roosevelt and truman because i thought it was wrong certainly if it were wrong under presidents roosevelt and truman it is wrong under president eisenhower last year this house i repeat by a vote of approximately 2 to 1 wrote finis to this program it killed it and it is dead today unless revived here by this house and i might point out to my republican colleagues that in that vote there were only 23 out of over 200 republicans who voted against killing it now i have sympathy with a true liberal or new dealer who believes in this kind of a program we have many here over on our side but to me it is unbelievable that any substantial number of our republican friends on the other side of the aisle who have voted consistently against this program will aboutface and vote for it i have offered this amendment to point up the seriousness of the situation since i do not feel that the federal government owes it to any minority group of normal people to furnish them housing i shall no doubt at the proper time ask permission to withdraw my amendment"]]}
