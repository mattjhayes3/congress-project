reduction of our military capability president clintons decision to attack yugoslavia and to maintain peacekeeping forces in kosovo were based upon the mistaken notion that military forces can turn ethnic and religious hatred into peaceful coexistence as a participant in the kosovo peacekeeping operation known as kfor the united states has 5 000 troops in kosovo 450 in macedonia and 10 in greece while working to achieve this harmony unitedstates troops have been fired upon and assaulted in many instances census figures collected by the u n high commission for refugees andthe yugoslavian

makes the presidents plan to build a peaceful multiethnic state all the more daunting this situation begs the question when will our troops leave kosovo if the clinton administration has its way the answer is no time soon all we need to do is to look at bosnia to explain this conclusion remember bosnia in 1996 the united states sent 16 500 troops to bosnia and some 6 000 support troops to neighboring nations the president stated that the deployment would last about 1 year the troops are still there and the administration has requested 1 4 billion for the next fiscal year to continue this 1year mission to bosnia it seems that much the same is expected for kosovo two american camps in that region are being expanded to house and support american soldiers for at least 3 to 5 more years more troubling is the assessment of the top unitedstates commander in kosovo according to the boston globe that commander brigadier general sanchez stated that the mission will require nato peacekeepers to remain there for at least a generation can we expect some of these nato troops to be american we should also consider the cost of these deployments up to last year 9 08 billion has been appropriated for bosnia operations with the expenditure for this fiscal year and the next the bosnian mission will accumulate costs exceeding 12 billion according to the department of defense the

and certainly face our administration one of those problems is keeping social security solvent this affects everybody not only existing retirees but the young middle age and future generations what is going to be their future in terms of working and paying taxes and maybe or maybe not getting social security benefits when they retire social security probably is one of this countrys most successful programs in terms of helping people retire with some security when we started social security in 1935 when franklin roosevelt decided we should have a program to force savings and pay for some disability insurance while you are working rather than risk the poor house at that time there were something like 52 workers for each social security retiree remember it is a payasyougo program existing current workers pay in their social security tax and that tax immediately goes out to pay benefits for existing retirees by the time we got to 1940 there were 38 people working paying in their taxes for every one retiree this year we have three people working three people working paying in their taxes to cover each retirees benefits a couple of things have happened politicians in this chamber the senate and the presidents decided to increase benefits over the yearsbecause it was popular when there was not enough money they increased taxes and borrowing by 2025 over on the far righthand side of this chart you see there are only going to be two workers paying in their taxes for each retiree we started out back in 1940 having a 3 percent tax on the first 1 500 of wages today we have increased that to 12 4 percent on the first almost 76 000 of wages so i hope we all agree one of our challenges is not to increase taxes yet again demographics of longer life span and lower birth rates have also greatly affected solvency the diminishing return on our social security investment should concern us all the real return of social security is less than 2 percent for the average worker in the united states again not counting the amount of the social security tax that pays for the disability insurance portion workers get a real return of less than 2 percent on the taxes paid in for some there is zero return on their social security they are never going to live long enough to get back what they and their employer put into it but still 1 9 percent is the average minorities do not get back what they pay in a young black male for example is going live on the average 62 years that means they pay in all of their life but do not get benefits but the average real return for the market is over 7 percent part of the solution for social security has got to be a better return on the investment this chart shows the number of years you are going to have to live after retirement to get back the money that you and your employer paid in just to break even if you were lucky enough to retire in 1940 it took 2 months if you retired 5 years ago in 1995 you are going to have to live 16 years after retirement to break even on average if you retire in 2005 2015 or 2025 it is unlikely you are going to ever get back what you put into this system even a c d or extra safe investments in the marketplace would give more to retirees governor bush is suggesting limitations on any such investments it can only be used for retirement purposes it has to be limited to safe investments we have companies now that will guarantee a return greater than social security without taking any risks so our challenge is we have to get people this congress the president to develop

first week he got his drivers license and he was 16 in waco texas and my parents had one good car and one kind of second car and so john got to drive the second car it was a ford fairlane the first week he got his drivers license he was driving down 25th street in waco and at that time there was a movie theater called the 25th street theater and the young lady who was in the ticket box the box office was a friend of his from high school and john drove by and trying to do some fancy maneuver with the car and wave at her he hit three cars and totaled two of them and drove a car up into the front entrance of the local newspaper i happened to be a senior in college at the time and was home with some of my old high school football buddies and when he called home he did not ask for my father he asked for me he said joe you are going to have to come down and help me out a little bit so my buddies and i we got in the car and they all knew him as little joe because when we were in high school john was not more than 42 feet tall so he had grown up by the time i got to college we went down to see him and he was standing outside looking at the car and not too knowing what to do after we got through laughing about it we said well john you are going to have to call dad there is no way to get around it so he did and of course my father came down and he was not too happy about it he did not laugh a bit one of my memories of my little brother in high school was standing there looking so forlorn with the girl he was trying to impress in the box office at the movie theater laughing and all of my friends laughing and my father just absolutely chewing his tail out for having this happen the first time he had his drivers license or in fact the first time he had his drivers license and drove by himself totalling two cars and sen~ling another car into the front office of the local newspaper which obviously the next day ran a very uncomplimentary story about larry bartons youngest son i can also remember in 1984 when i decided to run for congress now today we read routinely about million dollar campaigns and all these highpriced consultants and tv ads but in the sixth district of texas in 1984 in the republican primary there was not any of that it was an absolutely familyoriented grass roots campaign by then john was an attorney who was living down in corpus christi texas i convinced him to come to ennis and help run my campaign so he went from a beachfront apartment in corpus christi texas down on the gulf coast where there were sea breezes and just a really nice lifestyle to sleeping on a cot in the kitchen of my home my motherinlaw and fatherinlaw slept on a pallet out in the garage my campaign driver slept on the couch my sister slept in one room a bedroom with my oldest daughter alison jan and i slept in what was called the master bedroom which meant it had an extra foot of space with christine our youngest daughter in the crib john would routinely be woken up in the morning by my 2yearold kristin looking into his eyes tickling him we offered him a great salary i think of 600 a month but what that really meant was when he had a car note come due or a college loan payment come due my sister jan who was a campaign treasurer would say you bring me the bill and i will pay the bill and he did an outstanding job in that campaign i got into a runoff and in the runoff i lost the runoff by i want to say 9 votes out of about 10 000 votes cast to seek a recount you had to file a legal document in every county court and there were 14 counties so my brother who was the only attorney on the payroll of the campaign had to file those documents he prepared the legal briefs within 3 days he went to all 14 county courthouses in the sixth district of texas and filed the legal paperwork to request a hand count recount of every ballot that had been counted had been cast in the primary runoff in that runoff he coordinated some pro bono attorneys who represented me at each recount and we went from losing the election by 9 votes to winning the election by 10 votes to this day i think if it had not been for my little brother that might not have happened i can also remember when he came to see me about 4 years ago by now he was married and had two children and was practicing law in fort worth texas he said joe i have decided that i wanted to run for office i said john have you not seen enough of me and what i have done to convince you that there are better ways to make a living than trying to get elected and he said yes i have but i do not want to run for congress i want to run for district judge the county he was living in is the fourth largest county in texas so that meant that he had to run countywide in a county that has 1 million people i said john how much money do you have to run for office he said i dont have any money i said okay what kind of an organization do you have he said i dont have any organization i said okay have you done something notable in the county in a public way that your name is on the lips of all the voters he said i have not done that i said well why do you think you can win a district judgeship in tarrant county texas he said well if you can run for congress and win i know i can run for district judge and win i did not have an answer to that so i said okay so when he announced for district judge he announced in a seat for a position for a courtship that he did not think he would have any opposition in i felt pretty confident that he would win an uncontested election but that did not work out one of the biggest law firms in fort worth decide that they had an attorney that they wanted to run for that same position so an excellent attorney in fort worth who had an excellent reputation was well known in the legal community had impeccable credentials decided to run against john of course when that was announced we were not real happy about that but to make a long story short just like in my campaign in 1984 for congress where my mother and my father and my brother and my sister and my grandmother my aunt and uncle all the barton family and the bice family and the winslow family were out campaigning those same family members trekked up to tarrant county texas and we got on the telephones and we stood in front of the polling places and we handed out cards and we did all the grass roots things and again john was outspent but when the dust had cleared he won countywide he got the largest number of votes for any countywide office on the ballot and he almost got more votes than i did that kind of upset me a little bit but he has gone on to do an outstanding job in fact he has done such an outstanding job that this year he is up for reelection and he has no opponent when i go to tarrant county which is about half of my congressional district more and more now i am introduced as judge bartons brother which is a real tribute to him i really rise this

showed the communists how we coordinate our awacs with inflight refueling for longrange missions earlier in this session when i discovered this military exchange program and made it public the congress appealed to the defense department and passed legislation to end military exchanges that would benefit the warfighting skills of the chinese military these dod documents prove that the pentagon has ignored the will of congress instead they have not only jeopardized the 24 million people who live on democratic taiwan but this administration is in effect teaching the communist chinese how to improve their ability to kill americas defenders again this is bizarre it is almost surrealistic i beg my colleagues to pay attention to this i beg the administration to come to their senses quit trying to treat the worlds worst human rights abuser a regime that constantly reminds us that they do not believe in anything that america believes in hates everything america stands for i beg them to quit trying to call these people our strategic partners and training them how to do their military i stand ready to give my colleagues all of these documents upon request"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "2

eliminate this multibilliondollar bureaucracy with confused missions and questionable priorities frankly these are responsibilities that should be handled again by the department of defense we should

playing partisan games with the retirement dollars of hardworking americans when the president says we cannot trim waste 1 percent from the massive federal budget in order to protect social security i cannot help but question his priorities paying for more wasteful spending of taxpayer dollars or protecting social security the choice is simple as we close in on a final budget let us be very clear on one thing we will not go home until every penny of the social security trust fund is protected and we are not going to raise taxes on working americans and we are going to keep the budget balanced

senate and signed by the democratic president of the united states the problem is that while the minority leadership and the white house are talking fiscal restraint many of their democratic colleagues are pushing for spending well above the approved levels the leaders and their rank and file and the omb should get on the same pige on this issue there is time to deliberate and craft

retirees but the young middle age and future generations what is going to be their future in terms of working and paying taxes and maybe or maybe not getting social security benefits when they retire social security probably is one of this countrys most successful programs in terms of helping people retire with some security when we started social security in 1935 when franklin roosevelt decided we should have a program to force savings and pay for some disability insurance while you are working rather than risk the poor house at that time there were something like 52 workers for each social security retiree remember it is a payasyougo program existing current workers pay in their social security tax and that tax immediately goes out to pay benefits for existing retirees by the time we got to 1940 there were 38 people working paying in their taxes for every one retiree this year we have three people working three people working paying in their taxes to cover each retirees benefits a couple of things have happened politicians in this chamber the senate and the presidents decided to increase benefits over the yearsbecause it was popular when there was not enough money they increased taxes and borrowing by 2025 over on the far righthand side of this chart you see there are only going to be two workers paying in their taxes for each retiree we started out back in 1940 having a 3 percent tax on the first 1 500 of wages today we have increased that to 12 4 percent on the first almost 76 000 of wages so i hope we all agree one of our challenges is not to increase taxes yet again demographics of longer life span and lower birth rates have also greatly affected solvency the diminishing return on our social security investment should concern us all the real return of social security is less than 2 percent for the average worker in the united states again not counting the amount of the social security tax that pays for the disability insurance portion workers get a real return of less than 2 percent on the taxes paid in for some there is zero return on their social security they are never going to live long enough to get back what they and their employer put into it but still 1 9 percent is the average minorities do not get back what they pay in a young black male for example is going live on the average 62 years that means they pay in all of their life but do not get benefits but the average real return for the market is over 7 percent part of the solution for social security has got to be a better return on the investment this chart shows the number of years you are going to have to live after retirement to get back the money that you and your employer paid in just to break even if you were lucky enough to retire in 1940 it took 2 months if you retired 5 years ago in 1995 you are going to have to live 16 years after retirement to break even on average if you retire in 2005 2015 or 2025 it is unlikely you are going to ever get back what you put into this system even a c d or extra safe investments in the marketplace would give more to retirees governor bush is suggesting limitations on any such investments it can only be used for retirement purposes it has to be limited to safe investments we have companies now that will guarantee a return greater than social security without taking any risks so our challenge is we have to get people this congress the president to develop legislation to save social security it is easy to put off the fixing to the next generation or future congresses vice president gore has suggested adding giant ious that demand increasing taxes later the last president should have dealt with the problem the next president should not put oft solutions that will keep social security solvent for the next 75 years right now there is enough money coming in to pay benefits up until an estimated 2015 we need to take action we cannot keep putting it off"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a message to
