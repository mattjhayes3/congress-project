defense has taken no steps to award combat benefits to the casualties or even officially recognize the attack as a terrorist incident the house and senate have included two reform measures in the ndaa which we just passed while additional attacks have been attempted by similar highprofile radical islamic terrorists it is past time for the government to deliver on this act here we are almost 3 years later and theres been a recent report that has come out and in that report it references this incident of this slaughter of american troops on fort hood soil in texas it references that it shall be taken up as part of workplace violence the obama regime calls the fort hood shooting workplace violence sure its workplace violence its where they work and its violence but we have a concept of what workplace violence is and your normal workplace violence is not preceded by a shout by the shooter god is great in the arabic language its not preceded by discussions by the alleged perpetrator its alleged because he hasnt been convicted yet and we in a free american world take the position that all are innocent until proven guilty so we will call him the alleged shooter but theres clear evidence in reports by the defense department and by reports by the news media reports by witnesses on the scene reports by his fellow soldiers reports by folks from walter reed hospital where this americantrained militarytrained doctor worked that he had advocated that the american soldier was wrong and that he was contrary and he spoke and preached islamic terrorism so your normal workplace violence thats not a part of the factor yet this is what happened in this case senator collins on wednesday blasted the defense department and bless her for it for classifying the fort hood massacre as workplace violence and suggested political correctness is being placed above the security of the nations armed forces at home ive been talking about this now since the day after this happened we cant have a world where political correctness fails to define the criminal act by its very nature whether were talking about military law and the criminal relations in military law were just talking about criminal acts in general we have to be able to define them just to make the system work we have to be able to define them but more importantly we owe a duty and a responsibility to the american soldier to call an event what it is and not try to put a smokescreen over it or cloud the issue or in any way worry about the feelings of groups because the definition is the definition this man identified himself that he was committing this act in the name of god is great in arabic he acknowledged when questioned that it was part of his mission he acknowledged that he had dealt with terrorist spokesmen in the past and that the concept came from his interaction with awlaki and others so this guy is an islamic terrorist theres no other way you can describe this gentleman but now years after the event as he sits in the bell county jail in belton texas we continue to have reports coming down from our defense department that the folks that are responsible for our soldiers and responsible for those who died in this incident want to downplay this to be treated as an incident of workplace violence with all the white bread connotation that that has to me we ought to be ashamed of ourselves so lets look at some of the evidence we have that connects this to islamic terrorism recognizing the november 5 2009 attack on fort hood texas as an act of radical islamic terrorism and jihad anwar awlaki connection now mr awlaki is no longer with us we have taken that boy out yet the bottom line is at the time this happened they were directly connected this man preached taught and encouraged violenceislamic terrorist violence hasans presentations to the dod on jihad justification he would argue with his fellow soldiers about the justification for having jihad against the american military mr hasan was a member of the united states army he was a major he had been serving in the medical corps as a psychiatrist he was trained with american taxpayer dollars but he was preaching jihad to soldiers and there was lots of evidence i had a bill which was included in this recent defense bill that we just passed it said that this guy was telling people that hed believed in this kind of thing since medical school now hes a major serving as a psychiatrist advising our soldiers hasan purchased and practiced with highcapacity firearms prior to the attack he went out and he bought firearms he bought them at a local gun store of the guns that were used in the killings one of them was a semiautomatic weapon with a large magazine capacity he went out to the firing range and familiarized himself with these weapons prior to this incident you cant think of this as some guy who goes postal all of a sudden this guy was planning this whole event he shouts god is great in arabic before he starts shooting but they refer to it in the context of the broader threat of workplace violence i think there is a very good argument that the evidence shows this was a premeditated act on the part of major hasan and i believe when this case finally gets to trial that the evidence will be overwhelming that it was premeditated at the time of the event lieutenant general cone the iii corps commander at fort hood told nbcs today show on the friday after the shooting that the soldiers who witnessed the shooting rampage that left 13 people dead reported that the gunman shouted allahu akbar which means god is great before opening fire at the texas post the day after it was being reported that he did this yet in the initial report that came out from the defense department the mans name didnt even appear the relationship to any islamic terrorism was not referenced it was like any major from any outfit just wandered in and started shooting soldiers like he was having a bad day or something now we get another comment saying that were going to treat this in the bigger scope of workplace violence certainly we want to prevent workplace violence in every workplace but the connotation is that this is just something that happened its not something that just happened because quite honestly since that time others have been caught who reportedly were trying to imitate this shooter mr hasan we introduced a bill the fort hood families benefits protection act it would award both military and civilian casualties of the ford hood attack with combat status to ensure full benefits and eligibility for the purple heart and other awards and for the civilian award equivalence to the secretary of defenses defense of freedom medal now why did i ask for that because there was a precedent for it when they flew the plane into the pentagon on 9 11 this is what was the finding of the department of defensethat it was an act of terrorism and therefore they should be treated as combat casualties and those two medals were awarded this didnt just come off the top of my head this is what happened with the first terrorist attack in our country and with the second or third or whatever attack this one was when this man walked into that room there were people in civilian garb and there were people in uniform he went out of his way to shoot the people in uniform the civilians who were injured were injured because of misfire or misdirection as he walked down that line his target was all of those soldiers who were doing nothing more than either coming back from being off post and out of the countryor wherever theyd beenor preparing for their next duty stations wherever they may be goingiraq or afghanistan they were being processed and they were in this big room he walked down the line shooting everybody in uniform now when youre killing our combat soldiers and when youre crying out slogans of the jihad terrorists why wouldnt you think its a terrorist attack and why shouldnt these people who died in the line of duty be treated like those at the pentagon who died in the line of duty in fact except for what we were able to put together in circumstantial evidence after the fact at the time of the incident we had no idea who flew that plane into the pentagon we just made an educated guess in this case before this shooting started the guy identified himself and what his mission was for some reason in this world of political correctness someone has the idea that this is good for the morale of our military soldiers or that its good for something as i think the chief of staff said when this happened oh this is sure going to hurt our islamic outreach program whether its good for that or not i hold nothing against the islamic people nor does anybody at fort hood but we hold a lot against islamic terrorists who kill soldiers and the department of defense should have the guts to step up and to stand up for these soldiers i see my good

from doing that the entire school was designated as a cafeteria and the schools were then penalized you see by the standards that were created if a kid buys a coke and then takes it to lunch to drink

memorial the schoolchildren who collected money so it could be built many years ago but make it a memorial for all who served in world war i the second thing it would do is also designate the liberty memorial in kansas city as the world war i museum which would be in kansas city missouri you see it is the museum in the united states that honors and recognizes the history of world war i and the third thing that this bill would do is set up a commission so america can commemorate world war i you see its almost been 100 years since that war started not much is being said about world war i i asked a person not too long ago what he remembers about world war i from history books and he said isnt that the war where snoopy fought the red baron unfortunately too many americans know nothing

the money we did and i can recall being here on the floor and having democratic friends beating us up rightfully so because in 2006 we spent 160 billion more than we had coming in we didnt have to do that we shouldnt have done that i would never have dreamed that 5 short years later that with the democratic majority the spending would have exploded once they had no friction between a democratic president and a democratic congress and that we would go from the 160 billion in deficit spending in 2006 that republicans got beat up for to 1 6 trillion in deficit spending10 times moreand people still thinking thats somehow okay it wasnt okay for republicans to overspend by 160 billion and its not okay for this democratic senate and president to continue to push to spend 1 6 trillion more than the 2 2 trillion we supposedly will have coming in now were told today were going to have a vote on a republican bill a little surprising to some of us republicans we passed a bill cut cap and balance it wasnt what i wanted i liked the balanced budget amendment with a percentage of gdp cap on spending to help rein congress in and that was negotiable on the percentage but it also had 111 billion out of 1 6 trillion that would have been cut from spending that just wasnt enough but the balanced budget amendment if it had been passed and become part of the law was enough of a game changer it was worth voting for then the senate sits back and says were not going to go for that were not going to pass anything so pass something else and now our leadership has heard the call of leader reid down the hall and is going to bring another bill and i know the intentions of both sides of the aisle want the best for the country i get that i understand that we have different ideas on how that can be done and i know that there are people in my party that want to keep beating up on me because i cant vote for a bill that only cuts 1 trillion out of 15 trillion to 16 trillion that will be deficit spending over the next 10 years because its easy to do the math we cut 1 trillion out of 15 trillion 16 trillion over the next 10 years and if we can keep doing that and there are no assurances we can every 10 years cut another trillion then when i have my 207th birthday we can celebrate that year a balanced budget and we will have only added 120 trillion to the 14 3 trillion deficit now i cant vote for that politically were told this is the political thing to do youve got to do the political thing if you dont vote for the boehner bill youre voting for obama thats not true if the senate will pass anythinganythingthen we could drive this to a conference committee and get a compromise the senate has to pass something well think about this scenario very quickly we pass this say hypothetically the senate says oh well you pushed us to the edge of the cliff we didnt want to vote for this then they pass it just like we did and the president says i was going to veto but were on the edge of the cliff a 100 percent republican bill they wouldnt compromise and now they say well gee republicans inherited the economy its not right practically its not right politically lets

november 5 2009 since that time the department of defense has taken no steps to award combat benefits to the casualties or even officially recognize the attack as a terrorist incident the house and senate have included two reform measures in the ndaa which we just passed while additional attacks have been attempted by similar highprofile radical islamic terrorists it is past time for the government to deliver on this act here we are almost 3 years later and theres been a recent report that has come out and in that report it references this incident of this slaughter of american troops on fort hood soil in texas it references that it shall be taken up as part of workplace violence the obama regime calls the fort hood shooting workplace violence sure its workplace violence its where they work and its violence but we have a concept of what workplace violence is and your normal workplace violence is not preceded by a shout by the shooter god is great in the arabic language its not preceded by discussions by the alleged perpetrator its alleged because he hasnt been convicted yet and we in a free american world take the position that all are innocent until proven guilty so we will call him the alleged shooter but theres clear evidence in reports by the defense department and by reports by the news media reports by witnesses on the scene reports by his fellow soldiers reports by folks from walter reed hospital where this americantrained militarytrained doctor worked that he had advocated that the american soldier was wrong and that he was contrary and he spoke and preached islamic terrorism so your normal workplace violence thats not a part of the factor yet this is what happened in this case senator collins on wednesday blasted the defense department and bless her for it for classifying the fort hood massacre as workplace violence and suggested political correctness is being placed above the security of the nations armed forces at home ive been talking about this now since the day after this happened we cant have a world where political correctness fails to define the criminal act by its very nature whether were talking about military law and the criminal relations in military law were just talking about criminal acts in general we have to be able to define them just to make the system work we have to be able to define them but more importantly we owe a duty and a responsibility to the american soldier to call an event what it is and not try to put a smokescreen over it or cloud the issue or in any way worry about the feelings of groups because the definition is the definition this man identified himself that he was committing this act in the name of god is great in arabic he acknowledged when questioned that it was part of his mission he acknowledged that he had dealt with terrorist spokesmen in the past and that the concept came from his interaction with awlaki and others so this guy is an islamic terrorist theres no other way you can describe this gentleman but now years after the event as he sits in the bell county jail in belton texas we continue to have reports coming down from our defense department that the folks that are responsible for our soldiers and responsible for those who died in this incident want to downplay this to be treated as an incident of workplace violence with all the white bread connotation that that has to me we ought to be ashamed of ourselves so lets look at some of the evidence we have that connects this to islamic terrorism recognizing the november 5 2009 attack on fort hood texas as an act of radical islamic terrorism and jihad anwar awlaki connection now mr awlaki is no longer with us we have taken that boy out yet the bottom line is at the time this happened they were directly connected this man preached taught and encouraged violenceislamic terrorist violence hasans presentations to the dod on jihad justification he would argue with his fellow soldiers about the justification for having jihad against the american military mr hasan was a member of the united states army he was a major he had been serving in the medical corps as a psychiatrist he was trained with american taxpayer dollars but he was preaching jihad to soldiers and there was lots of evidence i had a bill which was included in this recent defense bill that we just passed it said that this guy was telling people that hed believed in this kind of thing since medical school now hes a major serving as a psychiatrist advising our soldiers hasan purchased and practiced with highcapacity firearms prior to the attack he went out and he bought firearms he bought them at a local gun store of the guns that were used in the killings one of them was a semiautomatic weapon with a large magazine capacity he went out to the firing range and familiarized himself with these weapons prior to this incident you cant think of this as some guy who goes postal all of a sudden this guy was planning this whole event he shouts god is great in arabic before he starts shooting but they refer to it in the context of the broader threat of workplace violence i think there is a very good argument that the evidence shows this was a premeditated act on the part of major hasan and i believe when this case finally gets to trial that the evidence will be overwhelming that it was premeditated at the time of the event lieutenant general cone the iii corps commander at fort hood told nbcs today show on the friday after the shooting that the soldiers who witnessed the shooting rampage that left 13 people dead reported that the gunman shouted allahu akbar which means god is great before opening fire at the texas post the day after it was being reported that he did this yet in the initial report that came out from the defense department the mans name didnt even appear the relationship to any islamic terrorism was not referenced it was like any major from any outfit just wandered in and started shooting soldiers like he was having a bad day or something now we get another comment saying that were going to treat this in the bigger scope of workplace violence certainly we want to prevent workplace violence in every workplace but the connotation is that this is just something that happened its not something that just happened because quite honestly since that time others have been caught who reportedly were trying to imitate this shooter mr hasan we introduced a bill the fort hood families benefits protection act it would award both military and civilian casualties of the ford hood attack with combat status to ensure full benefits and eligibility for the purple heart and other awards and for the civilian award equivalence to the secretary of defenses defense of freedom medal now why did i ask for that because there was a precedent for it when they flew the plane into the pentagon on 9 11 this is what was the finding of the department of defensethat it was an act of terrorism and therefore they should be treated as combat casualties and those two medals were awarded this didnt just come off the top of my head this is what happened with the first terrorist attack in our country and with the second or third or whatever attack this one was when this man walked into that room there were people in civilian garb and there were people in uniform he went out of his way to shoot the people in uniform the civilians who were injured were injured because of misfire or misdirection as he walked down that line his target was all of those soldiers who were doing nothing more than either coming back from being off post and out of the countryor wherever theyd beenor preparing for their next duty stations wherever they may be goingiraq or afghanistan they were being processed and they were in this big room he walked down the line shooting everybody in uniform now when youre killing our combat soldiers and when youre crying out slogans of the jihad terrorists why wouldnt you think its a terrorist attack and why shouldnt these people who died in the line of duty be treated like those at the pentagon who died in the line of duty in fact except for what we were able to put together in circumstantial evidence after the fact at the time of the incident we had no idea who flew that plane into the pentagon we just made an educated guess in this case before this shooting started the guy identified himself and what his mission was for some reason in this world of political correctness someone has the idea that this is good for the morale of our military soldiers or that its good for something as i think the chief of staff said when this happened oh this is sure going to hurt our islamic outreach program whether its good for that or not i hold nothing against the islamic people nor does anybody at fort hood but we hold a lot against islamic terrorists who kill soldiers and the department of defense should have the guts to

machines were and there was not a wall by our standards to stop them from doing that the entire school was designated as a cafeteria and the schools were then penalized you see by the standards that were created if a kid buys a coke and then takes it to lunch to drink thats nutritional but if he buys his lunch first and then goes down to buy a coke that is now by our standards unhealthy snickers
