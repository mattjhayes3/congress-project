terrorists although customs and border protection analyzes cargo and other information to target specific shipments for closer inspection it still physically inspects only a small fraction of the containers under its purview we cannot allow the threat that our current port security system allows to continue terrorists have already attacked our nation once there is every reason to believe that they will try againpossibly with a weapon of mass destruction a weapon that could be smuggled into our ports that is why i support the three tiered approach h r 4954 the safe port act of 2006 takes to address port security we must secure our ports and the containers that travel through them at home abroad and in transit to the united states h r 4954 takes important strides to accomplish this by requiring the department of homeland security to deploy nuclear and radiological detection systems at 22 important seaports by the end of fy07 additionally this legislation puts an emphasis on traininga key component to readiness our port police local law enforcement and longshoremen need an established training program with set guidelines from homeland security to deal with security breaches and terrorist attacks this bill will create one for containers in transit to our shores this legislation requires the secretary of homeland security to develop standards for sealing containers en route to the united states the safe ports act boosts private sector investment into security by devoting 25 million a year to forge private public partnerships to bring new technologies and techniques to market faster for overseas ports this bill realizes that our homeland security does not end at our borders instead we need to take a global approach to the way we protect our nation

of congress this document critical condition the state of the unions health care 2006 put out by my office in that we outlined many programs that would help reduce costs ofhealth care in america let me expand on one of them about community health centers which are nonprofit centers to provide primary and preventative care for folks who are low income or who are uninsured and underinsured however a recent report by the journal of the american medical association said that although these clinics are of tremendous value there is a shortage of medical personnel at them a study published by dr roger rosenblatt of the university of washington says that there is a 13 percent shortage of family physicians a 20 percent shortage of obstetricians and a 22 5 percent shortage of psychiatrists for these positions oddly enough if a physician is employed by a community health center they are covered by the federal liability but if someone wants to volunteer at a clinic they are not it is important that we provide mechanisms to allow physicians and other medical personnel to volunteer at these clinics america needs that the uninsured and underinsured need that and quite frankly it

would be appropriate this evening if we spent a few moments looking at the constitution but in order to really understand the milieu in which the constitution was created i think we need to go back 11 years before the constitution was ratified to the declaration of independence in there we read these words we hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal we mouth those words today and then we move on to the next clause and they mean so little to us compared to what they meant to our founding fathers you see most of our founding fathers came from countries in the british isles and in europe that were ruled by a king or an emperor who claimed and incredibly was granted divine rights what that says is that the rights came from god to the king or the emperor and he would give what rights he wished to the people and we made a stark departure from that fourscore and 7 years later abraham lincoln was to note that this new experiment might not work he said in his gettysburg address that we are now engaged in a great war testing whether this nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure we hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness it took 11 years for the promise of the declaration of independence to be fulfilled in the constitution that was ratified in 1787 the ink was hardly dry on the constitution before our founding fathers wondered if it really was clear that they meant to have a very limited federal government with essentially all of the rights belonging to the people and so they wrote 12 amendments 10 of them made it through that process of twothirds of

when it comes to immigration a lot of people with selfpromoting agendas do a lot of talking they have hidden motives that range from political to monetary to cultural however the only motive for immigration should be what is best for america not what is best for cheap labor not what is best for third world countries not what is best for obtaining more votes for the left not what is best for any specific race creed or religion but what is best for america that should be our immigration policy people who enter the united states must serve a purpose for the greater good of this nation a little history is due over 100 years ago this nation welcomed immigrants through ellis island in new york where people would come from all over the world into new york harbor they would be seen at ellis island these individuals would be examined they would be questioned and if this person saw after the immigrant was examined to be healthy and ready to work in america they were allowed to come in that process did not take a great amount of time now today if people want to come to the united states legally there is so much bureaucratic nonsense that it takes a long time for people who wish to become citizens or people who wish to work here or go to school here if they do it the right way the legal way we have all heard of the excuses and the socalled explanations for why it takes so long to allow people to come to the united states the legal way they are just excuses they are not reasons i am an advocate of immigration legal immigration 1515 i am proud of the fact that my ancestors came from scotland and the hardheaded ones came from germany but you know madam speaker we discriminate in this country against people who want to come here the legal way the rightway those who want to do something for america and not to america to the benefit of the lawless illegals who disrespect our rules the rule of law and our nation the battle for the border is upon us and i am not talking about iraq i am not talking about afghanistan i am talking about the american border we have an invasion going on in this country we have a colonization of our nation by other nations and we watch it and do very little you know this lawlessness on our borders breeds more lawlessness and it is only getting worse last week i was on this house floor and i invited some colleagues especially those down the hallway to go with me to the south texas border i guess they could not go because they were on their yachts sipping wine off cape cod and found other things that they could do better but i spent the last weekend down on the south texas border at a place called laredo texas and on this map here we have portions of texas mexif the gulf of mexico and laredo texas is in this dark blue that is webb county texas south of it is zapata county texas webb county just to give you some information is bigger than the state of delaware and i spent the weekend there with the sheriff of webb county sheriff flores and also the sheriff of zapata county sheriff gonzalez ziggy gonzalez and we found what occurs there on a daily basis is something that all americans should be aware of sheriff rick flores sheriff of webb county texas a place bigger than the state of delaware has 13 deputies patrolling the whole state and when we went down to the border he made sure that before we went to certain portions of the texasmexico border that we were armed with m16 rifles that we went with his small swat team that had body armor and helmets because he said there are places on the texas border with mexico you do not get close to the river without body armor now we are talking about the united states being inside the united states we are not talking about being in some foreign country but yet our sheriffs are concerned about their safety and the safety of people who are near our southern border because of what is going on on the other side of the border i spent some time years ago at checkpoint charlie inberlin you remember that is the place where the american sector was separated from the soviet sector that soviet sector looked into the grayness the darkness the bleakness of communism in eastern europe and how we had to patrol that border for americas safety and when i was on the texas border in laredo texas it reminded me of checkpoint charlie because of the violence that is occurring along our lawless southern border sheriff flores when he took us around along with his deputies also along with texas ranger doyle holdridge he tried to explain to me in very simple matters that this is an american issue this is not a partisan issue this as he said is a red white and blue issue the importance of protecting the sovereignty of the united states against the illegal invasion of people coming across our border and how many are we talking about in texas alone we are talking about 5 000 a day illegally coming into the united states we are talking about in our country now 11 to 14 million people who came in from canada or mexico illegally without permission and so he patrols that area he does his regular duties but he is concerned about three items three things and they all have to do with illegal activity he is concerned about the illegal drug cartels that operate in mexico and southern america and work their way up through the united states and to through laredo as you can see from this map laredo here is the center port in the united states it is the busiest inland port in the united states every day 7 000 18wheelers cross into the united states from this location about that many o south as well and they disseminate up to the northeast and to the midwest that is why this is the battle for the border because the drug cartels want to control this area and we have got more than one drug cartel down there fighting among themselves as to who will control the border so the first reason is for the drug trafficking that illegally comes into the united states is a concern to these sheriffs on the texas border the second concern is the illegal immigrants that come through that area many of those people brought into the united states by coyotes these are the people who for money make a profit off the human trafficking bringing people into the united states illegally and the third reason and maybe the most important reason is because sheriff flores and sheriff gonzalez are concerned about homeland security they areconcerned about those terrorists that wish to do us harm the next terrorist that commits a crime in the united states probably is not going to fly over here land at reagan national airport get off the airplane and look around do some damage they are probably not going to do that it is too difficult they are just going to probably come across the southern texas border as thousands of people do each day so those are three reasons that this nation needs to have an immigration policy that works an immigration policy that promotes legal immigration and an immigration policy that says no to those people who wish to come here illegally and to try to put things in perspective let us talk about the drug cartels that come up through the southern border of the united states now i am not going to spend a lot of time talking about the problems with driigs and how it affects americans but we know it does from schoolyards from the east coast to the west coast but their port of entry like those 7 000 trucks coming into the united states at laredo is right here the drug cartels have more money they have better electronic equipment they have better firepower they have better intelligence networks than our local sheriffs do our local sheriffs when we were down on the border we used night vision equipment but that was borrowed equipment the sheriffs tell me that on the other side of the border the drug cartels have the best night vision equipment that can be purchased they also have better body armor than americans do and not only that the drug cartels use satellite phones and they track our peace officers with gps in other words we have got a deputy sheriff out here on patrol in webb county or zapata county he uses his cell phone to make a call the drug cartels track where he is using gps and they can track his cell phone and know his location they not only know where our peace officers are they know where they all live they know the names of their family members they know the routine that they take each day you see these drug cartels are the enemy they are the enemy to america and yet our sheriffs they make do with what they have got you know they would like night vision equipment so they can patrol that area nightvision equipment that they do not have to borrow from the federal government they would like offroad vehicles satellite phones they have even suggested and asked while i was down there you think congressman poe when you go back to washington you can get us a humvee for our county now they do not want four or five they want one humvee for each of these 16 qounties on the texasmexico border so that they can track those drug cartels i tried to make a few phone calls this week to see how difficult that would be to obtain some used humvee that we brought back from the war in iraq that we are never going to use that this country will just put somewhere and let it rust and then melt it down to steel and the bureaucracy the red tape just to find the person who can make that decision was not possible but it would seem to me that while we fight the war on iraq when we bring those vehicles even those damaged vehicles back to the united states that are no longer going to be used by our military why cant the federal government just give a few of those to these border sheriffs along this border so they can protect and serve our nation better but so far that cannot happen because there is too much bureaucracy involved i mentioned the sheriffs deputies and how they are doing a great job sheriff flores and sheriff gonzalez but they too are concerned about their own safety we know that one of these local sheriffs departments they have to protect their own kids when they go to school that they use peace officers to escort their children to and from school because they are afraid of the safety of their own children this ought not to be you know the drug cartels more than anything else they have more money than our local sheriffs because it is all about money follow the money trail and in here it is a tremendous amount of money that we are talking about the drug cartels these are the people who that are the runners for lack of a better phrase that actually bring the drugs across from mexico into the united states those people who do that make 30 000 a week that is right just drug runners make 30 000 a week bringing that dope into the united states you know what a sheriff makes in texas on this border they make 40 000 a year a deputy sheriff makes about 22 000 a year a federal peace officer in mexico makes about 20 000 a year that is right these drug cartels have more money they pay their drug runners about 10 times what our local law enforcement make it is all about money and they are willing to do it they are willing to take that risk because of the amount of money that is involved in illegal drugrunning into the united states we know also that there have been many individuals that have for whatever reason been trained in the past in the united states for countries south of the border that have gone over to the other side see they can make more money they can make more of that filthy lucre if they work for the bad guys if they work for the outlaws one of those groups happens to be guatemalantrained forces that are now mercenaries for the cartels this is a photograph that was taken on the texasmexico border this top photograph it was taken with night vision equipment borrowed of course this is the mexico border this is the rio grande river and on this side is the texas american border now this photograph you would think maybe these are just some river rafters going down the rio grande river not so we know now that this photograph is taken of guatemalan mercenaries that have gone over to the other side and work for the bad guys work for the drug cartel they are all dressed in their camo outfits they have obviously backpacks probably drugs in bags in this raft you see a person in front with his little ak47 protecting the dope as they cross in from mexico to the united states this is our border this is what takes place on our borders and while some people in this house are so insistent on talking about the minute things that occur in this country maybe we should be concerned about the sovereignty and invasion of our country by these outlaws that are bringing drugs into this country the photograph below is a photograph we took last weekend it is a difficult one to see but you see two folks in here down here by the river this is mexico on this side rio grande river we are standing on this sidq over here on the texas american side there is an individual getting ready to get into the river come into the united states but over here the sheriffs department tells us this individual who has got his hand on his pistol in his holster is one of those drug cartel runners protecting his drugs but that is just a typical scene what it looks like looking across the river now remember when we went down to this area of the texasmexico border we were armed we were armed with m16 rifles we were armed with individuals who were from the swat teams of these two sheriffs departments because you see it is not safe and one reason it is not safe is because of the drug cartels that are bringing drugs in from other countries through our open borders so it is important that we first secure the borders because of the illegal invasion of people who wish to not only come here illegally but to bring that cancer into the united states and sell it for a profit these people who wish to make a profit off the weaknesses of other individuals and i am talking about drug dealers we also notice down here on the texas side of the rio grande river where the entry places would be for those individuals who want to come in here illegally not necessarily drug runners but some of them were the way they do that many times they will cross the river they will swim across the river without any clothes on they put their clothes in a plastic bag and when they get across the river they dry off and then put their clothes on of course they dispose of the bags and any other trash throughout that entire area we saw numerous trash bags where people had disposed of the bags and other litter all along that texas border especially on those routes that come into the united states i talked to a rancher down in zapata county not too long ago and he was telling me that his ranch down in zapata county right next to the border is like as he said shermans march to the sea i asked him to explain that he said you remember general sherman that union general that invaded the south and burned everything he came across until he got to atlanta he said that is what my ranch looks like in parts where people have come in across the border into the united states illegally and they have destroyed everything in their path just to get farther inland we are talking about american property property rights something that probably we ought to be concerned about the property of americans along our border however our ranchers do not have it that easy they have been warned by the drug cartels to be their friend because they do not want them to be their enemy veiled threats some ranchers have been promised money or they will be harmed they say it is either silver or lead what that means is we will pay you to let us cross your land or there will be lead which is a bullet idle threats i do not think so threats to ranchers to let those drug cartels and those human smugglers come across their land but this is the way these people must live sheriff flores made a comment near the end of our trip with him and his deputies and sheriff gonzales he said our biggest concern is national security he said these people will take money to smuggle people across our border they will take money to smuggle drugs across our border and they will take money to smuggle terrorists across our border it is an issue of national security let me continue a little bit about how much we are talking about besides drugs without demonstrating all the packages of narcotics let me just show you two photographs these were taken by the local sheriff departments down in south texas this cache of weapons up here you might think these were found in iraq somewhere saddam husseins outlaws might have had these not so this cache of weapons was found by a local sheriff department stopping a vehicle coming in yes to the united states from oursouthern border and you see the automatic weapons at the top you see a couple of pistols here and then you see grenadelaunching weapons at the bottom an invasion into the united states of illegal weapons just a brief moment about terrorist activity and how simple it is i mentioned 7 000 trucks a day coming into laredo this is no secret you can find this kind of information on the internet right here we have about six or seven hand grenades if you look closely you will see that the pin has been pulled from the hand grenades all of these here are just nondetonated bombs each hand grenade is wrapped in a plastic the pin is pulled and you can put one of these hand grenades near a vehicles engine it will melt the plastic and thus detonate the hand grenade these were found before they were ever used by local law enforcement down on the border just a simple way how terrorists can bring weapons into the united states weapons that their purpose is to do americans harm so i would hope that we as a nation understand that our first responders are the people who know the communities and part of those people are the sheriffs and the local police agencies while it is true i have not said much about the federal agents that are on the border i think we must be concerned equally as well in helping our first responders because they are in this battle too they know the territory they know the people and they know who the outlaws are because most of these individuals most of these first responders were raised in this entire area we have 11 to 14 million people living in this country illegally amnesty of course is not the answer we also have reports that members of al qaeda reside down here south of the american border in parts of mexico they infiltrate mexico of course illegally they assume the identity ofu hispanic individuals they learn the spanish language and then when time is appropriate they come across the american border and assimilate s some cowntrodden ilegaloimiigrant into the united states t we know that is occurring and so that is why i make the comments about those terrorists who wish to do us harm they are going to come from south of the border as the battle for iraq races on the battle for the border the battle for laredo continues let me mention what has occurred across the border from laredo laredo is a little over 100 000 people right here between zapata county and webb county across the county or across the american line into mexico is nuevo laredo it has about 400 000 individuals at least it used to because now people are leaving this year in nuevo laredo because of the violence of the drug cartels 155 people have been murdered sixteen police officers in nuevo laredo have been murdered we know that one of the police chiefs recent police chiefs 6 hours after he was sworn in as police chief of nuevo laredo was gunned down and he had 35 bullet holes in him because you see he was not going to work with the drug cartels we know that 44 americans have been kidnapped out of the united states and taken across the border and in all of those cases not one case has been solved not one of those murders has been resolved not one of those kidnappings has been cleared interesting this is the world we live in a world that we should be concerned about the world south of the american border we know that nuevo laredo because of the drug cartels because of location into the united states or near the united states and where the drugs can go has become a haven for drug traffickers a haven for gun running and a haven for those coyotes that bring people into the united states illegally just to give one example because there are numerous examples of the violence and the victims that occur both in mexico and the united states because of this illegal drug activity a couple of years ago there was a young teenage girl in laredo texas who met a guy from laredo who had a mercedes and he had a lot of money in his pocket and he was a teenager as well the girls mother told her do not get caught up with him he is up to no good stay in school get an education well what happened was he was one of those individuals who worked for the drug cartel but he was working on the american side and he owed some money to that drug cartel so one evening both of those teenagers were kidnapped taken back across the border they were beaten bags were puts over their heads and both of those teenagers were buried alive it is just one example of what happens down on the war for the border one thing that i have done to try to put some progress in our immigration policy is to 4ntroduce the dill requiring passports for all people who enter the united states t the 9 11 commission and itsr extensive report made recommendations that the united states require passports for everyone coming into the united states from south of the border and north of the border now we give people a pass from canada mexico and the caribbean islands they do not have to present a passport all they have to do is show up at the border present one of hundreds of different types of documents including old baptismal records sometimes all they have to say is state the country that they are from and they come into the united states this passport bill will require some documentation that people coming into the united states if they want to come in here legally they have to do it the legal way they have to have a passport a passport with a bar card a passport with a bar card that can be scanned so that we can record who comes into the united states do you know we do not record the people who come across our border the canadian border or the mexican border why is that i do not know maybe it is best for canada maybe it is best for mexico but it is not best for the united states passports do not discriminate against any individual they treat everybody the same way of course we can ship a package from honduras to the united states it is recorded by ups on a bar card scanner at least 10 times we know the places that package went before it is opened up here in the house of representatives but yet we do not do that for people who come into the united states so this passport act is nondiscriminatory and it will require individuals to have a passport to come into the united states otherwise they cannot enter therefore it helps businesses as well because a person then is legally in the united states and has a legal visa with a photograph on that visa that they obtained from their government and our government when they go to get a job the business does not have to check social security cards and all these other documents they look on that passport to see how long they can stay in the united states so this is one step i think we should progress and look forward to having a passport for all individuals who come into the united states now we have gotten some criticism about this when i introduced the passport for all bill the criticism came from our northern representatives and some of our cana dian friends because they want open borders between canada and the united states they do not want to have to pay that 100 for a passport let us think about that 100 for a passport that lasts 10 years that is 1 a year 80 cqnts a month that is less than a cup of starbucks coffee so this argument that we do not want to pay the 100 is ridiculous for our atiqnal sepurity that is not asking too much for our canadian friends american or people south of the american border this is something we should do we should proceed with the recommendation of the 9 11 commission some have asked if the 9 11 commission recommended it why do we not have it already it is because of bureaucracy it is because people who do not want that recommendation enforced ignore it and so therefore it has not occurred and congress is going to have to pass a law to require it one other matter that i would like to mention about our texas border some have talked about the only way we can keep people out is to build a fence i am not sure about that madam speaker i think we should at least debate that issue on the house floor one thing that is occurring we are finding out that there are electronic cameras on the united states side that do a pretty ample job of watching the river the problem is when that camera spots someone coming across the river there is no one down there in the area to go down there and stop that illegal traffic whether it is a drug smuggler gun runner or someone coming into the united states illegally we need to use some common sense in immigration and the first thing we do is to make people who want to come to the united states legally have a simple process for them to do so and use passports to do that there are some absurdities that occur in our immigration policy and i would like to mention a few of those when our border agents capture people crossing into the united states from the southern border into the united states the texas portion many of those individuals are not from mexico a lot of times we assume that all thepeople illegally coming into texas and the united states are from mexico that is not true we do a disservice to mexico when we say that because over half the people that came into the united states illegally from the south last year they were not from mexico they are called otms other than mexico over 50 percent were from some other nation other than mexico they are from south america they are from central america they are from asia they are from china they are from europe but they are not from mexico these people are called otms because you see everybody in the world except maybe some americans all these people in the world know that the southern border of the united states is an open border and you can cross here in texas or in arizona or new mexico and in california 0i 1545 so that is wky people all over the world are working their way to mexico and coming across illegally into the united states in any event what happens vyhen bontder agents or sheriffs captvre on of these individuals well if you are frbm mexico here is what happens they are usually put in some kind of detention facility and shipped back across the border if they are caught near the border that does not occur once they make it into the inland but if they are captured near the border they are taken back after they are put in some detention facility for a short period of time if you are not from mexico that does not occur they are taken to a local magistrate in one of our federal courthouses on the border the person is standing before the federal magistrate they do not live in mexico they are from some other nation so because our detention facilities are so full and we do not have near enough detention facilities this person is released back into our country with the promise to appear in court in 6 months for their deportation hearing and then some of them are actually moved up further into the united states by our own federal authorities think about this this is catchandrelease we catch them and then we release them how absurd is that this occurs with individuals who are from nations or nations other than mexico people understand that so much so that many times when these otms cross the border once they make it to a major highway they stand in the middle of the highway waving their hands they want to be captured because as soon as they are captured they are released with that getoutofjailfree ticket that allows them to roam the united states for 6 months before appearing in court for their deportation hearing this ought not to be not only that 85 percent of these people never appear in court are we surprised of course not so when people come to the united states illegally for whatever reason and they are captured they must understand that our government has the fortitude and the will to send them home no matter where they come from we must find the resources use old military bases it does not make any difference find a place to housethose individuals until their quick deportation hearing when i say quick it should not take 6 months it should be resolved within a week ship them back where they came from because they have invaded the united states this ought not to be of course we know many of them come from the laredo webb county zapata county just for your information down here on the gulf of mexico we have brownsville texas on the american side and across there we have matamoros mexico it just so happens that people who are from china the chinese are ille gally entering the united state from that area that is the area of the country they have picked to illegally come into the unitedstates and the same is true tiere once they are captured they are released on their word to appear back in court and many of them most of them do not appear so we did not change this policy the catchandrelease it is no longer catchandrelease it should be catchanddeport and deport immediately if you are illegally in the united states we also have policies in some of our major cities that do riot make much sense and i call these policies the sanctuary hideouts these are laws in major metropolitan areas that prevent local law enforcement from arresting people who are in the city in the united states illegally let me give you an example unfortunately this is one of the policies we have had in the city of houston down in texas where i am from a houston police officer can arrest somebody for jaywalking but a houston police officer cannot inquire into the legal status of a person that is arrested for jaywalking in other words you can be confined or arrested for jaywalking but this peace officer cannot do anything about the fact the person is illegally in the united states cannot even ask the question the police officer will be disciplined this sanctuary policy this sanctuary hideout is a policy of our major cities so we allow different pockets of people who are illegally in the united states we give them sanctuary why do we do that i donot know it is not best for america it is best for somebody elses own agenda but it is not best for america a police officer used to have the power to arrest somebody find out if they are illegally in the united states take them over to ins and ins would deport them the local law enforcement worked very well with the federal authorities we should resume that policy so that we have individuals that are arrested here for one crime they could be turned over to federal authorities and be deported immediately but now local law enforcement cannot even ask them the question of where they are from or they will be disciplined this ought not to be when a person comes to the united states and a lot of people do god bless them they come here legally we make it so difficult for those individuals to do it the right way that they are tempted to do it the illegal way i will give an example in my southeast texas district down in jefferson county i talked to an individual that is a naturalized citizen from mexico came to the united states did it the right way proud american loves our country one of his sons is serving in the military but he has got another son down in mexico that he wants to bring to the unitedi states and there are ways you do that legally it has taken him 15 years to get that second son into the united states legally that is ridiculous that is absurd if we are going to let that individual in let us let him in if we are going to tell him no tell him no but make a decision all the red tape and all the paperwork 15 years is ridiculous this american citizen i was mentioning to you wants his son to come here the right way he has encouraged him not to illegally come into the unitedstates we have been told that there are some people that have been vaiting to come into the united states on immigration status for 20 years and have yet to hear from our immigration officials as to whether they can come in the united states or not so we can see why people come here illegally we also know that the administration in mexico encourages illegal immigration into the united states because they printed up a pamphlet that i have shown on this house floor before that explains how immigrants from mexico can illegally enter the united states and shows them where to go where to cross the border what to do when they are confronted by american officials et cetera we know that a person can purchase fake documents at flea markets get a forged social security card and come into the united states illegally and this is encouraged by other nations american taxpayers pay each year per taxpayer 2 700 for the cost of illegal immigration that is the cost we pay for those people who are here illegally 2 700 a piece that is how much americans have to pay americans pay americans always pay just some specific examples health care oh tonight we heard so much about the cost of health care over here on the other side we heard some moaning and groaning and weeping about the cost of health care in the united states but i will ask my friends across the aisle why do they not address one of the costs of health care costs in the united states and that is the cost that we pay for people who are in the system that are illegally in the united states obtaining health care that americans pay and they do not pay for it has been estimated by some health care officials that over 20 percent of the cost of health care is because of those people illegally in the united states obtaining health care that the rest of us have to pay for that ought not to be why do we not want to address that issue in health care costs because it is political we cannot make a political case out of health care costs well maybe we should deal with the truth and the reality we know that many illegal immigrants when they want health care they just show up at the emergency room and because of our policies in this country i am not saying it is right or wrong i am just saying when they show up at the emergency room they are taken care of of course emergency room treatment is the most expensive treatment in health care but that is where those individuals go the rest of us pay for it maybe we ought to be sending some of those bills down south of the border and letting those other countries pay for the health care costs that we are paying for that health care cost that their citizens are taking from the rest of us something else we have heard a lot about in recent weeks is education and the cost of education in the united states it costs a lot of money not only with your local schools up through the 12th grade but individuals who wish to go on to college i had four kids and i know the expense of education all of them have finished college but one one is still in college but let us talk about education people in education tell us that part of the education costs is because of people who are illegally in the united states that we educate free let me explain that to you let us use this example let us say i decided to go to france and some of the things i have said about the french government they probably would not let me in legally so i would have to sneak into france and i am going to take my whole family with me so i sneak into france i take my four kids i show up someplace and say educate all of us and educate us in the english language because we do not speak french if i did that you would think that was absurd of course the french government would not let that happen would they no country in the world would let that happen they would get rid of me first second they sure would not let me go to school and would not pay for it or educate me in english or texan whichever but yet a person can come to the united states show up to one of our schools take their kids there and we educate them because we educate everybody that is in this country i am not saying it is right or wrong i just say we do it we educate them in their language and yet the rest of us pay for that so maybe we ought to reevaluate the cost of education the cost of medical health care in light of the fact that it costs americans so much to pay for the education and medical expenses of people here illegally let me talk one more thing about education i mentioned i have four kids and went to college one of them is still in college working on a ph d she will finish it god bless her but we have a policy in most state universities that if you are from the state that you go to school in you pay instate tuition you go to one of our major universities you live in the state of texas you pay instate tuition but if you from kansas let us use kansas and you come down to texas well you pay outofstate tuition because you are not from around here you are from kansas so you pay outofstate tuition let us say you come from a foreign country and you have applied for an education visa you came here to the united states the right way and the legal way you got admitted to one of our good universities in texas well you pay outofstate tuition because you arenot from texas you are from somewhere else but if you are illegally in the united states and you are illegally in texas you can apply to one of our state universities if you get admitted you pay instate tuition so we discriminate against americans from other states we discriminate against other citizens and other nations who come here the right way to the benefit of people who just show up illegally in the united states this ought not to be this is so ridiculous that there are some places in the united states that illegal immigrants can get state grants to go to college that means they go free i think maybe those state grants ought to go to citizens they certainly should be considered ahead of illegal immigrants and legal immigrants ought to be considered before illegal immigrants with the competition so tough in getting into our universities all of them throughout the united states some of these illegal immigrants are knocking american citizens american kids that are just average students out of a chance to go to college maybe we ought to reevaluate this policy of favoring illegals to the detriment of americans for a long time i was a judge in houston texas 22 years i saw about oh 25 000 criminal cases tough cases everything from stealing to killing rape robbery murder kidnapping child abuse capital murder and everything in between during that time and most recently especially i dealt with numerous cases of people who were from some other country than the united states most of whom were illegally in the united states it is estimated that about 20 percent of the people 20 percent of the people incarcerated in the united states in our state prisons our jails and our federal penitentiaries are illegally in the united states to begin with what that means is the criminal justice system which we pay for americans pay americans always pay part of the reason it is so expensive is we have got people in the system who are illegally in the united states to begin with so we pay for that system for those individuals but to carry it a little bit further to show you how we do not follow through with enforcement of our laws if i would send a person to prison that was convicted of a crime in texas sent him off to the texas state penitentiary you would think when they get out of the penitentiary we would have a border agent waiting there at the gate to pick him up and take him back home wherever they came from whether they were legally or illegally in the united states but that does not happen what happens is when a person finishes their time in the penitentiary they are taken back to the city in which they were convicted and released back in our community so here we have a person illegally in the united states commits a crime against someone in the united states goes to our state penitentiary does time in our pen when they get out rather than just automatically deport them send them back home wherever they came from we release them back into the community d 1600 this ought not to be so we have to deal with the absurdities in our immigration policy we have to be concerned about the illegal immigrants that come into the united states we must expect and demand that those people who want to come here come here the right way there is a reason they did not come here the legal way maybe we ought to find out what those reasons are the rule of law must be enforced madam speaker lawlessness on the border breeds more lawlessness and that is why it is increasing that is why the drug cartels are doing what they are doing bringing drugs into the united states to do harm to the rest of us that is why those coyotes those human smugglers are bringing people into the united states for money and that is why those terrorists who wish to do us harm when they come to the united states they will come the illegal way as well we must be serious about enforcing the rule of law enforcing what is best for america about 100 years ago this statement was made in the first place we should insist that if the immigrant who comes here in good faith becomes an american and assimilates himself to us he shall be treated on an exact equality with everyone else for it is an outrage to discriminate against any such man because of creed or birthplace or origin but this is predicated upon the mans becoming in very fact an american and nothing but an american there can be no divided allegiance here any man who says he is an american but something else also isnt an american at all we have room but for one flag the american flag and this excludes the red flag which symbolizes all wars against liberty and civilization just as much as it excludes any foreign flag of a nation to which we are hostile we have but room for one language here and that is the englishi

so much bureaucratic nonsense that it takes a long time for people who wish to become citizens or people who wish to work here or go to school here if they do it the right way the legal way we have all heard of the excuses and the socalled explanations for why it takes so long to allow people to come to the united states the legal way they are just excuses they are not reasons i am an advocate of immigration legal immigration 1515 i am proud of the fact that my ancestors came from scotland and the hardheaded ones came from germany but you know madam speaker we discriminate in this country against people who want to come here the legal way the rightway those who want to do something for america and not to america to the benefit of the lawless illegals who disrespect our rules the rule of law and our nation the battle for the border is upon us and i am not talking about iraq i am not talking about afghanistan i am talking about the american border we have an invasion going on in this country we have a colonization of our nation by other nations and we watch it and do very little you know this lawlessness on our borders breeds more lawlessness and it is only getting worse last week i was on this house floor and i invited some colleagues especially those down the hallway to go with me to the south texas border i guess they could not go because they were on their yachts sipping wine off cape cod and found other things that they could do better but i spent the last weekend down on the south texas border at a place called laredo texas and on this map here we have portions of texas mexif the gulf of mexico and laredo texas is in this dark blue that is webb county texas south of it is zapata county texas webb county just to give you some information is bigger than the state of delaware and i spent the weekend there with the sheriff of webb county sheriff flores and also the sheriff of zapata county sheriff gonzalez ziggy gonzalez and we found what occurs there on a daily basis is something that all americans should be aware of sheriff rick flores sheriff of webb county texas a place bigger than the state of delaware has 13 deputies patrolling the whole state and when we went down to the border he made sure that before we went to certain portions of the texasmexico border that we were armed with m16 rifles that we went with his small swat team that had body armor and helmets because he said there are places on the texas border with mexico you do not get close to the river without body armor now we are talking about the united states being inside the united states we are not talking about being in some foreign country but yet our sheriffs are concerned about their safety and the safety of people who are near our southern border because of what is going on on the other side of the border i spent some time years ago at checkpoint charlie inberlin you remember that is the place where the american sector was separated from the soviet sector that soviet sector looked into the grayness the darkness the bleakness of communism in eastern europe and how we had to patrol that border for americas safety and when i was on the texas border in laredo texas it reminded me of checkpoint charlie because of the violence that is occurring along our lawless southern border sheriff flores when he took us around along with his deputies also along with texas ranger doyle holdridge he tried to explain to me in very simple matters that this is an american issue this is not a partisan issue this as he said is a red white and blue issue the importance of protecting the sovereignty of the united states against the illegal invasion of people coming across our border and how many are we talking about in texas alone we are talking about 5 000 a day illegally coming into the united states we are talking about in our country now 11 to 14 million people who came in from canada or mexico illegally without permission and so he patrols that area he does his regular duties but he is concerned about three items three things and they all have to do with illegal activity he is concerned about the illegal drug cartels that operate in mexico and southern america and work their way up through the united states and to through laredo as you can see from this map laredo here is the center port in the united states it is the busiest inland port in the united states every day 7 000 18wheelers cross into the united states from this location about that many o south as well and they disseminate up to the northeast and to the midwest that is why this is the battle for the border because the drug cartels want to control this area and we have got more than one drug cartel down there fighting among themselves as to who will control the border so the first reason is for the drug trafficking that illegally comes into the united states is a concern to these sheriffs on the texas border the second concern is the illegal immigrants that come through that area many of those people brought into the united states by coyotes these are the people who for money make a profit off the human trafficking bringing people into the united states illegally and the third reason and maybe the most important reason is because sheriff flores and sheriff gonzalez are concerned about homeland security they areconcerned about those terrorists that wish to do us harm the next terrorist that commits a crime in the united states probably is not going to fly over here land at reagan national airport get off the airplane and look around do some damage they are probably not going to do that it is too difficult they are just going to probably come across the southern texas border as thousands of people do each day so those are three reasons that this nation needs to have an immigration policy that works an immigration policy that promotes legal immigration and an immigration policy that says no to those people who wish to come here illegally and to try to put things in perspective let us talk about the drug cartels that come up through the southern border of the united states now i am not going to spend a lot of time talking about the problems with driigs and how it affects americans but we know it does from schoolyards from the east coast to the west coast but their port of entry like those 7 000 trucks coming into the united states at laredo is right here the drug cartels have more money they have better electronic equipment they have better firepower they have better intelligence networks than our local sheriffs do our local sheriffs when we were down on the border we used night vision equipment but that was borrowed equipment the sheriffs tell me that on the other side of the border the drug cartels have the best night vision equipment that can be purchased they also have better body armor than americans do and not only that the drug cartels use satellite phones and they track our peace officers with gps in other words we have got a deputy sheriff out here on patrol in webb county or zapata county he uses his cell phone to make a call the drug cartels track where he is using gps and they can track his cell phone and know his location they not only know where our peace officers are they know where they all live they know the names of their family members they know the routine that they take each day you see these drug cartels are the enemy they are the enemy to america and yet our sheriffs they make do with what they have got you know they would like night vision equipment so they can patrol that area nightvision equipment that they do not have to borrow from the federal government they would like offroad vehicles satellite phones they have even suggested and asked while i was down there you think congressman poe when you go back to washington you can get us a humvee for our county now they do not want four or five they want one humvee for each of these 16 qounties on the texasmexico border so that they can track those drug cartels i tried to make a few phone calls this week to see how difficult that would be to obtain some used humvee that we brought back from the war in iraq that we are never going to use that this country will just put somewhere and let it rust and then melt it down to steel and the bureaucracy the red tape just to find the person who can make that decision was not possible but it would seem to me that while we fight the war on iraq when we bring those vehicles even those damaged vehicles back to the united states that are no longer going to be used by our military why cant the federal government just give a few of those to these border sheriffs along this border so they can protect and serve our nation better but so far that cannot happen because there is too much bureaucracy involved i mentioned the sheriffs deputies and how they are doing a great job sheriff flores and sheriff gonzalez but they too are concerned about their own safety we know that one of these local sheriffs departments they have to protect their own kids when they go to school that they use peace officers to escort their children to and from school because they are afraid of the safety of their own children this ought not to be you know the drug cartels more than anything else they have more money than our local sheriffs because it is all about money follow the money trail and in here it is a tremendous amount of money that we are talking about the drug cartels these are the people who that are the runners for lack of a better phrase that actually bring the drugs across from mexico into the united states those people who do that make 30 000 a week that is right just drug runners make 30 000 a week bringing that dope into the united states you know what a sheriff makes in texas on this border they make 40 000 a year a deputy sheriff makes about 22 000 a year a federal peace officer in mexico makes about 20 000 a year that is right these drug cartels have more money they pay their drug runners about 10 times what our local law enforcement make it is all about money and they are willing to do it they are willing to take that risk because of the amount of money that is involved in illegal drugrunning into the united states we know also that there have been many individuals that have for whatever reason been trained in the past in the united states for countries south of the border that have gone over to the other side see they can make more money they can make more of that filthy lucre if they work for the bad guys if they work for the outlaws one of those groups happens to be guatemalantrained forces that are now mercenaries for the cartels this is a photograph that was taken on the texasmexico border this top photograph it was taken with night vision equipment borrowed of course this is the mexico border this is the rio grande river and on this side is the texas american border now this photograph you would think maybe these are just some river rafters going down the rio grande river not so we know now that this photograph is taken of guatemalan mercenaries that have gone over to the other side and work for the bad guys work for the drug cartel they are all dressed in their camo outfits they have obviously backpacks probably drugs in bags in this raft you see a person in front with his little ak47 protecting the dope as they cross in from mexico to the united states this is our border this is what takes place on our borders and while some people in this house are so insistent on talking about the minute things that occur in this country maybe we should be concerned about the sovereignty and invasion of our country by these outlaws that are bringing drugs into this country the photograph below is a photograph we took last weekend it is a difficult one to see but you see two folks in here down here by the river this is mexico on this side rio grande river we are standing on this sidq over here on the texas american side there is an individual getting ready to get into the river come into the united states but over here the sheriffs department tells us this individual who has got his hand on his pistol in his holster is one of those drug cartel runners protecting his drugs but that is just a typical scene what it looks like looking across the river now remember when we went down to this area of the texasmexico border we were armed we were armed with m16 rifles we were armed with individuals who were from the swat teams of these two sheriffs departments because you see it is not safe and one reason it is not safe is because of the drug cartels that are bringing drugs in from other countries through our open borders so it is important that we first secure the borders because of the illegal invasion of people who wish to not only come here illegally but to bring that cancer into the united states and sell it for a profit these people who wish to make a profit off the weaknesses of other individuals and i am talking about drug dealers we also notice down here on the texas side of the rio grande river where the entry places would be for those individuals who want to come in here illegally not necessarily drug runners but some of them were the way they do that many times they will cross the river they will swim across the river without any clothes on they put their clothes in a plastic bag and when they get across the river they dry off and then put their clothes on of course they dispose of the bags and any other trash throughout that entire area we saw numerous trash bags where people had disposed of the bags and other litter all along that texas border especially on those routes that come into the united states i talked to a rancher down in zapata county not too long ago and he was telling me that his ranch down in zapata county right next to the border is like as he said shermans march to the sea i asked him to explain that he said you remember general sherman that union general that invaded the south and burned everything he came across until he got to atlanta he said that is what my ranch looks like in parts where people have come in across the border into the united states illegally and they have destroyed everything in their path just to get farther inland we are talking about american property property rights something that probably we ought to be concerned about the property of americans along our border however our ranchers do not have it that easy they have been warned by the drug cartels to be their friend because they do not want them to be their enemy veiled threats some ranchers have been promised money or they will be harmed they say it is either silver or lead what that means is we will pay you to let us cross your land or there will be lead which is a bullet idle threats i do not think so threats to ranchers to let those drug cartels and those human smugglers come across their land but this is the way these people must live sheriff flores made a comment near the end of our trip with him and his deputies and sheriff gonzales he said our biggest concern is national security he said these people will take money to smuggle people across our border they will take money to smuggle drugs across our border and they will take money to smuggle terrorists across our border it is an issue of national security let me continue a little bit about how much we are talking about besides drugs without demonstrating all the packages of narcotics let me just show you two photographs these were taken by the local sheriff departments down in south texas this cache of weapons up here you might think these were found in iraq somewhere saddam husseins outlaws might have had these not so this cache of weapons was found by a local sheriff department stopping a vehicle coming in yes to the united states from oursouthern border and you see the automatic weapons at the top you see a couple of pistols here and then you see grenadelaunching weapons at the bottom an invasion into the united states of illegal weapons just a brief moment about terrorist activity and how simple it is i mentioned 7 000 trucks a day coming into laredo this is no secret you can find this kind of information on the internet right here we have about six or seven hand grenades if you look closely you will see that the pin has been pulled from the hand grenades all of these here are just nondetonated bombs each hand grenade is wrapped in a plastic the pin is pulled and you can put one of these hand grenades near a vehicles engine it will melt the plastic and thus detonate the hand grenade these were found before they were ever used by local law enforcement down on the border just a simple way how terrorists can bring weapons into the united states weapons that their purpose is to do americans harm so i would hope that we as a nation understand that our first responders are the people who know the communities and part of those people are the sheriffs and the local police agencies while it is true i have not said much about the federal agents that are on the border i think we must be concerned equally as well in helping our first responders because they are in this battle too they know the territory they know the people and they know who the outlaws are because most of these individuals most of these first responders were raised in this entire area we have 11 to 14 million people living in this country illegally amnesty of course is not the answer we also have reports that members of al qaeda reside down here south of the american border in parts of mexico they infiltrate mexico of course illegally they assume the identity ofu hispanic individuals they learn the spanish language and then when time is appropriate they come across the american border and assimilate s some cowntrodden ilegaloimiigrant into the united states t we know that is occurring and so that is why i make the comments about those terrorists who wish to do us harm they are going to come from south of the border as the battle for iraq races on the battle for the border the battle for laredo continues let me mention what has occurred across the border from laredo laredo is a little over 100 000 people right here between zapata county and webb county across the county or across the american line into mexico is nuevo laredo it has about 400 000 individuals at least it used to because now people are leaving this year in nuevo laredo because of the violence of the drug cartels 155 people have been murdered sixteen police officers in nuevo laredo have been murdered we know that one of the police chiefs recent police chiefs 6 hours after he was sworn in as police chief of nuevo laredo was gunned down and he had 35 bullet holes in him because you see he was not going to work with the drug cartels we know that 44 americans have been kidnapped out of the united states and taken across the border and in all of those cases not one case has been solved not one of those murders has been resolved not one of those kidnappings has been cleared interesting this is the world we live in a world that we should be concerned about the world south of the american border we know that nuevo laredo because of the drug cartels because of location into the united states or near the united states and where the drugs can go has become a haven for drug traffickers a haven for gun running and a haven for those coyotes that bring people into the united states illegally just to give one example because there are numerous examples of the violence and the victims that occur both in mexico and the united states because of this illegal drug activity a couple of years ago there was a young teenage girl in laredo texas who met a guy from laredo who had a mercedes and he had a lot of money in his pocket and he was a teenager as well the girls mother told her do not get caught up with him he is up to no good stay in school get an education well what happened was he was one of those individuals who worked for the drug cartel but he was working on the american side and he owed some money to that drug cartel so one evening both of those teenagers were kidnapped taken back across the border they were beaten bags were puts over their heads and both of those teenagers were buried alive it is just one example of what happens down on the war for the border one thing that i have done to try to put some progress in our immigration policy is to 4ntroduce the dill requiring passports for all people who enter the united states t the 9 11 commission and itsr extensive report made recommendations that the united states require passports for everyone coming into the united states from south of the border and north of the border now we give people a pass from canada mexico and the caribbean islands they do not have to present a passport all they have to do is show up at the border present one of hundreds of different types of documents including old baptismal records sometimes all they have to say is state the country that they are from and they come into the united states this passport bill will require some documentation that people coming into the united states if they want to come in here legally they have to do it the legal way they have to have a passport a passport with a bar card a passport with a bar card that can be scanned so that we can record who comes into the united states do you know we do not record the people who come across our border the canadian border or the mexican border why is that i do not know maybe it is best for canada maybe it is best for mexico but it is not best for the united states passports do not discriminate against any individual they treat everybody the same way of course we can ship a package from honduras to the united states it is recorded by ups on a bar card scanner at least 10 times we know the places that package went before it is opened up here in the house of representatives but yet we do not do that for people who come into the united states so this passport act is nondiscriminatory and it will require individuals to have a passport to come into the united states otherwise they cannot enter therefore it helps businesses as well because a person then is legally in the united states and has a legal visa with a photograph on that visa that they obtained from their government and our government when they go to get a job the business does not have to check social security cards and all these other documents they look on that passport to see how long they can stay in the united states so this is one step i think we should progress and look forward to having a passport for all individuals who come into the united states now we have gotten some criticism about this when i introduced the passport for all bill the criticism came from our northern representatives and some of our cana dian friends because they want open borders between canada and the united states they do not want to have to pay that 100 for a passport let us think about that 100 for a passport that lasts 10 years that is 1 a year 80 cqnts a month that is less than a cup of starbucks coffee so this argument that we do not want to pay the 100 is ridiculous for our atiqnal sepurity that is not asking too much for our canadian friends american or people south of the american border this is something we should do we should proceed with the recommendation of the 9 11 commission some have asked if the 9 11 commission recommended it why do we not have it already it is because of bureaucracy it is because people who do not want that recommendation enforced ignore it and so therefore it has not occurred and congress is going to have to pass a law to require it one other matter that i would like to mention about our texas border some have talked about the only way we can keep people out is to build a fence i am not sure about that madam speaker i think we should at least debate that issue on the house floor one thing that is occurring we are finding out that there are electronic cameras on the united states side that do a pretty ample job of watching the river the problem is when that camera spots someone coming across the river there is no one down there in the area to go down there and stop that illegal traffic whether it is a drug smuggler gun runner or someone coming into the united states illegally we need to use some common sense in immigration and the first thing we do is to make people who want to come to the united states legally have a simple process for them to do so and use passports to do that there are some absurdities that occur in our immigration policy and i would like to mention a few of those when our border agents capture people crossing into the united states from the southern border into the united states the texas portion many of those individuals are not from mexico a lot of times we assume that all thepeople illegally coming into texas and the united states are from mexico that is not true we do a disservice to mexico when we say that because over half the people that came into the united states illegally from the south last year they were not from mexico they are called otms other than mexico over 50 percent were from some other nation other than mexico they are from south america they are from central america they are from asia they are from china they are from europe but they are not from mexico these people are called otms because you see everybody in the world except maybe some americans all these people in the world know that the southern border of the united states is an open border and you can cross here in texas or in arizona or new mexico and in california 0i 1545 so that is wky people all over the world are working their way to mexico and coming across illegally into the united states in any event what happens vyhen bontder agents or sheriffs captvre on of these individuals well if you are frbm mexico here is what happens they are usually put in some kind of detention facility and shipped back across the border if they are caught near the border that does not occur once they make it into the inland but if they are captured near the border they are taken back after they are put in some detention facility for a short period of time if you are not from mexico that does not occur they are taken to a local magistrate in one of our federal courthouses on the border the person is standing before the federal magistrate they do not live in mexico they are from some other nation so because our detention facilities are so full and we do not have near enough detention facilities this person is released back into our country with the promise to appear in court in 6 months for their deportation hearing and then some of them are actually moved up further into the united states by our own federal authorities think about this this is catchandrelease we catch them and then we release them how absurd is that this occurs with individuals who are from nations or nations other than mexico people understand that so much so that many times when these otms cross the border once they make it to a major highway they stand in the middle of the highway waving their hands they want to be captured because as soon as they are captured they are released with that getoutofjailfree ticket that allows them to roam the united states for 6 months before appearing in court for their deportation hearing this ought not to be not only that 85 percent of these people never appear in court are we surprised of course not so when people come to the united states illegally for whatever reason and they are captured they must understand that our government has the fortitude and the will to send them home no matter where they come from we must find the resources use old military bases it does not make any difference find a place to housethose individuals until their quick deportation hearing when i say quick it should not take 6 months it should be resolved within a week ship them back where they came from because they have invaded the united states this ought not to be of course we know many of them come from the laredo webb county zapata county just for your information down here on the gulf of mexico we have brownsville texas on the american side and across there we have matamoros mexico it just so happens that people who are from china the chinese are ille gally entering the united state from that area that is the area of the country they have picked to illegally come into the unitedstates and the same is true tiere once they are captured they are released on their word to appear back in court and many of them most of them do not appear so we did not change this policy the catchandrelease it is no longer catchandrelease it should be catchanddeport and deport immediately if you are illegally in the united states we also have policies in some of our major cities that do riot make much sense and i call these policies the sanctuary hideouts these are laws in major metropolitan areas that prevent local law enforcement from arresting people who are in the city in the united states illegally let me give you an example unfortunately this is one of the policies we have had in the city of houston down in texas where i am from a houston police officer can arrest somebody for jaywalking but a houston police officer cannot inquire into the legal status of a person that is arrested for jaywalking in other words you can be confined or arrested for jaywalking but this peace officer cannot do anything about the fact the person is illegally in the united states cannot even ask the question the police officer will be disciplined this sanctuary policy this sanctuary hideout is a policy of our major cities so we allow different pockets of people who are illegally in the united states we give them sanctuary why do we do that i donot know it is not best for america it is best for somebody elses own agenda but it is not best for america a police officer used to have the power to arrest somebody find out if they are illegally in the united states take them over to ins and ins would deport them the local law enforcement worked very well with the federal authorities we should resume that policy so that we have individuals that are arrested here for one crime they could be turned over to federal authorities and be deported immediately but now local law enforcement cannot even ask them the question of where they are from or they will be disciplined this ought not to be when a person comes to the united states and a lot of people do god bless them they come here legally we make it so difficult for those individuals to do it the right way that they are tempted to do it the illegal way i will give an example in my southeast texas district down in jefferson county i talked to an individual that is a naturalized citizen from mexico came to the united states did it the right way proud american loves our country one of his sons is serving in the military but he has got another son down in mexico that he wants to bring to the unitedi states and there are ways you do that legally it has taken him 15 years to get that second son into the united states legally that is ridiculous that is absurd if we are going to let that individual in let us let him in if we are going to tell him no tell him no but make a decision all the red tape and all the paperwork 15 years is ridiculous this american citizen i was mentioning to you wants his son to come here the right way he has encouraged him not to illegally come into the unitedstates we have been told that there are some people that have been vaiting to come into the united states on immigration status for 20 years and have yet to hear from our immigration officials as to whether they can come in the united states or not so we can see why people come here illegally we also know that the administration in mexico encourages illegal immigration into the united states because they printed up a pamphlet that i have shown on this house floor before that explains how immigrants from mexico can illegally enter the united states and shows them where to go where to cross the border what to do when they are confronted by american officials et cetera we know that a person can purchase fake documents at flea markets get a forged social security card and come into the united states illegally and this is encouraged by other nations american taxpayers pay each year per taxpayer 2 700 for the cost of illegal immigration that is the cost we pay for those people who are here illegally 2 700 a piece that is how much americans have to pay americans pay americans always pay just some specific examples health care oh tonight we heard so much about the cost of health care over here on the other side we heard some moaning and groaning and weeping about the cost of health care in the united states but i will ask my friends across the aisle why do they not address one of the costs of health care costs in the united states and that is the cost that we pay for people who are in the system that are illegally in the united states obtaining health care that americans pay and they do not pay for it has been estimated by some health care officials that over 20 percent of the cost of health care is because of those people illegally in the united states obtaining health care that the rest of us have to pay for that ought not to be why do we not want to address that issue in health care costs because it is political we cannot make a political case out of health care costs well maybe we should deal with the truth and the reality we know that many illegal immigrants when they want health care they just show up at the emergency room and because of our policies in this country i am not saying it is right or wrong i am just saying when they show up at the emergency room they are taken care of of course emergency room treatment is the most expensive treatment in health care but that is where those individuals go the rest of us pay for it maybe we ought to be sending some of those bills down south of the border and letting those other countries pay for the health care costs that we are paying for that health care cost that their citizens are taking from the rest of us something else we have heard a lot about in recent weeks is education and the cost of education in the united states it costs a lot of money not only with your local schools up through the 12th grade but individuals who wish to go on to college i had four kids and i know the expense of education all of them have finished college but one one is still in college but let us talk about education people in education tell us that part of the education costs is because of people who are illegally in the united states that we educate free let me explain that to you let us use this example let us say i decided to go to france and some of the things i have said about the french government they probably would not let me in legally so i would have to sneak into france and i am going to take my whole family with me so i sneak into france i take my four kids i show up someplace and say educate all of us and educate us in the english language because we do not speak french if i did that you would think that was absurd of course the french government would not let that happen would they no country in the world would let that happen they would get rid of me first second they sure would not let me go to school and would not pay for it or educate me in english or texan whichever but yet a person can come to the united states show up to one of our schools take their kids there and we educate them because we educate everybody that is in this country i am not saying it is right or wrong i just say we do it we educate them in their language and yet the rest of us pay for that so maybe we ought to reevaluate the cost of education the cost of medical health care in light of the fact that it costs americans so much to pay for the education and medical expenses of people here illegally let me talk one more thing about education i mentioned i have four kids and went to college one of them is still in college working on a ph d she will finish it god bless her but we have a policy in most state universities that if you are from the state that you go to school in you pay instate tuition you go to one of our major universities you live in the state of texas you pay instate tuition but if you from kansas let us use kansas and you come down to texas well you pay outofstate tuition because you are not from around here you are from kansas so you pay outofstate tuition let us say you come from a foreign country and you have applied for an education visa you came here to the united states the right way and the legal way you got admitted to one of our good universities in texas well you pay outofstate tuition because you arenot from texas you are from somewhere else but if you are illegally in the united states and you are illegally in texas you can apply to one of our state universities if you get admitted you pay instate tuition so we discriminate against americans from other states we discriminate against other citizens and other nations who come here the right way to the benefit of people who just show up illegally in the united states this ought not to be this is so ridiculous that there are some places in the united states that illegal immigrants can get state grants to go to college that means they go free i think maybe those state grants ought to go to citizens they certainly should be considered ahead of illegal immigrants and legal immigrants ought to be considered before illegal immigrants with the competition so tough in getting into our universities all of them throughout the united states some of these illegal immigrants are knocking american citizens american kids that are just average students out of a chance to go to college maybe we ought to reevaluate this policy of favoring illegals to the detriment of americans for a long time i was a judge in houston texas 22 years i saw about oh 25 000 criminal cases tough cases everything from stealing to killing rape robbery murder kidnapping child abuse capital murder and everything in between during that time and most recently especially i dealt with numerous cases of people who were from some other country than the united states most of whom were illegally in the united states it is estimated that about 20 percent of the people 20 percent of the people incarcerated in the united states in our state prisons our jails and our federal penitentiaries are illegally in the united states to begin with what that means is the criminal justice system which we pay for americans pay americans always pay part of the reason it is so expensive is we have got people in the system who are illegally in the united states to begin with so we pay for that system for those individuals but to carry it a little bit further to show you how we do not follow through with enforcement of our laws if i would send a person to prison that was convicted of a crime in texas sent him off to the texas state penitentiary you would think when they get out of the penitentiary we would have a border agent waiting there at the gate to pick him up and take him back home wherever they came from whether they were legally or illegally in the united states but that does not happen what happens is when a person finishes their time in the penitentiary they are taken back to the city in which they were convicted and released back in our community so here we have a person illegally in the united states commits a crime against someone in the united states goes to our state penitentiary does time in our pen when they get out rather than just automatically deport them send them back home wherever they came from we release them back into the community d 1600 this ought not to be so we have to deal with the absurdities in our immigration policy we have to be concerned about the illegal immigrants that come into the united states we must expect and demand that those people who want to come here come here the right way there is a reason they did not come here the legal way maybe we ought to find out what those reasons are the rule of law must be enforced madam speaker lawlessness on the border breeds more lawlessness and that is why it is increasing that is why the drug cartels are doing what they are doing bringing drugs into the united states to do harm to the rest of us that is why those coyotes those human smugglers are bringing people into the united states for money and that is why those terrorists who wish to do us harm when they come to the united states they will come the illegal way as well we must be serious about enforcing the rule of law enforcing what is best for america about 100 years ago this statement was made in the first place we should insist that if the immigrant who comes here in good faith becomes an american and assimilates himself to us he shall be treated on an exact equality with everyone else for it is an outrage to discriminate against any such man because of creed or birthplace or origin but this is predicated upon the mans becoming in very fact an american and nothing but an american there can be no divided allegiance here any man who says he is an american but something else also isnt an american at all we have room but for one flag the american flag and this excludes the red flag which symbolizes all wars against liberty and civilization just as much as it excludes any foreign flag of a nation to which we are hostile we have but room for one language here and that is the englishi language and we have room for but one sble loyalty and that is the ldyalty to the american people this was said by president theodore teddy roosevelt in 1907 a great believer in immigration an immigrant a person who wanted people to come to the united states the legal way words of wisdom maybe something we ought to listen to we must win the battle for the border we must win the battle for sovereignty and we must win the battle against lawlessness that surrounds our country that is just the way it is"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a reporter from a major news organization in the united states who is

cares not about the fate of an individual citizen but in a free country to murder a single innocent citizen is to provoke a fight with the entire nation this is one of the great differentiations between hezbollah and israel while desperately trying to retrieve two of her soldiers who were abducted by hezbollah terrorists israel takes great lengths to minimize civilian casualties conversely hezbollah takes great lengths to maximize civilian casualties in israel while making breathing barricades out of the innocent men women and children in lebanon time and again israel has made efforts for peace israel fully withdrew from lebanon then she uprooted from gaza she was thanked with rockets mayhem and bloodbath the recent kidnapping and murder of israeli citizens and soldiers were definitive acts of war hezbollah terrorists along with the nations of syria and iran who support them are the aggressors and now as israel has risen up to defend herself along with each of the individual citizens whom she loves we hear cries from the u n and other quarters for israel to restrain herself what if on 9 11 the outcry was for the united states to restrain ourselves or what if israel had listened to such calls for restraint 15 years ago when she learned that saddam hussein was building a nuclear reactor the united states and our coalition forces would have faced terrorists with nuclear weapons when we lifted the iron hand of saddam hussein in 2003 you see israel under7 stands that the entire world faces an evil poisonous ideology that causes mothers to leap for joy when their children blow themselves to pieces in order to kill other innocent human beings israel understands that a dark ideology like that must never be allowed to gain nuclear weapons and why does the rest of the world not seem to understand that this is the same ideology that murdered olympic athletes in 1972 that took american hostages in iran that murdered marines in their barracks in 1993 that bombed the world trade center in 1993 riyadh in 1995 the khobar towers in 1996 the embassy in 1998 and the uss cole in 2000 and then this murderess ideology massacred nearly 3 000 americans on september 11 and today this is the same ideology that is launching rockets into israel to kill innocent civilians and lest we forget it is the same ideology that is working feverishly to gain nuclear weapons to terrorize the western world in ways that we cannot yet imagine seven decades ago another murderess ideology arose in the world the dark shadow of the swastika fell first upon the jewish people of germany and because the world did not respond to such an evil it began to spread across europe until it lit the fires of world war iis hell on earth which saw atomic bombs fall on cities and over 50 million people dead worldwide all because the worlds free people did not respond in time 0l 2245 history has taught us that evil ideologies must ultimately be defeated in the minds of human beings but in the meantime in the meantime they must often be defeated upon the battlefield the battle israel fights in these days is a battle to protect all of humanity from an evil ideology that has no respect for innocent human life anywhere on the earth that is why israels war is our war and if there is hope for peace and freedom in this world free peoples across this world just unite to defeat this hellish ideology of terrorism this time we must not wait too long so may the people of israel take comfort in these days knowing that america stands with you may you find victory and may the

sound station moved out there very quickly and very efficiently they set up staging areas offshore they were able to locate the aircraft and to recover the aircraft in what was a sad moment but an important moment in our history and they did it in a fashion that was respectful that respected the kennedy family and also respected the emotions of all americans who followed that tragic case for a

medicine to come to congress and i think in many instances they came to congress because they had a voice that needed to be heard on many issues including this issue here i know i have become very close with many of the doctors the gentleman from georgia being the prime example and they are here because they care about multiple issues affecting their people back home and they are here to represent all of the people of their state they are no longelt practicing physicians so they are not doing this because they are reaching into their pocketbooks but they are doing this because they
