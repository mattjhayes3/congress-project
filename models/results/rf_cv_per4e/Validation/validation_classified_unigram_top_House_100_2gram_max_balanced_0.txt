attention under its own committee rules members of the rules committee are entitled to 48 hours notice of a meeting in case of an emergency the chairman may dispense with the 48hour notice this sounds like a reasonable rule and it would be if it were not abused for years the current chairman and his predecessors used the emergency meeting procedure only for legitimate emergencies but recently we have seen a trend toward abuse in this area as well for example the routine bill before us today the treasury postal appropriation bill was declared to be an emergency last thursday afternoon so that

considered tomorrow and tomorrows appropriation bill for which a rule has not been requested could have been considered today last week we saw the same thing with the national science foundation bill that bill was declared to be an emergency in the rules committee so that it could be rushed through without the required 48 hours notice on may 25 once again there was no printed committee report available and little opportunity for members to learn about the provisions of the bill then after all the rush the rule was not even called up until 2 weeks later on june 9 p we all understand the

david pence from a grand rapids address on november 4 1987 the time we were allotted yesterday expired before this address was completed and i think the comments of dr pence are important for the members of the house and for inserthat the american people have an opportunity of reading these comments of dr pence as well i would like at this time to conclude with the address that was left unread in my special order yesterday bear in mind that dr pence is a physician practicing medicine in the state of minnesota as i indicated to my colleagues yesterday this member from california as a senior member of the health and the environment subcommittee the subcommittee that has jurisdiction over the health care bill that will be taken up by the house tomorrow at least that is the schedule we are scheduled to take the rule tomorrow and it has been on and off the agenda for better than a week now but we are scheduled to take up the rule tomorrow a modified closed rule that this member intends

the environment as well as other members of the house and then i have been advised that we are scheduled to take up the aids bill itself on a date next week the precise date at this time is uncertain but we will begin the process tomorrow so i would like at this time to conclude with the address of dr pence so that my colleagues will have the benefit of his thinking the reason i have selected this address by dr pence is as i mentioned yesterday this member has studied a great deal on this issue in the last 3 years i have written some materials but this speech by dr pence i believe summarizes in a very succinct manner what we should be doing and are not doing today to control this epidemic in america the naive acceptance of the gay ideology by the medical profession and public health officials is probably best explained by a well meaning attempt not to discriminate most individuals who were not involved in the civil rights movement against racism tend to lump the traditional civil rights movement with the later feminist and gay liberation campaigns this hijacking of the freedom train by middle class careerists and sexual adolescents has virtually destroyed the real civil rights movement as karl marx said history the first time is tragedy the second time it is farce once again we have lost our historical memory of the real meaning and work of the early civil rights workers we have forgotten that the call of martin luther king was not for a world in which morality was separated from politicsquite the contrary he said i dream of a day when men will be judged not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character the early civil rights movement did not try to build identity on skin color but affirmed the common humanity the common creator and the common citizenship of each of us the civil rights movement was built by black southern baptist ministers certainly today they must be shaking their wise old heads in heaven as they see in the words of kipling the truth theyve spoken twisted by the knaves to make a trap for fools it is certainly the hest kept secret in america that the great majority of black leaders consider homosexual rights to be not an extension of the civil rights movement but its betrayal we must be intellectually discerning enough to see the radical difference between the claims of the traditional civil rights movement and the gay lobby it is closer to the truth to understand the lobby as a middle class special interest group which has squandered the moral authority of the old civil rights movement and captured many of the government jobs in human rights agencies formerly held by racial minorities this same group is now quite successfully building up a multimillion dollar cottage industry under the banner of aids education the medical profession would never contemplate involving smokers or agents of the tobacco industry to lead an educational effort against lung cancer the fact that state after state has given public funds to men who not only engage in the behavior which spreads the disease but base their personal and social identities on this activity must cause any reasonable individual a considerable

the house and the majority leader of the senate last year this was to be funded at 25 million it is to be funded now at 5 million a year if you read the language of the bill as to the duties of the council they are extensive its mission was changed from a central coordinating body with full control over trade policy to a more limited advisory council within the white house but the concept is clear it would institutionalize a government strategic planning process at the expense of decentralized marketoriented forces it is merely advisory it would be duplicative of functions being already carried out by other governmental agencies if its purpose is to be a central planning agency to pick winners and losers in the international marketplace it portends a very dangerous precedent indeed we do not need a council on industrial competitiveness the president has not asked for it and he does not want it two my substitute would strike the section which would call for the establishment of a competitive exchange rate the competitive exchange rate as defined in the bill is the set of exchange rates that would be consistent with an appropriate and sustainable balance in the current account as determined by the secretary of the treasury based on the appropriate methodology that takes into account the appropriate factors which provide the most opportune prospects for economic growth i do not know what that means and i doubt if anybody else does the bill further says all exchange rates also will be indexed to all appropriate currencies the experts agree that it is not possible to identify with precision what a competitive exchange rate is or should be at any given time the point i make is this provision evades the issue by mandating the secretary of the treasury to make such determinations my amendment recognizes that the recent overvaluation of the dollar has contributed to our trade deficit it certainly was not the only cause my substitute provides a mechanism for holding the administration accountable on any exchange rate negotiations through regular reporting requirements to congress it also encourages exchange market intervention in situations where currency volatility disrupts the unitedstates econ omy and our competitive position is jeopardized my substitute provides for negotiations with countries that manipulate their currencies in violation of international obligations it does not ignore the problem but takes a much more realistic approach it recognizes recent successes following the 1985 plaza agreement the toyko summit and the recent lourve agreement the most mischievous part of title iv on this issue directs the secretary of the treasury to buy and sell currencies to assist the gradual movement of the actual exchange of the dollar toward its competitive exchange rate we have common obligations with other countries under the provisions of the international monetary fund agreement which this provision would violate it could also be disruptive of the international bond market and our own bond market as well the worst of title iv is yet to come that is the provision which would direct the secretary of the treasury to initiate negotiations for the creation of a new international debt management facility this new organization would buy hold and resell if possible the sovereign debt of developing countries from creditor banks at discount rates in the last congress this was to be a new bank at the world bank i call it a world bank bank my substitute drops this proposal in its entirety because the proposal is poorly thought out in detail how would it be funded at first it was to be funded through contributions from member countries the chances of appropriating tax moneys to finance a facility to buy bad bank loans from other countries are not slim and none it is none h r 3 alludes to the possibility of taking the gold of the imf as collateral for the securities of this new international debt management authority or borrowing surplus funds from the world bank neither is feasible in the end the taxpayers of the sponsoring countries will have to stand up for the capitalization of the new

after all one could logically conclude that if congress intended that sport divers had a guaranteed access right to these shipwrecks then the statute would have said so moreover if this bill is enacted without the shumway amendment we will eliminate all federal jurisdictional involvement with regard to these shipwrecks in essence we will have abandoned the constitutional responsibility for

grammrudman budget cuts i am supporting a reasonable balanced and effective housing alternative being offered by the ranking minority member of the banking committee and i urge my colleagues to do likewise while costing less the alternative housing proposal will be able to serve more of the needy one reason for this is because it authorizes costeffective housing vouchers for up to 60 000 new units vouchers are a viable option in many communities and hud should be able to use them on a permanent and extensive basis unfortunately h r 4 does not authorize a single new voucher this is unfair to those who need housing and who would appreciate the opportunity and flexibility to choose their own dwelling in the neighborhood that they desire the alternative also places a greater emphasis on modernizing and rehabilitation of our existing housing stock much of which is seriously deteriorated rather than on constructing new projects the alternative avoids the micromanagement provisions of h

the 16 billion found in h r 4 this amount is still much greater than the administrations proposal of 11 3 billion the alternative preserve several important programs including community development

do not participate in the regular economy like you and i do in other words these people do not pay taxes we are losing tax revenues in the neighborhood of 100 to 200 billion a year or more than enough to balance the budget somehow we must get these people to pay their fair share whether it is via a fair flat tax or some other means it is time we brought the lost world of the underground economy to

there are many who say that because there is no open hostility or no armed hostility in cuba today that the cuban people are at peace eut certainly they are not free my generation of americans like all generations of americans before understand how precious freedom is that in fact freedom is the core of all human progress there were those who argued today that if we were to continue to aid those

weeks ago the house republican leadership took a special order to point out the pattern of increasing procedural abuses in the house and its committees the rules committee has been a particular problem in this area we have seen the increasing use of gag rules which restrict members ability to offer amendments and resolutions waiving all the standing rules of the house however there are some other problems affecting the rules committee which have received far less attention under its own committee rules members of the rules committee are entitled to 48 hours notice of a meeting in case of an emergency the chairman may dispense with the 48hour notice this sounds like a reasonable rule and it would be if it were not abused for years the current chairman and his predecessors used the emergency meeting procedure only for legitimate emergencies but recently we have seen a trend toward abuse in this area as well for example the routine bill before us today the treasury postal appropriation bill was declared to be an emergency last thursday afternoon so that the 48 hour notice could be dispensed with the committee met on friday morning with no final printed copy of the committee report available it didnt even have to be this way this bill could have been considered tomorrow and tomorrows appropriation bill for which a rule has not been requested could have been considered today last week we saw the same thing with the national science foundation bill that bill was declared to be an emergency in the rules committee so that it could be rushed through without the required 48 hours notice on may 25 once again there was no printed committee report available and little opportunity for members to learn about the provisions of the bill then after all the rush the rule was not even called up until 2 weeks later on june 9 p we all understand the need to move quickly in case of a real emergency but the abuse of the concept is the problem by repeatedly dispensing with the normal 48hour notice requirement it means that members are forced to vote before they have had an opportunity to properly review the legislation i hope that in the future the call of emergency meetings will be restricted to real emergencies aside from its emergency designation there is nothing unusual about the provisions of this rule it waives points of order against the bill for lack of authorization and because there are legislative provisions in this appropriation bill it also waives points of order to protect an amendment to be offered by the gentleman from pennsylvania providing for a drugfree workplace this is a longer version of the walker amendment which is technically legislation on an appropriation bill there has been particular interest in a legislative paragraph in this bill which provides for a 4percent pay increase for all federal employees including members of congress that language is legislation on an appropriation bill but it is protected from a point of order by the provisions of this rule however there is nothing in this rule which restricts the normal open amending process for general appropriation bills there are several

five multidisciplinary universitybased research centers were to be established to investigate potential medical applications expedite scientific and engineering training and develop programs to utilize this advanced technology in support of dod basic and applied research since 1984 interest in and expectations for the fel have continued to grow and progress has been made prof john madey
