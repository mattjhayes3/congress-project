served as allied commander ill have more to say later about this outstanding soldier because my main purpose today is to set the record straight about the korean war almost every history book tells us the korean war ended in a draw it was not a draw we won perhaps because the fighting ended with an armisticenot an unconditional surrenderkorea has been known as the forgotten war forgotten between the triumph of world war ii and the frustration of vietnam only recently historians and the general public alike have started taking a second look at the korean war its as if the free world suddenly woke up and recalled that korea was where we made our stand korea was where we shattered the myth of communist invincibility beginning with our show of resolve in korea and finally with the peacethroughstrength policies of ronald reagan the soviet union was forced to concede that it could not expand its empire by aggression in fact it could be said with all fairness and accuracy that the berlin wall began to crumble not in 1989 but in 1950 ive talked to veterans who fought in two wars veterans who have gone through both korea and jungle warfare most of them say korea was the most brutal war in our history a lot of it was fought in 30belowzero winters our haste to demobilize after world war ii made a hollow shell of the army and so 540 illtrained and illequipped troops found themselves overwhelmed by the 90 000man north korean army that poured across the 38th parallel on june 25 1950 the unitedstates led united nations troops were nearly pushed off the peninsula but the north korean offensive was halted at the pusan perimeter on september 10 and 5 days later the marine assault at inchonhistorys last great amphibious landingbegan the rollback of communist aggressors our marines and soldiers pushed the enemy all the way back across the border and all the way back to the yalu river pyongyang north korea was the only communist capital ever liberated by the west but then the communist chinese entered the war and drove allied forces back on a 275mile withdrawal the 1st marine division fought its way out of a trap at the chosin reservoir writing one of the most glorious chapters in marine corps history it allowed americanled forces to rally a second time driving the communiste back across the 38th parallel and while peace talks dragged on for 2 years both sides slugged it out in fighting that recalled the trench warfare of world war i much of the credit for the rollback should go to general ridgeway he took over u n forces whenthey were reeling under the communist assault and restored morale that had been strained by heavy losses and bitter cold he was a front line soldier and with a series of wellplanned counter offensives he pushed the communists back that rollback was the sum of countless acts of incredible heroism i would like to say a few words about one of them capt william e barber was the commander of company f 2nd battalion 7th marines first marine division on november 28 1950 captain barber and his battleweary troops were assigned to defend a 3mile mountain pass along the divisions main supply line just after the marines dug in along a frozen snowcovered hillside they were attacked by a communist regiment after seven hours of bitter fighting the marines were surrounded although ordered to fight his way back to a relieving force captain barber asked to stand fast and risk his entire command rather than abandon his wounded and sever contact with 8 000 other marines trapped at yudamni althoug severely wounded captain barber remained in personal control moving up and down the lines in a stretcher to inspire his men and direct the defense throughout 5 days and 6 nights of savage fighting in subzero weather the marines pushed back wave after wave by a determined enemy when the company finally was relieved only 82 of captain barbers 220 men were able to walk away from their positions this heroic stand accounted for approximately 1 000 enemy dead witnesses said that frozen enemy bodies were stacked nine deep in the snow around the embattled marines more importantly captain barbers action was a decisive factor in the successful withdrawal of the division from the chosin reservoir deathtrap he was awarded the congressional medal of honor this is what heroes are made of our involvement in the korean war was symbolized by the brilliance and strategic leadership of gen matthew ridgeway and the battlefield valor of capt william barber alongside these two heroes were hundreds of thousands of soldiers sailors airmen and marines who suffered sacrificed fought and in 54 000 cases died to protect the freedoms we enjoy today and that is the point i would like to stress wars should be judged not by surrenders or by victories in set battles wars should be judged on the basis of who imposes his will on whom on that basis we won and the world knows it the north koreans wanted to enslave the south to unify the country under their harsh totalitarian rule and we stopped them it was the first time the tide of communism was turned it was proof that the free world had the will not only to defend itself but to advance the cause of freedom throughout the world it was the turning point in asia the war boosted japans recovery from world war f1 south korea was left free to transform itself into one of the pacific rims several great economic powers through 10 presidents the united states has kept its commitment to preserve that freedom and we will continue to keep that commitment because we must north korea has not abandoned its dream of conquest and until it does it will continue to face the will and resolve of free people years after the armistice we began to reap the harvest of what we sowed by marines at chosin or the 23rd infantry regiment at heartbreak ridge it was on those desolate freezing hills so far away from home that the first hammer blows were made against the berlin wall and the statues of lenin and stalin it was korea that inspired the contras of nicaragua the mountain fighters in afghanistan and the peasants of el salvador to resist the communists i would further argue that there is a connection between the sacrifices made on pork chop hill and the blossoming democracies in budapest prague warsaw and other former communist countries besides seoul itself those newly liberated cities can take comfort from the progress of seoul from those dangerous days more than 40 years ago what a contrast between the two states north and south of the 38th parallel on the korean peninsula the south boasting of a 200 billion gross national product while the socialist workers paradise of north korea stagnates with a gnp less than onetenth the size it was a lesson for the whole world to see in the laboratory of korea free market principles proved superior to the unfeeling rigidity of marxism but those gains were not made without sacrifices and the people of south korea have not forgotten the sacrifices our troops shared with them to preserve their freedom and secure their future prosperity when edward reeves a quadrupleamputee from wounds suffered at chosin returned to korea for the 1988 olympics people would come out on the street to thank this american in a wheel chair if i had to do it all over again reeves said yes i would that is

fair vote on real spending cuts"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "2 years ago a new program was started it was an outreach program for socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers and we put 1 million into that program i objected to it at that time because nobody in this chamber could give me a definition of what a socially disadvantaged farmer or rancher was and then somebody and i think it was the gentleman from texas came down and said well itis people who have been discriminated against because of ethnicity their ethnic background because of their social background and so forth then we involved ourselves in a colloquy we found that under the civil rights laws we have right now anybody who is discriminated against for those reasons can go to court and there are criminal penalties so we really do not need it for that purpose so today we have not 1 million in here it was raised to 3 million last year this year it is 3 million again i noticed the chairman and ranking republican on this committee cut 5 000 out of it i appreciate that but it is still really 3 million three times what it was just 2 years ago the fact of the matter is we do not need this program nobody knows what a socially disadvantaged farmer is as a matter of fact the money the largest part of it went to 21 different universities and colleges around the country to implement the program it looks like to me it is a porkbarrel project for 21 or 22 universities because the money is not getting to the farmers in the first place we have extension programs to help farmers with problems they have like filling out forms or understanding what kind of herbicides or pesticides to use or anything that has to do with farming yet here is a program nobody knows what it is for nobody knows who it is supposed to help they cannot explain it on the floor of the house and we are spending 3 million for it so i would say to my colleague the gentleman from nebraska and my colleague the gentleman from new mexico we are talking about this bill being cut because of other programs other appropriations bills not being cut and this bill has been cut unfairly here is 3 million we can take out that nobody is going to miss because it is not helping anybody except 21 universities and nobody knows what they are doing with the money if you look at the definition on page 1 it says and here is what this money is used for oneonone assistance in filling out the forms required for participating in agricultural programs your extension programs do that there will be special training courses and meetings to explain the provisions of these programs they do that as well both individual and group training and assistance will be provided on such matters as land preparation planting seed selection harvesting and marketing they do that as well sources of financial assistance including farmers home administrations own lending program will be identified they do that as well so what is the purpose of this program if it is to make sure there is no discrimination based upon peoples ethnic background or social background that is already in the law under the civil rights law we have got the farmers home administration we have got the extension programs what do we need to be spending this 3 million on this program for it makes absolutely no sense and if somebody can explain to me in some detail what a socially disadvantaged farmer or rancher is i would love to hear it because i have been waiting for 3 years and i still do not have an answer"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "218 to 16 two hundred eighteen to

belgrade yugoslavia in subsequent missions the total of rescued airmen reached 800 during the first part of 1944 hundreds of allied sorties were flown from italian bases against the ploesti oil complex in romania hitlers most important source of oil during world war ii the losses were heavy since the route home led across yugoslavia and because the serbian area was under the control of

remember the armenian genocide which was at that time the unparalleled slaughter of all time setting the standard for hitler and stalin to kill tens of millions but today we have gorazde the leftist columnist mary mcgroryhave you ever heard me quote mary mcgrory says this they wished the president had not picked that particular sunday to ride his mustang around the track while the serbian tanks ground into the streets of gorazde the symbolism was abysmal leader of the western world or playboy i will submit this article for the record this president had better focus on this as mcgrory says it is history that will be merciless to this president not the republicans now let me say a few words about the armenian genocide between the years 1915 to 1923 over 12 million armenians perished as a result of the brutal policies of the ottoman empire april 24 1915 symbolically marks the beginning of the systematic policy of deportation and murder which characterizes the armenian genocide this sunday marks the 79th year since the then unequalled slaughter began it was on the night of april 24 1915 that over 200 armenian intellectual leaders were arrested in constantinople and in other cities throughout the ottoman empire in the months to follow armenian political intellectual and religious leaders were rounded up arrested exiled or murdered thus suppressing the most vocal voices of the armenian people armenian men of military age were conscripted into the service of the ottoman army these men were separated into labor battalions disarmed and then worked to death or massacred the remaining armenian divilians senior citizens women and children that were left behind were deported from their cities and towns the men and older boys were separated from the groups never to be seen again any others that remained were forced on death marches across asia minor into the syrian desert approximately 500 000 armenians were able to escape to russia europe or the united states as a result of the killings and deportations the armenian population in the ottoman empire was reduced from s22 million to fewer than 100 000 it is in the spirit of remembrance that we recognize the 79th anniversary of the armenian genocide and keep alive the memories of those who were murdered and honor those who survived likewise we commend the enduring strength and fortitude of the armenian people
