unprecedented military cooperation including the construction of components of united states military hardware in yugoslavia and united states supply of sophisticated military material to enable yugoslavia to modernize its defense forces yugoslav sources explained that they could produce spare parts more cheaply than could united states plants unitedstates assistance to a communist dictatorship would seem selfdefeating but since the allied betrayal of general mihailovich and the forces struggling against the nazi and communist tyrannies in world war ii the united state department has perpetuated the notion that yugoslavia represents communism with a difference in this regard our state department treatment of yugoslav communism is similar to our state department treatment of romania the fiction is preserved that romania too is communism with a difference and despite its horrifying human rights record mostfavorednation treatment is allegedly a way of wooing ceaucescu from the soviet orbit our former ambassador to romania david funderburk in his book pinstripes and reds explodes this myth but not the momentum in the bowels of state that continues to push for such policies the yugoslavs can indeed produce united states military equipment more cheaply than can unitedstates plants workers on the production line at the yugo plant make as little as 25 cents an hour certainly this is a factor behind the anticipated mass strikes in yugoslavia this fall as it should be any american concerned about fair labor standards and unfair trade practices should keep this in mind before considering purchase of a yugo car given this grass exploitation moreover the communist dictators of yugoslavia share another common feature with ceaucescuthey are hopelessly corrupt while ceaucescu sells human beings who want to emigrate the communist officials in yugoslavia who are running state enterprises have fraudulently issued promissory notes to the tune of at least 2 billion for theirown personal h 8288 co gain at the same time what hadbeen the most prosperous and productive country in the balkan region prior to world war i has been transformed by the communists since wwii into a terminal economic patient kept alive through such unitedstates life support systems as commercial and multinational lending institutions and preferential access to unitedstates markets yugoslavias outstanding world debt is pushing 19 billion their inflation rate is well over 100 percent and their unemployment stands at almost 17 percent small wonder then that yugoslav officials would salivate over the prospect of increased business with the united statesat the expense of united state jobs and security one must keep security in mind when dealing with any communist regime yugoslavia for example has maintained training camps for world terrorists have americans forgotten too that the architect of the achille lauro hijacking abu abbas was rescued and provided sanctuary in yugoslavia by that governments secret police this is the same government that sold minisubs to colonel qadhafi to be used against unitedstates ships in the mediterranean and cbs released on unconfirmed report that yugoslavia has sold sophisticated sea mines to the ayatollah khomeini to be used against american vessels in the persian gulf this is totally consistent behavior by an arms supplier to vietnam north korea angola nicaragua and the communist terrorists in el salvador there is also a confirmed report that the yugoslav government is producing sophisticated minirockets designed exclusively for the use of terrorists and it is as naive to believe that any yugoslav access to new technology is not immediately transferred to the soviet union as it is to believe that ceaucescu does not serve as an immediate conduit for the soviets if all of this were not enough the peoples militia in yugoslavia has responded to protests by everyone from students and

about how one administration or another has not done enough or states have not done enough but we arp not really going to get to the crux of the problem until we have a comprehensive approach which involves for the very first time a recognition of the fact that until you change the attitude toward drug users in this country you are not going to change the equation that presently exists i ask simply what is the impact on the young people of today when they see professional football players slapped on the wrist for 30 days and supposedly beginning their drug rehabilitation by playing golf what do they think when they hear on the floor of the house that we should excuse drug traffickers because they happen to be veterans i heard someone ask how can we take a particular benefit away from somebody when their service in vietnam drove them to trafficking in drugs is that the message you want to send forward do you want to send a message forward that in a courtroom in america that if someone is a drug trafficker they can say they got involved in drugs in vietnam and therefore they are excused i am concerned about veterans of america and concerned about the vietnam veterans but more concerned about the young people of america today in this respect what i heard on the floor is that if a trafficker sells drugs to my son or your son or grandson that person ought to receive special treatment because that person happened to be a veteran we made an exemption because we understood the problem of drug usage among some that returned from vietnam you do not suffer the same disability under the mccollum amendment if you are merely using drugs and convicted of use if you happen to be a veteran they are therefore given a special exemption but when their action rises to the question of drug trafficking we say that at that we draw the line we dont take away your health benefit we dont take away your retirement benefit we protect those but other types of benefits we are going to subject to penalty why do we do that because we have tried the purely criminal sanction route and we have recognized that is not sufficient we have to send a message that is more than that we have to change the culture of america with respect to usage of drugs that is why the amendment is crucial it goes to the question of true user accountability unfortunately the rangel substitute guts the effectiveness of this crucial amendment this amendment may be more important than any other single amendment we have here because it reflects a change in attitude of our approach on the drug problem we can talk big we can have mandatory penalties but if we excuse the users as we have done time and time again if we now excuse the trafficker because the trafficker happens to be a veteran we are going to send the wrong message to america if we want to save this generation of young people if we want to save the next generation we have to do more than we have done before we have to establish user accountability and that means changing the rules of the game that we have had thus far is this something new absolutely the reason it is new is because we have a tragedy affecting far

was debating h r 1460 th first sanctions bill there is no room in the world today for officially sanctioned racial discrimination apartheid is abhorrent and i agree that the united states should not stand by and ignore the continuation of this policy although i have always been a strong proponent of sanctions legislation and fully understand that south africa has made no visible progress in ending apartheid despite passage of previous sanctions legislation i have some serious reservations about this bill h r as the ranking republican on the banking committee let me address one problem in this bill with reepect to bank loans under this bill banks will not be able to reschedule existing loans with south africa because of the debt moratorium that south africa imposed after the first sanctions bill no payments are being made under original loan terms thus united states banks will have no other alternative then to sell the loans because they will become uncollectible under original terms the bottom line impact is that united states banks stand to lose over a billion dollars and our banks loss will become the south african governments gain it is inconceivable to me that the authors of this legislation would want to confer such a windfall on the south african government i should make the point that no new lending has occured since the last sanctions bill the only new money flowing into south africa has been shortterm trade financing which will be prevented under this bill additionally no new investment has been allowed either the first sanctions bill was a positive step forward which banned new banks loans but to allow the south africans to excuse their debt now is in my opinion not a sanction other provisions of the bill are also troublesome for instance unitedstates investors big and small may lose over a billion dollars because of the mandated disinvestment also the breaking of all intelligence ties between our two nations is mandated by this bill despite the strategic location of south africa t enetrage my colleagues to support tht 1roomfield alternative as a more sensiole in their approach to this problem we should seek allied strength if these sanctions are to be effective as the broomfield alternative suggests moreover thl burton substitute would specifically attempt to improve black economic power in south africa while maintaining the existing sanctions both of these objectives are laudableand notably lacking in h r 1580 h r 1580 in its present form is a solo effort because we do not have indications that other nations plan to follow our lead in the sanctions effort will blacks have more economic power if we pass this bill most likely notand therefore their leverage for change will diminish in the final analysis what we are doing here is simply sending a signal that we will have nothing to do with south africa it is a symbolic move and i can understand that approach but with respect to real economic harm to the south african government and economy i really dont believe that there will be any significant impact from the sanctions contained in h r 1580 as i mentioned i have supported sanctions in the past on every occasion i favor more punitive action against south africa but i believe that this legislation needs to be improved as it stands unitedstates banks and investors will be injured with no corresponding benefit or gain to the black majority in south africa moreover this legislation will provide a significant financial windfall for the south african government and i fall to understand

be funded at a current services level this budget resolution falls considerably short of current services and therefore is of groat concern to me the resolution may look all right at first glance on further examination however it is clear that the budget committee has recommended funds for function 700 that places veterans medical care at less than a priority level as compared to a number of other programs the budget committee recommendation figures might indicate to some that they are 250 million over the presidents reestimated request for budget authority and budget outlays on closer look however we can see that such is not the case a recommended 1percent acrosstheboard decrease for va medicine relates to 150 mll lion absorption of onehalf of the cost of a federal pay raise relates to another 150 mil lion this 300 million in turn relates to a loss of about 3 000 employees in vas department of medicine and surgery this budget committee report is a far cry from current services for va medicine it means that va will treat fewer outpatients next year it means that fewer inpatients will be treated it means that quality medical care for veterans is in jeopardy it means a diminishing of the historic pledge of this body that it will always assure adequate funds for va medicine the house veterans affairs committee carefully studied the presidents budget and then made recommendations to the budget committee we were unanimous in those recommendations we said that the presidents budget ought to be very modestly amended upward for va medical care and for the administration of veterans benefits we recommended a very modest increase in construction funds to build three more nursing homes to try to take care of aging veterans we wanted to start work on a

that came before the house telecommunications and finance subcommittee during the recent hearing conducted on this legislation i was struck by one overriding impression the codification of the fairness doctrine cannot be justified unless one accepts the spectrum scarcity rationale sheer weight of numbers prevents me from accepting this argument there are now approximately 10 000 radio stations and 1 300 television stations reaching 98 2 percent of all unitedstates households with the availability of home dishes cable vcrs and microwave technology there are numerous sources of

with the figures for the print media for example there are only 1 700 daily newspapers in this country and many major cities are only one or twopaper towns yet 96 percent of unitedstates households receive five or more television signals and 71 percent of all households receive nine or more signals in addition there are 7 300 cable systems reaching 46 percent of homes in the united states far from a scarcity the numbers indicate convincingly that the broadcast audience has a great many information alternatives available as my good friend the gentleman from iowa perceptively pointed out at the subcommittee hearing on h r 1934 in considering the spectrum scarcity rationale a distinction must be made between the availability of opportunities to broadcast programming and the availability of the opportunities to receive programming proponents of this bill have continually focused on the former distinction when the very purposes of the fairness doctrine command that we focus on the latter distinction i am concerned that enacting the fairness doctrine will intrude on the constitutional rights of broadcasters i see the fairness doctrine as a dangerous precedent of government

reorganization act the war powers resolution the budget act the committee reform amendments and numerous king caucus reforms that further opened the house and dispersed power while many of the reforms of that turbulent decade have been beneficial others have had the opposite effectparticularly those that gave rise to a proliferation of semlautomous subcommittees as a result the house is probably more out order today than it was 22 years ago the fact is this house is failing miserably at its three primary responsibilities policymaking oversight and controlling the purse strings the heart of the policy process in the house our committee system has clogged arteries as a result of layers of fatty tissue congressional oversight is something that is largely overlooked and our purse strings are hopelessly tangled in budget and appropriations hoops that dominate our sessions yet still come out days late and dollars short on savings why arent our authorizing committees doing their jobs for

bigger deficits but we still cant get our spending bills enacted on time the fact is last year we did much worse on enacting regular appropriations bills than we did 22 years ago whereas in the 89th

session and whereas in the 89th congress all the regular appropriations bills were eventually enacted separately in both sessions in the 99th congress only six money bills were separately enacted in the first session and in the second session we achieved the ultimate in purse string paralysis not one appropriation bill was separately enacted instead we ended up enacting one omnibus money bill

voting and onethird quorum rules we should no longer have need for these phantom legislative devices that were found necessary because members could not attend all their committee and subcommittee meetings and hearings abolishing these phantom devices together with our requirement for equitable party ratios on committees should help to ensure more conscientious representative and accountable

consideration and final approval of certain amendments added by the other body to the fair housing amendments act of 1988 my colleagues will recall that the house considered the fair housing

remaining differences between the civil rights community and the administration our purpose here today is to consider and hopefully accept the changes to h r 1158 adopted by the senate it should be pointed out that these changes have the support of the unitedstates department of housing and urban development the department of justice as well as key elements in the business community principally the national association of realtors and the national association of home builders the amendments adopted in the other body do no harm to the spirit of the balanced compromise approved by this house just a few weeks ago in fact many of these amendments serve to enhance and reinforce some of the provisions contained in that compromise for example many members of this house were concerned about the potential adverse impact that the coverage of families with children could have on senior citizens retirement communities under the language of one notable senate amendment existing senior citizen communities will have increased flexibility and possibility to qualify for the exemption from the familial status requirements just as important is the senateadded language providing a transition period for the current residents of housing that excludes children they will not be required to leave that housing nor will they be subject to eviction that is existing residents whose presence in a community or apartment complex might otherwise cause the community to fall outside the protections in section 807 b 2 will not be counted in calculating whether the exemption should apply the bottom line is that senior citizens retirement communities across the united states will have a greater chance of qualifying for the housing for older persons exemption furthermore no one will be evicted whether in a senior citizens community or an alladult community because of the enactment of this bill litigation authority was also an issue when we considered h r 1158 on this floor approximately 6 weeks ago the language contained in the bill before the house today fully consolidates in the department of justice the authority to represent the federal government in all of the enforcement actions under the fair housing act however while the litigation will be conducted by lawyers from the department of justice the decision as to whether or not prompt judicial action is necessary to obtain injunctive relief or to seek court enforcement of a finding of discriminatirn will still be lodged with the secretary of housing and urban development so under the latest compromise the secretary will decide whether or not litigation should occur where the secretary authorizes the litigation it is transmitted to the attorney general and lie is required to promptly commence and maintain such action consistent with the terms of the senate amendment the amended version of h r 1158 also contains a technical amendment to the bills language providing for a transition period for state and local fair housing agencies making it clear that certain interim certifications by hud are included in the bill the language adopted in the other body also makes it clear that this legislation is not requiring the establishment of a federal building code because of the accessibility and adaptability requirement for newly constructed multifamlly dwellings these and the other changes made in h r 1158 are improvements and refinements fully consistent with the spirit of the housepassed compromise bill we are in the final stretch run of a circuitous race that began nearly 10 years ago this bipartisan

social security we are being called upon to increase the coverage of benefits to our countrys elderly to cover catastrophic health costs unfortunately these new benefits will be paid for through a massive income tax increase imposed exclusively on the elderly the bill calls for a new mandatory supplemental premium which would apply to all medicare beneficiaries this new tax would start for individuals whose income is just 6 000 per year and the maximum tax of 580 per year would apply to elderly persons with incomes of 14 166 in stark contrast the presidents catastrophic health bill would require only a modest 4 92 a month premium lets compare the two bills h r 2470would provide insurance to the elderly by imposing a new 580 annual tax presidents planwould provide insurance at an annual cost of less than 60 a year in additional premiums it is my view that elderly americans need catastrophic health protection but they do not deserve substantial tax increases to pay for coverage which the majority of them will not need i suggest we look not just at the end result of our goals but at the means by which we intend to achieve this result health and human services secretary bowen convinced the administration last february to endorse a plan to cap a patients cost for medicarecovered benefits at 2 000 a year projections of the taxpayer cost of this original bill according to hhs was to be 2 3 billion in 1988 with an increase to 12 1 billion and 54 billion in the years 2000 and 2010 respectively this was however as the bill stood before being marked up by the house ways and

unlimited hospital stay after payment of 520 deductible it also limits to 1 043 annually the amount beneficiaries have to pay for physician fees and outpatient services not to be outdone by such landmarks the house energy subcommittee on health added a provision mandating that medicare pay 80 percent of the cost of outpatient prescription drugs after beneficiaries pay a 500 a year deductible the preliminary hhs estimate of this final draft projects a boost in spending to 13 1 billion in 1989 rising to 52 8 billion a year by 2000 and over 205 billion annually by the year 20101 the treasury

legislation means to them most of the funds for this insurance are provided through a massive tax increase on our senior citizens in fact 58 new tax brackets would be addedi in all a fivefold increase in annual medicare premiums is what we are passing on to our nations elderly i think there is a better way we need not raise taxes on the nations elderly for health care coverage the president submitted a catastrophic health plan that would have provided necessary coverage at a modest 4 90 monthly premium the presidents plan would have limited outofpocket expenses to 2 000 annually for those who decide to participate in the plan instead our senior citizens are being stuck with a new tax hike of over 30 billion during the next 5 years to pay for the more liberal health plan h r 2470 would also provide coverage for prescription medicines this type of insurance already exists in the private market but is not purchased why because most elderly choose not to buy such coverage because it is simply not worth the cost to them in all i doubt very seriously that the socalled beneficiaries of this legislation will see the increase in their taxes at all essential when it pays for services which they are able to receive at better quality and price in the private sector i suggest that we think about what were doing for a change if this legislation is passed we are almost

people of today when they see professional football players slapped on the wrist for 30 days and supposedly beginning their drug rehabilitation by playing golf what do they think when they hear on the floor of the house that we should excuse drug traffickers because they happen to be veterans i heard someone ask how can we take a particular benefit away from somebody when their service in vietnam drove them to trafficking in drugs is that the message you want to send forward do you want to send a message forward that in a courtroom in america that if someone is a drug trafficker they can say they got involved in drugs in vietnam and therefore they are excused i am concerned about veterans of america and concerned about the vietnam veterans but more concerned about the young people of america today in this respect what i heard on the floor is that if a trafficker sells drugs to my son or your son or grandson that person ought to receive special treatment because that person happened to be a veteran we made an exemption because we understood the problem of drug usage among some that returned from vietnam you do not suffer the same disability under the mccollum amendment if you are merely using drugs and convicted of use if you happen to be a veteran they are therefore given a special exemption but when their action rises to the question of drug trafficking we say

sanctions legislation i have some serious reservations about this bill h r as the ranking republican on the banking committee let me address one problem in this bill with reepect to bank loans under this bill banks will not be able to reschedule existing loans with south africa because of the debt moratorium that south africa imposed after the first sanctions bill no payments are being made under original loan terms thus united states banks will have no other alternative then to sell the loans because they will become uncollectible under original terms the bottom line impact is that united states banks stand to lose over a billion dollars and our banks loss will become the south african governments gain it is inconceivable to me that the authors of this legislation would want to confer such a windfall on the south african government i should make the point that no new lending has occured since the last sanctions bill the only new money flowing into south africa has been shortterm trade financing which will be prevented under this bill additionally no new investment has been allowed either the first sanctions bill was a positive step forward which banned new banks loans but to allow the south africans to excuse their debt now is in my opinion not a sanction other provisions of the bill are also troublesome for instance unitedstates investors big and small may lose over a billion dollars because of the mandated disinvestment also the breaking of all intelligence ties between our two nations is mandated by this bill despite the strategic location of south africa t enetrage my colleagues to support tht 1roomfield alternative as a more sensiole in their approach to this problem we should seek allied strength if these sanctions are to be effective as the broomfield alternative suggests moreover thl burton substitute would specifically attempt to improve black economic power in south africa while maintaining the existing sanctions both of these objectives are laudableand notably lacking in h r 1580 h r 1580 in its present form is a solo effort because we do not have indications that other nations plan to follow our lead in the sanctions effort will blacks have more economic power if we pass this bill most likely notand therefore their leverage for change will diminish in the final analysis what we are doing here is simply sending a signal that we will have nothing to do with south africa it is a symbolic move and i can understand that approach but with respect to real economic harm to the south african government and economy i really dont believe that there will be any significant impact from the sanctions contained in h r 1580 as i mentioned i have supported sanctions in the past on every occasion i favor more punitive action against south africa but i believe that this legislation needs to be improved as it stands unitedstates banks and investors will be injured with no corresponding benefit or gain to the black

been my strongly held view and the view of the entire house veterans affairs committee that at the very least the medical program of the veterans administration should be funded at a current services level this budget resolution falls considerably short of current services and therefore is of groat concern to me the resolution may look all right at first glance on further examination however it is clear that the budget committee has recommended funds for function 700 that places veterans medical care at less than a priority level as compared to a number of other programs the budget committee recommendation figures might indicate to some that they are 250 million over the presidents reestimated request for budget authority and budget outlays on closer look however we can see that such is not the case a recommended 1percent acrosstheboard decrease for va medicine relates to 150 mll lion absorption of onehalf of the cost of a federal pay raise relates to another 150 mil lion this 300 million in turn relates to a loss of about 3 000 employees in vas department of medicine and surgery this budget committee report is a far cry from current services for va medicine it means that va will treat fewer outpatients next year it means that fewer inpatients will be treated it means that quality medical care for veterans is in jeopardy it means a diminishing of the historic pledge of this body that it will always assure adequate funds for va medicine the house veterans affairs committee carefully studied the presidents budget and then made recommendations to the budget committee we were unanimous in those recommendations we said that the presidents budget ought to be very modestly amended upward for va medical care and for the administration of veterans benefits we recommended a very modest increase in construction funds to build three more nursing homes to try to take care of aging veterans we wanted to start work on a badly needed clinical addition and spinal cord injury unit at dallas tx we rejected a 1percent projected increase in productivity in va hospitals and clinics because medical care is just not measured that way in essence we asked for a budget to adequately provide current services with only bare bones enhancemerits already fully justified these were modest but vitally needed recommendations we tried to be responsible we trisd to be frugal however it seems obvious that this budget resolution was preordained by the economic summit agreements of last decomber i say this because of the very quick action of the budget committee in reporting it to us i was not party to that agreement and do not feel compelled to support any part of it that does harm to va medicine i believe the veterans of this nation deserve a quality medical program i intend always to lend my best efforts in that direction in that regard i must state publicly that the resolution before us is most seriously flawed in a very critical area"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "as we consider h r 1934 today i hope that we will bear in mind the many compelling arguments for not codifying the fairness doctrine as i listened to the panelists that came before the house telecommunications and finance subcommittee during the recent hearing conducted on this legislation i was struck by one overriding impression the codification of the fairness doctrine cannot be justified unless one accepts the spectrum scarcity rationale sheer weight of numbers prevents me from accepting this argument there are now approximately 10 000 radio stations and 1 300 television stations reaching 98 2 percent of all unitedstates households with the availability of home dishes cable vcrs and microwave technology there are numerous sources of information for broadcast audiences to choose from although no one is even suggesting that we consider applying the fairness doctrine to newspapers it is interesting to contrast the broadcast numbers with the figures for the print media for example there are only 1 700 daily newspapers in this country and many major cities are only one or twopaper towns yet 96 percent of unitedstates households receive five or more television signals and 71 percent of all households receive nine or more signals in addition there are 7 300 cable systems reaching 46 percent of homes in the united states far from a scarcity the numbers indicate convincingly that the broadcast audience has a great many information alternatives available as my good friend the gentleman from iowa perceptively pointed out at the subcommittee hearing on h r 1934 in considering the spectrum scarcity rationale a distinction must be made between the availability of opportunities to broadcast programming and the availability of the opportunities to receive programming proponents of this bill have continually focused on the former distinction when the very purposes of the fairness doctrine command that we focus on the latter distinction i am concerned that enacting the fairness doctrine will intrude on the constitutional rights of broadcasters i see the fairness doctrine as a dangerous precedent of government regulation over content government officials should not be dictating broadcast contentthat should be determined solely by the tastes and information needs of the people the dial of the television set is a far more desirable regulatory tool than a vague concept of fairness enforced by a government agency"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "assume something that is just the opposite of what we have here today let us assume a republican congress and a democrat in the white house and the speaker of this hypothetical republican congress has gotten himself into some difficulty the democratic attorney general knows that if he undertakes an investigation if he indicts the first accusation will be that it is a political indictment when a politician of any party is indicted the first defense is that it is a political vendetta now the attorney general of whatever party is going to think twice about indicting a high political official of this congress or the other body it just creates more problems than it is worth the purpose of an independent counsel statute is not simply to avoid conflicts of interest within an administration it ought to be to avoid political indictment that ought to be the worst thing in the lexicon of justice political indictment now to obviate the perception that politics is playing a role in accusing indicting having grand jury hearings concerning a prominent member of this body there ought to be an easy way a simple way a direct way a statutory way to get that wonderful dispassionate impartial nonpolitical in dependent counsel to investigate and if an indictment is warranted to bring it if

book entitled house out of order in that book he charged that the house was not functioning properly because power was too concentrated in senior committee chairmen and the rules committee neither of which he felt were representative of the american people that book helped spark a congressional reform revolution over the next decade it gave us the legislative reorganization act the war powers resolution the budget act the committee reform amendments and numerous king caucus reforms that further opened the house and dispersed power while many of the reforms of that turbulent decade have been beneficial others have had the opposite effectparticularly those that gave rise to a proliferation of semlautomous subcommittees as a result the house is probably more out order today than it was 22 years ago the fact is this house is failing miserably at its three primary responsibilities policymaking oversight and controlling the purse strings the heart of the policy process in the house our committee system has clogged arteries as a result of layers of fatty tissue congressional oversight is something that is largely overlooked and our purse strings are hopelessly tangled in budget and appropriations hoops that dominate our sessions yet still come out days late and dollars short on savings why arent our authorizing committees doing their jobs for one thing they get organized late each congress and then only work 2 or 3 days a week when they finally do start reporting bills they are lucky if their legislation can be squeezed in between budget and appropriations measures for another thing our committeeslike gulliverare hamstrung and tied down by a lilliputian system of subcommittees and staff ensuring duplication conflict and delays what about our constitutional powers of the purse despite the landmark budget reform act of 1974 the fact is we are doing a much worse job of budgeting today than we were 22 years ago not only do we have bigger deficits but we still cant get our spending bills enacted on time the fact is last year we did much worse on enacting regular appropriations bills than we did 22 years ago whereas in the 89th congress we at least enacted two appropriation bills prior to the start of the fiscal year in each session in the 99th congress we had enacted none by the start of the fiscal new year in either session and whereas in the 89th congress all the regular appropriations bills were eventually enacted separately in both sessions in the 99th congress only six money bills were separately enacted in the first session and in the second session we achieved the ultimate in purse string paralysis not one appropriation bill was separately enacted instead we ended up enacting one omnibus money bill that rolled everything into one ball of waxthe largest spending bill in the history of the republic as we approach the commemoration of the 200th anniversary of our constitution this year we would do well to examine this sorry state of affairs and vow to restore this house to its proper role under that document what we are proposing on this side is a bicentennial house restoration project that reforms house rules and procedures in such a way as to revitalize the policy oversight and budgetary processes of this body first we propose to organize our committees earlier within three legislative days after their election so we can hit the ground running second we propose more 5day workweeks so committees can do their policy and oversight jobs properly third we propose to limit committees to no more than six subcommittees and members to no more than four subcommittee assignments and to abolish the joint referral of billsall to allow for more conscientious legislating and less duplication of effort with the reduction of subcommittees f member assignments we feel it wili oe possible to accomplish our other reforms a 10percent reduction in committee staffs and the elimination of proxy voting and onethird quorum rules we should no longer have need for these phantom legislative devices that were found necessary because members could not attend all their committee and subcommittee meetings and hearings abolishing these phantom devices together with our requirement for equitable party ratios on committees should help to ensure more conscientious representative and accountable legislating at the committee level and less need to rewrite bills once they reach the floor we would also require formal adoption of committee oversight agendas to ensure a more systematic approach to fulfilling that important responsibility of the congress in the area of budget reform our package calls for a special task force to report back in 3 months its recommendations for improving the budget process also in the area of budget reform we propose a rule to require a twothirds vote to consider any waiver of budget act rules and a prohibition against the inclusion of extraneous materials in reconciliation bills in the appropriations area we propose a formula whereby any shortterm continuing appropriations of 30 days or less comply with a set formula providing only for the lower of certain amounts and that longterm continuing appropriations bills conform to the same rules as regular appropriations bills regarding unauthorized and legislative provisions and cost estimates we would also require that such longterm bills contain the full text of language to be enacted rather than references to other bills and that provisions not previously adopted by the house be subject to amendment and h 8 not be protected against points of order except by twothirds vote if we are going to start legislating in such omnibus bills lets subject them to strict rules and procedures we urge the defeat of the previous question on this resolution so that our republican leader mr micas may be recognized to at least offer this bicentennial house restoration project of reforms defeating the previous question does not necessarily imply support for our package but it does indicate a willingness to at least debate them for an hour consider them on their merits and then have a direct or them before voting on the resolution reported from the democratic caucus lets make this 100th congress a truly historic one by adopting this package of house reforms that will permit this house to once again fully realize its constitutional role and potential now after the vote on the previous question we are entitled on this side of the aisle to offer a motion to commit with instructions we will as we have in the past take advantage of that opportunity there will be a motion offered to commit with instructions those instructions would be this during the 100th congress this historic congress no bill joint resolution or amendment shall be reported or considered if it contains any provision to increase marginal tax rates from the 15 and 28 percent rates for individuals or the 24percent top rates for business as provided for by the tax reform act of 1986 public law 99514 or which reduces or eliminates deductions or credits unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates for the purposes of this paragraph any provision to delay the effective dates of such rates shall be construed as a tax increase we should clearly air this issue the first day of this 100th congress we should say this first day in adopting this motion to commit with instructions that we will not allow for individual tax rate increases beyond what we just passed late last year the american people are still in doubt as to exactly what was in that tax reform package they thought they had their rates reduced and to have discussion now which i have been shocked to hear that we might come right back and in less than a year in fact in only perhaps weeks that the house of representatives the congress would presume to consider raising individual tax rates is beyond my comprehension and the american people need to know on this first day in this first vote that they will not have to worry about that issue others will speak more to this particular point on the motion to commit and also on the rules in a moment following is the proposed house republican rules package for the 100th congress"]]}
