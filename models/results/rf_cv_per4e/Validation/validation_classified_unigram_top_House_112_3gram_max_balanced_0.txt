napolitano recently ordered immigration and customs enforcement officials to not deport certain classes of aliens who are in the country illegally instead these illegal aliens will be given 2year work permits that can be renewed indefinitely the reason secretary napolitano and president obama have given the american people for this de facto amnesty program is prosecutorial discretion the secretary and the president claim that the department of homeland security personnel can use their discretion to decide what individuals they can and cannot deport but in federal immigration law this discretion does not exist congress took it away from the executive branch in 1996 when it passed the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act the law requires and i will repeat that this law requires immigration officials to address illegal aliens when they become aware that they are in the country illegally it clearly spells out the actions that must be taken by federal officials in fact according to one of the nations leading experts on immigration congress frustrated at the time because the clinton administration was using it to let thousands of illegal aliens remain in the united states wrote the law to remove that discretion in other words the discretion that president obama and secretary napolitano claim they use no longer exists because congress deliberately eliminated it in 1996 by stating they still have it president obama and secretary napolitano are actually ordering federal immigration officials to break the law since the executive branch is citing a privilege that no longer exists in ordering federal immigration officials to break the 1996 immigration act which was passed by congress and signed into law today im calling on the judiciary and homeland security committees to hold hearings to investigate the legality of this decision to use socalled prosecutorial discretion just this week we heard from the united states supreme court that because the federal government writes immigration laws state laws must work in harmony with the federal government in striking down part of arizonas s b 1070 the high courts majority said that federal law shall be the supreme law of the land when laws do not work in harmony with the federal scheme or when federal law is explicit well in this case the law is very clear there is no prosecutorial discretion now my district in pennsylvania has one of the highest unemployment rates in the state and our country is still reeling from one of the worst recessions we have ever faced the department of homeland securitys unlawful action could have grave consequences on our labor force and on our economy both at the local and national levels additionally allowing individuals with forged documents to remain in this country could pose a serious threat to our homeland security let me also state that i am troubled by the expansion of the authority of the president that he believes he has in the past president obama clearly stated he had to follow existing immigration laws during a town hall meeting with univision in march 2011 he said america is a nation of laws which means i as the president am obligated to enforce the law i dont have a choice about that during that same town hall meeting president obama also said there are enough laws on the books by congress that are very clear in terms of how we have to enforce our immigration system that for me to simply through executive order ignore those congressional mandates would not conform with my appropriate role as president so what changed in the last 15 months did congress grant the president new powers i dont remember doing that fifteen months ago president obama said he cant ignore congressional mandates but suddenly 2 weeks ago he can again i ask what changed im concerned president obama overstepped his constitutional authority in this case just as he did in claiming executive privilege in operation fast and furious thats why these

this one had a question for me his mom was sitting in the room and he said congressman why are we still in afghanistan and i told the young lance corporal i dont know i cannot answer it i dont understand why we are not pushing the president to bring our troops home before 2014 and that leads me to a quote by ronald reagan from his book entitled an american life the autobiography based on reagans life and it dealt with lebanon and he was the president at the time perhaps we didnt appreciate fully enough the depth of the hatred and the complexity of the problems that made the middle east such a jungle perhaps the idea of a suicide car bomber committing mass murder to gain instant entry to paradise was so foreign to our values and consciousness that it did not create in us the concern for the marines safety that it should have in the weeks immediately after the bombing i believed the last thing that we should do was turn tail and leave yet the irrationality of middle east politics forced us to rethink our policy there if there would be some rethinking of policy before our men die we would be a lot better off if that policy had changed towards more of a neutral position and neutrality those 241 marines would be alive today i thank mr reagan for his service to our nation and i thank him for those words i wish both parties would listen to leaders like ronald reagan who

project or cause brings them together for more than a century our tax laws have recognized that such voluntary associationsnonprofits as we call them todayshould not be taxed because their proceeds are devoted entirely to improve our communities through education advocacy and civic action section 501 of the internal revenue code recognizes them today and civic groups as diverse as moveon org the league of conservation voters the aclu the national rifle association and various taxpayer groups have always been included in this definition we dont apply a political test to these civic groups we recognize the fundamental right of americans to organize and to pool their resources to promote whatever causes they believe in left or right indeed whatever their political persuasion these civic groups perform an absolutely indispensable role in our democracy by raising public awareness defining issues educating voters promoting reforms holding officials accountable and petitioning their government to redress grievances abolition womens suffrage the civil rights movementall would have been impossible without them in order to be recognized as nonprofit groups these organizations must register with the irsa purely ministerial function that in the past has been applied evenly and without regard to their political views at least until now it seems that tea party groups are today being treated very differently than their counterparts on the political left for the last 2 years many have been stonewalled by the irs when they sought to register as nonprofits most recently they have been barraged with increasingly aggressive and threatening demands vastly outside the legal authority of the irs indeed the only conceivable purpose of some of these demands is to intimidate and harass a tea party group in my district is typical of the reports that we are now hearing across this country this group submitted articles of incorporation as a nonprofit to the state of california and they received approval within a month but then they tried to register as a nonprofit with the irs despite repeated and numerous inquiries the irs stonewalled this group for a year and a half at which time it demanded thousands of pages of documentation and gave the group less than 3 weeks to produce it the irs demanded the names of every participant at every meeting held over the last 2 years transcripts of every speech given at those meetings what positions they had taken on issues the names of their volunteers and donors and copies of communications they had with elected officials and on and on perhaps most chilling of all the organizer of this particular group soon found herself the object of a personal income tax audit by the irs these are groups of volunteers who pass the hat at meetings to pay for renting the hall they give of their own time to research issues and pay out of their own pockets for printing flyers the donations made to them arent tax deductible so there is no legitimate purpose in asking for the names of their donors let alone of their volunteers unlessand this is the fine point of itunless the purpose is to harass and intimidate ironically the same tactics we now see used by the united states against tea parties were once used by the most abusive of the southern states in the 1950s to intimidate civil rights groups like the naacp no such tactics have been reported by similar civic groups on the political left so the conclusion is inescapablethat this administration is very clearly very pointedly and very deliberately attempting to intimidate harass and threaten civicminded groups with which they disagree using one of the most feared and powerful agencies of the united states government to do so these facts speak for themselves they need no embellishment or interpretation they should alarm every american of goodwill regardless of political philosophy for if this precedent is allowed to stand no ones freedom is safe i bring these facts to the attention of the house today and ask that they be rigorously investigated and if found accurate that those officials responsible be exposed disgraced dismissed and debarred from any further

rules regarding the school lunch program and while i wont go into the lengthy reasons why its the wrong way to go for nutritionnot just the cost that it bears to the schools but also the fact that usda was recommending reducing the consumption of potatoes corn peas and lima beans to just one serving a weekwhich believe me i was shocked but it wasnt just myself that had this reaction it was also the california fruit growers association it was the national school boards association it was the council of the great city schools that wrote a letter and thats why i and 40 other colleagues wrote to mr vilsack of the unitedstates department of agriculture in reaction to the promulgation of these rules i will enter into the record the testimony i was going to give until she withdrew the amendment as well as these four letters mr chair i rise in opposition to this amendment breakfasts and lunches served in schools are important components of the diets of school age children improving the nutritional profile of meals served to school children is very important when the usda proposed a rule that eliminated potatoes from the school breakfast program and limited the school lunch program to one cup a week of potatoes i was very concerned on the agriculture committee i have made it frequently known how important healthy living and nutritious eating habits are to me as a person a mother a grandmother and as a legislator it is especially near and dear to my heart when we discuss policies that affect childrens nutritional needs when i heard that the usda recommended reducing the consumption of potatoes corn peas and lima beansi was shocked when my daughter was growing up i took great care to ensure that she ate healthy balanced meals of course potatoes were a part of that equation you all know that they are full of potassium vitamins c and b6 potassium fiber and antioxidants i cannot understand why the usda would want to reduce school childrens consumption of potatoes i think that it is short sighted for the usda to ignore the health benefits that the potato provides when looking at how to incentivize healthier eating habits we in congress need to find a way to encourage and educate program recipients to eat balanced meals i think it is very important to make sure that children receive balanced meals and that certainly includes potatoes i along with fortyone of my colleagues sent a letter to the usda asking a number of questions about this proposed rule without objections i would like to submit a copy of this letter to the record mr chair potatoes lima beans peas and corn are all healthy vegetables that should certainly be in the school breakfast and lunch programs potatoes are an excellent source of potassium and good source of fiber according to the usdas own magazine amber waves potatoes deliver these nutrients at a very low cost fns has estimated that the proposed rule would increase the cost of school meals by 6 8 billion over the next five years per meal the cost will increase by 14 cents per lunch and fifty cents per breakfast mr chair school districts and states across the country are already cashstrapped and cannot afford this increased cost this additional burden will be passed onto students paying full price for their meals while i agree with the intent of the usda to encourage the consumption of more fruits and vegetables whole grains and lean proteinsrestricting the consumption of nutritious vegetables like potatoes lima beans peas and corn is shortsighted and not the most effective approach to achieve that

with consumption taxes because the power to tax is the power to destroy and what we destroy in this country is productivity were the only oecd country on the planet that doesnt have a consumption tax the only one that punishes our producers instead of taxing our consumers and it eliminates not 2 9 trillion in loopholes as the budget does but 100 percent of every corporate loophole weve heard it on

president obamas increased spending in fact it took our nation over 200 years to accumulate the same amount of debt as weve accumulated in the last 212 years in north dakota we know that you cant do the same thing over and over again and expect different results this week congress has the opportunity to get it right in north dakota we balance our budget we work to leave that next generation

future of our children and grandchildren could be without the threat of having to repay the money that washington has wasted imagine how momandpop shops could be growing hiring and expanding if looming tax increases werent a factor in their business plans enough is enough missing another opportunity to balance the budget is not a mistake that we can afford to make twice thats why i authored

napolitano recently ordered immigration and customs enforcement officials to not deport certain classes of aliens who are in the country illegally instead these illegal aliens will be given 2year work permits that can be renewed indefinitely the reason secretary napolitano and president obama have given the american people for this de facto amnesty program is prosecutorial discretion the secretary and the president claim that the department of homeland security personnel can use their discretion to decide what individuals they can and cannot deport but in federal immigration law this discretion does not exist congress took it away from the executive branch in 1996 when it passed the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act the law requires and i will repeat that this law requires immigration officials to address illegal aliens when they become aware that they are in the country illegally it clearly spells out the actions that must be taken by federal officials in fact according to one of the nations leading experts on immigration congress frustrated at the time because the clinton administration was using it to let thousands of illegal aliens remain in the united states wrote the law to remove that discretion in other words the discretion that president obama and secretary napolitano claim they use no longer exists because congress deliberately eliminated it in 1996 by stating they still have it president obama and secretary napolitano are actually ordering federal immigration officials to break the law since the executive branch is citing a privilege that no longer exists in ordering federal immigration officials to break the 1996 immigration act which was passed by congress and signed into law today im calling on the judiciary and homeland security committees to hold hearings to investigate the legality of this decision to use socalled prosecutorial discretion just this week we heard from the united states supreme court that because the federal government writes immigration laws state laws must work in harmony with the federal government in striking down part of arizonas s b 1070 the high courts majority said that federal law shall be the supreme law of the land when laws do not work in harmony with the federal scheme or when federal law is explicit well in this case the law is very clear there is no prosecutorial discretion now my district in pennsylvania has one of the highest unemployment rates in the state and our country is still reeling from one of the worst recessions we have ever faced the department of homeland securitys unlawful action could have grave consequences on our labor force and on our economy both at the local and national levels additionally allowing individuals with forged documents to remain in this country could pose a serious threat to our homeland security let me also state that i am troubled by the expansion of the authority of the president that he believes he has in the past president obama clearly stated he had to follow existing immigration laws during a town hall meeting with univision in march 2011 he said america is a nation of laws which means i as the president am obligated to enforce the law i dont have a choice about that during that same town hall meeting president obama also said there are enough laws on the books by congress that are very clear in terms of how we have to enforce our immigration system that for me to simply through executive order ignore those congressional mandates would not conform with my appropriate role as president so what changed in the last 15 months did congress grant the president new powers i dont remember doing that fifteen months ago president obama said he cant ignore congressional mandates but suddenly 2 weeks ago he can again i ask what changed im concerned president obama overstepped his constitutional authority in this case just as he did in claiming executive privilege in operation fast and furious thats why these two committees must hold formal hearings and investigate this claim of discretion and the unilateral rewriting of federal immigration policy"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "27 times the united states constitution has been amended its something we do rarely and its something that we should think through in the process we do it only because it is absolutely required and we have common agreement across the house the senate and the american people this is one of those moments if you ask most every american on the street should we balance our budget they will nod their head if you ask them again should we force congress to balance the budget again they will nod their head and say yes this is something we should do there is common agreement across the american people because its common sense its hard to explain to any family or any business why they have to balance their budget but congress does not it is the ultimate exemption for members of congress that they can spend as much as they want as often as they would like without any retribution i hear all the doomsday statements that if we balanced our budget what would possibly happen if we had to live within our means it makes me smile and say just like every business and every family we have to make hard choices and we have to do it but its not what doomsday prediction happens if we balance our budget it is look up across the ocean at what is happening in europe right now to nations that did not balance their budget and for some reason we think as americans we can run up as much debt as we would like with no consequence we are fooling ourselves the doomsday is coming we must put a boundary around the united states congress to be able to balance our budget in 1995 when this failed by one vote we will forever regret that if this

marine corps base in my district were there four of the five had lost both legsdouble amputees and the one kid that had his leg blown off by an ied i went into his room as i did the other four but this one had a question for me his mom was sitting in the room and he said congressman why are we still in afghanistan and i told the young lance corporal i dont know i cannot answer it i dont understand why we are not pushing the president to bring our troops home before 2014 and that leads me to a quote by ronald reagan from his book entitled an american life the autobiography based on reagans life and it dealt with lebanon and he was the president at the time perhaps we didnt appreciate fully enough the depth of the hatred and the complexity of the problems that made the middle east such a jungle perhaps the idea of a suicide car bomber committing mass murder to gain instant entry to paradise was so foreign to our values and consciousness that it did not create in us the concern for the marines safety that it should have in the weeks immediately after the bombing i believed the last thing that we should do was turn tail and leave yet the irrationality of middle east politics forced us to rethink our policy there if there would be some rethinking of policy before our men die we would be a lot better off if that policy had changed towards more of a neutral position and neutrality those 241 marines would be alive today i thank mr reagan for his service to our nation and i thank him for those words i wish both parties would listen to leaders like ronald reagan who understood that youre not going to change the middle east no matter what you want to do or hope to do or pray to do you cant do it and you wont do it beside me are two little girls one named eden and one named stephanie they are at the graveside of their father sergeant kenneth bladuf sergeant in the united states marine corps about 2 months ago he was sent to afghanistan along with a colonel benjamin palmer from cherry point marine corps air station which is in my district also one night when they were having dinner with the afghan trainees one of the trainees pulled out a pistol and killed both of them it is so ironic that the day before sergeant bladuf was killed he had emailed his wife and he said i dont trust them i dont trust them i dont trust any of them and yet we keep spending 10 billion a month were going to cut programs from senior citizens and children in america we cant balance the budget but old mr karzai hell get his 10 billion a month the congress needs to look at this and start bringing our troops home before 2014 also in sundays paper it says suicide bomber hits nato bus 17 people including 12 americans are killed in the deadliest attack since the war began i hope that we dont have to continue to go to walter reedbethesda and see all of these broken bodies if were going to be there until 2014 there are going to be a lot more broken bodies and dead young men and women i hope the leadership of both parties will start joining those of us in both parties and bring our troops home before 2014 again i state to all the children like eden and stephanie be proud of your moms and your dads but for those of us who are policymakers we have the responsibilitynot the generals but we the policymakersof sending our young men and women to die and lose their limbs for absolutely nothing but a corrupt leader i will close right now with the same closing i do all the time god please bless our men and women in uniform please bless the families of our men and women in uniform god in your loving arms hold the families who have given a child dying for freedom in afghanistan and iraq god please bless the house and senate that we will do what is right in your

defining aspect of the american tradition is that groups of citizens band together for a wide variety of civic purposes they recruit volunteers raise funds and spend those funds to promote whatever project or cause brings them together for more than a century our tax laws have recognized that such voluntary associationsnonprofits as we call them todayshould not be taxed because their proceeds are devoted entirely to improve our communities through education advocacy and civic action section 501 of the internal revenue code recognizes them today and civic groups as diverse as moveon org the league of conservation voters the aclu the national rifle association and various taxpayer groups have always been included in this definition we dont apply a political test to these civic groups we recognize the fundamental right of americans to organize and to pool their resources to promote whatever causes they believe in left or right indeed whatever their political persuasion these civic groups perform an absolutely indispensable role in our democracy by raising public awareness defining issues educating voters promoting reforms holding officials accountable and petitioning their government to redress grievances abolition womens suffrage the civil rights movementall would have been impossible without them in order to be recognized as nonprofit groups these organizations must register with the irsa purely ministerial function that in the past has been applied evenly and without regard to their political views at least until now it seems that tea party groups are today being treated very differently than their counterparts on the political left for the last 2 years many have been stonewalled by the irs when they sought to register as nonprofits most recently they have been barraged with increasingly aggressive and threatening demands vastly outside the legal authority of the irs indeed the only conceivable purpose of some of these demands is to intimidate and harass a tea party group in my district is typical of the reports that we are now hearing across this country this group submitted articles of incorporation as a nonprofit to the state of california and they received approval within a month but then they tried to register as a nonprofit with the irs despite repeated and numerous inquiries the irs stonewalled this group for a year and a half at which time it demanded thousands of pages of documentation and gave the group less than 3 weeks to produce it the irs demanded the names of every participant at every meeting held over the last 2 years transcripts of every speech given at those meetings what positions they had taken on issues the names of their volunteers and donors and copies of communications they had with elected officials and on and on perhaps most chilling of all the organizer of this particular group soon found herself the object of a personal income tax audit by the irs these are groups of volunteers who pass the hat at meetings to pay for renting the hall they give of their own time to research issues and pay out of their own pockets for printing flyers the donations made to them arent tax deductible so there is no legitimate purpose in asking for the names of their donors let alone of their volunteers unlessand this is the fine point of itunless the purpose is to harass and intimidate ironically the same tactics we now see used by the united states against tea parties were once used by the most abusive of the southern states in the 1950s to intimidate civil rights groups like the naacp no such tactics have been reported by similar civic groups on the political left so the conclusion is inescapablethat this administration is very clearly very pointedly and very deliberately attempting to intimidate harass and threaten civicminded groups with which they disagree using one of the most feared and powerful agencies of the united states government to do so these facts speak for themselves they need no embellishment or interpretation they should alarm every american of goodwill regardless of political philosophy for if this precedent is allowed to stand no ones freedom is safe i bring these facts to the attention of the house today and ask that they be rigorously investigated and if found accurate that those officials responsible be exposed disgraced dismissed and debarred from any further

rules regarding the school lunch program and while i wont go into the lengthy reasons why its the wrong way to go for nutritionnot just the cost that it bears to the schools but also the fact that usda was recommending reducing the consumption of potatoes corn peas and lima beans to just one serving a weekwhich believe me i was shocked but it wasnt just myself that had this reaction it was also the california fruit growers association it was the national school boards association it was the council of the great city schools that wrote a letter and thats why i and 40 other colleagues wrote to mr vilsack of the unitedstates department of agriculture in reaction to the promulgation of these rules i will enter into the record the testimony i was going to give until she withdrew the amendment as well as these four letters mr chair i rise in opposition to this amendment breakfasts and lunches served in schools are important components of the diets of school age children improving the nutritional profile of meals served to school children is very important when the usda proposed a rule that eliminated potatoes from the school breakfast program and limited the school lunch program to one cup a week of potatoes i was very concerned on the agriculture committee i have made it frequently known how important healthy living and nutritious eating habits are to me as a person a mother a grandmother and as a legislator it is especially near and dear to my heart when we discuss policies that affect childrens nutritional needs when i heard that the usda recommended reducing the consumption of potatoes corn peas and lima beansi was shocked when my daughter was growing up i took great care to ensure that she ate healthy balanced meals of course potatoes were a part of that equation you all know that they are full of potassium vitamins c and b6 potassium fiber and antioxidants i cannot understand why the usda would want to reduce school childrens consumption of potatoes i think that it is short sighted for the usda to ignore the health benefits that the potato provides when looking at how to incentivize healthier eating habits we in congress need to find a way to encourage and educate program recipients to eat balanced meals i think it is very important to make sure that children receive balanced meals and that certainly includes potatoes i along with fortyone of my colleagues sent a letter to the usda asking a number of questions about this proposed rule without objections i would like to submit a copy of this letter to the record mr chair potatoes lima beans peas and corn are all healthy vegetables that should certainly be in the school breakfast and lunch programs potatoes are an excellent source of potassium and good source of fiber according to the usdas own magazine amber waves potatoes deliver these nutrients at a very low cost fns has estimated that the proposed rule would increase the cost of school meals by 6 8 billion over the next five years per meal the cost will increase by 14 cents per lunch and fifty cents per breakfast mr chair school districts and states across the country are already cashstrapped and cannot afford this increased cost this additional burden will be passed onto students paying full price for their meals while i agree with the intent of the usda to encourage the consumption of more fruits and vegetables whole grains and lean proteinsrestricting the consumption of nutritious vegetables like potatoes lima beans peas and corn is shortsighted and not the most effective approach to achieve that goal i encourage my colleagues to vote no on this amendment and instruct the usda to issue a new proposed rule on implementing the new national nutrition standards for the school breakfast and school lunch programs"]]}
