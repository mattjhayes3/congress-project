word is meaningless irans government is a notoriously untrustworthy rogue state that has made it unmistakably clear that it intends to acquire nuclear weapons and once acquired to use them the only way to avert this nightmare short of war is for the regime to collapse from within over the last several years the iranian opposition has grown dramatically for two reasons there is a strong and
