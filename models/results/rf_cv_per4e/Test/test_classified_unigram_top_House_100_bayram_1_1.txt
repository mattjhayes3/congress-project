negotiations with the soviet union relative to its presence in nicaragua it is a most fascinating letter signed on to by a large portion of the democratic leadership including the people who brought the bill to the floor the othl day that had provisions in it whiei would have committed our military to central america and to the nicaraguan problem for the first time but in this letter to the president they say some very fascinating things that i think the american people should reflect upon for example in this letter they are saying quite clearly that the nicaraguan communist government represents a real threat to unitedstates security they say at present the greatest danger of such a threatmeaning to central america in this case and they above say that the united states has valid security concerns in central america and then they say at present the greatest danger of such a threat is in nicaragua under the government of the sandinista junta then they go on to say some very interesting things for instance they make the point about the massive amount of soviet aid that is there including as they put it mi24 hind attack helicopters and then they make this statement there are also rumors of the construction of submarine bases and airfields capable of landing the largest bombers we know that that is more than rumor unless of course pictures of those bases are simply rumor because on this floor during the debate my colleague the gentleman from california actually showed this house pictures of the airfields pictures of the submarine bases it is more than rumor it is fact that is the problem that we are faced with anyhow they go on and they suggest to the president that what he ought to do is to negotiate the soviet presence out of nicaragua the problem with this letter is that it does not seem to recognize that those negotiations have already been under way and that the soviet union is not responding in a manner which helps our security interests i have here another letter this one from colin powell the national security adviser to the president who has pointqd out to us he wrote it to one of our colleagues the chairman of the subcommittee on europe and the middle east and he says in the letter president reagan raised the issue of nicaragua with the general secretary pointing out that continuing massive soviet supply of military equipment to the sandinista regime aggravates the situation in central america and constitutes another instance in which soviet actions in regional conflicts made unitedstates soviet relations more difficult secretary schultz pursued the same topic with the soviets in postsummit consultations in other words what this letter says is that there is an ongoing process of discussions taking place on the very topic that the democrats are saying open negotiations about i am surprised that they do not know what is really going on but let us go on in the letter because this is the problem mr powell goes on and points out the soviet position on the question is clear they propose to limit military assistance to the sandinistas to only small armswhich the general secretary characterized as police arms in exchange for unitedstates stopping its military assistance programs to the other nations of central america and to the nicaraguan democratic resistance this proposal needless to say is not congruent with our commitments to the central american democracies nor with our national interest its acceptance would leave the present dangerous sandinista military preponderance over its neighbors entirely intact moreover it would have us legitimize a dangerous extension of soviet power onto the mainland of the western hemisphere now the only thing that i can conclude is either the people who signed on to this letter are totally ignorant of the negotiations that are ongoing or they intend for us to accept the soviet proposal because i can come to no other interpretation of what they are saying to the president if in fact what they are saying is mr president accept what the soviets offer let us understand what that means it means the soviets would continue to send the small arms in ak47s for instance automatic rifles while we would send no aid whatsoever to the central american democracies what that would mean is that the guerrilla forces that have been funded and have been supported out of nicaragua would be able to get those ak47s to use against el salvador to use against guatemala to use against honduras to use against costa rica and those countries would not have any help to respond the soviets are saying let us send small arms we wont send tanks but we are going to send small arms but you send nothing is that really the deal that the democrats would have us sign on to i

above fiscal year 1987 levels and more than 1 2 billion above the administration request my colleagues will ask why a 300 million cut is the right amount to cut from the interior appropriations bill the response is that a 300 million reduction would reduce by one half the level of increase in appropriations from last year to this year except for the increase in the fillrate of the strategic petroleum reserve last year the congress approved 8 3 billion for the department of interior and related agencies appropriations bill as part of the omnibus continuing resolution this year the committee is recommending a 9 45 billion bill an increase of almost 1 2 billion if one sets aside the decision to provide 600 million in strategic reserve funds this leaves an increase in discretionary spending of approximately 600 million the amendment i am offering would cut this increase in half i believe my amendment is necessary to compensate for the blatantly artificial and unrealistic assumptions made by the budget conference agreement this budget agreement assumes 7 2 billion in revenues from early payment of rea loans my colleagues know that this is not going to happen in todays interest rate market is the rea going to go out and borrow private money to repay subsidized public funds of course not this 7 2 billion savings is no savings at all another assumption is that congress is going to raise nearly 20 billion in taxes this year the conference agreement assumes that 1988 revenues will be in the range of 932 billion is this really going to happen are twothirds of my colleagues in the house and twothirds of the members of the other body going to put their names on the line to6 override a presidential veto of a tax increase that is what

make the tough choices to achieve real deficit reduction our goal is to reduce this funny money by around one half or 15 billion this works out to be a need for approximately a 300 million reduction

of the house of representatives i look forward to many such initiatives under the leadership of the gentleman from massachusetts the fairness doctrine has been a regulation of the federal communications commission for over 25 years it has been challenged studied threatened and bantered about for the last several years over the last 2 years the fcc has undertaken an effort to repeal the fairness doctrine that effort has sparked the current debate the legislation before us today is intended to settle the debate by codifying the fairness doctrine into our communications laws it is important to note however that the debate is not simply a legislative issue the doctrine is currently subject to court challenge and quite frankly it will be settled in the court i believe by codifying the doctrine it actually assists the courts in ruling on the doctrines constitutionality i understand that the communications laws place special duties and privileges with broadcasters this unique treatment arises from the right to broadcast given by the government to a chosen few the broadcaster accepts an obligation to the community when he receives his license broadcasters are obliged and licensed to serve their communities fair and complete news is inherent in such public service it is unfortunate that we must resort tc any form of government requirementc for enforcing that obligation but i also acknowledge that the fair ness doctrine is not an overly burden some restriction imposed by the gov eminent as presently administerec under the current state of technolog3 and the market the doctrine does vest broad editorial responsibility with the broadcaster with appropriate deference given to the good faith and reasonable judgment of licensees only a handful of complaints are actually processed by the government under current circumstances it is not an intrusive program of government censorship or control technology has brought us all sorts of alternative

his way through the maze that so often attends legislative research and produced a full response that was precisely what the client ordered bernie also had an uncanny way of sensing what clients really wanted before they knew it themselves needless to say these abilities made bernie a constant source of information for those at hud and even some congressional staffers who needed to get the story right and in full the first time thoughout his entire 33 years in legislative reference bernie remained consummmately patient in his work he was always willing to take the timein an informative

effective saddled with a halfdozen amendments the issue has been thrown back into a political circus one obstructive amendment by representative hertel requires a socioeconomic impact study of each closing most communities actually benefit from the closure of unneeded bases longterm conomic advantages ouiweight shortterm impacts when congress feels it has to cut defense programs across the board to save money it does often without hesitation but socioeconomic studies are never required for the communities that are directly affected its hard to understand how the closure of obsolete bases with a savings of 5 billion per year could be under such contention colorados pat schroeder attached an amendment to include ove eas bases thus injecting the controversial issue of allied burdensharing though there is certainly merit to allied burdensharing it should be considered as a separate issue the inclusion of overs has bases in this bill would confuse the neec to promote defense efficiency with the neej to reexamine americas role in the worldand its another ornament to the bill the rules committee has submitted the f nal version of the military base closing bill and its loaded with all of the amendments from the three committees this bill known as the committee bill is decorated with such additions as foreign bases congressional vote of approval the cumbersome congressional authorization and appropriations process to fund the base closures a socioeconomic impact statement and a historical study of each base as the rules committee has determined the original bill known as

president of the united states urging him to begin negotiations with the soviet union relative to its presence in nicaragua it is a most fascinating letter signed on to by a large portion of the democratic leadership including the people who brought the bill to the floor the othl day that had provisions in it whiei would have committed our military to central america and to the nicaraguan problem for the first time but in this letter to the president they say some very fascinating things that i think the american people should reflect upon for example in this letter they are saying quite clearly that the nicaraguan communist government represents a real threat to unitedstates security they say at present the greatest danger of such a threatmeaning to central america in this case and they above say that the united states has valid security concerns in central america and then they say at present the greatest danger of such a threat is in nicaragua under the government of the sandinista junta then they go on to say some very interesting things for instance they make the point about the massive amount of soviet aid that is there including as they put it mi24 hind attack helicopters and then they make this statement there are also rumors of the construction of submarine bases and airfields capable of landing the largest bombers we know that that is more than rumor unless of course pictures of those bases are simply rumor because on this floor during the debate my colleague the gentleman from california actually showed this house pictures of the airfields pictures of the submarine bases it is more than rumor it is fact that is the problem that we are faced with anyhow they go on and they suggest to the president that what he ought to do is to negotiate the soviet presence out of nicaragua the problem with this letter is that it does not seem to recognize that those negotiations have already been under way and that the soviet union is not responding in a manner which helps our security interests i have here another letter this one from colin powell the national security adviser to the president who has pointqd out to us he wrote it to one of our colleagues the chairman of the subcommittee on europe and the middle east and he says in the letter president reagan raised the issue of nicaragua with the general secretary pointing out that continuing massive soviet supply of military equipment to the sandinista regime aggravates the situation in central america and constitutes another instance in which soviet actions in regional conflicts made unitedstates soviet relations more difficult secretary schultz pursued the same topic with the soviets in postsummit consultations in other words what this letter says is that there is an ongoing process of discussions taking place on the very topic that the democrats are saying open negotiations about i am surprised that they do not know what is really going on but let us go on in the letter because this is the problem mr powell goes on and points out the soviet position on the question is clear they propose to limit military assistance to the sandinistas to only small armswhich the general secretary characterized as police arms in exchange for unitedstates stopping its military assistance programs to the other nations of central america and to the nicaraguan democratic resistance this proposal needless to say is not congruent with our commitments to the central american democracies nor with our national interest its acceptance would leave the present dangerous sandinista military preponderance over its neighbors entirely intact moreover it would have us legitimize a dangerous extension of soviet power onto the mainland of the western hemisphere now the only thing that i can conclude is either the people who signed on to this letter are totally ignorant of the negotiations that are ongoing or they intend for us to accept the soviet proposal because i can come to no other interpretation of what they are saying to the president if in fact what they are saying is mr president accept what the soviets offer let us understand what that means it means the soviets would continue to send the small arms in ak47s for instance automatic rifles while we would send no aid whatsoever to the central american democracies what that would mean is that the guerrilla forces that have been funded and have been supported out of nicaragua would be able to get those ak47s to use against el salvador to use against guatemala to use against honduras to use against costa rica and those countries would not have any help to respond the soviets are saying let us send small arms we wont send tanks but we are going to send small arms but you send nothing is

right amount to cut from the interior appropriations bill the response is that a 300 million reduction would reduce by one half the level of increase in appropriations from last year to this year

and agreed that congress needs to make the tough choices to achieve real deficit reduction our goal is to reduce this funny money by around one half or 15 billion this works out to be a need for

massachusetts the fairness doctrine has been a regulation of the federal communications commission for over 25 years it has been challenged studied threatened and bantered about for the last several years over the last 2 years the fcc has undertaken an effort to repeal the fairness doctrine that effort has sparked the current debate the legislation before us today is intended to settle the debate by codifying the fairness doctrine into our communications laws it is important to note however that the debate is not simply a legislative issue the doctrine is currently subject to court challenge and quite frankly it will be settled in the court i believe by codifying the doctrine it actually assists the courts in ruling on the doctrines constitutionality i understand that the communications laws place special duties and privileges with broadcasters this unique treatment arises from the right to broadcast given by the government to a chosen few the broadcaster accepts an obligation to the community when he receives his license broadcasters are obliged and licensed to serve their communities fair and complete news is inherent in such public service it is unfortunate that we must resort tc any form of government requirementc for enforcing that obligation but i also acknowledge that the fair ness doctrine is not an overly burden some restriction imposed by the gov eminent as presently
