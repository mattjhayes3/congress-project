but it will be done without the openended funding option now available this is the third time in the last 4 years the house will vote on a balanced budget amendment four years ago opponents of the balanced budget amendment argued that congress didnt need the amendment to balance our budget we have the power right now they argued to deal with our deficit without amending the constitution the house defeated the amendment by seven votes since then the federal debt has grown by over 1 trillion two years ago opponents of the balanced budget amendment argued that the amendment would demean the constitution tie congress hands and hurt the economy the house defeated the amendment by nine votes since then the federal debt has grown by over 500 billion let us end this deficit madness let us allow future generations of americans to decide for themselves how they want to spend their money the balanced budget amendment is not the final answer to our fiscal problems but it will provide a measure of discipline that doesnt exist now for that reason i applaud this effort and strongly support the balanced budget amendment"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "3 weeks ago president clinton spoke with great passion and eloquence of the need for the united states to put its fiscal house in order and of his vision for this country quite frankly i disagree on his views of broad new taxes for the families of america and quite frankly i believe that the public is having increased concerns regarding taxes that will reach deeply into the pocket of everyand i repeat everymiddleclass family in america but today i wish to speak of the area of spending cuts where there is total agreement thus tomorrow on behalf of myself and my freshman republican colleagues i will introduce a modest amendment before the accounts subcommittee that will reduce nonstatutory committee spending by 25 percent this amendment will cut onequarter from last years total authorization for the standing committees and will make allowances for the many committees that have a history of lean budgeting and fairly allocating resources the american public has indeed signalled a willingness to sacrifice but i believe their definition of sacrifice is for their elected officials to first cut spending i hope every member will contact the membership of the accounts subcommittee and tell them that the need to put americas fiscal house in order must begin right here in americas house of the people it is quite simple with regard to spending cuts congress must lead the way"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "4 days after the november

strikes and youre out why should a violent criminal get three strikes and let us quit using the word strikes and talk about what is the heart of the matter and that is victims why should a violent criminal get three victims it is absurd we need to do what we should do the first time and lock him or her up and not give them an opportunity for a second or third victim remember also we are only talking about the people who he is caught hurting three strikes and youre out is the most overblown discussion in this crime bill and i think we should amend this bill make it much tougher than it is

the last several days rightly focuses on very serious deficiencies in child care programs additionally however its condemnation of inadequate parenting by parents who are illprepared for parental responsibility must also be highlighted we as a nation and this congress must recognize that the huge number and rate of increase in illegitimate births especially with so many children and teenagers having children is the largest contributing factor for the tragedy among americas children it is time to boldly remind the bleeding heart liberals in this congress whose hearts are in the right place but who apparently lack common sense or resolve that their unwillingness to move forward on effective and yet humane changes in our welfare system contributes mightily to the problems of our nations infants and children currently our welfare system encourages illegitimate births with all the attendant problems these problems are only magnified as these children suffering from neglect and abuse themselves become adults on our welfare rolls populate our prisons suffer the physical and mental problems from inadequate childhood nutrition and all too frequently perpetuate another generational cycle of child neglect yet the leadership in this congress and the party that controls this congress cant manage to give welfare reform a sufficient priority to pass effective legislation this year thats outrageous and people in this country know that the excuses being offered for the lack of action on welfare reform ring hollow many republicans and democrats in this congress want to act to reform our welfare system and are willing to vote for the substantial upfront costs for job training and child care benefits if they are coupled with effective nononsense workincentive welfare reform for the sake of americas youngest children it is well past time for this congress to enact meaningful welfare reformwith or without any leadership from the white housefor we are still waiting for that
