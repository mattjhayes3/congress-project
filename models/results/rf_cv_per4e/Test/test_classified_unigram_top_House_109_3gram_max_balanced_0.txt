{"top_correct": [[0.0, 0.0, 0, "2 weeks ago i visited israel spent about 12 days there and traveled the whole country we started in the northern part up around caesaria phillipi went down to elat on the red sea went to jerusalem went to tel aviv talked to the people and had a very good feel for what actually is going on there so often on codels we are in a country for 24 hours 36 hours and we move on and this was a little different and so at the present time obviously people know that israel is in a very difficult spot recently they had a war involving hezbollah on their northern border and the hezbollah was located in lebanon southern part of it and fired hundreds if not thousands of katyusha missiles into israel particularly the northern part of israel and yet as we visited that part of the country it was almost untouched it seemed they had repaired they hadrestored and life was going on as usual only a couple 3 weeks after the conflict had ended as many people know hamas is very powerful in gaza and in the west bank and has tremendous influence in the paldstinian areas at the present time there are rockets being fired by the hamas people down in gaza into israel so as we watch this and as we watch the continual conflict with the palestinians and the desire for the palestinians to have a unified state unifying the west bank on the west bank of the jordan and in th gaza strip down in the southwestern part of the country you can see that israel is under tremendous pressure yet the thing that was rather impressive was the staying power the re solve the willingness of the israelis to try to see this through i guess the lessons that i took away from this and the concerns were that obviously it is important that the united states have that same staying power that same will to pull together that same willingness to survive in the face of adversity because even though we are protected by two great oceans the wor d has shrunk today we are not as secure as we once were we face a true global conflict over the horizon many of the things that we observed in israel i think apply to us even though sometimes we are not aware of it tony blair made an interesting observation here recently he stated that peace ih the middle east will be hard to come by unless israel and the palestinians and hamas and hezbollah ca~n somehow resolve their differences i believe that is very true our focus is on iraq here in the united states sometimes on afghanistan but at the heart of much of the conflict and much of the turmoil in the middle east is the conflict that involves terrorist organizations ar d israel i am not here to be partisan ar d take israels side versus another nations side i am simply pointing these issues out that i think are very important the things that i mentioned that particularly impressed me about the israelis were number one a willingness to persevere in the face of great adversity and people realize what the terrorists are attempting to do but also not far away is iran and the iranian president has basically said that he would like to destroy israel and everyone knows that at the present time it does appear that iran is trying to build nuclear capabilities this is a very tenuous situation as far as israel is concerned despite these threats as i mentioned israel seems to be staying the course seems to have great resolve and i would hope that we would have the same resolve in our country in terms of persevering in the face of adversity the second thing that i took away from that trip to israel that i think is important that may have some applicability to our situation here in t e united states is a sense on the part of the israelis of having great unity of purpose a willingness to pull together a willingness to avoid all fragmentation i guess when your back is to the wall and you are not very big ybu realize that unity of purpose is critical so we certainly detected that i guess i can relate a little bit to my previous experience in the athlet c arena in regard to the importance of unity of purpose a team of great athletes which was polarized and which was divided was not able to accompliih a great deal and yet a team with less talent which had unity of purpose would usually prevail over a superior team physically that was divided almost every time so the analogy that i would like to draw at this present time are some things that i have observed as i leave this body and this has to do really with the recent election we certainly experienced a very contentious election we saw a great deal of partisanship accusations were numerous and sometimes very destructive there were deep divisions that were very apparent between the two parties the general public at least the public that i dealt with in rural and central parts of america watched the acrimony and the namecalling with a great deal of dismay and sometimes disgust and to a significant degree i believe the political process and congress in particular is viewed with a great deal of mistrust and skepticism at the present time at the root of that i think was some of the dialogue that they saw occur in the last several months it seems to me as i talked to my constituents and people around the country that the public is counting on us to lead to unite to serve the best interests of the country rather than to point fingers and to seek to destroy the opposition i think that from this election some lessons can be drawn which way this congress goes i am not certain but i at least have some wishes i have some desires which i will try to convey i guess the majority in the house and the senate now has changed it definitely has this presents two opportunities number one an opportunity for the new majority to pay back those who were in the majority for either real or perceived slights and offenses but the second approach can be something that i think would be more constructive is a chance to change the political climate to foster a more cooperative governing style and certainly something that would restore a good deal of confidence on the part of the american people i think there are three major factors that people continually point to in regard to the last election and the two the first two have been given preeminence first of all iraq the conflict over there the fact that many americans have grown weary of it many americans have decided that we are on the wrong course to be honest about it i dont think that the congress has a tremendous amount of control over what is happening in iraq we have some we can control funding and we can make comments here but we really arent the generals on the ground so that really may be a little bit out of our element to some degree the second area is the area of ethics and the fact that many people were very upset with corrupt practices that had occurred on the part of a small number of people but still a number of our members and that this is something that congress definitely does have directly in its purview we did some reforms but not enough i dont believe in the last few months and i believe that congress members of congress members of the senate have to be above reproach as joe paterno one time said we cannot only be fair we have to appear to be fair we cannot have the perception even of wrongdoing as i sat in meeting after meeting after meeting over 6 years i cant really remember anyone getting up and really addressing the issue of ethics and how important this is in preserving the trust of the american people it is something that this body obviously has to do a better job with and i hope that it will become a major priority here then the third thing which many of the pundits have not referred to very often has simply been the issue of partisan bickering which i think would serve us very well to get over to some degree and it will be interesting to see how that develops as time goes on the most hopeful time that i had during my 6 years in congress was also maybe the worst time and that was the 3 or 4 months right after 9 11 and almost everyone here can remember those times we can remember the horror that we felt as we saw the pentagon destroyed the twin towers go down the plane crash over pennsylvania and the fact that we realized all of a sudden that as a nation we were vulnerable that was a terrible time and there was a lot of rebuilding to do at the same time it was a very hopeful time because for 3 months maybe 4 months here in this chamber and over in the senate we saw congress work together pull together to display a unity of purpose that i had not seen before or since it showed what we were capable of doing as a body as a unified organization so as time goes by and as that memory of 9 11 begins to fade it is easy to begin to become complacent again and decidd that the most important thing is party supremacy so i would hope that people would realize that even though we have not been attacked for the last 5 years that attack is still on the horizon that this is still a world that is very very combustible at the present time we really do need to pull together in a way that we have not done for the last 5 years cervantes once said something that was rather important to me in my outlook on life he said the journey is more important than the end a very brief statement he said the journey is more important than the end what he was saying is that the process that we go through the way we do things how we do things why we do things is really more important than the end result sometimes that is easy to say but it is really hard to live with because losing an election is very difficult i have experienced that losing a football game is very difficult losing a business is very difficult but what he was saying is you know the process is more important than all of that the process is more important than whether you win or whether you lose you do things in a certain way and you do them every time and in the long run that will be the most important thing that is why i point to the fact that doing things the right way here and unity of purpose is going to be very important this week there will be a big football game ohio state is going to play michigan one team will prevail they are both undefeated i dont know which team is going to win but i do know this the deciding factor will probably be something that was overlooked in the preparation something that has been laying there for the last 9 or 10 weeks unaddressed it may be a fumble the back doesnt carry the ball high and tight he flags the ball something that should have been addressed it may be an extra point where a guy isnt stepping with his right foot and all of a sudden he gets blown off th5 ball and somebody blocks an extra point or somebody blocks a punt it may be fatigue in the fourth quarter conditioning that wasnt undertaken that should have been done often that which ia ignored which does not seem to be very important or very apparent all of a sudden in a crisis becomes critical that is the way it is with our country at the present time i feel that there is something that we really are not payingadequate attention to it is like how you carry the football it is like blocking it is like punt protection those kinds of things that are little dont seem to make a lot of difference but all of sudden it jumps up and bites you the greatest threat facing the united states as i see it at the present time is something that we need to pay attention to and that is our young people because young people are the future there was a study that was released today by americas promise the organization that was headed up for many years by colin powell still very active and his wife they did a research report which released some information that i thought was very revealing it said there are really five things that a young person needs to have to grow up and be productive and to be healthy and to help make this country work they said these five promises are number one caring adults in that young persons life and 40 percent of our young people indicated at the present time that they either dont have any or dont have enough one out of five young people indicate that they do not have a single caring adult in their life somebody that really cares for them as they are number two a safe place and a constructive use of time and a tremendous number of our kids go home to homes that are not safe because of abuse they live in neighborhoods that because of gangs or violence or whatever are not safe again that is a major problem a healthy start and healthy development many of our young people grow up without adequate medical care medical attention and as a result they dont in the first 3 or 4 or 5 years of life have an even start and this again is a tremendous handicap effective education 25 percent of our young people dont complete high school many of them who do complete high school are not adequately prepared for the world of work and we are falling behind in many areas internationally in terms bf our education then opportunity to serve other people to give something of themselves so the interesting thrust of this whole research study it was interesting indicated that 31 percent of our children have either four or five of these essential ingredients and the conclusion of the study is that these 31 percent will be pretty well prepared these 31 percent will do pretty well with the rest of their lives but then they said you know 48 percent have only two or three of these factors and they have a chance but they are kind of on the bubble if you only have two or three of those five ingredients going in your life you are somewhat crippled and you may be fortunate and you may make it but you may be less than fortunate and you may not make it then the critical thing was they said 21 percent have only one of those factors or they have zero so 21 percent one out of every five of our children is at tremendous risk of not being a productive adult of having a life that is certainly not what it could be so it is important that we focus on this and understand how important this is one in 12 of our young people today attempts suicide so there is a certain desperation out there i would like to now turn to something that prime minister tony blair of britain said on this floor about 3 years ago which i think is somewhat germane that relates to what i have been talking about with our young people with our divisions in congress and so on he said as britain knows all predominant power seems for a time invincible but in fact it is transient so what he was saying is that every great nation for a period of time has assumed that it was going to live forever that things were not going to change that it would be preeminent forever and then eventually realized that this power that they had this aura of invincibility all of a sudden was not there anymore so i think that there is no question as we look at history that what he said is very true i would like to just take a quick cursory look at three nations that certainly would have fit that category he was talking about nations that were invincible at the time certainly rome 2 000 years ago ruled the entire civilized world appeared to be invincible but eventually fell from preeminence the reasons historians have given that they fell were number one a general decline in morality an increase in corruption and instability in leadership an increasing public addiction to evermoreviolent public spectacles an increase in crime and prostitution and above all a population that became more selfabsorbed apathetic and unwilling to sacrifice for the common good does that fit any of our parameters here i dont know but it certainly is something we need to be aware of and we need to think about to some degree great britain 150 years ago dominated the world had a colonial empire that dominated the world from the late 1600s through much of the 1800s yet this british empire eventually slowly crumbled the reasons given by historians are as follows number one they lost the national resolve to maintain their territory it takes a lot of energy and commitment to maintain farflung colonies around the world next values that led to ascendency were eroded the integrity the character of the people somehow was no longer what it once had been spiritual underpinnings began to shift some the spiritual values were no longer there russia 20 years ago one of the great nations of the world one of the two superpowers at that time in a matter of months disintegrated before our eyes alexander solzhenitzen reflected on this fall when he observed this he said over a half century ago while i was still a child i recall a number of older people offered the following explanation for the great disasters that had befallen russia then he quotes men have forgotten god that is why all of this has happened that is what he found many people in russia saying marx and lenin had dismantled russias religious heritage values had fallen russias foundation was broken and eventually it collapsed like a house of cards with nothing to sustain it so if you look at these three nations which i just picked out randomly there are really some common themes of historical collapse number one citizens are less willing to sacrifice for other people and for their country number two citizens become more selfabsorbed they have a greater desire for the state to take care of them number three a weakening of commonly held values and number four the decline of spiritual commitment i think there are some warnings here some things we might think about some things that may be applicable to our country and to this body here we currently have the most powerful military the strongest economy the most stable government of any nation in the world and so it is easy at times to think that we are invincible that this will go on forever but as tony blair stated as britain knows all predominant power for a time seems invincible but in fact it is transient i think it is our job here in this body and in this country to see to it that it doesnt become transient at least not real soon that we are able to preserve the integrity and identity of our country that has been so important in over 36 years of coaching i witnessed firsthand some trends that were concerning to me i noticed over that 36 years that the young men who came into the program became over time more troubled they were people who showed more stress they had less moral clarity as time passed when i started coaching in 1962 i think most of the players i dealt wish knew that it was wrong to tell a lie they knew that stealing something was wrong it was just something that was a given and yet as time goes on we ran into something called postmodernism the idea that everything is relative there are no moral absolutes as a result if you can get away with something it may be okay that has become a rather pervasive theme in our country and particularly in our institutions of higher education the idea of postmodernism as a result i saw young men who were a little more troubled a little less stable and i think there are really two major factors behind this first of all family stability has certainly eroded i saw that because when i first recruited players and went into their homes in the i960s and the early 1970s it was rather rare to see a young person who did not have both parents and if you saw somebody with only one parent it was usually because one parent or the other was deceased but as time went on and as i wrapped up my coaching career in the late 1990s roughly onehalf of the young people that we were dealing with had grown up without both biological parents one parent or other had simply taken off a divorce or something had occurred so that certainly left some tremendous scars in 1960 the outofwedlock birthrate was 5 percent today it is around 36 percent about one out of every thrse children is born outside of marriage less than a quarter of families with children under the age of 6 have a parent staying home with them fulltime onethird of all schoolage children come home to an empty house for at least part of the week and the hours between 3 and 6 of course are the greatest hours of risk for young children then the last thing i will mention here 24 million children in the united states live without their real father so being fatherless is a huge problem in our country today and those young people who are fatherless are two to three more times likely to be abused have emotional behavior problems abuse drugs and alcohol commit a crime and so on there is a greeting card company that went to a prison on mothers day and offered to give free greeting cards to every inmate who would want one to send to his mother they had almost 100 percent participation almost every inmate of that prison decided that they wanted to send a mothers day card to their mother they had so much success the greeting card company came back on fathers day and they made the same offer they had practically zero participation you say well what in the world happened here the thing was that the great majority almost all of the men in that prison did not have a father their father had simply abandoned them probably early in life and as a result they were not interested at all in sending them a card certainly the family structure has changed in our country and i think we have to pay attention to that we have to buttress it as much as we can we cant legislate a lot of these things but we can certainly attempt to do something about it the second thing that i will address and this will be the last thing i will talk about is the fact that the environment that our young people are now growing up in has certainly changed as well the family the launching pad has changed has become less stable and the environment into which we are thrusting our young people has certainly become more difficult has become more challenging has become more dangerous and as a result we have seen some major changes one thing that i was very proud to see this house address yesterday was the matter of underage drinking this has become a huge problem in our nation and we did pass the stop bill yesterday i dont know if we will get if done in the senate or not i hope we will it simply made an attempt to do something about the ravages of underage drinking i will just present a few interesting details regarding underage drinking a recent national academy of sciences study showed that alcohol kills sixandahalf times more children than all other drugs combined so if you look at cocaine if you look at heroin marijuana and on and on and you combine all of those alcohol kills sixandahalf times more children more than 4 000 a year which is a huge number it costs the united states 53 billion annually there are currently 3 million teenage alcoholics so it is by far the biggest drug problem we have the average age for the first drink of a young person who decides to use alcohol before age 21 is 12 8 years of age when you start using alcohol that young that early in your life it makes a huge difference because of your psychological and your physiological immaturity a young person who starts drinking before age 15 is five times more likely to become an aicoholic than one who waits until they are 21 years of age anyway this body has done something about this not probably enough but at least it is a good start and i was proud to see that happen yesterday another drug that is particularly pernicious and is spreading like wildfire across the country is methamphetamine many places will find that the rates of use of heroin and cocaine are going down rather dramatically and the reason for that is methamphetamine is moving in methamphetamine is cheaper and methamphetamine is much more addictive so it is sweeping across the country it started in california and has slowly moved across and now there is a pocket up in the northeastern part of the country where we dont see much of it but through the midwest through the south through most of the rest of the country it has become pretty much a tidal wave so we have been very concerned about this we find that in nebraska roughly 22 000 people according to a recent report are addicted in a state of only 1 7 million the average meth addict will cost society about 50 000 a year so in nebraska it is about a 1 billion a year problem and nationally it is huge it is eating up a huge amount of our money at the present time so we did again make some attempt to address that here the combat meth act was important and i think maybe the most important part of that bill was that we did something to try to regulate sudafedrine which absolutely is necessary in order to produce methamphetamine there are only about six or seven countries in the world that produce sudafedrine and so what we did in that bill was we said those countries that produce sudafedrine and ship it to other countries will need to give the united states invoices of where those shipments of sudafedrine are going which enables us then to track the sudafedrine to the superlabs which are mostly in mexico and we think that is the most helpful way we have of getting at some of those superlabs that are shipping about 80 to 90 percent of the methamphetamine into the united states these are some things that have been done of course we realize that we have a huge problem with pornography and some of video games that are affecting our young people and so on i will not try to outline all of these but i just want to mention the fact that i believe that it is important that we as a body as a congress pay attention to what is going on with our young people because if we dont if we fail to address those issues it is a little bit like a football team ignoring something that eventually will catch up with you as tony blair mentioned the longterm wellbeing of a nation is served well only when you pay attention to the next generation fl 1315 and we have a lot of warning signs out there that we are beginning to slip that we have not paid adequate attention that the next generation coming up may not be able to carry the ball so to speak so i hope that that will be a major concern and a major thrust in this body as we move forward it has been a pleasure for me to be here for the last 6 years a lot of great friends both sides of the aisle it has been very challenging at times and i see great potential i do hope that we will pull together and hope that we will serve the nation as best we can as time moves forward"], [0.0, 0.0, 0, "2 weeks ago president bush addressed a virginia audience vowing no letup in the war on terror he acknowledged we have rocky roads ahead but we

worked diligently to produce a responsible bill that addresses the need for serious meaningful and practical reform today i am introducing this legislation in the senate i recognize that the method used in this bill to compel the u n to make these reforms may not be popular with some of my colleagues but i feel that there is no other way to proceed this legislation requires that 50 percent of the unitedstates contribution to the united nations regular budget be withheld if specific reforms are not implemented before dismissing this approach i urge my colleagues to examine the reforms mandated and the flexibility inherent in the legislation first the reforms title i requires management and budgetary reforms to create a more streamlined efficient and effective organization it shifts funding mechanisms for 18 programs of the u n from the regular assessed budget to voluntarily funded programs in an effort to make these programs more accountable to those who fund them it calls for budgetary practices that would allow us to measure the effectiveness and relevance of programs and it creates an independent oversight board an office of ethics and a chief operating officer to increase the accountability of the u n this title also addresses the shameful antisemitism inherent in u n structures by calling for israel to have a permanent seat in one of the regional groups with all the accompanying rights and privileges and it requires the state department to review u n agencies that focus exclusively on the palestinian agenda title ii deals with the human rights mandate of the u n it establishes basic criteria that member states must meet to be eligible to serve on u n human rights bodies and requires the u n entity that selects members on these bodies to abide by these criteria title iii mandates reforms of the international atomic energy agency so that it can better focus on the key issues of nuclear safety and security and nuclear verification activities title iv calls for a review of u n peacekeeping operations and requires that the unitedstates deny support for new or expanded missions until procedures are in place to prevent further sexual exploitation by u n peacekeepers these measures including adopting a code of conduct for all personnel participating in these operations and establishing a data base so that past abusers are not able to participate in future operations have been specifically endorsed by the secretary generals special advisor on sexual exploitation and abuse and should be in place by this summer yet it is incumbent upon us to ensure that they are not stalled by member states that dont see this tragic situation as a serious problem title v puts forward ways to improve budget practices by requiring more details about the u n budget including proposed increases to be presented to congress and finally title vi provides the leverage if i could come up with a better way i would pursue it wholeheartedly but even the strongest supporters of the unitedstates u n relationship acknowledge that the only way the u n pays attention to calls for reform is when its budget is threatened experience has shown that the u n will institute needed improvements only when congress threatens to withhold unitedstates funding this is not meant to be draconian these reforms if implemented will increase the credibility the legitimacy and the effectiveness of the u n in fact i want to underscore the importance i place on a united nations that can fulfill its core objectiveto serve as an institution that supports the preservation of international peace and security i feel this objective is at risk finally it is important to highlight the flexibility that is built into this legislation it allows the administration 2 years to work with the u n to make these necessary reforms before the withholding provision is triggered even after 2 years it does not insist that every one of the reforms be implemented but allows an additional year for the u n to complete the job if the u n adopts measures that achieve the same purpose as those outlined in this bill it allows the full unitedstates contribution to be expended and if the u n chooses not to implement these needed reforms the legislation authorizes the contributions that are withheld from expenditure to remain available until the u n acts in 1949 dean acheson said that the united states must work actively to make the united nations an effective instrument of international cooperation there is and always will be a role for america in ensuring that the u n lives up to the

to oppose this legislation primarily because of unconstitutional gun control amendments added tothe bill in the senate as a firm believer in the second amendment to the united states constitution and an opponent of all federal gun laws i cannot support a bill that imposes new unconstitutional gun controls on americans i believe that the second amendment is one of the foundations of our constitutional liberties in fact i have introduced legislation the second amendment protection act which repeals misguided federal gun control laws such as the brady bill senate amendments added two sections to s 397 that impose unconstitutional controls on american gun owners and sellers first a section was added to the bill to outlaw any licensed gun importer manufacturer or dealer from selling delivering or transferring a handgun without a secure gun storage or safety device each and any violation of this requirement can result in a person being fined up to 2 500 or having his license revoked this gun lock requirement amounts to the imposition of a new federal tax on each handgun sale because gun buyers will be forced to pay the cost of the secure gunstorage or safety device that is required with a handgun irrespective of if that device is desired further the severe penalties for non compliancewhether intentional or accidentaladd yet more weight to the crippling regulations that hang over gun transactions in the united states second a section was added to the bill to create draconian penalties for people who possess armor piercing bullets just like the democratic congress before it that passed the assault weapons ban the republican congress is poised to give in to antigun rights scare tactics by selectively banning bullets instead of each gun owner being able to decide what ammunition he uses in his gun federal bureaucrats will make that decision to recognize the threat such regulation places on gun owners just consider that a gun without ammunition is nothing more than an expensive club regulating ammunition is the back door path to gun regulation the armor piercing bullets restriction imposes a 15 years mandatory minimum sentence for just carrying or possessing such bullets even without a gun during or in relation to a crime of violence or drug trafficking given the wide scope of criminal laws and the fact that people are on occasion accused of crimes they did not commit this provision promises to discourage many nonviolent lawabiding individuals from possessing ammunition protected under the second amendment further it does not take much imagination to see how such a provision could be used by an antigun prosecutor in the prosecution of an individual who used a gun in self defense especially considering that use of such bullets to murder can result in a death sentence in such instances a defendant who exercised self defense may well accept a guilty plea bargain to avoid the severe enhanced penalties imposed under s 397 i am particularly disturbed that the house of representatives leadership has taken the unusual step of bringing s 397 to the floor for a vote without house members at least having an opportunity to vote on removing the gun control amendments instead of voting on a bill that contains the new gun control provisions we should be considering h r 800 the house version of s 397 prior to its perversion by gun control amendments notably gun owners of america has written to house members to request that they oppose s 397 and instead support h r 800 last month i wrote to house speaker dennis hastert majority leader tom delay and committee on the judiciary chairman james sensenbrenner of my opposition to these antigun rights provisions in s 397 while i am concemed about some of the federalism implications of h r 800 it is a far superior bill because it neither requires gun locks nor restricts gun owners ammunition choices with 258 sponsors and cosponsors h r 800 would easily pass the house the house voting for h r 800 would allow the differences between h r 800 and s 397 to be reconciled in conference committee in conference every expectation would be that the new gun control provisions would be stripped from the legislation given that the original unamended s 397 had 62 senate sponsors and cosponsorsa filibuster proof majority in the senate i regret that under the guise of helping gun owners

we started in the northern part up around caesaria phillipi went down to elat on the red sea went to jerusalem went to tel aviv talked to the people and had a very good feel for what actually is going on there so often on codels we are in a country for 24 hours 36 hours and we move on and this was a little different and so at the present time obviously people know that israel is in a very difficult spot recently they had a war involving hezbollah on their northern border and the hezbollah was located in lebanon southern part of it and fired hundreds if not thousands of katyusha missiles into israel particularly the northern part of israel and yet as we visited that part of the country it was almost untouched it seemed they had repaired they hadrestored and life was going on as usual only a couple 3 weeks after the conflict had ended as many people know hamas is very powerful in gaza and in the west bank and has tremendous influence in the paldstinian areas at the present time there are rockets being fired by the hamas people down in gaza into israel so as we watch this and as we watch the continual conflict with the palestinians and the desire for the palestinians to have a unified state unifying the west bank on the west bank of the jordan and in th gaza strip down in the southwestern part of the country you can see that israel is under tremendous pressure yet the thing that was rather impressive was the staying power the re solve the willingness of the israelis to try to see this through i guess the lessons that i took away from this and the concerns were that obviously it is important that the united states have that same staying power that same will to pull together that same willingness to survive in the face of adversity because even though we are protected by two great oceans the wor d has shrunk today we are not as secure as we once were we face a true global conflict over the horizon many of the things that we observed in israel i think apply to us even though sometimes we are not aware of it tony blair made an interesting observation here recently he stated that peace ih the middle east will be hard to come by unless israel and the palestinians and hamas and hezbollah ca~n somehow resolve their differences i believe that is very true our focus is on iraq here in the united states sometimes on afghanistan but at the heart of much of the conflict and much of the turmoil in the middle east is the conflict that involves terrorist organizations ar d israel i am not here to be partisan ar d take israels side versus another nations side i am simply pointing these issues out that i think are very important the things that i mentioned that particularly impressed me about the israelis were number one a willingness to persevere in the face of great adversity and people realize what the terrorists are attempting to do but also not far away is iran and the iranian president has basically said that he would like to destroy israel and everyone knows that at the present time it does appear that iran is trying to build nuclear capabilities this is a very tenuous situation as far as israel is concerned despite these threats as i mentioned israel seems to be staying the course seems to have great resolve and i would hope that we would have the same resolve in our country in terms of persevering in the face of adversity the second thing that i took away from that trip to israel that i think is important that may have some applicability to our situation here in t e united states is a sense on the part of the israelis of having great unity of purpose a willingness to pull together a willingness to avoid all fragmentation i guess when your back is to the wall and you are not very big ybu realize that unity of purpose is critical so we certainly detected that i guess i can relate a little bit to my previous experience in the athlet c arena in regard to the importance of unity of purpose a team of great athletes which was polarized and which was divided was not able to accompliih a great deal and yet a team with less talent which had unity of purpose would usually prevail over a superior team physically that was divided almost every time so the analogy that i would like to draw at this present time are some things that i have observed as i leave this body and this has to do really with the recent election we certainly experienced a very contentious election we saw a great deal of partisanship accusations were numerous and sometimes very destructive there were deep divisions that were very apparent between the two parties the general public at least the public that i dealt with in rural and central parts of america watched the acrimony and the namecalling with a great deal of dismay and sometimes disgust and to a significant degree i believe the political process and congress in particular is viewed with a great deal of mistrust and skepticism at the present time at the root of that i think was some of the dialogue that they saw occur in the last several months it seems to me as i talked to my constituents and people around the country that the public is counting on us to lead to unite to serve the best interests of the country rather than to point fingers and to seek to destroy the opposition i think that from this election some lessons can be drawn which way this congress goes i am not certain but i at least have some wishes i have some desires which i will try to convey i guess the majority in the house and the senate now has changed it definitely has this presents two opportunities number one an opportunity for the new majority to pay back those who were in the majority for either real or perceived slights and offenses but the second approach can be something that i think would be more constructive is a chance to change the political climate to foster a more cooperative governing style and certainly something that would restore a good deal of confidence on the part of the american people i think there are three major factors that people continually point to in regard to the last election and the two the first two have been given preeminence first of all iraq the conflict over there the fact that many americans have grown weary of it many americans have decided that we are on the wrong course to be honest about it i dont think that the congress has a tremendous amount of control over what is happening in iraq we have some we can control funding and we can make comments here but we really arent the generals on the ground so that really may be a little bit out of our element to some degree the second area is the area of ethics and the fact that many people were very upset with corrupt practices that had occurred on the part of a small number of people but still a number of our members and that this is something that congress definitely does have directly in its purview we did some reforms but not enough i dont believe in the last few months and i believe that congress members of congress members of the senate have to be above reproach as joe paterno one time said we cannot only be fair we have to appear to be fair we cannot have the perception even of wrongdoing as i sat in meeting after meeting after meeting over 6 years i cant really remember anyone getting up and really addressing the issue of ethics and how important this is in preserving the trust of the american people it is something that this body obviously has to do a better job with and i hope that it will become a major priority here then the third thing which many of the pundits have not referred to very often has simply been the issue of partisan bickering which i think would serve us very well to get over to some degree and it will be interesting to see how that develops as time goes on the most hopeful time that i had during my 6 years in congress was also maybe the worst time and that was the 3 or 4 months right after 9 11 and almost everyone here can remember those times we can remember the horror that we felt as we saw the pentagon destroyed the twin towers go down the plane crash over pennsylvania and the fact that we realized all of a sudden that as a nation we were vulnerable that was a terrible time and there was a lot of rebuilding to do at the same time it was a very hopeful time because for 3 months maybe 4 months here in this chamber and over in the senate we saw congress work together pull together to display a unity of purpose that i had not seen before or since it showed what we were capable of doing as a body as a unified organization so as time goes by and as that memory of 9 11 begins to fade it is easy to begin to become complacent again and decidd that the most important thing is party supremacy so i would hope that people would realize that even though we have not been attacked for the last 5 years that attack is still on the horizon that this is still a world that is very very combustible at the present time we really do need to pull together in a way that we have not done for the last 5 years cervantes once said something that was rather important to me in my outlook on life he said the journey is more important than the end a very brief statement he said the journey is more important than the end what he was saying is that the process that we go through the way we do things how we do things why we do things is really more important than the end result sometimes that is easy to say but it is really hard to live with because losing an election is very difficult i have experienced that losing a football game is very difficult losing a business is very difficult but what he was saying is you know the process is more important than all of that the process is more important than whether you win or whether you lose you do things in a certain way and you do them every time and in the long run that will be the most important thing that is why i point to the fact that doing things the right way here and unity of purpose is going to be very important this week there will be a big football game ohio state is going to play michigan one team will prevail they are both undefeated i dont know which team is going to win but i do know this the deciding factor will probably be something that was overlooked in the preparation something that has been laying there for the last 9 or 10 weeks unaddressed it may be a fumble the back doesnt carry the ball high and tight he flags the ball something that should have been addressed it may be an extra point where a guy isnt stepping with his right foot and all of a sudden he gets blown off th5 ball and somebody blocks an extra point or somebody blocks a punt it may be fatigue in the fourth quarter conditioning that wasnt undertaken that should have been done often that which ia ignored which does not seem to be very important or very apparent all of a sudden in a crisis becomes critical that is the way it is with our country at the present time i feel that there is something that we really are not payingadequate attention to it is like how you carry the football it is like blocking it is like punt protection those kinds of things that are little dont seem to make a lot of difference but all of sudden it jumps up and bites you the greatest threat facing the united states as i see it at the present time is something that we need to pay attention to and that is our young people because young people are the future there was a study that was released today by americas promise the organization that was headed up for many years by colin powell still very active and his wife they did a research report which released some information that i thought was very revealing it said there are really five things that a young person needs to have to grow up and be productive and to be healthy and to help make this country work they said these five promises are number one caring adults in that young persons life and 40 percent of our young people indicated at the present time that they either dont have any or dont have enough one out of five young people indicate that they do not have a single caring adult in their life somebody that really cares for them as they are number two a safe place and a constructive use of time and a tremendous number of our kids go home to homes that are not safe because of abuse they live in neighborhoods that because of gangs or violence or whatever are not safe again that is a major problem a healthy start and healthy development many of our young people grow up without adequate medical care medical attention and as a result they dont in the first 3 or 4 or 5 years of life have an even start and this again is a tremendous handicap effective education 25 percent of our young people dont complete high school many of them who do complete high school are not adequately prepared for the world of work and we are falling behind in many areas internationally in terms bf our education then opportunity to serve other people to give something of themselves so the interesting thrust of this whole research study it was interesting indicated that 31 percent of our children have either four or five of these essential ingredients and the conclusion of the study is that these 31 percent will be pretty well prepared these 31 percent will do pretty well with the rest of their lives but then they said you know 48 percent have only two or three of these factors and they have a chance but they are kind of on the bubble if you only have two or three of those five ingredients going in your life you are somewhat crippled and you may be fortunate and you may make it but you may be less than fortunate and you may not make it then the critical thing was they said 21 percent have only one of those factors or they have zero so 21 percent one out of every five of our children is at tremendous risk of not being a productive adult of having a life that is certainly not what it could be so it is important that we focus on this and understand how important this is one in 12 of our young people today attempts suicide so there is a certain desperation out there i would like to now turn to something that prime minister tony blair of britain said on this floor about 3 years ago which i think is somewhat germane that relates to what i have been talking about with our young people with our divisions in congress and so on he said as britain knows all predominant power seems for a time invincible but in fact it is transient so what he was saying is that every great nation for a period of time has assumed that it was going to live forever that things were not going to change that it would be preeminent forever and then eventually realized that this power that they had this aura of invincibility all of a sudden was not there anymore so i think that there is no question as we look at history that what he said is very true i would like to just take a quick cursory look at three nations that certainly would have fit that category he was talking about nations that were invincible at the time certainly rome 2 000 years ago ruled the entire civilized world appeared to be invincible but eventually fell from preeminence the reasons historians have given that they fell were number one a general decline in morality an increase in corruption and instability in leadership an increasing public addiction to evermoreviolent public spectacles an increase in crime and prostitution and above all a population that became more selfabsorbed apathetic and unwilling to sacrifice for the common good does that fit any of our parameters here i dont know but it certainly is something we need to be aware of and we need to think about to some degree great britain 150 years ago dominated the world had a colonial empire that dominated the world from the late 1600s through much of the 1800s yet this british empire eventually slowly crumbled the reasons given by historians are as follows number one they lost the national resolve to maintain their territory it takes a lot of energy and commitment to maintain farflung colonies around the world next values that led to ascendency were eroded the integrity the character of the people somehow was no longer what it once had been spiritual underpinnings began to shift some the spiritual values were no longer there russia 20 years ago one of the great nations of the world one of the two superpowers at that time in a matter of months disintegrated before our

for the great disasters that had befallen russia then he quotes men have forgotten god that is why all of this has happened that is what he found many people in russia saying marx and lenin had dismantled russias religious heritage values had fallen russias foundation was broken and eventually it collapsed like a house of cards with nothing to sustain it so if you look at these three nations which i just picked out randomly there are really some common themes of historical collapse number one citizens are less willing to sacrifice for other people and for their country number two citizens become more selfabsorbed they have a greater desire for the state to take care of them number three a weakening of commonly held values and number four the decline of spiritual commitment i think there are some warnings here some things we might think about some things that may be applicable to our country and to this body here we currently have the most powerful military the strongest economy the most stable government of any nation in the world and so it is easy at times to think that we are invincible that this will go on forever but as tony blair stated as britain knows all predominant power for a time seems invincible but in fact it is transient i think it is our job here in this body and in this country to see to it that it doesnt become transient at least not real soon that we are able to preserve the integrity and identity of our country that has been so important in over 36 years of coaching i witnessed firsthand some trends that were concerning to me i noticed over that 36 years that the young men who came into the program became over time more troubled they were people who showed more stress they had less moral clarity as time passed when i started coaching in 1962 i think most of the players i dealt wish knew that it was wrong to tell a lie they knew that stealing something was wrong it was just something that was a given and yet as time goes on we ran into something called postmodernism the idea that everything is relative there are no moral absolutes as a result if you can get away with something it may be okay that has become a rather pervasive theme in our country and particularly in our institutions of higher education the idea of postmodernism as a result i saw young men who were a little more troubled a little less stable and i think there are really two major factors behind this first of all family stability has certainly eroded i saw that because when i first recruited players and went into their homes in the i960s and the early 1970s it was rather rare to see a young person who did not have both parents and if you saw somebody with only one parent it was usually because one parent or the other was deceased but as time went on and as i wrapped up my coaching career in the late 1990s roughly onehalf of the young people that we were dealing with had grown up without both biological parents one parent or other had simply taken off a divorce or something had occurred so that certainly left some tremendous scars in 1960 the outofwedlock birthrate was 5 percent today it is around 36 percent about one out of every thrse children is born outside of marriage less than a quarter of families with children under the age of 6 have a parent staying home with them fulltime onethird of all schoolage children come home to an empty house for at least part of the week and the hours between 3 and 6 of course are the greatest hours of risk for young children then the last thing i will mention here 24 million children in the united states live without their real father so being fatherless is a huge problem in our country today and those young people who are fatherless are two to three more times likely to be abused have emotional behavior problems abuse drugs and alcohol commit a crime and so on there is a greeting card company that went to a prison on mothers day and offered to give free greeting cards to every inmate who would want one to send to his mother they had almost 100 percent participation almost every inmate of that prison decided that they wanted to send a mothers day card to their mother they had so much success the greeting card company came back on fathers day and they made the same offer they had practically zero participation you say well what in the world happened here the thing was that the great majority almost all of the men in that prison did not have a father their father had simply abandoned them probably early in life and as a result they were not interested at all in sending them a card certainly the family structure has changed in our country and i think we have to pay attention to that we have to buttress it as much as we can we cant legislate a lot of these things but we can certainly attempt to do something about it the second thing that i will address and this will be the last thing i will talk about is the fact that the environment that our young people are now growing up in has certainly changed as well the family the launching pad has changed has become less stable and the environment into which we are thrusting our young people has certainly become more difficult has become more challenging has become more dangerous and as a result we have seen some major changes one thing that i was very proud to see this house address yesterday was the matter of underage drinking this has become a huge problem in our nation and we did pass the stop bill yesterday i dont know if we will get if done in the senate or not i hope we will it simply made an attempt to do something about the ravages of underage drinking i will just present a few interesting details regarding underage drinking a recent national academy of sciences study showed that alcohol kills sixandahalf times more children than all other drugs combined so if you look at cocaine if you look at heroin marijuana and on and on and you combine all of those alcohol kills sixandahalf times more children more than 4 000 a year which is a huge number it costs the united states 53 billion annually there are currently 3 million teenage alcoholics so it is by far the biggest drug problem we have the average age for the first drink of a young person who decides to use alcohol before age 21 is 12 8 years of age when you start using alcohol that young that early in your life it makes a huge difference because of your psychological and your physiological immaturity a young person who starts drinking before age 15 is five times more likely to become an aicoholic than one who waits until they are 21 years of age anyway this body has done something about this not probably enough but at least it is a good start and i was proud to see that happen yesterday another drug that is particularly pernicious and is spreading like wildfire across the country is methamphetamine many places will find that the rates of use of heroin and cocaine are going down rather dramatically and the reason for that is methamphetamine is moving in methamphetamine is cheaper and methamphetamine is much more addictive so it is sweeping across the country it started in california and has slowly moved across and now there is a pocket up in the northeastern part of the country where we dont see much of it but through the midwest through the south through most of the rest of the country it has become pretty much a tidal wave so we have been very concerned about this we find that in nebraska roughly 22 000 people according to a recent report are addicted in a state of only 1 7 million the average meth addict will cost society about 50 000 a year so in nebraska it is about a 1 billion a year problem and nationally it is huge it is eating up a huge amount of our money at the present time so we did again make some attempt to address that here the combat meth act was important and i think maybe the most important part of that bill was that we did something to try to regulate sudafedrine which absolutely is necessary in order to produce methamphetamine there are only about six or seven countries in the world that produce sudafedrine and so what we did in that bill was we said those countries that produce sudafedrine and ship it to other countries will need to give the united states invoices of where those shipments of sudafedrine are going which enables us then to track the sudafedrine to the superlabs which are mostly in mexico and we think that is the most helpful way we have of getting at some of those superlabs that are shipping about 80 to 90 percent of the methamphetamine into the united states these are some things that have been done of course we realize that we have a huge problem with pornography and some of video games that are affecting our young people and so on i will not try to outline all of these but i just want to mention the fact that i believe that it is important that we as a body as a congress pay attention to what is going on with our young people because if we dont if we fail to address those issues it is a little bit like a football team ignoring something that eventually will catch up with you as tony blair mentioned the longterm wellbeing of a nation is served well only when you pay attention to the next generation fl 1315 and we have a lot of warning signs out there that we are beginning to slip that we have not paid adequate attention that the next generation coming up may not be able to carry the ball so to speak so i hope that that will be a major concern and a major thrust in this body as we move forward it has been a pleasure for me to be here for the last 6 years a lot of great friends both sides of the aisle it has been very challenging at times and i see great potential i do hope that we will pull together and hope that we will serve the nation as best we can as time moves forward"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "2 weeks ago president bush addressed a virginia audience vowing no letup in the war on terror he

these alternative violent ways of objecting to our fellow man by these islamic fundamentalist terrorist practices is not lost on me as did rosa parks thousands of individuals today around the world

religion at all yet there are some people who just cannot stand this who absolutely refuse to allow us this opportunity the web site www persecution org a web site that tracks human rights and persecution of people for choosing to simply practice their christian faith reported on october 6 that 53yearold pamilton tadoa a member of the tabernakel pentecostal church in indonesia was shot in the head and killed in the area of poso while he road his motorbike to school where he served as a treasurer his death raised fears of a new islamic crackdown on evangelicals in indonesia where 10 000 christians died between 1998 and 2003 at the hands of extreme islamic jihad warriors according to human rights group open doors about 1 000 churches were burned down by islamic mobs open door said in
