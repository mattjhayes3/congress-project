to pay for because americans always pay always pay for illegal entry illegals will lose unemployment checks grants to pay energy bills and even some public medical care and even applying for these perks means a monetary punishment to illegals they are also now busting business owners who until recently have left their own porch lights on guiding illegals their way in the name of a bigger bottom

a comprehensive implementation plan for the entire life of the program as the chair of the coast guartl authorizing subcommittee i have also requested the exact same information unfortunately to date neither the gentleman from kentucky nor i have received the information requested i would say to the coast guard to the department of omb provide congress with this information and do it now no more

the original 20year estimation thousands of jobs would be lost in a number of states the total cost to the taxpayer would actually increase substantially because of the delays and the delivery of the new more capable vessels aircraft and communications equipment will be delayed indefinitely specifically this cut in funding would likely stop all work on the national security cutter affecting jobs in mississippi the break in production would negatively impact the alreadytroubled shipbuilding industry it would also defer design work on offshore patrol cutters and the fast response cutter again affecting jobs in mississippi would stop work on the vertical takeoff unmanned aerial vehicle and this affects jobs in texas it will scale back the mission effectiveness program of the 210 and 270foot

free of major casualty less than 50 percent of the time last year the services fleet of c130 hu25 and hh60 aircraft all failed to meet target levels for readiness and last year the coast guards main rescue helicopter experienced inflight engine failures at a rates of 329 mishaps per 1 000 hours of flight all of these issues are putting our men and women in uniform in grave danger and jeopardizing our homeland security mission the gao testified before my subcommittee that legacy assets are insufficient to meet mission demands and the need to replace or upgrade deteriorating legacy assets is considerable the coast guard commandant calls it a readiness gap or downward readiness spiral whatever we call it the fact remains without new and betterequipped assets promised under deepwater the coast guard will not be able to successfully conduct its homeland security and other vital missions delaying deepwater is bad for homeland security it is also bad news for the budget continuing to defer acquisition of new assets causes the service to sink more and more money into rapidly deteriorating legacy assets just to keep them afloat the coast guard anticipated spending 20 million annually to keep legacy assets operational but in 2006 the service expects to spend more than 12 times that much and that does not take into account the nearly 60 million it will cost to replace the wing boxes on several of the c130s or the 63 million in other unfunded legacy sustainment priorities in order to control costs we need to invest in replacement assets the new deepwater assets will

on the other side say that nobody benefits from capital gains and dividends when in fact 35 million taxpayers have dividend income and 26 million taxpayers realize capital gains i think that shows how little they know about employee ownership in america of so many companies where people work so to dismiss out of hand as if no one benefits from these provisions is absolutely false and not to mention the effect of these investment tax reductions on our economy and what that means for peoples individual lives and their prosperity i spent some time earlier going through a number of statistics about how we have record unemployment record homeownership record productivity and so many indicators of strength in our national economy that are as a result of the 2003 tax relief also the potential tax hike in investment taxes could already potentially be weighing on people about to retire the 70 million baby boomers who are about to retire and could weigh on investors as they make their longerterm investment decisions that is why it is so important that we continue the capital gains and dividend tax relief in reconciliation that we dont have a tax hike on investment taxes because that would hurt the economic growth that we have been able to achieve in recent years let me just say that we have been able to do both in our legislation both capital gains and middleincome amt and they have been done within the budget the congressionally approved budget by this congress allows up to 70 billion in reconciliation and tax relief within our budget we do both of them we may not do it exactly

speaking out recently taxpayers in houston forked out over 125 million in hospital costs in just 1 year by treating more than 53 000 illegals taking advantage of the system in our hospitals taking advantage of americans and really taking advantage of legal immigrants it is morally wrong for illegals to enter this country with the expectation that they will live off of others it is morally wrong for them to expect that americans will pay to take care of them take care of their health costs their education costs and their social services costs but now it is becoming illegal for illegals to get these services that even many americans do not receive taxpayers are finding their own answers while some federal lawmakers in washington remain deaf to their desire because they are too busy dueling over illegal immigration doctrines state leaders are stepping in across the couhtry just this week in colorado lawmakers took a cue from their citizens by cutting through the conflict and passed 11 bipartisan bills taking a tougher stance on illegal entry just like houston illegals have been drawn to colorado like moths to a flame and like many states colorado has left the porch light on for them because they have bad laws that encourage illegal entry such as laws that protect employers that hire illegals providing illegals benefits that many americans do not receive such as unemployment grants and even medical care this may explain why half of colorados immigrants are illegal but those days may be over because now state legislators are aiming to flip the switch and turn out the lights and turn off the benefits that make being illegal so lucrative this week they passed 11 immigration bills including making people prove that they are legal residents of colorado in order to receive state and federal benefits that is a farreaching requirement which will require many of those 1 million people to prove that they are in the state legally to receive benefits without that proof they lose the benefits that americans have to pay for because americans always pay always pay for illegal entry illegals will lose unemployment checks grants to pay energy bills and even some public medical care and even applying for these perks means a monetary punishment to illegals they are also now busting business owners who until recently have left their own porch lights on guiding illegals their way in the name of a bigger bottom line those businesses who exploit illegals make a profit off of cheap labor but americans pick up the tab for all social services now they are going to lose a grip on that filthy lucre that they have gotten businesses that exploit those already living in the shadows of our society beyond the scope of federal work and wage regulations it will cost those illicit businesses money in the form of fines if they do not keep records proving that they hire only legal residents and while many americans do not turn out at the polls it seems some illegals find some way to vote in this country and now it is going to be a felony if they do so and while colorado legislators have been hard at work they are letting the voters make the really tough decisions they are asking them in november on the ballot if they should sue the federal government for not enforcing federal immigration laws voters will also be asked to deny tax benefits to business owners who hire illegals each day my office gets inundated with calls emails and faxes of people demanding their voices be heard demanding we secure the borders demanding that government enforce the law and

expectancy 63 a pretty good deal for the government today however americans are living longer than ever and far more likely to live long enough to get their benefits social security is not a savings plan it is a payasyougo system where todays workers support todays retirees and tomorrows workers support tomorrows retirees the number of workers supporting each retiree was 42 when the program started it is now three with the payroll taxes on the paychecks of hardworking americans going up 600 percent over the time when it gets to two just in 3 years 2008 the government will begin to pay
