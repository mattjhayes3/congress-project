rept sents the time of day during the house proceedings e g o 1407 is 2 07 cardinal wyszynski spent much of his priestly life under the harsh anticlerical tyrannies of nazism and communism yet thanks to his brilliant leadership the polish catholic church today is far stronger than it was when he became primate of poland in 1949 in fact i believe it is fair to say that of the various current power centers in poland only the catholic church speaks for the vast majority of the polish people given what has transpired in postworld war ii poland that is a remarkable turn of events on a number of occasions during this period poland was rocked by domestic political troubles in each instance cardinal wyszynski played a pivotal role in the resolution of those problems primarily because he possessed the uncanny ability of knowing just when and how much to resist totalitarian rule and when to compromise without repudiating his principles adhering to those principles i might add cost him time in prison throughout that ordeal his paramount concern was that the church would never reject the will of its people for the better part of the last year the worlds attention has been riveted upon poland as we all know there have been moments when it appeared soviet intervention was imminent miraculously that has been avoided to date and much of the credit for that must go to cardinal wyszynski always able to keep things in perspective he skillfully served as a bridge between labor and government in a manner that inspired the confidence and trust of both parties i had the distinct

jurisdiction over civil rights complaints has often been to deny swift and fair justice for persons who have been discriminated against the backlog in federal agencies creates unnecessary delays additional costs and causes further overcrowding in already overburdened federal courts this problem is not endemic to the reagan administration in 1977 many of those who have cosponsored h r 5689 introduced legislation to make the law rationally applicable and consistent and provide greater protection to individuals discriminated against over the past several months i have been working with respresentatives of the leadership conference on civil rights and using their valuable suggestions for improvement in the 1977 bill and subsequent drafts although the leadership conference disagrees with some of the specifics of the bill as well as its timing they are in accord with the view that civil rights enforcement should be strengthened their recent report on the current problems of the

of civil rights complaints agencies which are responsible for program evaluation and civil rights compliance retain the authority to conduct investigations and attempt to resolve complaints for the first time overall enforcement is centralized and made mandatory i hope that the congress views this legislation as a basis for exploration of critical issues in federal civil rights enforcement the overall role of the justice department the proper test to avoid actions which have discriminatory effects an affirmative duty of the federal government to provide protection against discrimination

standards for enforcement we have provided a compromise test of reasonably forseeable effects i believe the congress should explore how best to frame a reasonable test that compli s with the underlying affirmative duty to avoid actions which produce discriminatory effects h r 5689 is an attempt to provide a basis for consensus the civil rights act of 1982 is intended to dramatically improve the effectiveness of current federal civil rights enforcement efforts the act would increase the ability for individuals who have been discriminated against to petition the government for fair and timely resolution of their grievances as a strong supporter of civil rights i am convinced that action is necessary to provide a real framework of protection against discrimination for all

security of israel our closest friend and most stable and reliable ally in the middle east in any offensive effort against israel the awacs would represent a yital asset to the arab nations and would seriously upset the balance of powers between the arabs and israel even if we can believe the saudis promise that they will not use the equipment against israel we have no guarantees that the saudis will not transfer the awacs to another arab nation for use against israel second i believe that this sale represents a breach of a solemn public promise which the unitedstates government made in 1978 this promise was made both to the unitedstates congress and to the government of israel it is no secret that without this promise the senate would never have voted to approve the sale of f15 jets to saudi arabia in 1978 in my view a promise made is a promise kept by breaking our commitment here we put in doubt all commitments which our government has ever made in the past or will in the future finally it is dangerous to the security of the united states to transfer this equipment to the saudi regime"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a nation is indeed fortunate when in times of crises a leader emerges with the capacity to cope effectively with the many crosscurrents that accompany national emergencies poland was so blessed in the person of cardinal stefan wyszynski a courageous prudent farseeing and temperate spiritual leader who adroitly headed the polish catholic church of some 30 million souls for more than a generation the reach of this amazing prelates influence extended well beyond poland with the advent bf the papacy of john paul ii who at his inauguration indicated that it was because of his mentor wyszynski that the roman catholic church has its first polish pontiff 0 this symbol rept sents the time of day during the house proceedings e g o 1407 is 2 07 cardinal wyszynski spent much of his priestly life under the harsh anticlerical tyrannies of nazism and communism yet thanks to his brilliant leadership the polish catholic church today is far stronger than it was when he became primate of poland in 1949 in fact i believe it is fair to say that of the various current power centers in poland only the catholic church speaks for the vast majority of the polish people given what has transpired in postworld war ii poland that is a remarkable turn of events on a number of occasions during this period poland was rocked by domestic political troubles in each instance cardinal wyszynski played a pivotal role in the resolution of those problems primarily because he possessed the uncanny ability of knowing just when and how much to resist totalitarian rule and when to compromise without repudiating his principles adhering to those principles i might add cost him time in prison throughout that ordeal his paramount concern was that the church would never reject the will of its people for the better part of the last year the worlds attention has been riveted upon poland as we all know there have been moments when it appeared soviet intervention was imminent miraculously that has been avoided to date and much of the credit for that must go to cardinal wyszynski always able to keep things in perspective he skillfully served as a bridge between labor and government in a manner that inspired the confidence and trust of both parties i had the distinct honor and privilege of cochairing with our colleague clem zablocki the presidents delegation to the funeral of cardinal wyszynski the other members of the delegation were his eminence john cardinal krol archbishop of philadelphia aloysius mazewski president polishamerican congress the honorable francis j meehan ambassador to poland the honorable william wilson the presidents personal envoy to the holy see and peter s bridges director eastern european affairs department of state also participating in the ceremony and of special meaning to me was the delegation from the archdiocese of detroit headed by his excellency edmund szoka archbishop of detroit who was accompanied by the reverend stanley milewski chancellor of orchard lake schools orchard lake mich mrs helen zielinska president of the polish womens alliance and mr joseph drobot president of the polish roman catholic union of america the outpouring of sympathy we witnessed for this towering religious figure has left me with poignant and lasting memories it also has caused me to realize what a legacy he leaves behind the poland we see today in many ways is the result of his efforts therefore while saluting his memory i pray that whoever is chosen as the next primate of poland will be able to build upon the wyszynski legacy and in so doing move poland toward a permanent solution to its most difficult internal problems"]]}
