unfortunately history has willed a different story army specialist garrett fant instead returned to lake tahoe last week as a fallen hero at the age of 21 this young man sacrificed all those years all those memories all those pleasuresand all that lifein the service of his country he loved the army and he had a plan for his lifehed serve his country as a soldier for 20 years and then he would come and serve his community as a high school history teacher from everything ive learned about garrett fant he would have made a great history teacher his mother told a reporter his thought was that high school was the last stop for kids and he wanted to influence people hed have made a great family man his older brother remembers looking up to garrett as if garrett were the older brother knowing full well the dangers that surrounded him in afghanistan his foremost attention went to reassuring his family that he was safe and secure his mother said he always tried to protect me from the dangers of being over there he was just someone that if you were his family or his friendsor his countryhe gave you his all and loved you with everything above all garrett fant wanted to be a soldier his brother tried to get him to enlist with him in the navy but garrett would have none of that he was all army and had known from the time he was a little boy thats what he most wanted to do on facebook he listed his occupation as grunt telling his friends you cant spell infantry without fant he was the top marksman in his class of 1 000 i wish id known him i wish my grandchildren might one day have

douglas macarthur turned his attention to fallen heroes like army specialist garrett fant and with searing insight he observed their story is known to all of you it is the story of the american man at arms my estimate of him was formed on the battlefields many many years ago and has never changed i regarded him then as i regard him now as one of the worlds noblest figures not only as one of the finest military characters but also as one of the most stainless his name and fame are the birthright of every american citizen in his youth and strength his love and loyalty he gave all that mortality can give he needs no eulogy from me or any other man and macarthur goes on to say but when i think of his patience under adversity of his courage under fire and his modesty in victory i am filled with an emotion of admiration i cannot put into words he belongs to history as furnishing one of the greatest examples of successful patriotism he belongs to posterity as the instructor of future generations in the principles of liberty and freedom and so garrett fant became a teacher after all as shakespeare said this story shall the good man teach his son succeeding generations of students at south lake tahoe high school and also at valley oak high school in american canyon which garrett also attended will know his story every memorial day in his hometown his name will be read with a special pride that his friends and neighbors will share strangers will pass by his honored grave adorned with flags and flowers and theyll note the few years he had and the sacrifice he made

remember about the peace corps is that you get a lot more out of it than you really give youre serving other people but youre learning youre learning about another culture and at the same time youre learning about your own country and your own experiences because of the points of contrast what a wonderful thing it is that america has now tens of thousands of people who have served in the peace corps who have returned and who now are working in every walk of lifeworking in international organizations working in business organizations knowing different cultures knowing different languagesthereby providing a dimension to our own national life that we would otherwise not have if we did not have people who had had the experience of serving in the peace corps there is one other

spirit was kind of catching and they would participate in all kinds of little volunteer activities and things that they hadnt necessarily thought of doing themselves of course the peace corps

thing just as an example is that peace corps volunteers of course do their assignments but theyre also people who do volunteer work of one kind or another one of the big hits was when i was in mogadishu in the peace corps i was with two other people who were peace corps lawyers at that time and there were about 50 60 people who were teachers some were community health workers and some were community school construction workers they would come to mogadishu for a couple days off for vacation time when school was down that kind of thing and five or six of them got together and started

stimulus program was mismanaged illconceived and failed to create the jobs promised by the president for 38 straight months and counting the unemployment rate has remained above 8 percent the american people realize something that my democrat friends dont seem to understand that government cannot create jobs and shouldnt be in the business of handing out jobs in 2010 the american people sent me and many of my colleagues to washington to cut government spending and offer real solutions to job creation we have been aggressively fighting to achieve that challenge our country needs commonsense progrowth policies that will help small business regain their confidence when business owners have faith that the government will not raise their taxes impose new unnecessary regulations and pick winners and losers in the marketplace theyll invest more when they invest more the company grows and the opportunity for american jobs grows with it just last week we saw a very clear picture of the different visions for job creation held by folks in washington my friends in the senate voted on but thankfully failed to pass the buffett rule the act would impose a tax hike on one class of americans and would pay for approximately 11 hours of government functioning talk about a cynical ruse serving only to divide our country for political purposes but while my democrat colleagues in the senate are working to raise taxes on americans and americas job creators the house is trying to lower them last week we passed a small business tax cut which will give businesses with fewer than 500 employees a 20 percent tax reduction off their active business income and encourage the creation of more jobs for our citizens data shows that 7 out of every 10 jobs in this country are created by companies with fewer than 500 employees my republican colleagues and i truly believe that small businesses are the backbone of our countrys economy and their success is vital to our economic recovery we continue to act proactively and as reflected in the 27 jobcreating measures passed by the house this congress alone to ensure job providers are able to create innovate and lead we hope our friends in the senate and white house will decide to join us as we say yes to american jobs for american people"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "40 years from now a beloved high school history teacher at tahoe high school named garrett fant should be celebrating his retirement surrounded by generations of his students and his children and grandchildren they would have all told affectionate stories about how mr fant inspired them or helped them and wished him a happy and welldeserved retirement unfortunately history has willed a different story army specialist garrett fant instead returned to lake tahoe last week as a fallen hero at the age of 21 this young man sacrificed all those years all those memories all those pleasuresand all that lifein the service of his country he loved the army and he had a plan for his lifehed serve his country as a soldier for 20 years and then he would come and serve his community as a high school history teacher from everything ive learned about garrett fant he would have made a great history teacher his mother told a reporter his thought was that high school was the last stop for kids and he wanted to influence people hed have made a great family man his older brother remembers looking up to garrett as if garrett were the older brother knowing full well the dangers that surrounded him in afghanistan his foremost attention went to reassuring his family that he was safe and secure his mother said he always tried to protect me from the dangers of being over there he was just someone that if you were his family or his friendsor his countryhe gave you his all and loved you with everything above all garrett fant wanted to be a soldier his brother tried to get him to enlist with him in the navy but garrett would have none of that he was all army and had known from the time he was a little boy thats what he most wanted to do on facebook he listed his occupation as grunt telling his friends you cant spell infantry without fant he was the top marksman in his class of 1 000 i wish id known him i wish my grandchildren might one day have been his high school history students instead army specialist garrett fant takes his place in history among nine generations of american heroes who sacrificed all those precious years to protect those who couldnt protect themselves to stand up to the bullies of the world to proclaim liberty throughout all the land and unto all the inhabitants thereof in his farewell address at west point general douglas macarthur turned his attention to fallen heroes like army specialist garrett fant and with searing insight he observed their story is known to all of you it is the story of the american man at arms my estimate of him was formed on the battlefields many many years ago and has never changed i regarded him then as i regard him now as one of the worlds noblest figures not only as one of the finest military characters but also as one of the most stainless his name and fame are the birthright of every american citizen in his youth and strength his love and loyalty he gave all that mortality can give he needs no eulogy from me or any other man and macarthur goes on to say but when i think of his patience under adversity of his courage under fire and his modesty in victory i am filled with an emotion of admiration i cannot put into words he belongs to history as furnishing one of the greatest examples of successful patriotism he belongs to posterity as the instructor of future generations in the principles of liberty and freedom and so garrett fant became a teacher after all as shakespeare said this story shall the good man teach his son succeeding generations of students at south lake tahoe high school and also at valley oak high school in american canyon which garrett also attended will know his story every memorial day in his hometown his name will be read with a special pride that his friends and neighbors will share strangers will pass by his honored grave adorned with flags and flowers and theyll note the few years he had and the sacrifice he made and be humbled by it and perhaps inspired by it to become better citizens no history teacher can do more than that to his grieving family on behalf of a grateful nation i can only say that you do not mourn alone your pride in garrett is shared by your community by your country and by many many history teachers who will tell his story to the latest american generation"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "9 2 percent unemployment in june twentynine months in a row of over 8 percent unemployment twenty million americans remain

businesses and entrepreneurs are holding back private sector job creation in our economy american job creators fear the regulatory and fiscal environment they will face in the near future until they

decided that it is time for the troops to withdraw in my opinion this decision is dangerously irresponsible violence has already spilled into the united states from mexico the 16 texas border counties are packed with foreign nationals charged with serious crimes in the united states according to the gao 56 percent of the border is wide open and instead of fulfilling their duty to protect the people of this country washington orders retreat it defies logic that we would remove the national guard from the border if anything we need more troops on the ground doesnt washington know that the border is a war zone to abandon the third front puts americans at risk with crossborder crime this is a national security issue that cannot be ignored it is the first duty of the federal government to
