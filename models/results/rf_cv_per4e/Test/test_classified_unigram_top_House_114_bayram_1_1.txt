know is that california officials pushing the states highspeed rail proposal wont be deterred by skyrocketing costs an absence of private investment or the 55 millionand growingfunding gap what we didnt know was the extent of secrecy and mismanagement taxpayers would face at the hands of state officials pushing this project just this month we learned that in 2013 the agencys main contractor projected that the first phases costs had risen 31 percent this information was concealed by the highspeed rail authority and only released 2 years later after pressure from congress while the lack of transparency is unacceptable especially given that taxpayers are ultimately on the hook for this project the fundamental issue here is that the entire project is a rusein literal terms a train wreckin that state officials knew this for some time and that those same officials hid this from the public in 2008 voters were promised an 800mile system that would link sacramento san francisco los angeles and san diego cost about 34 billion and would have less than onethird of the costs paid by the state through its taxpayers the system was promised to travel from san francisco to los angeles in under 2 hours and 40 minutes fast forward to 2011 when the price had shot up from 34 billion to 100 billion the plan was reduced to only l a to san francisco and the state was quick to grab billions

them to come up with the ultimate full plan of the cost of doing highspeed rail having not succeeded in getting that through a majority that still liked it as it was my next legislation was to say now that we know this is over 100 billion lets put this back on the ballot and in front of the voters since the price has tripled and they were deceived at what it would cost at the time that too met defeat as those in the majority still wished to continue this boondoggle today the governor claims the price has fallen to 68 billion for what would be an illegal system based on what the voters passed under prop 1a however the estimate ignores the costs of tunneling through the tehachapi mountains ignores cost spikes in the initial construction segment and ignores the rising costs of lands acquisition due to people having to fight because they are having their homes their farms and their small businesses paved over by this project the promises made in 2008 ranged from low ticket prices to questionable job figures including the fact that they were claiming there would be a million new jobs from highspeed rail when we pinned them down in committee a little bit later they said well that would mean a million jobyears that number has since been pared down all these have been proven false in fact these claims are so misleading that a state court has forbidden the legislature from writing ballot measure descriptions earlier this week i sent out a survey to residents in my weekly enewsletter to constituents in californias first district my own district asking them to share their thoughts on highspeed rail as it is now i listed a number of suggested actions we could take on highspeed rail from leaving it as is to defunding it and asked which best represents our constituents position on the project now of the nearly 1 600 answers we received their views are pretty clear nearly half of them said they thought funding for highspeed rail should be redirected to invest in water storage and water infrastructure to help our state right now in this drought about 20 percent thought the state should subpoena the cost documents and require highspeed rail authority officials to testify why the figures were concealed approximately 18 percent thought californias highspeed rail should undergo federal investigation in response to these allegations given that the project involves the use of federal funds a scant 7 percent thought we should keep going forward with highspeed rail and believed the current price tag is a worthwhile investment of public funds lastly 4 percent supported investing in highspeed rail provided the project stayed within the old constraints the old pricesthe ones they saw on the ballot so at best you see 11 percent that might support highspeed rail and 4 percent that might under the old price which is nowhere near what was projected people dont like this project dont trust those advocating for it and they deserve better than to see their own tax dollars used to lie to them no new federal dollars will come from here to help this project be propped up anymore it is time we start prioritizing funding for projects that actually

trucks semis vans or cars one thing that does not come to mind is the back portion of a tractor trailer being the trailer portion which has no way of selfpropelling itself unfortunately the epa doesnt seem to see it that way in last years proposed rules for greenhouse gas emissions and fuel efficiency standards for onroad heavyduty vehicles and engines the epa attempted to regulate truck trailers as selfpropelled vehicles furthermore the epa has a voluntary program called smartway that provides engineering guidelines for aerodynamics and reduced truck weight smartway which is voluntary is intended to improve fuel efficiency for combined tractor tailers however smartway only improves fuel efficiency when tractor trailers are traveling at highway speeds of more than 50 miles per hour smartway provides no benefits whatsoever when the tractor trailers are traveling at less than 50 miles per hour around towns which are where most of the tractor trailers are used in the united states but epa wants to mandate all trailers to be governed by smartway even those that travel less than 50 miles per hour in fact if the government manipulates the weight of trailers cargo gets displaced

highly customized to the individual specifications of each customer trailer manufacturers should not be forced to comply with a onesizefitsall standard especially when given that so many trailers do not gain any fuel efficiency benefits from smartway my amendment would prevent the epa from using any funds in the bill to regulate trailers under the greenhouse gas rule not only should these guidelines remain voluntary because they only benefit some trailers epa has no business regulating trailers under the clean air act given that they are not selfpropelled this proposed regulation by the epa is another example of a federal agency overstepping its bounds and attempting to enact a regulation that benefits some parts of the economy but harms others if this attempted overreach by the

percent of the base electricity according to the inspector generals office this project will save enough money to pay for itself in just 447 years it is too bad solar panels only last about 25 years

our nations capital it was hereat the place that memorialized one of the most historic moments in our historywhere i joined the shepherds men for a short 1mile run out of their 911mile journey as i stood in the shadow of the iwo jima memorial one of the shepherds men following our run came up to me and said when we go into combat we know that we may not come back out and i lost many of my men in combat and i can accept that but what is hard is when these men survive combat and they come back home and lose their life to these debilitating conditions that is hard to swallow as a veteran of the united states air force i am extremely grateful to the unwavering commitment the shepherds men have shown to defend their fellow servicemen and ensure that they have the resources they need to begin their road to recovery although the road may be long and fraught with setbacks people across this nation are going the extra mile to ensure our servicemembers are given the help they deserve to the shepherds men godspeed on the rest of your journey and thank you for your commitment to our nations military"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a few years ago a socalled doctor in philadelphia by the name of kermit gosnell was killing babiesliterally he ran an abortion clinic there and as can happen in these houses of horror some of these innocent unborn children were actually born alive before they could be exterminated in the womb so there you have a little nowborn baby squirming kicking sometimes crying right there in front of you on the table so what did gosnell do he would take a pair of scissors plunge them into the baby and sever his or her spinal cord no care whatsoever about the pain involved one of gosnells employees who witnessed this barbarism described the babys scream as follows i cant describe it it sounded like a little alien well this wasnt an alien it was a human being just like you and me although in an earlier form of development gosnell thank god is in prison but we have now learned that the largest abortion provider in this country planned parenthood is not only destroying the lives of little unborn children but selling their body parts for profit i might add that

deal with iran by a 2 to 1 margin these returns are in line with recent national polls showing americans as a whole overwhelmingly disapprove of the agreement by a similar count and they have every right to what we have learned about this deal is that it does not go far enough to achieve its ultimate goal to prevent iran from getting a nuclear weapon in fact it would allow just that when it sunsets in the meantime anytime anywhere inspections of iranian nuclear sites were neutralized to provide up to 24 days notice prior to any inspection in addition this deal precipitates a nuclear arms race in the middle east a reality we are already seeing as nations like egypt jordan and saudi arabia have already begun building up their nuclear infrastructure in response the hundreds of billions of dollars in sanctions relief provided by this deal will no doubt be used to further fund tehrans state sponsorship of terror a nation that has a ninefigure line item in the budget to support terrorism like attacks that devastated our nation on september 11 2001 is hard to trust unfortunately what we have is a bad deal one that makes an already volatile unstable middle east less safe

our real estate disclosure laws in a decade 1 888 pages worth we know if we do not enact this bill people are going to be denied homeownership opportunities we have already heard within our committee we have heard from our constituents already for example large lenders have already announced they are not going to do onetime closings anymore due to the uncertainty that comes from an individual in tyler texas i quoted earlier one from el paso who stated presented in el paso an institution is going to stop residential mortgage lending for a time until they can get a good feeling on how the regulation is going to be officially interpreted americans are being denied homeownership opportunities and all the gentleman from arkansas the author of h r 3192 says is lets have for those who operate in good faith a temporary grace period in trying to roll this out so what the motion to recommit doesand i know this is not the gentlemans purpose but what his motion to recommit does if adopted by the house is actually discriminate against the very people that he says he wishes to help because now all of a sudden it is going to be our servicemembers our veterans our seniors our students and family members of servicemembers veterans seniors and students who are going to be denied their homeownership opportunities now maybe in the gentlemans district they prefer the lawsuit in my district in the fifth district of texas they prefer the homeownership opportunity any bad actors can still be sued under tila in a private rightofaction but when we are trying to ensure that people are not denied their homeownership opportunities why would we want to discriminate against our servicemembers and veterans because all of a sudden then there is extra liability so everybody will know now that if you are going to lend on a home mortgage to a veteran you are going to have extra liability are you going to make that loan are you going to charge them more this house should reject any

freshman lawmakers to speaker boehner calling for a vote to repeal the medical device tax according to a 2014 industry survey the tax resulted in employment reductions of 14 000 industry workers in 2013 and years prior to implementation of this tax with approximately an additional 4 500 jobs lost in 2014 furthermore if we dont repeal this tax the industry will forgo hiring of nearly 20 500 employees over the next 5 years this important bipartisan legislation will repeal the affordable care acts medical device tax that is limiting access to health care devices that north country families need and undermining the medical device industry that is so important to our local economy repealing the medical device tax will help our small businesses create jobs for north country families and

well that we are suffering from a record drought but what we already know is that california officials pushing the states highspeed rail proposal wont be deterred by skyrocketing costs an absence of private investment or the 55 millionand growingfunding gap what we didnt know was the extent of secrecy and mismanagement taxpayers would face at the hands of state officials pushing this project just this month we learned that in 2013 the agencys main contractor projected that the first phases costs had risen 31 percent this information was concealed by the highspeed rail authority and only released 2 years later after pressure from congress while the lack of transparency is unacceptable especially given that taxpayers are ultimately on the hook for this project the fundamental issue here is that the entire project is a rusein literal terms a train wreckin that state officials knew this for some time and that those same officials hid this from the public in 2008 voters were promised an 800mile system that would link sacramento san francisco los angeles and san diego cost about 34 billion and would have less than onethird of the costs paid by the state through its taxpayers the system was promised to travel from san francisco to los angeles in under 2 hours and 40 minutes fast forward to 2011 when the price had shot up from 34 billion to 100 billion the plan was reduced to only l a to san francisco and the state was quick to grab billions ofunknown at the timefederal stimulus that came along later funding that could have been used for critical needs like roads or water infrastructure that california needs so desperately as well as now shifting capandtrade dollars recently created to try and prop up highspeed rail and its deficient budget dollars as a state senator at the time the first bill i introduced was one that would require them to come up with the ultimate full plan of the cost of doing highspeed rail having not succeeded in getting that through a majority that still liked it as it was my next legislation was to say now that we know this is over 100 billion lets put this back on the ballot and in front of the voters since the price has tripled and they were deceived at what it would cost at the time that too met defeat as those in the majority still wished to continue this boondoggle today the governor claims the price has fallen to 68 billion for what would be an illegal system based on what the voters passed under prop 1a however the estimate ignores the costs of tunneling through the tehachapi mountains ignores cost spikes in the initial construction segment and ignores the rising costs of lands acquisition due to people having to fight because they are having their homes their farms and their small businesses paved over by this project the promises made in 2008 ranged from low ticket prices to questionable job figures including the fact that they were claiming there would be a million new jobs from highspeed rail when we pinned them down in committee a little bit later they said well that would mean a million jobyears that number has since been pared down all these have been proven false in fact these claims are so misleading that a state court has forbidden the legislature from writing ballot measure descriptions earlier this week i sent out a survey to residents in my weekly enewsletter to constituents in californias first district my own district asking them to share their thoughts on highspeed rail as it is now i listed a number of suggested actions we could take on highspeed rail from leaving it as is to defunding it and asked which best represents our constituents position on the project now of the nearly 1 600 answers we received their views are pretty clear nearly half of them said they thought funding for highspeed rail should be redirected to invest in water storage and water infrastructure to help our state right now in this drought about 20 percent thought the state should subpoena the cost documents and require highspeed rail authority officials to testify why the figures were concealed approximately 18 percent thought californias highspeed rail should undergo federal investigation in response to these allegations given that the project involves the use of federal funds a scant 7 percent thought we should keep going forward with highspeed rail and believed the current price tag is a worthwhile investment of public funds lastly 4 percent supported investing in highspeed rail provided the project stayed within the old constraints the old pricesthe ones they saw on the ballot so at best you see 11 percent that might support highspeed rail and 4 percent that might under the old price which is nowhere near what was projected people dont like this project dont trust those advocating for it and they deserve better than to see their own tax dollars used to lie to them no new federal dollars will come from here to help this project be propped up anymore it is time we start prioritizing funding for projects that actually address real problems facing california such as the current drought it is time to apply common sense to this situation we have a state whose economy depends on a sound water supply yet in the midst of a historic drought we are still chasing this highspeed rail boondoggle rather than throwing billions of dollars away lets get to what people demand and will help our economy and the people of california"]]}
