regarding religious freedom many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have attempted to use this amendment as a wedge in an effort to divide the american people i want to take a few minutes to discuss the truth and the facts about its impact in september of 1789 the first congress considered demands made by many participants in the state conventions which called for ratifying the unitedstates constitution in response to many of those concerns congress approved by a voice vote the first amendment to the united states constitution and sent it to the states for ratification the states ratified it in december of the first two clauses of the first amendment address religious freedom the first prohibits an establishment of religion so that citizens would not be forced to support a national church as was the case in great britain the second clause prohibits any government act that inhibits the free exercise of religion by a citizen thereby assuring that the government cannot dictate religious beliefs or interfere with citizens as they practice and live out their faith historically we have a proud tradition of republicans and democrats working together to protect free exercise under the first amendment a great example of this is the religious freedom restoration act which passed this house by a voice vote in unfortunately basic principles of free exercise are under attack today in response mr russells limited amendment would extend religious liberty protection to four categories of government contractors it is important to note that one doesnt lose constitutional rights if he or she seeks to become a contractor of the government hence contractors are protected in the free exercise of their religious beliefs and practices the russell amendment makes explicit these contractors rights to such protection in the employment of people who work for them so lets look at the russell amendment it states any branch or agency of the federal government shall with respect to any religious corporation religious association religious educational institution or religious society that is a recipient of or offeror for a federal government contract subcontract grant purchase order or cooperative agreement provide protections and exemptions consistent with sections 702 a and 703 e 2 of the civil rights act of 1964 and section 103 d of the americans with disabilities act of 1990 again note that the russell amendment is limited to these four categories of religious entities and it does not apply to other private entities or individuals the 1964 civil rights act is a landmark civil rights law which bans discrimination on the basis of race color religion sex or national origin title 7 of the act deals with discrimination in the workplace section 702 specifically protects the four categories of religious employers listed in the russell amendment hence the russell amendment extends to these four categories of religious entities when they are working for or attempt to work for the government the same religious liberty rights they have had for over 50 years when operating in the private sector this approach is neither new nor novel the americans with disabilities act of 1990 extends many of the same rights granted under the 1964 act to people with disabilities section 103 d of that act allows the four categories of religious entities to give preference in employment to individuals of a particular religion and to require that all applicants and employees conform to the religious tenets of such organization again the russell amendment extends to these four categories of religious entities the same religious liberty rights they have had for over 25 years when operating in the private sector to when they are doing business in the government the opponents of the russell amendment say it provides for discrimination against the lgbt community a simple review of the amendment and the underlying statutes demonstrates an absence of any reference to lgbt persons indeed the russell amendment is narrowly drawn to apply only to the four categories of religious entities in their employment of individuals to carry out their work any service or product produced by such an entity in a government contract would have to be provided to whomever the government requires and that obviously and appropriately will include those in the lgbt community if the russell amendment is discriminatory then so is the first amendment the religious freedom restoration act the 1964 civil rights act and the americans with disabilities act if allowing a religious entity to employ persons who share its beliefs is discriminatory then so are all these other congresses it is inaccurate to portray the russell amendment as anything other than a narrowly drawn effort to protect religious freedom"], [0.0, 0.0, 0, "3 years ago the louisiana air national guard began to turn around after coming in 38th in the nation at the

provide those services but some fraudulent providers use that program to rip off taxpayers it has got to stop one of the things that dr bucshon observed and brought to our attention was that when

information doesnt get disseminated to other states so that fraudulent provider simply steps across the state line sets up another operation and starts ripping off taxpayers all over again this legislation addresses that ripoff i am glad it does because we can debate about lots of things but there is unity here about wanting to make certain that any taxpayer dollar is well spent and that it is not ripped off by a fraudulent provider this sets up practical mechanisms for states that have identified a fraudulent provider so they may share that information with other states so they dont

it would also mean less privacy protections the usa freedom act also ends bulk collections across all domestic surveillance authorities not just section 215 it also expands transparency with increased

tools to combat terrorism in more targeted and effective ways specifically the bill replaces the administrations bulk metadata collection with a targeted program to collect only the records the government needs without compromising the privacy of innocent americans it includes new authorities to allow the administration to expedite emergency requests under section 215 and fills holes in our surveillance law that require intelligence agencies to go dark on known terrorists or spies when they transit from outside to inside the unitedstates or vice versa under current law the administration has to temporarily stop monitoring persons of interest as it shifts between domestic and international surveillance authorities what is more likely to stop the next terrorist attack the bulk collection of innocent americans or the ability to track down a known terrorist as soon as he or she enters the united states if you answer that question the same way i do then dont let the bluster

their chests these courageous men do not run for their own glory but for their fellow servicemembers whose lives may be forever changed by the effects of these conditions today one out of five servicemembers returning home from iraq or afghanistan have been diagnosed with one of these debilitating conditions if left unchecked these injuries could be life threatening as our servicemembers return home from active duty it is important for them to know that they do not suffer alone this morning the shepherds men are a few steps closer to reaching their final destination as the sun rose gently against the backdrop of the iwo jima memorial the shepherds men arrived in our nations capital it was hereat the place that memorialized one of the most historic moments in our historywhere i joined the shepherds men for a short 1mile run out of their 911mile journey as i stood in the shadow of the iwo jima memorial one of the shepherds men following our run came up to me and said when we go into combat we know that we may not come back out and i lost many of my men in combat and i can accept that but what is hard is when these men survive combat and they come back home and lose their life to these debilitating conditions that is hard to swallow as a veteran of the united states air force i am extremely grateful to the unwavering commitment the shepherds men have shown to defend their fellow servicemen and ensure that they have the resources they need to begin their road to recovery although the road may be long and fraught with setbacks people across this nation are going the extra mile to ensure our servicemembers are given the help they deserve to the shepherds men godspeed on the rest of your journey and thank you for your commitment to our nations military"], [0.5,

colleagues on the other side of the aisle have attempted to use this amendment as a wedge in an effort to divide the american people i want to take a few minutes to discuss the truth and the facts about its impact in september of 1789 the first congress considered demands made by many participants in the state conventions which called for ratifying the unitedstates constitution in response to many of those concerns congress approved by a voice vote the first amendment to the united states constitution and sent it to the states for ratification the states ratified it in december of the first two clauses of the first amendment address religious freedom the first prohibits an establishment of religion so that citizens would not be forced to support a national church as was the case in great britain the second clause prohibits any government act that inhibits the free exercise of religion by a citizen thereby assuring that the government cannot dictate religious beliefs or interfere with citizens as they practice and live out their faith historically we have a proud tradition of republicans and democrats working together to protect free exercise under the first amendment a great example of this is the religious freedom restoration act which passed this house by a voice vote in unfortunately basic principles of free exercise are under attack today in response mr russells limited amendment would extend religious liberty protection to four categories of government contractors it is important to note that one doesnt lose constitutional rights if he or she seeks to become a contractor of the government hence contractors are protected in the free exercise of their religious beliefs and practices the russell amendment makes explicit these contractors rights to such protection in the employment of people who work for them so lets look at the russell amendment it states any branch or agency of the federal government shall with respect to any religious corporation religious association religious educational institution or religious society that is a recipient of or offeror for a federal government contract subcontract grant purchase order or cooperative agreement provide protections and exemptions consistent with sections 702 a and 703 e 2 of the civil rights act of 1964 and section 103 d of the americans with disabilities act of 1990 again note that the russell amendment is limited to these four categories of religious entities and it does not apply to other private entities or individuals the 1964 civil rights act is a landmark civil rights law which bans discrimination on the basis of race color religion sex or national origin title 7 of the act deals with discrimination in the workplace section 702 specifically protects the four categories of religious employers listed in the russell amendment hence the russell amendment extends to these four categories of religious entities when they are working for or attempt to work for the government the same religious liberty rights they have had for over 50 years when operating in the private sector this approach is neither new nor novel the americans with disabilities act of 1990 extends many of the same rights granted under the 1964 act to people with disabilities section 103 d of that act allows the four categories of religious entities to give preference in employment to individuals of a particular religion and to require that all applicants and employees conform to the religious tenets of such organization again the russell amendment extends to these four categories of religious entities the same religious liberty rights they have had for over 25 years when operating in the private sector to when they are doing business in the government the opponents of the russell amendment say it provides for discrimination against the lgbt community a simple review of the amendment and the underlying statutes demonstrates an absence of any reference to lgbt persons indeed the russell amendment is narrowly drawn to apply only to the four categories of religious entities in their employment of individuals to carry out their work any service or product produced by such an entity in a government contract would have to be provided to whomever the government requires and that obviously and appropriately will include those in the lgbt community if the russell amendment is discriminatory then so is the first amendment the religious freedom restoration act the 1964 civil rights act and the americans with disabilities act if allowing a religious entity to employ persons who share its beliefs is discriminatory then so are all these other congresses it is inaccurate to portray the russell amendment as anything other than a narrowly drawn effort to protect religious freedom"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "3 years ago the louisiana air national guard began to turn around after coming in 38th in the nation at the end of september 2012 with a 98 4 percent

squirming kicking sometimes crying right there in front of you on the table so what did gosnell do he would take a pair of scissors plunge them into the baby and sever his or her spinal cord no care

friend and a great energy and commerce committee person who with his experience as a physician is able to give us the benefit of this bill i thank the gentleman from indiana for that the medicaid program is an incredibly important program to get health care to poor americans who need it the vast majority of our providers use the medicaid program to provide those services but some fraudulent providers use that program to rip off taxpayers it has got to stop one of the things that dr bucshon observed and brought to our attention was that when states are aggressively monitoring for fraud and when they identify a fraudulent provider they write that person off the rolls so that that provider cant keep ripping off the taxpayers but that information doesnt get disseminated to other states so that fraudulent provider simply steps across the state line sets up another operation and starts ripping off taxpayers all over again this legislation addresses that ripoff i am glad it does because we can debate about lots of things but there is unity here about wanting to make certain that any taxpayer dollar is well spent and that it is not ripped off by a fraudulent provider this sets up practical mechanisms for states that have identified a fraudulent provider so they may share that information with other states so they dont find themselves digging the same hole we have bipartisan
