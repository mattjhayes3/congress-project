jobs their policies are developing bigger jobs bigger government here in washington d c so much so that the only city in this country that real estate prices have not gone down is washington d c

because we have excessive and frivolous lawsuits against our own energy production and it has significantly delayed and in many cases prevented our energy resources from reaching the american

this country from having this endless plethora of lawsuits that stop the permitting and stop the production what it would do is it would require that all lawsuits be filed within 60 days and that the courts would have to have a determination or solution to that case within 180 days and that if the district court ruling was appealed that it would go to the supreme court and the supreme court would have a ruling within another 180 days it would also allow some relief from the frivolous lawsuits by allowing the prevailing party to be able to seek legal fees and other expenses under the act this

it is the very first time that we have done so while making corresponding cuts in spending that exceed the ceiling increase to most of us this is just good common sense its the only responsible thing

years the what we call discretionary spending the money that has to be appropriated annually has increased by over 80 percent federal employment has increased by 10 percent in about that same time so government spending has grown and people are saying that the way tonot people my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and the president are saying that the reason we have stagnant job opportunities is because we havent spent enough well i listed earlier the stimulus the bailouts the auto bailouts the health care bill all this spending thats taken place and were still where we are now and people say well it happened during world war ii we spent a ton of money and then coming out of that we grew jobs the difference the big difference was coming out of world war ii the last time our debt to gdp ratio was near where it is now the difference was and the thing that saved us was the immediate cuts right we cut government spending back but we grew jobs we literally made things here in america you know why we had an environment that fostered job creation we had an environment that cultivated entrepreneurs we grew jobs here in america because we made things here we produced

36 billion reduction to medicare and medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments now disproportionate share may sound a little confusing im going to explain what that is in a district such as mine we have hospitals that have missions and im sure across the country many hospitals have missions they want to make sure that the indigent population folks who cant afford insurance who are selfpays or maybe are on medicaid that they have access to quality services so the government says to these hospitals we understand that medicaid reimbursements or selfpay patients will not cover your services so what were going to do is were going to try to make you whole with this disproportionate share the health care law eliminates the disproportionate share for hospitals and so hospitals that have a high indigent population or a high number of selfpay patients or those who are on medicaid they are not going to get that disproportionate share the hospital in my district came down here it is a large teaching institution they made a special trip down here to tell me that provision of the health care law will bankrupt them they probably receive somewhere around 80 million a year to make them whole because of their mission and isnt that what we want we want to make sureand wasnt that the original intent of the health care law to make sure that there was accessible care for all americans but here again we reached the unintended consequences and the effect that this law is going to have on our hospitals there is a 7 1 billion reduction for readmissions we will talk about that in a little bit hospitals and many of the ones in my district and i know throughout this country they are heavily dependent on medicare and medicaid dollars and with that narrow margin medicare and medicaid dont even cover their costs and so theres such a small margin for them to operate that theres really little capacity for improvements realistically hospitalsespecially teaching hospitals and hospitals that are treating the underservedcannot bridge that gap and they wont be able to bridge that gap because of this new health care law hospitals must be able to invest in their infrastructure

law the affordable care act mandates that hospitals must move to electronic health records now from a patient safety standpoint thats a good thing but getting hospitals up to speed and getting them

source performance source design fuels input controls ability to measure pollutants emissions and operating conditions in other words we want to be sure that can be met under actual operating conditions and then the second part of our section 5 that we want to be sure supersedes which this amendment would not allow is that we put in section 5 the presidents own executive order in which he says that the administrator shall impose the least burdensome regulation consistent with the purposes of the act so all were doing in section 5 is saying we want to make sure that its the least

about wanting to create jobs but their policies are destroying jobsamerican jobs private pay jobs their policies are developing bigger jobs bigger government here in washington d c so much so that the only city in this country that real estate prices have not gone down is washington d c theyve gone up why because this administration nancy pelosi harry reid and their colleagues in the house and the senate in the 111th congress are creating bigger government more regulations more taxes more attacks on jobs in the private sector more attacks on small businesses and its creating a bigger government thus higher real estate prices here in washington because weve created government jobs they claim about all the jobs created with the stimulus bill et cetera but its government jobs is pretty much what were creating weve got another problem in fact i introduced h r 1032 the relief act because we have excessive and frivolous lawsuits against our own energy production and it has significantly delayed and in many cases prevented our energy resources from reaching the american marketplace h r 1032 the relief act doesnt stop people from having their day in court but what it would do is it would allow the environmental wackos that are trying to stop energy production here in this country from having this endless plethora of lawsuits that stop the permitting and stop the production what it would do is it would require that all lawsuits be filed within 60 days and that the courts would have to have a determination or solution to that case within 180 days and that if the district court ruling was appealed that it would go to the supreme court and the supreme court would have a ruling within another 180 days it would also allow some relief from the frivolous lawsuits by allowing the prevailing party to be able to seek legal fees and other expenses under the act this is the kind of bill that we need to pass ive been asking members of congress to cosponsor this because we need to

crafted a plan that addresses the real underlying challenge of our ballooning national debt the bipartisan agreement before us today is an historic achievement this is the 76th time that we have raised the debt ceiling since 1962 seventyfive times it has been raised this is the 76th time yet it is the very first time that we have done so while making corresponding cuts in spending that exceed the ceiling increase to most of us this is just good common sense its the only responsible thing to do yet 75 times before no connection was made between the debt ceiling and efforts to tackle our debt with todays underlying legislation we are fundamentally changing the way business is done here in washington we are setting a new precedent for fiscal discipline and accountability this is a tremendous achievement that will have a profound and lasting impact on our budget and our economy in both the short medium and long term this is an especially critical point to focus on todays legislation has dramatic implications for both the budget and our economy as you know very well the two are inextricably linked this is why our fiscal situation is so important we dont need a balanced budget for the sake of a balanced budget we need to balance our budget because job creation and economic growth depend on it there is a reason why the major credit agencies have said that our aaa credit rating is in jeopardy if we dont dramatically cut spending multitrilliondollar deficits and a national debt that approaches 100 percent of gdp are not sustainable democrats and republicans alike recognize that if we want to inspire confidence in the unitedstates economy create jobs and restore our position as the worlds most vital and dynamic economy we absolutely must chart a new fiscal course the bipartisan agreement that we will consider today does just that it makes meaningful immediate spending cuts it sets up a process that guarantees votes in both chambers by thanksgiving on an even bigger package this will give us the time necessary to go beyond cuts to significant new reforms that includes reforming entitlement programs to keep them solvent and ensure that they dont force us back onto a path of spiraling deficits and debt by setting up this process we can responsibly make the hard but essential choices that will restore our economy and unleash its power to create new opportunities for americans the underlying legislation will also impose additional automatic cuts should congress fail to continue on a path to real reform we are all in this

fail to continue the process of meaningful reform but by coming together and enacting real reform by remaining committed to this joint effort into the future we can all share in the benefits of a

a better job than the fcc i think you know one of the clear things that i would like to see and i think this body would like to see and why i oppose this rule is if we are talking about repealing the fccs rules what is the work product of this body what is the replace its repeal and replace i think there has been some acknowledgment in fact the gentleman from florida mentioned that the committee might work on some of these areas what is that proposed body of work why are we not looking at repeal and replace and what we are replacing it with is it going to be similar to former chairman waxmans net neutrality bill of last year are there substantial changes that havebuyin across the aisle can we do better frankly im skeptical but if the gentleman would like to advance the work product of his

circuits that process and imposes simplistic highly ideological solutions on what is actually a complex issue that has shared ideals for preserving a free internet free of government involvement we can find bipartisan consensus the fcc order came close to striking that correct balance far closer than the status quo thats why its supported by internet service providers themselves consumers groups

growth i mean it sounds simple it really does you know the last time our country had the amount of spending that we see happening right now was actually in the lead up to world war ii and ive talked a lot about cutting and reducing government overspending and government growth it needs to be done in the last 3 years the what we call discretionary spending the money that has to be appropriated annually has increased by over 80 percent federal employment has increased by 10 percent in about that same time so government spending has grown and people are saying that the way tonot people my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and the president are saying that the reason we have stagnant job opportunities is because we havent spent enough well i listed earlier the stimulus the bailouts the auto bailouts the health care bill all this spending thats taken place and were still where we are now and people say well it happened during world war ii we spent a ton of money and then coming out of that we grew jobs the difference the big difference was coming out of world war ii the last time our debt to gdp ratio was near where it is now the difference was and the thing that saved us was the immediate cuts right we cut government spending back but we grew jobs we literally made things here in america you know why we had an environment that fostered job creation we had an environment that cultivated entrepreneurs we grew jobs here in america because we made things here we produced things again in southwest washington we had a roaring timber industry that has all but shut down and the sad thing is if you dont manage the health of a forest it deteriorates some of these folks who are here in these bureaucratic offices in washington d c i swear have never stepped foot in a real forest they think you just tie a big ribbon around it and dont let anybody in or out and thats how we protect our environment theyre wrong you see they think that our environment and our economy are mutually exclusive man that is such a low opinion of american researchers that really must say that we dont think we can our citizens our people are intelligent enough to come up with new and innovative ways to both manage our timber and our timber economy and protect our environment so what we have now is shut off stands of trees ripe for beetle infestation disease or worse fire

have five hospitals in my district so our reliance for our local economy and for our state economy is just so very important i want to talk a little more about what this health care law is going to do to medicare and do to our hospitals there is 112 billion in reduced market basket updates to hospitals there is a 36 billion reduction to medicare and medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments now disproportionate share may sound a little confusing im going to explain what that is in a district such as mine we have hospitals that have missions and im sure across the country many hospitals have missions they want to make sure that the indigent population folks who cant afford insurance who are selfpays or maybe are on medicaid that they have access to quality services so the government says to these hospitals we understand that medicaid reimbursements or selfpay patients will not cover your services so what were going to do is were going to try to make you whole with this disproportionate share the health care law eliminates the disproportionate share for hospitals and so hospitals that have a high indigent population or a high number of selfpay patients or those who are on medicaid they are not going to get that disproportionate share the hospital in my district came down here it is a large teaching institution they made a special trip down here to tell me that provision of the health care law will bankrupt them they probably receive somewhere around 80 million a year to make them whole because of their mission and isnt that what we want we want to make sureand wasnt that the original intent of the health care law to make sure that there was accessible care for all americans but here again we reached the unintended consequences and the effect that this law is going to have on our hospitals there is a 7 1 billion reduction for readmissions we will talk about that in a little bit hospitals and many of the ones in my district and i know throughout this country they are heavily dependent on medicare and medicaid dollars and with that narrow margin medicare and medicaid dont even cover their costs and so theres such a small margin for them to operate that theres really little capacity for improvements realistically hospitalsespecially teaching hospitals and hospitals that are treating the underservedcannot bridge that gap and they wont be able to bridge that gap because of this new health care law hospitals must be able to invest in their infrastructure having such a narrow margin and or no margin operating in the red theyre not going to be able to do that theyre not going to be able to invest in infrastructure systems improvements new techniques to reduce hospitalacquired infections new models of delivering health care and electronic health records and i want to talk about electronic health records because they were mandated in the health care law the affordable care act mandates that hospitals must move to electronic health records now from a patient safety standpoint thats a good thing but getting hospitals up to speed and getting them ready for business has very high it costs for our hospitals so again youve got this health care law mandating electronic records and youve got these drastic cuts to our hospitals in their medicaid and medicare reimbursements i yield to the gentleman from georgia"]]}
