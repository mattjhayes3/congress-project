a far different place for bill mote back in the early part of the last century teddy roosevelt was president there was a world without jet planes without television no man had flown in space it was a world that encouraged a young boy to go fishing in the beautiful waters of the gulf of mexico it was also a time that encouraged entrepreneurs and bill mote took full advantage he could not wait to venture out into the world and start his own business while he never earned a college degree bill mote was a welleducated individual whose charisma and charm paved him a very successful path in the business world mr motes love for the world extended far beyond the realm of his exciting business ventures he loved the adventure of travel and the excitement of the sea he visited many places after he sold his company and concentrated on trips that would enable him to be with marine scientists oceanographers and biologists bill recognized very early on that irresponsible global habits were endangering his beloved sea what a shame it would be that we would be destroying one of our two unexplored frontiers a vast one at that covering threefourths of the world to bill mote that was just as exciting as man landing on the moon discovering and protecting our oceans became his passion it is not surprising to people who knew bill to understand how his passion was superseded only by his generosity in his goal he definitely put his money where his heart was he met eugenie clark some may know her as the famous shark lady on pbs nature shows bill and dr clark started a partnership that would last over 35 years and would be the root of mr motes philanthropic mission to save our oceans always drawn to the water he settled on the west coast of florida in sarasota with the intent to build a marine laboratory he used what he learned from his travels and joined dr clark in establishing one of the finest marine laboratories in the world when mr mote discovered cape haze laboratory in 1965 he immediately set his mind into catapulting the small marine research facility into a worldrenowned program henceforth the mote marine laboratory named after its principal benefactor has been the catalyst for breeding and mammal programs which benefit sea life all over the world the lab first became known internationally for shark research and in 1991 congress designated mote marine laboratory as the national center for shark research bill mote who himself never had the opportunity of higher education initiated a scholar chair in fisheries ecology and enhancement at florida state university he also encouraged younger people to become interested in marine life schoolchildren were exposed to the smallest creatures as well as the magnificent sharks and dolphins at mote marine laboratories aquarium a new state of the art marine mammal rescue center gives all visitors a firsthand look at the expert veterinary care that motes marine biologists provide bill will always be remembered as a promoter of education as well as an excellent educator himself he was at the helm when the jason project began at mote marine that was developed as an educational venture between dr ballard and mote marine dr ballard is using jason and jason ii remote submersibles credited with the discoveries of the titanic the bismarck and other landmark discoveries beneath the depths of our oceans mr mote was constantly expanding the depths of our understanding even to the bottom of the sea even larger than his love of the oceans was his love for education he gave not only to the studies of marine biology and oceanography but also relentlessly promoted the fields to youth and professionals alike with his own special blend of enthusiasm in 1968 mr mote was awarded the gold medal of the international oceanographic foundation many of us who knew bill mote have our own stories to tell after meeting a person like bill his energetic and passionate love for the ocean was magnetic his relentless drive passion and vigor was rivaled only by his charismatic personality bill mote was to all of us and will remain in our hearts a true example of what one person can do with a little determination i served on the board of mote marine before i came to congress i had the pleasure of knowing bill mote well he was a devoted husband and brother he was a counselor to marine biologists

an example of why that could be a problem let us say that a health plan sets up its definition for getting psychiatric care saying that somebody has to try to commit suicide three times before one can

that is the real message that i hope our colleagues will ponder that we frankly do not look to the unitedstates department of education the federal government to define the terms of quality in education across the country we do have 50 individual states each a laboratory in and of themselves and each that we see is free to be innovative to weigh the risks of new programs and new ideas against the successful models and the record of their 49 counterparts and colleagues throughout the rest of the country and states are in a better position to act more swiftly than the federal government is states are closer to the people the elected officials are much more accountable than the bureaucrats down the street here from where we are here at the unitedstates department of education that is the front line the states are the front lines of education reform and states differ some states have a more decentralized approach where local school districts are able to innovate each further at a more local level some states are a little more centrally controlled at their state capitals but in no case should we ever not be willing to trust the future of our children and their ability to grow intellectually to a small group of folks here in washington d c over at the department of education whose goal today facilitated by this centralized governing types down at todays white house to collect this authority and power in washington d c to define the terms of quality to define how a dollar will be spent in a classroom and of course with the track record of the

i contrast that with again five priorities total the next one was government intrusion into peoples lives that was down at 10 2 percent then you have crime political corruption and rising health care costs which trail just a few percents behind that but given the huge number of individuals that responded an overwhelming majority identified education as their top priority we are hearing this around the country that parents care about how much money they are spending on taxes they care about the corruption and the lack of integrity we have seen in the white house over the last 8 years they care

very strong commitment to veterans health care the president proposed a budget that basically flatlined it there was no increase in veterans health care and congress recognizing the importance of living up to the commitments that we have made to our veterans increased the funding by about 1 7 billion i have a few letters from folks in montana veterans health care is a pretty interesting issue in montana one of the interesting aspects of the montana experience in world war ii is that there is a larger proportion of montanas population that served in world war ii than any other state in the country that had a lot to do with the census during the 1930s montana lost a lot of population and the allocation of forces and the draft quotas were based upon population numbers that predated 1940 so montanans sent more men and women to fight in world war ii than other states did proportionately so as a consequence of that we have a larger proportion of veterans and of course we have a very large state also to deal with they just recently closed a veterans facility in miles city a veterans hospital in miles city in fact one veteran wrote to me and said im wondering what message you are trying to send to us you expanded the veterans cemetery and you closed the veterans hospital does that tell us that you have something in mind for the world war ii and korean war veterans in any event this congress has approved a budget that will increase spending to provide health care to veterans and it is extremely important that we live up to the commitment that we made to these disabled veterans and other senior citizens who are veterans who need to secure their health care budgets are about more than numbers budgets are about priorities and the budget that we just passed i think is an important one because i think it tells the american people what our priorities are for the future of america and i want to just outline again what those are i talked briefly for a few minutes about increasing spending for veterans health care but also we included in our budget a provision to set aside all of the social security taxes that are collected for social security which is something that is unique congress has not done that over the last 20 years the surpluses coming from social security as i know most of my colleagues know has been spent on other things we established a milestone we say from now forward all of the social security taxes 100 percent will be set aside to save social security we also want to strengthen our national defense i think it is obvious to everyone who is paying attention to the situation in kosovo the war in kosovo it is obvious that our military is strapped to the absolute limit we cannot fly many of our airplanes we are running short of armaments it is clear we have inadequate training or insufficient training in many cases that our men and women are being stretched to the limit and perhaps beyond it we need to put more resources to the national defense also as part of this budget there is a plan to lower taxes on the american people i think it is important for us to have some discussion about why it is important for us to lower taxes for the american people the portion of our national income today that is going to taxes to the burden of taxes of the federal government is the third highest it has ever been in the national history in fact the only time the percentage of our national income was higher going to taxes was in world war ii in 1945 and 1946 so it is a simple matter of fairness that the tax burden is too high and we need to lower the tax burden on american families i think it is really important that we talk about and have a clear debate about where we think we ought to reduce taxes there are two areas i think that are particularly important one is eliminating the marriage penalty i think it is grossly unfair that 70 000 of my constituents in montana pay on average 1 400 more in taxes because they are married than if they were single i also believe that we need to do something about the estate tax there is not a tax that is more unfair than the estate tax the fact that we tax somebody simply because they die seems to me to be extraordinarily unfair while it is often perceived as a tax on the rich the very wealthy do not pay that tax it is working men and women small business owners and people who have saved and have been prudent with their money farmers and ranchers particularly are hard hit by the death tax we just passed on may 8 tax freedom day the american people have been working all year long until may 8 to support government now they get to work for their families one of the ways we can help them live up to the responsibilities of their families be able to provide for their families is by reducing taxes we did that in the last congress we passed the 400 per child tax credit it will go to 500 this year it is surprising how many montanans have written to me thanking me for that 400 per child tax credit saying that that is going to allow them to be able to spend more money on education for their children or perhaps even clothing or food or the necessities of the family or even maybe a family vacation but montanans are grateful for that incidentally that is 50 million more that will be made available to the citizens of montana to spend in montana which will of course strengthen the economy of the state of montana so many montanans write to me and say that both the husband and the wife have to work in order to support their family or a woman might even write and say that her husband has two jobs a fulltime job and a parttime job just to support the family forty percent of that income is going to the government that is too high of a percentage we ought to be 20 or 25 percent total going to government and the best way to do that is a downpayment with the marriage penalty"], [0.0, 0.0, 0, "as a member of the subcommittee on health and environment of the house

about immigration based on vietnams record of progress on immigration and its continued cooperation on unitedstates refugee programs over the past year renewal of the jacksonvanik waiver will continue to promote freedom of immigration disapproval would undoubtedly result in the opposite the jacksonvanik waiver also symbolizes our interest in further developing relations with vietnam having lifted the trade embargo and established diplomatic relations 5 years ago the united states has tried to work with vietnam to normalize incrementally our bilateral political economic and consular relationships this is in americas own shortterm and longterm national interests it builds on vietnams own policy of political and economic reintegration into the world this will be a lengthy and challenging process however now is not the time to reverse course on vietnam vietnam continues to cooperate fully with our priority efforts to achieve the fullest possible accounting of american powmias the jacksonvanik waiver supports this process the jacksonvanik waiver certainly does not constitute an endorsement of the communist regime in hanoi we cannot approve of a regime that places restrictions on basic freedoms including the right to organize political parties freedom of speech and freedom of religion on may 4 however this body passed a resolution condemning just such violations of human rights the jacksonvanik waiver does not provide vietnam with new trade benefits including normal trade relations ntr status with the jacksonvanik waiver the united states has been able to successfully negotiate and sign a new bilateral commercial trades agreement with vietnam congress will have an opportunity in the future whether to approve it or not and whether to grant ntr or not but that is a separate process the renewal of the jacksonvanik waiver only keeps this process going nothing more renewal of the jacksonvanik waiver does not antomatically make american exports to vietnam eligible for possible coverage by unitedstates trade financing programs the waiver only allows american exports to vietnam to be eligible for such coverage the war with vietnam is over and we have embarked upon a new although cautious expanded relationship with vietnam now is not the time to reverse this constructive course accordingly this member urges a no vote on the resolution having summarized the key reasons to oppose the resolution this member would like to expand on a few of these points first the issue of emigration which indeed is what the jacksonvanik provision is all about since march of 1998 the united states has granted vietnam a waiver of the jacksonvanik emigration provisions of the trade act of 1974 as this is only an annual waiver the president decided on june 2 2000 the renew this extension because he determined that doing so would substantially promote greater freedom of emigration from that country in the future this determination was based on vietnams record of progress on emigration and on vietnams continued cooperation on unitedstates refugee programs over the past year as a result we are approaching the completion of many refugee admissions categories under the orderiy departure program odp including the resettlement opportunity for vietnamese returnees former reeducation camp detainees mccain amendment subprograms and montagnards the vietnamese government has also agreed to help implement our decision to resume the odp program for former unitedstates government employees which was suspended in 1996 the renewal of the jacksonvanik waiver is an acknowledgment of that progress disapproval of the waiver would undoubtedly result in vietnams immediate cessation of cooperation second the jacksonvanik waiver also symbolizes our interest in further developing relations with vietnam having lifted the trade embargo and established diplomatic relations five years ago the united states has tried to work with vietnam to normalize incrementally our bilateral political economic and consular relationship this policy is in americas own short and longterm national interest it builds on vietnams o n policy of political and economic reintegration into the world in the judgment of this member this will be a lengthy and challenging process however he suggests that now is not the time to reverse course on vietnam third over the past five years vietnam has increasingly cooperated on a wide range of issues the most important of these is the progress and cooperation in obtaining the fullest possible accounting of americans missing from the vietnam war those members who attended the briefing by the distinguished ambassador to vietnam a former prisoner of war and former member of this body the honorable pete peterson learned of the significant efforts to which vietnam is now extending to address our concerns regarding the pow mia issue including their participation in remains recovery efforts which are physically very dangerous fourth the jacksonvanik waiver does not constitute an endorsement of the communist regime in hanoi we cannot approve of a regime that places restrictions on basic freedoms including the right to organize political parties freedom of speech and freedom of religion however our experience has been that isolation and disengagement does not promote progress on human rights new sanctions including the symbolic disapproval of the jacksonvanik waiver only strengthens the position of the communist hardliners at the expense of those in vietnams leadership who are inclined to support more openness engagement with vietnam has resulted in some improvements in vietnams human rights practices though we still remain disappointed at the very limited pace and scope of such reforms as this member mentioned on may 4 2000 this body adopted a resolution condemning vietnams human rights record given the strong reaction to our resolution by hanoi it is evident that our actions and concems did not go unnoticed fifth the jacksonvanik waiver does not provide vietnam with any new trade benefits including normal trade relations ntr status however with the jacksonvanik waiver the united states has been able to successfully negotiate a new bilateral commercial trade agreement with vietnam this agreement was signed two weeks ago in washington in the opinion of this member this agreement is in our own short and long term national interest vietnam remains a very difficult place for american firms to do business vietnam needs to undertake additional fundamental economic reforms this new bilateral trade agreement will require vietnam to make these reforms and will result in increased american exports supporting jobs here at home in a separate process with a separate vote congress will have to decide whether to approve or reject this new trade agreement and to grant ntr status to vietnam given that the agreement has yet to even be transmitted to congress and there are only a limited number of legislative days before the bodys scheduled adjoumment this member believes that these decisions will not be made until the 107th congress meets next year thus the jacksonvanik waiver simply ensures that the modest trade opportunities currently available to american businesses will continue until congress considers the agreement sixth contrary to the claims of some opponents of the jacksonvanik waiver renewal of the jacksonvanik waiver does not automatically make american investment in and exports to vietnam eligible for coverage by unitedstates trade financing programs such as those administered by the overseas private investment corporation the exportimport bank and the unitedstates department of agriculture the waiver only allows american exports and investments to be eligible for such coverage each must still face separate individual reviews against each programs relevant criteria americans must conclusively recognize that the war with vietnam is over with the restoration of diplomatic relations in 1995 the united states and vietnam embarked on a new relationship for the future it will not be an easy or quick process vietnam today remains a communist country with very limited freedoms for its citizens significant reforms must occur before relations can be truly normal the emotional scars of the vietnam war remain with many americans in the mid1960s this member was an infantry officer and intelligence officer with the first infantry division within a month of completing my service members of my tightknit detachment of that division were in vietnam and taking casualties the first night after arrival like other vietnamera veterans this member has emotional baggage a great many americans have emotional baggage about vietnam but this member would suggest that it is time to get on with our bilateral relationship and not reverse course on vietnam passing this resolution of disapproval of the jacksonvanik waiver would represent yet another reflection of animosities of the past at a time when vietnam is finally looking ahead and making changes towards its integration into the international community a retrenchment on our part by this disapproval resolution is not in americas short and long term national interests accordingly this member strongly urges the rejection of

design and construction of the bend feed canal pipeline project in oregon the bend feed canal is built on pumice and other porous volcanic rock because of the porous rock over 20 cubic feet per second of water is lost over the length of the bend feed canal this loss causes the tumalo irrigation district district to use all available water and in drought years even that is not enough to supply the needs of its irrigators the existing bend feed canal has several segments currently piped this creates a dangerous situation as a person falling into an open section of the canal will soon find themselves approaching a piped section which would mean almost certain death although the beginning of each piped section has a trash rack with the urbanization of bend and the development around the bend feed canal the risk to small children is great this legislation will allow the district to replace six segments of open canal with pipeline in addition to the water conservation benefits once the

was born in my state of florida in the city of tampa at the turn of the century the world was a far different place for bill mote back in the early part of the last century teddy roosevelt was president there was a world without jet planes without television no man had flown in space it was a world that encouraged a young boy to go fishing in the beautiful waters of the gulf of mexico it was also a time that encouraged entrepreneurs and bill mote took full advantage he could not wait to venture out into the world and start his own business while he never earned a college degree bill mote was a welleducated individual whose charisma and charm paved him a very successful path in the business world mr motes love for the world extended far beyond the realm of his exciting business ventures he loved the adventure of travel and the excitement of the sea he visited many places after he sold his company and concentrated on trips that would enable him to be with marine scientists oceanographers and biologists bill recognized very early on that irresponsible global habits were endangering his beloved sea what a shame it would be that we would be destroying one of our two unexplored frontiers a vast one at that covering threefourths of the world to bill mote that was just as exciting as man landing on the moon discovering and protecting our oceans became his passion it is not surprising to people who knew bill to understand how his passion was superseded only by his generosity in his goal he definitely put his money where his heart was he met eugenie clark some may know her as the famous shark lady on pbs nature shows bill and dr clark started a partnership that would last over 35 years and would be the root of mr motes philanthropic mission to save our oceans always drawn to the water he settled on the west coast of florida in sarasota with the intent to build a marine laboratory he used what he learned from his travels and joined dr clark in establishing one of the finest marine laboratories in the world when mr mote discovered cape haze laboratory in 1965 he immediately set his mind into catapulting the small marine research facility into a worldrenowned program henceforth the mote marine laboratory named after its principal benefactor has been the catalyst for breeding and mammal programs which benefit sea life all over the world the lab first became known internationally for shark research and in 1991 congress designated mote marine laboratory as the national center for shark research bill mote who himself never had the opportunity of higher education initiated a scholar chair in fisheries ecology and enhancement at florida state university he also encouraged younger people to become interested in marine life schoolchildren were exposed to the smallest creatures as well as the magnificent sharks and dolphins at mote marine laboratories aquarium a new state of the art marine mammal rescue center gives all visitors a firsthand look at the expert veterinary care that motes marine biologists provide bill will always be remembered as a promoter of education as well as an excellent educator himself he was at the helm when the jason project began at mote marine that was developed as an educational venture between dr ballard and mote marine dr ballard is using jason and jason ii remote submersibles credited with the discoveries of the titanic the bismarck and other landmark discoveries beneath the depths of our oceans mr mote was constantly expanding the depths of our understanding even to the bottom of the sea even larger than his love of the oceans was his love for education he gave not only to the studies of marine biology and oceanography but also relentlessly promoted the fields to youth and professionals alike with his own special blend of enthusiasm in 1968 mr mote was awarded the gold medal of the international oceanographic foundation many of us who knew bill mote have our own stories to tell after meeting a person like bill his energetic and passionate love for the ocean was magnetic his relentless drive passion and vigor was rivaled only by his charismatic personality

the 40th anniversary of that event with a simple mass and marker to me the service and the marker were both reminders that the ordinary space we sometimes occupy can become forever changed by the deeds of a person who stood there i am confident it was no accident that the church waited 40 years to commemorate the event my visit to washington and my attendance at the merton mass sparked a

throughout the rest of the country and states are in a better position to act more swiftly than the federal government is states are closer to the people the elected officials are much more accountable than the bureaucrats down the street here from where we are here at the unitedstates department of education that is the front line the states are the front lines of education reform and states differ some states have a more decentralized approach where local school districts are able to innovate each further at a more local level some states are a little more centrally controlled at their state capitals but in no case should we ever not be willing to trust the future of our children and their ability to grow intellectually to a small group of folks here in washington d c over at

that responded an overwhelming majority identified education as their top priority we are hearing this around the country that parents care about how much money they are spending on taxes they care about the corruption and the lack of integrity we have seen in the white house over the last 8 years they care about a strong national defense they care about foreign policy they care about the

budget that basically flatlined it there was no increase in veterans health care and congress recognizing the importance of living up to the commitments that we have made to our veterans increased the funding by about 1 7 billion i have a few letters from folks in montana veterans health care is a pretty interesting issue in montana one of the interesting aspects of the montana experience in world war ii is that there is a larger proportion of montanas population that served in world war ii than any other state in the country that had a lot to do with the census during the 1930s montana lost a lot of population and the allocation of forces and the draft quotas were based upon population numbers that predated 1940 so montanans sent more men and women to fight in world war ii than other states did proportionately so as a consequence of that we have a larger proportion of veterans and of course we have a very large state also to deal with they just recently closed a veterans facility in miles city a veterans hospital in miles city in fact one veteran wrote to me and said im wondering what message you are trying to send to us you expanded the veterans cemetery and you closed the veterans hospital does that tell us that you have something in mind for the world war ii and korean war veterans in any event this congress has approved a budget that will increase spending to provide health care to veterans and it is extremely important that we live up to the commitment that we made to these disabled veterans and other senior citizens who are veterans who need to secure their health care budgets are about more than numbers budgets are about priorities and the budget that we just passed i think is an important one because i think it tells the american people what our priorities are for the future of america and i want to just outline again what those are i talked briefly for a few minutes about increasing spending for veterans health care but also we included in our budget a provision to set aside all of the social security taxes that are collected for social security which is something that is unique congress has not done that over the last 20 years the surpluses coming from social security as i know most of my colleagues know has been spent on other things we established a milestone we say from now forward all of the social security taxes 100 percent will be set aside to save social security we also want to strengthen our national defense i think it is obvious to everyone who is paying attention to the situation in kosovo the war in kosovo it is obvious that our military is strapped to the absolute limit we cannot fly many of our airplanes we are running short of armaments it is clear we have inadequate training or insufficient training in many cases that our men and women are being stretched to the limit and perhaps beyond it we need to put more resources to the national defense also as part of this budget there is a plan to lower taxes on the american people i think it is important for us to have some discussion about why it is important for us to lower taxes for the american people the portion of our national income today that is going to taxes to the burden of taxes of the federal government is the third highest it has ever been in the national history in fact the only time the percentage of our national income was higher going to taxes was in world war ii in 1945 and 1946 so it is a simple matter of fairness that the tax burden is too high and we need to lower the tax burden on american families i think it is really important that we talk about and have a clear debate about where we think we ought to reduce taxes there are two areas i think that are particularly important one is eliminating the marriage penalty i think it is grossly unfair that 70 000 of my constituents in montana pay on average 1 400 more in taxes because they are married than if they were single i also believe that we need to do something about the estate tax there is not a tax that is more unfair than the estate tax the fact that we tax somebody simply because they die seems to me to be extraordinarily unfair while it is often perceived as a tax on the rich the very wealthy do not pay that tax it is working men and women small business owners and people who have saved and have been prudent with their money farmers and ranchers particularly are hard hit by the death tax we just passed on may 8 tax freedom day the american people have been working all year long until may 8 to support government now they get to work for their families one of the ways we can help them live up to the responsibilities of their families be able to provide for their families is by reducing taxes we did that in the last congress we passed the 400 per child tax credit it will go to 500 this year it is surprising how many montanans have written to me thanking me for that 400 per child tax credit saying that that is going to allow them to be able to spend more money on education for their children or perhaps even clothing or food or the necessities of the family or even maybe a family vacation but montanans are grateful for that incidentally that is 50 million more that will be made available to the citizens of montana to spend in montana which will of course strengthen the economy of the state of montana so many montanans write to me and say that both the husband and the wife have to work in order to support their family or a woman might even write and say that her husband has two jobs a fulltime job and a parttime job just to support the family forty percent of that income is going to the government that is too high of a percentage we ought to be 20 or 25 percent total going to government and the best

resolution it is important for us i think to recognize what the jacksonvanik waiver does and what it does not do by law the underlying issue here is about immigration based on vietnams record of progress on immigration and its continued cooperation on unitedstates refugee programs over the past year renewal of the jacksonvanik waiver will continue to promote freedom of immigration disapproval would undoubtedly result in the opposite the jacksonvanik waiver also symbolizes our interest in further developing relations with vietnam having lifted the trade embargo and established diplomatic relations 5 years ago the united states has tried to work with vietnam to normalize incrementally our bilateral political economic and consular relationships this is in americas own shortterm and longterm national interests it builds on vietnams own policy of political and economic reintegration into the world this will be a lengthy and challenging process however now is not the time to reverse course on vietnam vietnam continues to cooperate fully with our priority efforts to achieve the fullest possible accounting of american powmias the jacksonvanik waiver supports this process the jacksonvanik waiver certainly does not constitute an endorsement of the communist regime in hanoi we cannot approve of a regime that places restrictions on basic freedoms including the right to organize political parties freedom of speech and freedom of religion on may 4 however this body passed a resolution condemning just such violations of human rights the jacksonvanik waiver does not provide vietnam with new trade benefits including normal trade relations ntr status with the jacksonvanik waiver the united states has been able to successfully negotiate and sign a new bilateral commercial trades agreement with vietnam congress will have an opportunity in the future whether to approve it or not and whether to grant ntr or not but that is a separate process the renewal of the jacksonvanik waiver only keeps this process going nothing more renewal of the jacksonvanik waiver does not antomatically make american exports to vietnam eligible for possible coverage by unitedstates trade financing programs the waiver only allows american exports to vietnam to be eligible for such coverage the war with vietnam is over and we have embarked upon a new although cautious expanded relationship with vietnam now is not the time to reverse this constructive course accordingly this member urges a no vote on the resolution having summarized the key reasons to oppose the resolution this member would like to expand on a few of these points first the issue of emigration which indeed is what the jacksonvanik provision is all about since march of 1998 the united states has granted vietnam a waiver of the jacksonvanik emigration provisions of the trade act of 1974 as this is only an annual waiver the president decided on june 2 2000 the renew this extension because he determined that doing so would substantially promote greater freedom of emigration from that country in the future this determination was based on vietnams record of progress on emigration and on vietnams continued cooperation on unitedstates refugee programs over the past year as a result we are approaching the completion of many refugee admissions categories under the orderiy departure program odp including the resettlement opportunity for vietnamese returnees former reeducation camp detainees mccain amendment subprograms and montagnards the vietnamese government has also agreed to help implement our decision to resume the odp program for former unitedstates government employees which was suspended in 1996 the renewal of the jacksonvanik waiver is an acknowledgment of that progress disapproval of the waiver would undoubtedly result in vietnams immediate cessation of cooperation second the jacksonvanik waiver also symbolizes our interest in further developing relations with vietnam having lifted the trade embargo and established diplomatic relations five years ago the united states has tried to work with vietnam to normalize incrementally our bilateral political economic and consular relationship this policy is in americas own short and longterm national interest it builds on vietnams o n policy of political and economic reintegration into the world in the judgment of this member this will be a lengthy and challenging process however he suggests that now is not the time to reverse course on vietnam third over the past five years vietnam has increasingly cooperated on a wide range of issues the most important of these is the progress and cooperation in obtaining the fullest possible accounting of americans missing from the vietnam war those members who attended the briefing by the distinguished ambassador to vietnam a former prisoner of war and former member of this body the honorable pete peterson learned of the significant efforts to which vietnam is now extending to address our concerns regarding the pow mia issue including their participation in remains recovery efforts which are physically very dangerous fourth the jacksonvanik waiver does not constitute an endorsement of the communist regime in hanoi we cannot approve of a regime that places restrictions on basic freedoms including the right to organize political parties freedom of speech and freedom of religion however our experience has been that isolation and disengagement does not promote progress on human rights new sanctions including the symbolic disapproval of the jacksonvanik waiver only strengthens the position of the communist hardliners at the expense of those in vietnams leadership who are inclined to support more openness engagement with vietnam has resulted in some improvements in vietnams human rights practices though we still remain disappointed at the very limited pace and scope of such reforms as this member mentioned on may 4 2000 this body adopted a resolution condemning vietnams human rights record given the strong reaction to our resolution by hanoi it is evident that our actions and concems did not go unnoticed fifth the jacksonvanik waiver does not provide vietnam with any new trade benefits including normal trade relations ntr status however with the jacksonvanik waiver the united states has been able to successfully negotiate a new bilateral commercial trade agreement with vietnam this agreement was signed two weeks ago in washington in the opinion of this member this agreement is in our own short and long term national interest vietnam remains a very difficult place for american firms to do business vietnam needs to undertake additional fundamental economic reforms this new bilateral trade agreement will require vietnam to make these reforms and will result in increased american exports supporting jobs here at home in a separate process with a separate vote congress will have to decide whether to approve or reject this new trade agreement and to grant ntr status to vietnam given that the agreement has yet to even be transmitted to congress and there are only a limited number of legislative days before the bodys scheduled adjoumment this member believes that these decisions will not be made until the 107th congress meets next year thus the jacksonvanik waiver simply ensures that the modest trade opportunities currently available to american businesses will continue until congress considers the agreement sixth contrary to the claims of some opponents of the jacksonvanik waiver renewal of the jacksonvanik waiver does not automatically make american investment in and exports to vietnam eligible for coverage by unitedstates trade financing programs such as those administered by the overseas private investment corporation the exportimport bank and the unitedstates department of agriculture the waiver only allows american exports and investments to be eligible for such coverage each must still face separate individual reviews against each programs relevant criteria americans must conclusively recognize that the war with vietnam is over with the restoration of diplomatic relations in 1995 the united states and vietnam embarked on a new relationship for the future it will not be an easy or quick process vietnam today remains a communist country with very limited freedoms for its citizens significant reforms must occur before relations can be truly normal the emotional scars of the vietnam war remain with many americans in the mid1960s this member was an infantry officer and intelligence officer with the first infantry division within a month of completing my service members of my tightknit detachment of that division were in vietnam and taking casualties the first night after arrival like other vietnamera veterans this member has emotional baggage a great many americans have emotional baggage about vietnam but this member would suggest that it is time to get on with our bilateral relationship and not reverse course on vietnam passing this resolution of disapproval of the jacksonvanik waiver would represent yet another reflection of animosities of the past at a time when vietnam is finally looking ahead and making changes towards its integration into the international community a retrenchment on our part by this disapproval resolution is not in americas short and long term national interests accordingly this member strongly urges the rejection of house joint resolution 99"]]}
