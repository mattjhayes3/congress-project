prelates influence extended well beyond poland with the advent bf the papacy of john paul ii who at his inauguration indicated that it was because of his mentor wyszynski that the roman catholic church has its first polish pontiff 0 this symbol rept sents the time of day during the house proceedings e g o 1407 is 2 07 cardinal wyszynski spent much of his priestly life under the harsh anticlerical tyrannies of nazism and communism yet thanks to his brilliant leadership the polish catholic church today is far stronger than it was when he became primate of poland in 1949 in fact i believe it is fair to say that of the various current power centers in poland only the catholic church speaks for the vast majority of the polish people given what has transpired in postworld war ii poland that is a remarkable turn of events on a number of occasions during this period poland was rocked by domestic political troubles in each instance cardinal wyszynski played a pivotal role in the resolution of those problems primarily because he possessed the uncanny ability of knowing just when and how much to resist totalitarian rule and when to compromise without repudiating his principles adhering to those principles i might add cost him time in prison throughout that ordeal his paramount concern was that the church would never reject the will of its people for the better part of the last year the worlds attention has been riveted upon poland as we all know there have been moments when it appeared soviet intervention was imminent miraculously that has been avoided to date and much

indeed create a balanced budget for fiscal year 1983 beginning on october 1 primarily let me observe that today 928 000 workers in the construction industry are out of work that is 18 1 percent of the total in that industry two hundred and fifty thousand of the workers in the automobile industry are out of work that is 20 8 percent of the workers in that industry these two industries together total 1 178 000 workers who are out of work because of a decline in their industries the principal question is why in the opinion of this member from california the reason or the answer to that question is highinterest rates currently the prime in this country is about 16 percent how do we get that prime rate down the answer is that we must reduce the quantity of borrowing which the federal government contemplates taking from the credit markets over the course of the next year how do we do that we have got to reduce the size of the deficit now when you serve in this house in this institution it almost exudes from the walls that you really cannot cut spending of the federal government that it is part and parcel of the premises and it is impossible to really do it well this member from california yesterday made a presentation to the budget committee whereby a plan was presented that we could balance the budget in 1983 i would like to talk about that this afternoon as we prepare to do battle over the budget this year as we have done in the past i am sure that all of us are not just a little more uneasy this time about the budgetary socioeconomic financial and political ramifications of being confronted with the largest deficit in our nations history we are simply not following the script very well which if we recall why our constituents sent us here 18 months ago calls for movement in the opposite direction we are supposed to be balancing the budget not busting it it becomes imperative therefore for us to find an alternative to the administrations fiscal year 1983 budget a chief obstacle which has thus far prevented us from coalescing around an acceptable substitute is the continuing debate over economic assumptions in february the office of management and budget indicated that the fiscal year 1983 deficit would be 107 2 billionincluding offbudget itemsthe congressional budget office estimates the onbudget deficit alone will be closer to 157 billion the variation in just the onbudget deficit exceeds 70 percent due to acceptance of differing assumptions as to gnp growth inflation interest rates unemployment and changes in law with fluctuations of as little as 1 percent accounting for billions of dollars in changes to the budget it becomes nearly impossible for us to correctly predict what the final figures will be because of this uncertainty it becomes even more important for the congress to take decisive action on the budget and reduce the projected deficitwhether 100 billion or 200 billionby an amount large enough and meaningful enough to make a critical difference large enough to relieve much of the constrictive pressure on the credit markets and meaningful enough so that the message to both taxpayers and the business community would be clear as to our intention to finally do something about outofcontrol federal spending i submit therefore that despite protestations to the contrary not only must the budget be balanced it can be or to be more exactbecause of continued volatility of economic assumptionsas closely balanced as possible under existing circumstances this can be accomplished by cutting 110 billion from the projected fiscal year 1983 deficit whatever that figure may ultimately be a cut of this magnitude would certainly be large enough to materially affect financial markets and meaningful enough to send a clear message that we are finally serious about putting the nations fiscal house in order my program for reducing the deficit by 110 billion can be divided into two underlying premises seven direct components and two indirect additives as follows premises first measures undertaken to reduce the fiscal year 1983 budget should encompass the final 6 months of fiscal year 1982 as well such measures as freezing current benefit levels scaledback increases selective cuts rescissions deferrals or eliminations ought to be implemented as soon as possible inasmuch as fiscal year 1982 spending is not only excessive to begin with but alsobecause of its exaggerated deficithas contributed significantly to the fluctuating and undermining economic indicators after all the more pessimistic analyses including the congressional budget offices result from the higher deficits interest rates and unemployment and lower productivity and revenues caused by the fiscal year 1982 budget i believe that by attacking the fiscal year 1982 deficit at least partially we will affect the economic indicators in such a way as to make the administrations original forecasts and assumptions more feasible and acceptable and even though it may be too late to reduce actual spending for this yearfiscal year 1982in many programs budget cuts based upon fiscal year 1982 levels of spending ought to be possible in most cases this is especially important for two reasons fiscal year 1983 spending is largely an extension of fiscal year 1982as well as previousspending and larger cuts are possible in the more

because you go prepared to have hearings you go prepared to listen to the evidence you go prepared to make up your mind based on the evidence that is presented and maybe everybody there decides based on the evidence that is presented that there is one way to go but a chairman or someone else will pull the proxies out of his pocket and vote the opposite way for those people who never had the benefit of those hearings that were actually taken it then happens on the committee level where proxies are allowed to be voted then we come here on the floor of the house and we have bills that

that both of these women shared the unfortunate experience of imprisonment in soviet labor camps she said it all started in 1949 when her husband was arrested for being a member of a ukranian nationalist association and writing zamizdat the underground press he was sentenced to 30 years that began strokatakaravanskis long stuggle to secure freedom for her husband she petitioned the government and like her companion nadia svitlychny wrote of her husbands plight for the underground press in 1972 when the soviet government began staging mass arrests of ukranian intellectuals and artists these women fled to the caucasus in the north for safety unfortunately it was to no avail for the police were not long in catching them no reason was given for strokatakaravanskis arrest but she is certain it stemmed from her fight on behalf of her husband she spent 4 years at the labor camp before being released in december 1975 four more years elapsed while she waited for her husband to complete his 30year term today after half a lifetime of waiting and hoping the two have been reunited and reside in the united states the most tragic thing about the story that unfolded in my office yesterday was that for every one of these examples of abuse and incarceration by the soviet government that comes to light there are countless others that we never even hear about last week i met with a group of individuals who serve on my ethnic citizens advisory council in the lehigh valley and i was once again impressed at the insight and understanding that these americans have of world affairs

presidents delegation to the funeral of cardinal wyszynski the other members of the delegation were his eminence john cardinal krol archbishop of philadelphia aloysius mazewski president polishamerican congress the honorable francis j meehan ambassador to poland the honorable william wilson the presidents personal envoy to the holy see and peter s bridges director eastern european affairs department of state also participating in the ceremony and of special meaning to me was the delegation from the archdiocese of detroit headed by his excellency edmund szoka archbishop of detroit who was accompanied by the reverend stanley milewski chancellor of orchard lake schools orchard lake mich mrs helen zielinska president of the polish womens alliance and mr joseph drobot president of the polish roman catholic union of america the outpouring of sympathy we witnessed for this towering religious figure has left me with poignant and lasting memories it also has caused me to realize what a legacy he leaves behind the poland we see today in many ways is the result of his efforts therefore while saluting his memory i pray that whoever is chosen as the next primate of poland will be able to build upon the wyszynski legacy and in so doing move poland toward a permanent solution to its most difficult internal problems"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a s a member of the foreign

our economy and my topic this afternoon will deal with how we can cut down the deficit for 1983 and indeed create a balanced budget for fiscal year 1983 beginning on october 1 primarily let me observe that today 928 000 workers in the construction industry are out of work that is 18 1 percent of the total in that industry two hundred and fifty thousand of the workers in the automobile industry are out of work that is 20 8 percent of the workers in that industry these two industries together total 1 178 000 workers who are out of work because of a decline in their industries the principal question is why in the opinion of this member from california the reason or the answer to that question is highinterest rates currently the prime in this country is about 16 percent how do we get that prime rate down the answer is that we must reduce the quantity of borrowing which the federal government contemplates taking from the credit markets over the course of the next year how do we do that we have got to reduce the size of the deficit now when you serve in this house in this institution it almost exudes from the walls that you really cannot cut spending of the federal government that it is part and parcel of the premises and it is impossible to really do it well this member from california yesterday made a presentation to the budget committee whereby a plan was presented that we could balance the budget in 1983 i would like to talk about that this afternoon as we prepare to do battle over the budget this year as we have done in the past i am sure that all of us are not just a little more uneasy this time about the budgetary socioeconomic financial and political ramifications of being confronted with the largest deficit in our nations history we are simply not following the script very well which if we recall why our constituents sent us here 18 months ago calls for movement in the opposite direction we are supposed to be balancing the budget not busting it it becomes imperative therefore for us to find an alternative to the administrations fiscal year 1983 budget a chief obstacle which has thus far prevented us from coalescing around an acceptable substitute is the continuing debate over economic assumptions in february the office of management and budget indicated that the fiscal year 1983 deficit would be 107 2 billionincluding offbudget itemsthe congressional budget office estimates the onbudget deficit alone will be closer to 157 billion the variation in just the onbudget deficit exceeds 70 percent due to acceptance of differing assumptions as to gnp growth inflation interest rates unemployment and changes in law with fluctuations of as little as 1 percent accounting for billions of dollars in changes to the budget it becomes nearly impossible for us to correctly predict what the final figures will be because of this uncertainty it becomes even more important for the congress to take decisive action on the budget and reduce the projected deficitwhether 100 billion or 200 billionby an amount large enough and meaningful enough to make a critical difference large enough to relieve much of the constrictive pressure on the credit markets and meaningful enough so that the message to both taxpayers and the business community would be clear as to our intention to finally do something about outofcontrol federal spending i submit therefore that despite protestations to the contrary not only must the budget be balanced it can be or to be more exactbecause of continued volatility of economic assumptionsas closely balanced as possible under existing circumstances this can be accomplished by cutting 110 billion from the projected fiscal year 1983 deficit whatever that figure may ultimately be a cut of this magnitude would certainly be large enough to materially affect financial markets and meaningful enough to send a clear message that we are finally serious about putting the nations fiscal house in order my program for reducing the deficit by 110 billion can be divided into two underlying premises seven direct components and two indirect additives as follows premises first measures undertaken to reduce the fiscal year 1983 budget should encompass the final 6 months of fiscal year 1982 as well such measures as freezing current benefit levels scaledback increases selective cuts rescissions deferrals or eliminations ought to be implemented as soon as possible inasmuch as fiscal year 1982 spending is not only excessive to begin with but alsobecause of its exaggerated deficithas contributed significantly to the fluctuating and undermining economic indicators after all the more pessimistic analyses including the congressional budget offices result from the higher deficits interest rates and unemployment and lower productivity and revenues caused by the fiscal year 1982 budget i believe that by attacking the fiscal year 1982 deficit at least partially we will affect the economic indicators in such a way as to make the administrations original forecasts and assumptions more feasible and acceptable and even though it may be too late to reduce actual spending for this yearfiscal year 1982in many programs budget cuts based upon fiscal year 1982 levels of spending ought to be possible in most cases this is especially important for two reasons fiscal year 1983 spending is largely an extension of fiscal year 1982as well as previousspending and larger cuts are possible in the more egregiouslyinflated fiscal year 1982 budget than in its fiscal year 1983 successor witness

upshot of all of this is that we do not pay attention to many of the bills in the subcommittee or committee stage because you go prepared to have hearings you go prepared to listen to the evidence you go prepared to make up your mind based on the evidence that is presented and maybe everybody there decides based on the evidence that is presented that there is one way to go but a chairman or someone else will pull the proxies out of his pocket and vote the opposite way for those people who never had the benefit of those hearings that were actually taken it then happens on the committee level where proxies are allowed to be voted then we come here on the floor of the house and we have bills that really are not in good shape what happens when we on the minority side i 850 attempt to bring amendments and some on the majority side bring amendments we get criticized by the leadership for slowing down the process and for attempting to put roadblocks in the legislative progress the fact is that much of the legislation is not being dealt within the subcommittee level the committee level and then by the rules we adopt on the floor which do not allow us to take care of those problems it is not being dealt with on the floor so the committee staffing goes beyond us picking up the cudgel thrown by the president of the united states to try to slim down government to its regular size so that we are fighting trim instead of being overweight and trying to slug ourselves through a fight that we cannot win it goes to the very question of how this institution operates if we are elected by the people to make those decisions we ought to make those decisions they should not be made by staffers who in some waysand there are many many good staffers i do not mean to say that there are notbut there is a certain feeling that develops after awhile when you are here long after the members are here when you stay on the committees and the subcommittees long after they do i had a freshman member come to me today and say during a hearing he and another member got together to bring up an amendment and they asked one of the counsel to come over the counsel said well have you checked with this staff person and that staff person and that staff person he named three staff people well if you have not checked with those staff people i would suggest that you not introduce this amendment during this markup proceeding now what does that mean it means that we have turned this place on its head there is no justification for the growth we have had in staff two years ago the entire professional staff of the committee on education and labor went to the peoples republic of china i have waited with bated breath to find out what pearls of wisdom they have brought us back from the communist regime in china as to how we can better have labor relations in this country or how we can better educate our children you know i am still waiting because i doubt we can learn much in the peoples republic of china about our labor relations and our educational institutions which i thought were the reasons that we had a committee on education and labor we all know that it goes on it is something that we keep quiet about here on the hill and we should not keep quiet about it the american people are looking at us i would hope sometime that the press who are so interested in watching when we do our daily dance or yearly dance on pay raises for members of congress and then leave as we discuss something else which probably costs 40 times as much would pay a slight bit of that attention to how we organize ourselves to the fact that we are overstaffed here to the fact that on some committees you have four and five and six and seven and eight people just on the top who are making over 30 000
