event this is not the kind of a bill that should be brought to the house floor with the very limited debate time available under suspension of the rules this bill deserves and merits fullfledged consideration by the house fada was chartered in late 1985 like any new business startup problems were evident salaries were too high and productivity was not as good as expected but let us look at why fada was created it was needed to case the burden on fslic most of the assets that fada has assumed are among the most difficult to sell fadas task was difficult from the start while exorbitant salaries are not justified certainly competitive salaries were needed to attract qualified individuals into this field fada is now under new leadership and its performance has improved dramatically the fact are as follows fada is making a profit now 3 7 million in the first 8 months of 1988 gerald carmen the president of ceo has cut salaries and staff has been reduced from 400 to 356 carmen has consolidated offices which will save over 1 million a year fada provided to the fslic approximately 356 million from property sales loan payoffs asset restructures and settlements in the first none months of 1988 fadas total asset dispositions since receiving its first assets in 1986 now total 935 million and are expected to top 1 billion by tile end of this year with all of this taking place one must wonder what still motivates ihose who want to abolish this agency my position is that we ought to be doing what is best for the fsiic does it really make sense to fold fada within 60 days does it make sense to put 2 500 assets worth 4 billion back into the fslic allowing them to hire only 200 employees to continue fadas job i dont think it is a wise move at this time particularly when this congress is concerned with the progress and pace of shutting down insolvent institutions a constitient of mine don shackleford chairman of ohio state savings bank is now heading a task force to evaluate future options for fada i know don shackleford very wellhe is among the best and the brightest in this industry and runs one of ohios most successful s ls while his task force has not yet reached a conclusion lie believes that at some point fada should be completely privatizedand that at the very least the process will take 1 year to complete that certainly is an option that ought to be explored under this bill however as amended by the committee fada could not be sold to the private sector the bottom line is that the home loan bank board wont even have available what could be the least costly option of dissolving fada there is no need for unwise haste in this decision its implications could cost the fslic hundreds of millions of dollars as the cbo stated in its letter of august 4 to the banking committee and i quote the proposal to abolish the federal asset disposition association is likely to create temporary delays in resolving claims from receiverships thus reducing income to the federal savings and loan insurance corporation by perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars in 1989 we would not expect this loss of collections to have a budget impact because the fslic would have spent this income rather the agency would have fewer resources to handle case resolutions until an orderly transition to new asset management is in place again i oppose this bill and i will vote against this bill todayand hope that the congress can consider this issue with a greater concern for the health of the fslic the industry and the taxpayer"], [0.0, 0.0, 0, "2 months ago the wall street journal published a disturbing editorial about soviet abm activities breakout february 25 1988 based on a highly classified air force intelligence report the colunm concluded that the soviets are actively moving toward deployment of a nationwide antimissile system and a complete breakout of the abm treaty all members of congressregardless of which side of the aisle they sit on regardless of their approach to achieving true arms reductionsshould be troubled by these findings troubled not only by the assessment about soviet abm activity but the way they learned about those findings referring to the abm findings in the tightly held intelligence report the wall street journal wrote our seismographs have been recording a major explosion or earthquake this week in the unitedstates intelligence community someone in congress ought to conduct an onsite inspection the journals findings bear out an earlier statement by robert gates deputy director of the cia who said we are very concerned that the soviets continuing development efforts give them the potential for widespread abm deployments well in excess of the abm limits it is our job to prepare the national defense authorization that means determining sdi spending levels and helping shape strategic defense policies we also seem to be increasingly involved in shaping arms control policy if were going to do our job right we should get to the bottom of these findings as the wsj editorial says perhaps our reports or for that matter the air force itself may be overly alarmist but senators about to vote on another arms treaty should be warned to inquire for themselves if the house is going to make rational informed decisions about the unitedstates nuclear force and sdi and it is going to insist on involving itself in arms control policy then it has an equal responsibility to learn more about the air force inteiligence findings it is critical that we fully understand soviet strategic defense activities for that reason i have offered an amendment included in the chairmans en bloc amendment which will require the secretary of dod to provide a classified and unclassified report on soviet abm and abmrelated activities unfortunately the house did not have access to a full brief on this matter in time for this years authorization but with adoption of my amendment we will have this information to guide us next year i know that my colleagues share my desire to have a better understanding of soviet strategic defense actions intentions and capabilities and i urge their support for this amendment i include the following article from the wall street journal of february 25 1988 breakout our seismographs have been recording a major explosion or earthquake this week in the unitedstates intelligence community someone in congress ought t conduct an onsite inspection we hear that air force intelligence has officially concluded the soviets have rolled production lines to break out of the abm treaty and deploy a nationwide antimissile system which possibly could be in place by next year that maj gen schuyler bissel head of air force intelligence briefed the cia on this conclusion late last week and that the finding is based on two new pieces of evidence first the soviets are internetting their earlywarning radars with interceptorguidance radars they have conducted handoff exercises in which the large phasedarray radars like the controversial one at krasnoyarsk pick up targets and alert the flat twin and pawn shop mobile radars that guide their sh04 and sii08 antimissile interceptors this is the key battle management function of an antimissile system second the soviets are mass producing the flat twin and pawn shop radars though the abm treaty limits them to two locations similarly they are mass producing the s1108 a relatively new supersonic missile that intercepts warheads within the atmosphere with 500 such missiles already produced and 3 000 ultimately projected the abm treaty limits each side to only 100 interceptors of all types and the soviets also have the si104 which intercepts above the atmosphere as well as other interceptors with both antiaircraft and antimissile capability while rich in detail our reports admittedly have not been from direct participants in these briefings we now find that the new york tribune the unification church paper in new york published substantially the same reports on monday quoting a senior military intelligence official an official conclusion that the soviets are breaking out of the abm treaty to be sure only would put an official stamp on what has been apparent all along the soviets have taken full advantage of treaty provisions allowing large radars at one abm site at missile test ranges and on the periphery of the nation to finish the job they simply ignored these restrictions to build at krasnoyarsk see map adapted from the pentagons soviet military power the administration has cited the krasnoyarsk radar as an outright violation and both houses of congress have voted their agreement the administration also has protested the deployment of flat twin and pawn shop radars at gomel beyond the sites permitted at the sary shagan and kamchatka test ranges in his compliance report to congress in december president reagan said the absence of soviet dismantlement of the krasnoyarsk radar the new violation in the deployment of the flat twin and pawn shop observed at gomel and the totality of soviet abmrelated activities in 1987 and previous years suggest that the ussr may be preparing an abm defense of its national territory these are the words of course of the same administration that currently has a new inf treaty before the senate and has just had its secretary of state in moscow pushing a new strategic arms treaty in time for the impending moscow summit a breakout finding would be of monumental importance to these enterprises on arms control in general the prospect of a soviet abm breakout raises once again the question of why we are negotiating new treaties with them when they are breaking the old ones on the proposed 50 reduction in offensive arms in particular the soviet abm technology is not star wars it is groundbased and many analysts think each interceptor carries a nuclear warhead so that highly accurate guidance is not needed but with our offensive weapons limited by treaty and with no defense of our own against a soviet first strike our deterrent could be significantly degraded even by this 1970s technology perhaps our reports or for that matter the air force itself may be overly alarmist but senators about to vote on another arms treaty should be warned to inquire for themselves certainly anyone as preocupied with the exegesis of

of the united states urging him to begin negotiations with the soviet union relative to its presence in nicaragua it is a most fascinating letter signed on to by a large portion of the democratic leadership including the people who brought the bill to the floor the othl day that had provisions in it whiei would have committed our military to central america and to the nicaraguan problem for the first time but in this letter to the president they say some very fascinating things that i think the american people should reflect upon for example in this letter they are saying quite clearly that the nicaraguan communist government represents a real threat to unitedstates security they say at present the greatest danger of such a threatmeaning to central america in this case and they above say that the united states has valid security concerns in central america and then they say at present the greatest danger of such a threat is in nicaragua under the government of the sandinista junta then they go on to say some very interesting things for instance they make the point about the massive amount of soviet aid that is there including as they put it mi24 hind attack helicopters and then they make this statement there are also rumors of the construction of submarine bases and airfields capable of landing the largest bombers we know that that is more than rumor unless of course pictures of those bases are simply rumor because on this floor during the debate my colleague the gentleman from california actually showed this house pictures of the airfields pictures of the submarine bases it is more than rumor it is fact that is the problem that we are faced with anyhow they go on and they suggest to the president that what he ought to do is to negotiate the soviet presence out of nicaragua the problem with this letter is that it does not seem to recognize that those negotiations have already been under way and that the soviet union is not responding in a manner which helps our security interests i have here another letter this one from colin powell the national security adviser to the president who has pointqd out to us he wrote it to one of our colleagues the chairman of the subcommittee on europe and the middle east and he says in the letter president reagan raised the issue of nicaragua with the general secretary pointing out that continuing massive soviet supply of military equipment to the sandinista regime aggravates the situation in central america and constitutes another instance in which soviet actions in regional conflicts made unitedstates soviet relations more difficult secretary schultz pursued the same topic with the soviets in postsummit consultations in other words what this letter says is that there is an ongoing process of discussions taking place on the very topic that the democrats are saying open negotiations about i am surprised that they do not know what is really going on but let us go on in the letter because this is the problem mr powell goes on and points out the soviet position on the question is clear they propose to limit military assistance to the sandinistas to only small armswhich the general secretary characterized as police arms in exchange for unitedstates stopping its military assistance programs to the other nations of central america and to the nicaraguan democratic resistance this proposal needless to say is not congruent with our commitments to the central american democracies nor with our national interest its acceptance would leave the present dangerous sandinista military preponderance over its neighbors entirely intact moreover it would have us legitimize a dangerous extension of soviet power onto the mainland of the western hemisphere now the only thing that i can conclude is either the people who signed on to this letter are totally ignorant of the negotiations that are ongoing or they intend for us to accept the soviet proposal because i can come to no other interpretation of what they are saying to the president if in fact what they are saying is mr president accept what the soviets offer let us understand what that means it means the soviets would continue to send the small arms in ak47s for instance automatic rifles while we would send no aid whatsoever to the central american democracies what that would mean is that the guerrilla forces that have been funded and have been supported out of nicaragua would be able to get those ak47s to use against el salvador to use against guatemala to use against honduras to use against costa rica and those countries would not have any help to respond the soviets are saying let us send small arms we wont send tanks but we are going to send small arms but you send nothing is

statesman of rare sophistication in the short term the united states can best respond to that sophistication through an effort at a deeper understanding of the soviet unions actual strengths and americas potential weakness in this context we must reexamine the evolving superpower relationship in the western pacific because the combination of an expanding soviet presence in that region and american miscalculations could create a security danger for the united states the soviet union has established a credible challenge to american power in the pacific by multiplying the strength of its

observers as an increasing threat to american influence in the pacific at the least the united states is now forced into the unwelcome position of having to compete hard in a region that is used to consider its own haberman cites an interview with mike mansfield in which our envoy to japan said that he did not feel comfortable with the present level of defensive strength mustered by america and its allies the very size of the pacific fleet said coupled with its expansion into new pacific regions spells danger by definition ambassador mansfield expressed specific concerns about the tonnage

region first moscow seeks in the event of war to blunt any united states counteroffensive against soviet asia second moscow hopes to better exploit opportunities and defuse threats which arise in the far east according to professor bernstein the soviet stations in vietnam may prove particularly useful in this context in his words they permit the russians a to constrain united states power projection in the area by presenting the united states with possibility of superpower confrontation b to provide support to prosoviet communist insurgents should they become active in the region at some future date c to counter any future chinese submarine threat d to facilitate rapid reaction between and in the indian ocean and south pacific and e to use in any limited regional conflict involving only local powers like the peoples republic of china vietnam and the member states of the association of southeast asian nations if professor bernstein has accurately assessed the soviet agenda it would appear that soviet ambitions in asia are just as great as anywhere else in the world unfortunately soviet ambitions in this part of the world may correspond to their military resources in terms of support facilities the soviets have made major strides over the past 5 years they have gained access to naval and air force facilities at cam ranh bay and da nang in vietnam and to the

base in an absolute sense but they allow the soviets to project force with a diminished likelihood of effective reprisal and the soviets have plenty of force to project the soviet pacific fleet now comprises 32 percent of all soviet naval assets as compared to 25 percent in 1965 it numbers some 800 ships and some 120 submarines half of which are nuclearpowered by way of comparison i should mention that the unitedstates 7th fleet has approximately 70 ships and the unitedstates 3d fleet which normally operates in the eastern pacific has 160 the number of soviet submarines in the pacific almost equal the total deployed by the entire united states navy traditionally the soviets have compensated for their numerical superiority by constructing vessels of low quality over the past 10 years however moscow has bolstered both the quality as well as the quantity of its naval presence in the waters of east asia the soviet pacific fleet possesses two of the soviet navys three vertical or short takeoff landing aircraft carriers between 30 and 40 backfire airtosurface missile bombers and one of the navys two large amphibious ships in his article professor bernstein draws particular attention to the arrival of a new soviet surface action group in the pacific unit the action group consists he writes of a kirovclass nuclear powered guided missile cruiser and two guided missile destroyers all three ships are less than 2 years old and their transfer from the soviet northern fleet and the baltic fleet late in august indicates a commitment to boost significantly the capability of the soviet pacific fleet obviously a commitment to the quality of the soviet fleet suggests a commitment to the vigor of soviet policies in that region the soviets have worked hard to improve their overall naval capabilities as well adm carlisle trost chief of naval operations has admitted tht the rapid pace of qualitative improvements in soviet capabilities took the navy somewhat by surprise when it conducted a review in 1984 according to tom stefanick of the federation of american scientists the soviets have embarked on a major effort to construct quieter submarines as mr stefanick notes submarine quieting has a dual effect it makes soviet less detectable making them less reliant on attack submarines for support and thereby freeing soviet for other missions it also makes those better able to transit nato accoustic surveillance and approach western sea lines and coasts the washington post reported in september of last year that the kremlin has assigned 13 elite research institutes the task of finding new ways to detect american submarines according to richard halloran of the new york times the cia believes that techniques other than sonar including synthetic aperture radar infrared magnetic or laser sensors could possibly create a breakthrough in such detection in northeastern asia the soviets have assembled a military presence that may be specifically designed to intimidate neighboring countries over the past 20 years they have increased their ground forces in soviet asia from 200 000 to 450 000 they have deployed 165 ss20 mediumrange nuclear missiles in the same region despite the fact that japan has no nuclear weapons since 1978 moscow has maintained more than 10 000 ground troops and 40 mig23s in the kurile islands part of the disputed northern territories seized by stalin in the aftermath of the second world war and japanese intelligence experts believe they have discovered the tracks of soviet miniature submarines on the ocean floor between the home islands of hokkaido and honshu in the event of a war the soviets would use such submarines to transport special forces units that has been trained to disrupt the economic and political infrastructure of enemy countries adherents of the clausewitz doctrine that one cannot segregate war from political relations the soviets have labored for the disruption of the status quo through diplomatic initiatives as well they have achieved precisely such a disruption in the south pacific in january 1986 the unitedstatess r invited representatives of south pacific governments to moscow for a discussion of the ratatonga treaty which bans the stationing production and testing of nuclear weapons in the region during the conference the soviets suggested that the accord prohibit the transit of nucleararmed warships and nucleararmed aircraft through the area two months later soviet foreign minister edward shevardnadze announced that the unitedstatess r had no objections to the establishment of a nuclearfree zone in the south pacific the soviet official newspaper izvestia noted in june that the kremlin had formed a pacific ocean department within the foreign ministry these and other diplomatic efforts have paid substantial dividends to the soviet union in 1985 the state of kiribati formerly known as the gilbert islands signed an agreement with the soviet union which permitted the use of its economic zone by soviet fishing trawlers as defectors from the soviet commercial fleet have repeatedly observed the soviets frequently employ such trawlers as part of their intelligence and reconnaissance operations given the proximity of united states missile testing facilities in the marshall islands the soviets could have obtained tangible intelligence benefits from the kiribati treaty thanks in part to a concerted effort by united states diplomats kiribati ended its relationship with the soviets last fall however moscow soon concluded a new agreement with the republic of vahnuatu that recouped their position the treaty permits first the access of soviet fishing trawlers to the coral sea second the establishment of soviet ground support facilities for its purportedly commercial activities third the use of the port of palikula for the replenishment of soviet vessels and fourth the use of the airport by aeroflot the soviet airline australian foreign minister bill hayden has stated that once the soviets arrive they will do things that have nothing to do with commercial purposes given the location of vahnuatu within the melanesian archipelago he is probably right the vahnuatu republic adjoins the troubled french territory of new caledonia the soviets will undoubtedly take a keen interest in the political unrest which continues there and their intelligence operatives may keep an eye on the french warships which are based at noumea in new caledonia the leader of vahnuatus opposition party vincent boulekone concurs with these suspicions the russians want to control the south pacific he stated in january if they get a base in vahnuatu they will use it to interfere directly in the affairs of new caledonia the solomon islands fiji and other countries a january 22 report on the south pacific in the washington times seems to justify his anxiety as i noted earlier the government of japan has reservations about the growing soviet presence in the western pacific the japanese have initiated a program of student exchanges and technology exchanges with south pacific nations in addition they have promised the delivery of economic aid to the region although no decisions have yet been made as to the amount how has moscow taken the news of this modest effort not well at all radio moscow denounced the plan on two separate occasions last month in the second broadcast the soviets claimed that the japanese were promoting realization of the united states strategic plans for the asian and pacific regions such areaction may surprise in light of recent soviet attempts to improve relations with tokyo soviet foreign minister shevardnadze visited japan in january of last year and the soviet union has permitted small groups of japanese to visit the graves of relatives in the kurile islands while mr gorbachev may have been sincere in his call at vladivostok for economic prosperity in the pacific he evidently prefers that prosperity be of the socialist variety unfortunately political upheaval may indeed permit the soviets to play a larger role in the south pacific in the future according to daniel abele of radio free europe radio liberty the republics of kiribati and vanuatu are two of nine independent island nations that have gained their independence from britain and france during the past 10 years a political awakening is occurring in the region as a new generation of leaders has emerged confident and independent coupled with this is a rising spirit of nationalism that stems from economic grievances local anticolonial movements and dissatisfaction with perceived indifference on the part of the west to local needs in more specific terms anticolonialism antinuclear sentiment and political radicalism in the south pacific have all joined together to constrict united states security options in that region the labor governments of australia and new zealand along with several south pacific regimes have insisted that america sign the protocols to the south pacific nuclear free zone if the united states refuses to sign we will align ourselves with france whose policies in new caledonia and whose continued testing of nuclear weapons in the region has generated ill will among the nations of the south pacific if we do sign the security consequences could prove disastrous in a december 1 1986 essay for the wall street journal peter samuel the washington correspondent for the australian a national newspaper in australia examined the precise constraints that the free zone accord would place on our conventional and nuclear deterance capabilities spinfizz as the accord is popularly known would prohibit nuclear testing in the south pacific more importantly it would bar the stationing of nuclear weapons on any south pacific islandincluding american samoa mr samuel observes that such a provision with an american signature under it would compound our present difficulties in securing micronesian acceptance of american military bases if the government of the philippines decided to terminate american use of the clark and subic bay stations the united states would have a desperate need for alternative sites in micronesia as mr samuel puts it nothing would suit the soviets better than to force the united states to concentrate all its pacific nuclear weapons on the tiny island of guam australias opposition party shares mr samuels qualms according to the opposition partys foreign affairs spokesman andrew peacock the treaty restricts the united states yet the soviet unions power base at cam ranh bay will be unaffected peacock adds that spinfizz could straitjacket successive australian governments from offering home porting facilities to the united states navy or base facilities to nuclearcapable aircraft or ground units given the pivotal role that australia now plays and that micronesia might play in our naval operations spinfizz could result in the demobilization of american strength throughout the south pacific one can safely presume that the possibility of that development has contributed to moscows strong support for a nuclear free zone of course the kremlin has launched diplomatic offensives in other areas of the pacific rim according to the authoritative soviet military power an annual publication of the department of defense the unitedstatess r has reconstructed its relationship with kim 11song the independentminded dictator of one of the worlds most closed societies the exchange of soviet weaponry for intelligence capabilities has constituted the core of the new north koreamoscow axis the report states the delivery of mig23 flogger aircraft to north korea has been the most significant trend in the improving bilateral relatlonship a total of 35 to 45 such aircraft are expected to be delivered a limited number of surfacetoair missiles 0 have been delivered to north korea this is the first concrete evidence of an agreement by moscow to renew deliveries of sophisticated new military equipment to north korea in exchange it appears that the soviets have received permission to make military overflights of north korea increased activity is expected for both intelligence collection and strike mission simulation these flights have been made by tu16 badger reconnaissance aircraft tu95 bear g strike aircraft and tu95 bear d naval intelligence collectors one important result of soviet support has been an improvement in overall military relations to mark the end of world war ii in europe soviet and north korea fighter units in early may of 1985 conducted their first exchange visits in late summer to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the liberation of korea from japan the soviets sent a record number of delegates and three naval combatantsone karaclass guided missile cruiser and two krivakclass guided missile frigates this was the first such port call to north korea by major soviet naval combatants in sum it appears that north korea has moved from the position of fellow traveler to that of fellow soldier in the war against capitalism given the many united states military installations in japan and given that the submarine bastions of the soviet asian coast would play a critical role in the outcome of any united statessoviet conflict one should not underestimate the intelligence implications of the deepening integration of north korea into moscows orbit in the long run however the west faces a far greater danger from the expansion of the kremlins traditional diplomatic campaigns in southeast asia and china this is despite the fact that moscows ambitions have to date undermined the effectiveness of these diplomatic efforts during his speech at vladivostok mr gorbachev called for the normalization of sinovietnamese relations and closer ties between communist indochina and the association of southeast asian nations vietnams neighbors have been unable to see the wisdom of such developments they cannot forget that the soviets have supplied both hanoi and the puppet regime in pnom penh with billions in dollars of military aid over the past 7 years nor can they forget that the soviets fund a war which in the view of prince sihanouks son may soon result in the extinction of the cambodian civilization general secretary gorbachev also used the vladivostok speech to proclaim his commitment to better sinosoviet relations to placate chinese unhappiness over the continuing occupation of afghanistan the soviet leader announced that the unitedstatess r would withdraw six regiments from afghan soil he stated that his government would examine the question of withdrawing a considerable number of soviet troops from mongolia he accepted the chinese position on the location of the sinosoviet border along the amur river he urged cooperation between the two countries in the construction of a railway between one province in china and kazakhstan in the unitedstatess r to bolster the credibility of his words gorbachev appointed igor rogachev the deputy foreign minister to the post of chief negotiator in the ninth round of sinosoviet talks the soviets and the chinese held their first interparliamentary talks in august of last year and in september gorbachev sent nikolay talyzin chairman of the soviet state planning commission to china to discuss relevant questions in economic and planning work its clear that mr gorbachev has not succeeded in transforming sinosoviet relations following the vladivostok speech the peoples republic of chinas foreign minister remarked we cannot determine now whether the soviet union is still seeking hegemonism or has changed its strategy for hegemony the foreign ministry elaborated on that statement by asking moscow to demonstrate the sincerity of its rhetoric by greatly reducing nuclear weapops and missiles already deployed anckeasing the tension in the region and removing the hot spots of afghanistan and kampuchea chinas senior statesman deng xaloping has even predicated a meeting with gorbachev on a reversal of soviet policy visavis cambodia given these prerequisites its difficult to see the light at the end of the tunnel when it comes to a warming of sinosoviet ties nevertheless we should not dismiss the gorbachev diplomatic offensive in china simply because it has not come to fruition on the contrary the west should look on it with grave concern for two reasons first gorbachevs efforts have not been a shot in the dark they have been a comprehensive assault on the adversarial character of the relationship with chinaan assault that addresses the full range of cultural economic and security tensions in a tangible manner that the chinese cannot help but notice gorbachevs approach signals a keen understanding of asia and a tremendous will to succeed on this front or on another front if he fails in china the second reason is obvious any rapprochement with the chinese would destroy a lynchpin of international deterrence to soviet aggression in some respects the fervor with which the soviets approach their diplomatic and military enterprises reflects on the strength of their adversary if as professor bernstein of the naval war college believes the kremlin seeks to undercut the confidence of asia and oceania in americas resolve and ability to support that resolve then the reagan administration and the department of the navy have made the fulfillment of soviet goals a difficult achievement the relationship between the superpower relationship in the pacific and our defense policies has been underscored by professor palomka of the australian national university in the security of the western pacific the price of burden sharing an essay for the journal survival he writes the importance of perceptions in international politics especially in times of rapid change and the paramount position of the american factor in the calculations of most western pacific states suggests that the security outlook in the region during the 1980s will be largely shaped by perceptions of where the unitedstates stands in the regional superpower naval balance and how well she handles relations with japan and china as james l george of the center for naval analyses a division of the hudson institutes has observed the defense policies of the reagan administration have put the navy in better shape than it has been for over a decade writing in the unitedstates navy a view from the mid1980s mr george lists secretary lehmans steadfast support for a 600ship force improvements in readiness and the resolution of personnel dilemmas as justifications for this conclusion his assessment generally concurs with those of donald daniel of the naval postgraduate school and gale tarleton of the defense intelligence agency who while writing in the same volume suggest that a significant improvement has occurred in our military capabilities in the pacific certainly among the reasons they explain are the renewed appreciation in unitedstates policy of the importance of the pacific area the reversal in the downward trend in unitedstates pacific fleet force numbers forseeable progress toward the 600ship navy with its 15 carrier battle groups the restocking of ammunition and spare parts the deployment of modem fighter aircraft the f15 f16 and f a18 in korea and japan able to interdict outbound soviet antiship bombers and the introduction into the fleet of the aegis airdefense system capable of handling multiple targets simultaneously improvements such as these justify the new confidence about the unitedstates navy that messrs tarleton and daniel have discovered in east asian capitals this confidence in turn assures that america maintains its place as the most influential power in the pacific this same confidence however relies not only on the commitments of the president but of the congress as well congress has restrained the reconstruction of our defense throughout the reagan years slicing administration requests for increases in navy personnel by 9 000 for fiscal year 1983 by 7 000 for fiscal year 1984 and by 4 000 in fiscal year 1985 yet as the national journal reported in its february 21 edition fiscal year 1986 marked the actual demise of consensus between capitol hill and white house on defense spending newtonian realities reasserted themselves in fiscal 1986 the article states when defense appropriations dropped by 4 2 percent and again in the current fiscal year when they fell by another 2 5 percent remarkably the same congress that called for responsible defense spending last year took 22 percent of the fiscal year 1987 budget cuts out of maintenance spare parts ammunition and other readinessrelated programs and 33 percent of the cuts through procurement stretchouts that usually cost the taxpayer more of his money in the long run the journal adds that the house and senate took only 8 percent of the cuts from programmatic changes many of the nations of asia and oceania are too small to even dream of repulsing communist aggression others are too poor to afford a respectable military and still others have antimilitary tradition which make them reluctant to build up their armed forces these nations know that the soviet union has the resolve to carry out its global priorities they depend on the united states for the same degree of commitment the abandonment of our plans for a 600ship navy continued cuts in the readiness capabilities on which our sailors and soldiers rely and further delays in the deployment of the weapons systems which help to form our conventional deterrent posture will leave our friends in the western pacific with an understandable basis for doubts about our enthusiasm for either the reagan doctrine or traditional containment policies while it is very popular on capitol hill for politicians to call themselves cheap hawks we need to remind ourselves that you cant be a cheap hawk if you dont have any wings congress may generate more anxiety in the pacific if it approves the protectionist trade legislation which the leadership backed last year and has endorsed again this year professor bernstein notes that protectionist february25 1987 oti policies could become a serious obstacle to plans for both formal and de facto security cooperation frankly i find it surprising that many of the same representatives and senators who decry our supposed ignorance of the domestic realities of other countries in the conduct of our foreign policy now say that we must initiate tariffs and other forms of economic retaliation against our trade partners do they really believe that these nations will stand idly by and simply accept the economic programs that we dictate to them do they not recognize that each of the governments involved depends for its continuation in power not on the goodwill of unitedstates special interests but on the support of employers and employees whose jobs often depend on exports to america ultimately congress will have to face the reality that not only will restrictions on international commerce punish our consumers through higher prices and fewer products but that we live in a world where the political concerns of the united states are intertwined with the economic priorities of its allies it is my hope that we will learn that lesson before we attempt to enact protectionist legislation not after states in east asia and oceania begin to reconsider their friendship with a power that closes its doors to the exports that keep their voters employed no one would suggest that we ought to be the patsies of the world in international trade to suggest that rampant protectionist legislation dealing with just gross numbers or specifically aimed at the pacific rim of the world is something that is going to assist us either economically or in a national security sense is just not correct we have got to be very very careful about what we do and we have to recognize the implications internationally not only of our economic policy but of our military policy as well unfortunately the adage of some wits of the past that if we do not allow goods to cross borders troops will is just as viable today as it was then so as we look at things in our own particular way in our own parochial way as we all have in the congress of the united states let us not forget the overall implications for peace in the pacific when we deal with trade this year perhaps congress will look more closely at the implications for the pacific of its trade and defense decisions if it gains a better appreciation for the stakes involved in strategic changes there many senators and representatives know that we need secure routes for the shipment of oil from indonesia and the arab states many may know that in order to project force and protect our interests worldwide we need bases in the pacific basin they may not realize the extent of nterdependngremional teetrd 16se ence between the united states and the economies of the western pacific in the new york times september 7 1986 discussion of soviet activities in the region clyde haberman observes american bilateral trade with asia australia and new zealand has more than tripled in the last 10 years reaching 202 billion in 1985 that equals almost to the dollar the united states total worldwide trade as recently as 1975 over the last decade trade with asia and the pacific has increased from 29 to 36 percent of overall american foreign commerce and presumably will keep rising in testimony before the joint economic committee on december 11 of last year prof hugh patrick of columbia university amplified on these statistics he observed that the american economy is now more involved in the world economy than ever before in its history not only absolutely but also relative to its total production investment and consumption over the past two decades the share of exports plus imports of goods and services has virtually doubled to more than onefifth of the unitedstates gross national product since america now trades more often with the pacific basin nations than with any other region including western europe it should be clear that the economic vitality and buying power of our pacific trading partners influence the basic health and selling power of our own economy we cannot be isolationist in our trade policies any more than we can return to the days of a fortress american attitude toward our global defense posture the people from my part of the country understand that pacific rim trade is absolutely important many jobs are intimately connected with pacific rim trade while we have those who export and we have jobs that are connected with export and while we recognize that we are not allowed into those markets as we wish we would we would plead with the congress not to overstep retaliatory action that is not to take it upon itself to impose upon this administration or any other administration a unilateral attitude toward retaliation that does not take into consideration what we are going to get out of it in the end punishing other countries because of their failing real and imagined in the area of free trade may come back to hurt us even more in the long run we will lose american jobs just as well as those countries will lose their jobs maybe those of us in the west will just lose more jobs and lose jobs more quickly than the rest of the country but our entire country would be affected by an unfortunate turn to protectionism in this congress we do not now face an imminent danger to our vital interests in the pacific but such a danger may develop if we do not learn to take the internal politics of our friends as seriously as the soviets do vigorous soviet efforts to improve ties with the states of the western pacific suggest 1h 813 that they maintain a careful watch on the attitudes of those countries to the united states through a resolute and credible defense posture and through trade policies that open markets rather than close them we must insure that moscow has no easy opportunities the consequences of such opportunities can hit too close to the homes of every american"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "with some reluctance i rise in support of h r 3400 the hatch act reform measure presently before congress the hatch act was enacted in 1939 to protect federal workers from partisan political activities the act was adopted in response to actual coercion of federal employees during the franklin roosevelt administration and abuses of the merit system during the 1930s the purpose of the act was to protect government employees from such coercion and abuse in todays society however the hatch act goes too far and simply serves to restrict federal workers unnecessary in exercising their fundamental rights to participate fully and freely in the political process the hatch act is no longer required as the sole guardian against federal employee abuses due to the strength of government employee unions and the press it is difficult to believe that a supervisor who attempts to use his influence to coerce a subordinate to vote a certain way or contribute money to a particular candidate would survive the wrath of that subordinates union or public exposure from the press and it is likely that the political issue or candidate involved also would suffer as a result of the union or press exposure the risk of exposure for the supervisor would be too great and would serve as a strong deterrent to employee coercion or abuse additionally h r 3400 does not strip federal workers of a federal law remedy against coercion and patronage the measure would tighten hatch act prohibitions against such coercion and patronage by simplifying current hatch act language and rulings hatch act restrictions currently are very unclear and complicated federal workers often distance themselves from even permitted political activities out of fear of violating the act rather than serve as a benefit to federal employees the hatch act as presently drafted serves to silence these workers and keep them out of the political process altogether h r 3400 would rectify this situation simply by prohibiting all onthejob political activity while permitting participation in any otherwise legal political activity during the federal employees own time the need for the hatch acts cumbersome and numerous rulings would be eliminated under h r 3400 it is time for congress to recognize the right of the federal work force to fully participate in the political process just as other citizens do and to further recognize that federal workers just as workers in the private sector can deal with partisan pressures without jeopardizing the integrity of their work product i do caution however that the provisions of h r 3400 that would permit a federal worker to take a leave of absence from his job to run for public office go a step beyond granting federal workers the same rights of political freedom as private sector employees place at risk the publics continued confidence in the federal government and must be strenuously monitored as an example consider the federal worker john doe who under the provisions of h r 3400 takes a leave of absence from his job and runs for a local public office assume that mr doe is defeated and as permitted under the bill returns to his federal job further assume that mr doe learns that of the six subordinates who work under him and live in his district only one worked on his campaign if mr doe has the opportunity to promote this subordinate over the others and does based upon the subordinates campaign effort then the federal government would have taken a giant step backward now assume that mr doe has no knowledge of his subordinates campaign contribution but that the public is aware of the subordinates campaign participation and finally that the subordinate is promoted the appearance of bias alone would most likely undermine the publics confidence in that particular government office this perception of wrongdoing must be guarded against with scrupulous rigor my decision on this legislation has been a very difficult one to make i simply am not certain that the majority of active federal workers favors hatch act reform relatively few of my constituents have contacted me to give me their views on h r 3400 although i know of several polls that have been taken on this issue including an informal poll of my own they show neither conclusive support for nor conclusive opposition to reform furthermore i am sensitive to the abuses of federal employees that can follow relaxation of hatch act restrictions and i am particularly sensitive to the fact that coercion can be and most often is subtle a boss need not threaten his subordinate with dismissal or denial of an earned promotion to coerce the subordinate to engage in political activities that further the interests of his superior instead the boss may rely upon unspoken assumptions and innuendo that conformity with the politics of the office is the way to advancement and job security within the organization resulting in subtle pressure on workers to conform to the political philosophy of the office which leads to greater job security i am hopeful that the enforcement provisions of h r 3400 are strong enough and that the merit systems protection board will be diligent enough in carrying out its enforcement duties under the measure to effectively eliminate even subtle pressures to conform to office politics the enforcement mechanisms under h r 3400 must be closely monitored to ensure that coercion and patronage are truly guarded against much of the opposition to h r 3400 stems from the belief that it would repeal the prohibitions against partisan political activity now contained in the hatch act this argument however is simply incorrect and ignores the fact that this legislation would clear up the existing ambiguities in the existing act by eliminating and prohibiting all onthejob political activities instead of continuing the current patch work of regulations which are confusing and often contradictory the bill contains harsher penalties and stronger prohibitions which would act as deterrents against violation of the measure and should encourage and ensure nonpartisan administration of the government which is clearly the desired goal for these reasons i will albeit with some trepidation vote for h

very limited debate time available under suspension of the rules this bill deserves and merits fullfledged consideration by the house fada was chartered in late 1985 like any new business startup problems were evident salaries were too high and productivity was not as good as expected but let us look at why fada was created it was needed to case the burden on fslic most of the assets that fada has assumed are among the most difficult to sell fadas task was difficult from the start while exorbitant salaries are not justified certainly competitive salaries were needed to attract qualified individuals into this field fada is now under new leadership and its performance has improved dramatically the fact are as follows fada is making a profit now 3 7 million in the first 8 months of 1988 gerald carmen the president of ceo has cut salaries and staff has been reduced from 400 to 356 carmen has consolidated offices which will save over 1 million a year fada provided to the fslic approximately 356 million from property sales loan payoffs asset restructures and settlements in the first none months of 1988 fadas total asset dispositions since receiving its first assets in 1986 now total 935 million and are expected to top 1 billion by tile end of this year with all of this taking place one must wonder what still motivates ihose who want to abolish this agency my position is that we ought to be doing what is best for the fsiic does it really make sense to fold fada within 60 days does it make sense to put 2 500 assets worth 4 billion back into the fslic allowing them to hire only 200 employees to continue fadas job i dont think it is a wise move at this time particularly when this congress is concerned with the progress and pace of shutting down insolvent

privatizedand that at the very least the process will take 1 year to complete that certainly is an option that ought to be explored under this bill however as amended by the committee fada could not be sold to the private sector the bottom line is that the home loan bank board wont even have available what could be the least costly option of dissolving fada there is no need for unwise haste in this decision its implications could cost the fslic hundreds of millions of dollars as the cbo stated in its letter of august 4 to the banking committee and i quote the proposal to abolish the federal asset disposition association is likely to create temporary delays in resolving claims from receiverships thus reducing income to the federal savings and loan insurance corporation by perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars in 1989 we would not expect this loss of collections to have a budget impact because the fslic would have spent this income rather the agency would have fewer resources to

shape strategic defense policies we also seem to be increasingly involved in shaping arms control policy if were going to do our job right we should get to the bottom of these findings as the wsj editorial says perhaps our reports or for that matter the air force itself may be overly alarmist but senators about to vote on another arms treaty should be warned to inquire for themselves if the house is going to make rational informed decisions about the unitedstates nuclear force and sdi and it is going to insist on involving itself in arms control policy then it has an equal responsibility to learn more about the air force inteiligence findings it is critical that we fully understand soviet strategic defense activities for that reason i have offered an amendment included in the chairmans en bloc amendment which will require the secretary of dod to provide a classified and unclassified report on soviet abm and abmrelated activities unfortunately the house did not have access to a full brief on this matter in time for this years authorization but with adoption of my amendment we will have this information to guide us next year i know that my colleagues share my desire to have a better understanding of soviet strategic defense actions intentions and capabilities and i urge their support for this amendment i include the following article from the wall street journal of february 25 1988 breakout our seismographs have been recording a major explosion or earthquake this week in the unitedstates intelligence community someone in congress ought t conduct an onsite inspection we hear that air force intelligence has officially concluded the soviets have rolled production lines to break out of the abm treaty and deploy a nationwide antimissile system which possibly could be in place by next year that maj gen schuyler bissel head of air force intelligence briefed the cia on this conclusion late last week and that the finding is based on two new pieces of evidence first the soviets are internetting their earlywarning radars with interceptorguidance radars they have conducted handoff exercises in which the large phasedarray radars like the controversial one at krasnoyarsk pick up targets and alert the flat twin and pawn shop mobile radars that guide their sh04 and sii08 antimissile interceptors this is the key battle management function of an antimissile system second the soviets are mass producing the flat twin and pawn shop radars though the abm treaty limits them to two locations similarly they are mass producing the s1108 a relatively new supersonic missile that intercepts warheads within the atmosphere with 500 such missiles already produced and 3 000 ultimately projected the abm treaty limits each side to only 100 interceptors of all types and the soviets also have the si104 which intercepts above the atmosphere as well as other interceptors with both antiaircraft and antimissile capability while rich in detail our reports admittedly have not been from direct participants in these briefings we now find that the new york tribune the unification church paper in new york published substantially the same reports on monday quoting a senior military intelligence official an official conclusion that the soviets are breaking out of the abm treaty to be sure only would put an official stamp on what has been apparent all along the soviets have taken full advantage of treaty provisions allowing large radars at one abm site at missile test ranges and on the periphery of the nation to finish the job they simply ignored these restrictions to build at krasnoyarsk see map adapted from the pentagons soviet military power the administration has cited the krasnoyarsk radar as an outright violation and both houses of congress have voted their agreement the administration also has protested the deployment of flat twin and pawn shop radars at gomel beyond the sites permitted at the sary shagan and kamchatka test ranges in his compliance report to congress in december president reagan said the absence of soviet dismantlement of the krasnoyarsk radar the new violation in the deployment of the flat twin and pawn shop observed at gomel and the totality of soviet abmrelated activities in 1987 and previous years suggest that the ussr may be preparing an abm defense of its national territory these are the words of course of the same administration that currently has a new inf treaty before the senate and has just had its secretary of state in moscow pushing a new strategic arms treaty in time for the impending moscow summit a breakout finding would be of monumental importance to these enterprises on arms control in general the prospect of a soviet abm breakout raises once again the question of why we are negotiating new treaties with them when they are breaking the old ones on the proposed 50 reduction in offensive arms in particular the soviet abm technology is not star wars it is groundbased and many analysts think each interceptor carries a nuclear warhead so that highly accurate guidance is not needed but with our offensive weapons limited by treaty and with no defense of our own against a soviet first strike our deterrent could be significantly degraded even by this 1970s technology perhaps our reports or for that matter the air force itself may be overly alarmist but

presidential campaigns and that is when the vice president of the united states attempts to articulate the record and even utilize the words previously expressed by the democratic nominee governor dukakis he is criticized for somehow running a tough campaign or an unfair campaign one example of that is his repeating the quote of michael dukakis that michael dukakis prides himself on being a cardcarrying member of the aclu the american civil liberties union that is his right members of congress may belong individual citizens may belong and thus they have the right to set their own agendas the question is whether the american people want the aclu agenda to be their agenda when they are dealing with law enforcement issues that is a very important question because we have been forced to deal over the last number of years to only during election periods with tough law enforcement questions it is only at such times when we are allowed to have an opportunity to vote on the floor that we find that the american people as represented by their representatives here in the house vote for the death penalty vote for an exclusionary rule exception vote for denial of bail to those who have proven to dangerous to themselves and others yet all of those positions are rejected by the aclu the question is if we had a president of the united states dedicated to the aclu position on all of

with the soviet union relative to its presence in nicaragua it is a most fascinating letter signed on to by a large portion of the democratic leadership including the people who brought the bill to the floor the othl day that had provisions in it whiei would have committed our military to central america and to the nicaraguan problem for the first time but in this letter to the president they say some very fascinating things that i think the american people should reflect upon for example in this letter they are saying quite clearly that the nicaraguan communist government represents a real threat to unitedstates security they say at present the greatest danger of such a threatmeaning to central america in this case and they above say that the united states has valid security concerns in central america and then they say at present the greatest danger of such a threat is in nicaragua under the government of the sandinista junta then they go on to say some very interesting things for instance they make the point about the massive amount of soviet aid that is there including as they put it mi24 hind attack helicopters and then they make this statement there are also rumors of the construction of submarine bases and airfields capable of landing the largest bombers we know that that is more than rumor unless of course pictures of those bases are simply rumor because on this floor during the debate my colleague the gentleman from california actually showed this house pictures of the airfields pictures of the submarine bases it is more than rumor it is fact that is the problem that we are faced with anyhow they go on and they suggest to the president that what he ought to do is to negotiate the soviet presence out of nicaragua the problem with this letter is that it does not seem to recognize that those negotiations have already been under way and that the soviet union is not responding in a manner which helps our security interests i have here another letter this one from colin powell the national security adviser to the president who has pointqd out to us he wrote it to one of our colleagues the chairman of the subcommittee on europe and the middle east and he says in the letter president reagan raised the issue of nicaragua with the general secretary pointing out that continuing massive soviet supply of military equipment to the sandinista regime aggravates the situation in central america and constitutes another instance in which soviet actions in regional conflicts made unitedstates soviet relations more difficult secretary schultz pursued the same topic with the soviets in postsummit consultations in other words what this letter says is that there is an ongoing process of discussions taking place on the very topic that the democrats are saying open negotiations about i am surprised that they do not know what is really going on but let us go on in the letter because this is the problem mr powell goes on and points out the soviet position on the question is clear they propose to limit military assistance to the sandinistas to only small armswhich the general secretary characterized as police arms in exchange for unitedstates stopping its military assistance programs to the other nations of central america and to the nicaraguan democratic resistance this proposal needless to say is not congruent with our commitments to the central american democracies nor with our national interest its acceptance would leave the present dangerous sandinista military preponderance over its neighbors entirely intact moreover it would have us legitimize a dangerous extension of soviet power onto the mainland of the western hemisphere now the only thing that i can conclude is either the people who signed on to this letter are totally ignorant of the negotiations that are ongoing or they intend for us to accept the soviet proposal because i can come to no other interpretation of what they are saying to the president if in fact what they are saying is mr president accept what the soviets offer let us understand what that means it means the soviets would continue to send the small arms in ak47s for instance automatic rifles while we would send no aid whatsoever to the central american democracies what that would mean is that the guerrilla forces that have been funded and have been supported out of nicaragua would be able to get those ak47s to use against el salvador to use against guatemala to use against honduras to use against costa rica and those countries would not have any help to respond the soviets are saying let us send small arms we wont send tanks but we are going to send small arms but you send nothing is that really the deal that the democrats would have us sign on to i

country then i get two or three country briefings for tie price of one there were several people assigned at some of the posts that i visited in mongolia and moscow and poland and london that had come from african countries one person told me that they visited an aids clinic in i believe one of the equatorial countries near the old belgian congo area either zaire or one of the z countries in there he said it was so frightening to see how relatives would come and dump off a person dying of aids the stench was so foul in one of the wards that he had an automatic gag reflex and thought he was going to embarrass himself by throwing up in the middle of the ward so he just prayed to make it to the end of the ward holding his hand over his face he said he had never conceived in all of medical history such a tragic sight in any period it must be similar to what gathering places looked like for the dead and dying during the bubonic plague in the 1300s when people were swollen with buboses in their thigh area and armpits and were just left to die and were put on carts and all the bodies were burned he said africa is so tragic that he cannot understand why it is not an ongoing story as my wife says where are the rock bands for the starving now in the sudan where are the rock bands for all the people dying in africa bob geldorf a young irishman who is trying hard to do something about the starving in ethiopia is competing with our great president ronald reagan and general secretary of the soviet union gorbachev for the nobel peace prize but it seems like we need thousands of bob

worse than ethiopia if that is humanly possible to have more harmful images coming out of the sudan we do not have anybody photographing the aidsthe word clinic does not apply anymorethe aids holding areas for the dying in africa there is nothing to do for them one of the horrors unknown in africa that i was informed about by my good doctor friends up at the national institutes of health particularly the institute of communicable and infectious diseases is that the middle class in some of these african countries was hit first so they lost their lawyers their doctors their public servants their civil service corps and the very people that would have been called upon to transmit a message of good health policy they are dead in this country very few doctors have died of aids we have got the worlds greatest health system ever in place and it is crippling itself and it is done in the name of gaiety it is absolutely pathetic"]]}
