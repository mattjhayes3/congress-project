the 500 million that has now trained five people do we stand behind that decision as a body i hope we do not the bigger question we have to ask and it is a hard question are we a nation at war today

the voices of the american people across the nation every single day it is a frustration about what this body does not do we should be having a debate over the authorization for use of military force

our friends perished in the disaster on august 29 2005 we lost over 1 200 people these vulnerabilities were not vulnerabilities that were unknown as a matter of fact mark schleifstein with the

accurately predicted the outcomes of a direct hit by a storm like hurricane katrina upon our communities we saw what had happened homes businesses monuments schools our history our dreams our hopes our future were all flooded as a result of hurricane katrina 10 years ago this wasnt a third world country it was one of americas great cities that was underwater many people look back at hurricane katrina and they view the impacts as being parochial things that impacted louisiana and mississippi and alabama not something that impacted the nation nothing could be further from the truth when the mississippi river was shut down and all the ports associated with it across the gulf coast as a result of the devastating impacts the farmers in the midwest had no way of getting their crops out to market there was no capacity within other transportation mediums to get these crops out therefore the farmers in the midwest suffered as a result of hurricane katrinas impacts on the gulf coast rail lines louisiana is only one of two places in the united states where we have all six class i rail lines in many cases the rail lines and the associated infrastructure was destroyed therefore once again severely impacting americas intermodal transportation system the economy one of the places that has these amazing natural resources has an amazing energy industry petrochemical industry agriculture industry and many many others severely impacted causing impacts not just again to the regional economy but to the national economy one great example of that is gasoline prices following hurricane katrina we watched gasoline prices spike 75 cents a gallon but let me be clear not in louisiana nationwide75 cents a gallon is the national average price increase as a result of those 2005 hurricanes on the gulf coast75 cents a gallon as i recall i believe that translates into 450 million in higher consumer payments per day as a result of the impacts those storms had the 2005 hurricaneshurricane katrina and hurricane ritahad on the gulf coast and had on really the nation importantly the deficit much of the recovery that was funded by the federal government in fact the far majority of it was funded by deficit spending funded by deficit spending this wasnt spending that was offset this wasnt reserve dollars that the federal government had sitting there waiting for this unbelievable disaster this was deficit spending our children our grandchildren our greatgrandchildren will be paying for decades for this i want to be clear this was preventable which i am going to talk about in a minute also the impact to the environment here you see the unitedstates army corps of engineers and you see the epa out there talking about the importance of wetlands and the importance of waters of the united states and writing all of these extraordinary rules to grant themselves more aggressive jurisdiction larger jurisdiction over our private lands yet as a result of those storms alone in 2005 we lost over 200 square miles of coastal wetlands in the state of louisiana alone i am going to say again a lot of people looked at this and watched it on tv and saw it as being a parochial problem a problem of the gulf coast a problem of louisiana mississippi and alabama you could cut and paste that situation you could paste virtually any other coastal city any other coastal state in this nation and they potentially could face the same repercussions the same outcomes as we experienced in 2005 because this nation continues to have a reactive policy to disasters and it is something that we have got to change we could have taken the hundredplus billion dollars that congress appropriated following the 2005 hurricanes to help recover to help get these communities back on their feet across the gulf coast we could have taken a fraction of those dollars and we could have invested it proactively and prevented it from happening any city on our coast could experience the same disaster we saw and i remind you just in 2012 we saw hurricane sandy cause profound consequences in new york new jersey and other communities on the east coast i will say it once again disasters that were preventable and so this is something that we all need to be paying attention to while in new orleans while in south louisiana and mississippi and in alabama there were amazing stories of communities coming together of people coming together of resilient families coming together to ensure that while this did knock them down they were getting back up again and they were going to recoverstrong resolve from these communities all across the gulf coast one other thing that was truly amazing is watching the incredible outpouring of support not just from the gulf coast but from all over this nation and countries around the world committing to come help us recover across the gulf coast it was an amazing opportunity for people to come together to put down differences and to all come together in support of the recovery of these communities the recovery of these families the recovery of these businesses the recovery of the hopes and dreams of these communities across the gulf coast we are going to continue to see this play over and over again we are going to continue to see these types of disasters over and over again until we turn the policies around in the united states until we see fundamental changes i want to pivot back to the recovery i want to pivot back to new orleans i want to pivot back to plaquemines parish and st bernard st tammany i want to pivot back to lower jefferson parish these communities in many cases were destroyed everything was underwater everything i will say it again the homes the businesses the schools the hopes the dreams the future underwaterand 10 years ago 10 years ago unbelievable i think that most people would have told you these communities arent coming back they cant come back they have been so profoundly impacted that they simply cant recover from this but that is not what happened as you just heard mr scalise discuss people came together we now have an amazing progress amazing recovery of our schools in south louisiana amazing recovery in our economy as a matter of fact we now have tens of billions of dollars in economic development projects on the horizon while in other areas you are seeing people losing jobs you are seeing businesses close you are seeing small businesses shut down and a trend of more small businesses closing and opening across the nation but in louisiana tens of billions of dollars in new economic development projects on the horizon as a matter of fact we have the largest foreign investment in unitedstates history committed to projects in south louisiana we are seeing a manufacturing renaissance and it is happening because our people are so resilient because we have come back because we have come together and because we have plotted a path to the future using the resources that louisiana is so blessed with the louisiana maritime transportation system that we have and the amazing natural resources in regard to the inexpensive readily available natural gas oil petrochemical industry the rail lines the intermodal transportation facilities we have been able to accomplish a manufacturing renaissance not in mexico not in asia but right here in the united states in south louisiana in closing i want to say i pray that there is not another community that there is not another city that there is not another state in this nation that has to experience that has to go through the tragedy the travesty that we experienced in south louisiana the loss of over 1 200 of our friends our relatives and our neighbors to see the type of recovery to see people come together to see us finally help to build a resilient protection system resilient ecosystem to ensure that the next storm isnt going to cause the same devastation to new orleans as we saw 10 years ago i pray that that doesnt have to happen again the only way we prevent it from happening again is if people learn from the lessons of hurricane katrina from hurricane rita if they actually apply the lessons learned that we so painfully went through in south louisiana in mississippi and in alabama that we apply those lessons around the united states to make our communities more

over the country came to lower manhattan to sift through the rubble and pick up the pieces it was a site of national tragedy a site of national heroism and it must also be the site of a national memorial it is only fitting that the 9 11 memorial receives proper funding just like every other national memorial it is sacred ground and it must be maintained accordingly also annual security costs run into the millions of dollars as the site remains a top terrorist target terrorists may have attacked our country at three locations that day but they also attacked the spirit inside all of us i encourage every member of this body to vote for this legislation and to visit the 9 11 memorial and museum to see what i and representative nadler see every day i thank representative macarthur for introducing this legislation and i again thankalwaysthe heroes of that fateful day"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "175 268 that is the number of pages of federal regulations on the books that are breaking down the backs of small businesses farmers and families across our entire country some of the folks across the aisle may say that there arent any unnecessary regulations there arent regulations that cause an undue burden on families there may not be any that are outdated let me give you a list of a couple that i came across just in the last couple of years i spoke to some dairy farmers in my congressional district not too long ago according to the epa if they stored more than 1 320 gallons of milk they had to prepare the same kind of hazardous spill requirement that these large oil companies do with oil spills just a few years ago we had the department of labor try to say whether my nephews or anyones kids or grandkids could perform common chores on the family farm we also had the epa trying to implement ambient air quality standards that are so unrealistic that literally the mark twain national forest in southeast missouri would be considered in some areas a nonattainment zone and i can tell you right now that i would rather breathe the oxygen in southeast missouri than in any of the big coastal cities on the east or the west side we have also seen this administration act with the stroke of a pen to try and implement rules that could not be passed by legislation in congress such as capandtrade when the democrats controlled the house in 2010 now the president is trying to implement those environmental policies which would ultimately double and triple the utility rates of people on fixed incomes in southeast missouri we had an issue where the national park service implemented a rule saying that a local baptist church in southcentral missouri could not perform their water baptism service along the current river an act that they had been doing for decades this was a rule that came up as i have stated there are multiple rulesand i could go on and onthat are unnecessary outdated and causing an undue burden on businesses this is the opportunity where citizens across the country can come before this commission and request rules to be seen and to be looked at that would actually make government smaller more efficient and accountable i am asking this body to help support the scrub act so we can reform government regulation at the federal level like we have done at the state level when i was there"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "177 on h r 2901 1 am not rec i was absent

right to maintain and enforce existing sanctions and even to deploy new sanctions to address those continuing con cerns which we fully intend to do when circumstances warrant it is imperative that we take steps to deal with irans destabilizing activities and support for terrorism this involves continued enforcement of international and united states law including sanctions related to irans nonnuclear activities i am quoting the president we will maintain powerful sanctions targeting irans support for groups such as hezbollah its destabilizing role in yemen its backing of the assad regime its missile program and its human rights abuses at home this was in direct response to the gentleman who is saying that he is not for upholding these things today we had many in a bipartisan fashion who voted against this agreement the president has stated clearly that under the terms of the comprehensive iran sanctions accountability and divestment act of 2010 he would not interfere with the terrorist list that he would not interfere with the human rights list but the simple fact isand i have read every single word of the joint agreementthere are hundreds of people in annex ii on that sanctions list among them are more than 50 that are on the terrorist list and the human rights list as violators the president said that they will not be lifted off and yet there they are that is what this bill does it is interesting that last weekand i quote a letter by our esteemed colleagues on the other side of the aisle mr speakerand here is the letter that they sent to the president of the united states reinforcing why this bill is such a good idea irans destabilizing behavior in the region and continued support for terrorism represent an unacceptable threat to our closest allies as well as our own national security as the international community prepares for implementation of the joint agreement iran must understand that violating international laws treaties and agreements will have serious consequences we call on the administration this is their words mr speaker to immediately announce new unitedstates sanctions against individuals and entities involved in irans ballistic missile program to ensure iran is held accountable for its actions i continue to quote this letter inaction from the united states would send the misguided message that in the wake of the joint agreement the international community has lost the willingness to hold the iranian regime accountable for its support for terrorism and other offensive actions throughout the region including syria yemen lebanon and the gaza strip this behavior including ballistic missile tests as the chairman spoke aboutposes a direct threat to american national security interests and those of our allies this was signed by representative lowey our esteemed colleague that is at the podium now on the other side of the aisle mr engel the leader of the democratic national committee for congress debbie
