the exclusion and asylum reform amendments of 1993 some of you may have watched the television program 60 minutes last sunday and were as aghast as i was at the ease with which we see aliens coming into this country at our airports and other ports of entry who have fraudulent documents or no documents at all and how they can come in and if this is the case simply say i claim political asylum i am in fear of persecution if i am returned to country x y or z and immediately the immigration officers release them into the public domain of the united states they give them a work permit they allow them to go get a social security card and a drivers license and 90 percent of them are never seen again not before a hearing officer or anywhere else it is absolutely absurd how this can happen and i am disappointed that we have not had hearings on this subject before i introduced a similar bill to the one i am talking about this time in the last congress but we have not yet addressed the matter what is happening in this country is that we have got a system abroad of people who are smuggling folks into our country taking advantage of a very big loophole in our law if somebody comes to this country and he or she has no documents at all we should not allow that to happen that they can just walk away into the society and have a work permit and so forth the reason why technically this is being done is because we are very liberal on giving someone the right to claim asylum when they first set foot in our nation either on the sandy shores of the beach or in an airport we say if you profess the right magic word and say that youre afraid that youre going to be persecuted back in your homeland because of some political beliefs or religious beliefs then were going to give you the opportunity to go before an immigration judge and have a full hearing on this matter well the problem is the immigration judges are not sitting at the airports of this nation waiting to hear these cases they have backlogs a hundred thousand cases sitting there in the nation today waiting to be heard it takes literally years to hear these cases and all of that time while people are waiting to be heard they are existing out in the countryside and oftentimes are not even showing up for these hearings when somebody goes to jfk as the 60 minutes report showed that they did do on sunday and they make this political asylum claim there is no room to hold them even overnight at jfk they are full at the house so to speak at the little bit of detention center immigration services has so they are immediately parolled into the country and given this temporary work permit and they are told they have a hearing in another couple of months they are supposed to come to just a preliminary hearing it does not resolve anything and then there may be 3 or 4 years or perhaps a few months if they are lucky for coming back for a fullfledged hearing if they show up what my bill does is very simple it says if you come in with a fraudulent document or no document at all any port of entry whether its an airport or a land port you are going to be assigned to a specially trained asylum officer there are already 150 of them in the immigration service today and that specially trained asylum officer is going to ask a series of questions to determine if they have a credible fear of persecution if they return to their homeland my bill says if you dont have a document at all if youve not made a political asylum claim or if you do not present a credible fear of persecution to this asylum officer youll be put on the very next return plane and shipped back to the country of origin you are not going to have a day in court here and an immigration judge type court youre not going to be given a temporary work permit youre not going to be allowed to get a social security card or a drivers license youre going to be shipped back where you came from and i think that is very important 35 000 came through our airports alone last year in this category 15 000 of them at kennedy in new york and most of those 90 percent of those we will never see again before an immigration judge they are here as a practical matter they are here permanently because we do not have a system to round them up as my colleagues heard the other night on 60 minutes one of those was the fellow who we believe was involved in the shooting at the cia in langley va a few weeks ago he came over here and was given this status because he did not have the right documents but he claimed political asylum i would submit that the bill that i am introducing with a number of cosponsors today is the only practical way to grant relief to this nation to our people and that we need to get on with the business of screening out those who do not have legitimate claims and i would hope that we will have hearings shortly on this subject and that this type of legislation will be put in place so that we do not have people coming into this country getting into our system buying their way in in many cases i understand they may pay as much as 30 000 for these fraudulent documents and for the advice that tells them the magic words to claim the political asylum if my proposal were to be adopted i believe that most of this would end and we could go back to a much more reasonable basis for operating in the last 2 years alone there has been a 300percent increase in the number of people coming in through this political asylum claim with fraudulent documents or a lack of documents at our airports a 300percent increase it could only be because the people out there in the other world know that this is a way to beat the system and i would submit to my colleagues that there may be many of those who come in who are not so innocent who may be terrorists or potential terrorists the threat to our security as well as the threat to our orderly immigration system is at risk i would urge my colleagues to look at the exclusion and asylum reform amendments of 1993 and consider cosponsoring them and urging hearings and a markup as expe ditiously as possible to put in place a system that will stop this kind of nonsense once

yielding this time to me there is more to this bill than prohibiting gifts from lobbyists in my opinion this bill is big brotherism from washington at its worst disguised as an ethics reform for congress why do i say this i say it because there are a number of provisions in the bill that pa t so much control over private groups in the hands of the federal government and not the federal government but one person who is going to decide whether or not they violated the law ahd the penalties for individuals is up to 10 000 and could be as mnh as 200 09 now the gentleman there said the ethics rules in this house would penalize a member of this house in the event that they broke the law that is in this bill i would like to ask anybody here when was the last time you heard of any member being penalized to the tune of 10 000 or s200 000 it just does not happen for to you say it happens is erroneous it simply is not going to happen you might chastise them or censure them here in this body but they are not going to be penalized like the average citizen who is going to get hit with a 10 000 or 200 000 fine now we talk about the pac contributions the gentleman from texas the sponsor of this bill from april 9 of this year to june 20 got 76 percent of his campaign contributions from pacs 42 500 now i am not saying that influences him but i would say that it would probably have nore of an impact on him than a big mac that he is getting from the same people who are giving him this money from january 1 to february 16 of this year he got 45 percent of the money from pacs or 26s357 11 now i am not saying that influences him but i would say it would have more of an impact on him or anybody else than a big mac yet if somebody takes a member of congress out and buys him a sandwich he is guilty of breaking the law and can be penalized 10 000 but he cannot be if he gives him 45 0 where is the logic in that it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever this bill will stop kill in my opinion many philanthropic organizations that give millions of dollars to cancer research projects child and wife abuse centers ronald mcdonald houses and others because it in effect prohibits any congressman from participating in those charitable zvents you are not going to be able to do it anymore believe it or not folks some people like us to go to these events and raise money for these charities that is prohibited so who is going to pick up the tab it is going to be the taxpayers because those philanthropic organizations are not going to get that money in the future my question to my colleagues is why not make all lunches or all dinners or any event reportable on the reports that we ble we have to ieport about 9 reports this year alone why not zoport all of that if we did that the public would know cur onstituents would know who we are having lunch with and who is taking us out to play golf or something and the media would know make no mistake about it the media watchers every single thing we do around here so they would know if we were grossly violating or even remotely violating any kind of ethics rules of this house u 1520 by doing that we would not create a new

on which this amendment is being based i have the greatest respect for my distinguished colleague the gentleman from illinois but the courthouse in rhode island is in serious need of repair in fact yesterday during the rain the computer room flooded and was unusable if we are going to have a crime bill which is going to put billions of dollars to try and deal with crime in our nation we must have a facility which can administer justice in this particular courthouse which was built in 1908 this is not a new building this is merely an appropriation to repair an existing structure this building has 56 000 square feet of office space which house 107 federal employees who are involved in trying toadminister justice in rhode island it is one of the busiest courthouses in the country these renovation plans have been in the system for over 10 years for the last 4 years gsa has been working on them the alternatives to not funding this renovation are first to build a new courthouse which would be almost four times as expensive as these renovations the second alternative would be to vacate this courthouse and lease spaces which over a 30year present value figure would again be four times the expense of renovating this courthouse we have a situation where a jury which is trying to be empaneled whici would normally take 70 to 100 people can only sit in one individual room 40 people we have people in thecorridors waiting to hear jury instructions when our prisoners are brought into this courthouse they must ride in public elevators and stand with the public because there are no facilities yes there are times when i think we ought to look beyond rules which would limit our ability to deal with serious issues and i would suggest this is one of those times no one who is running a company would say that we should bind ourselves and not fix and protect our assets no one who is a legislator would say we should become so involved that we do not take appropriate action when we see necessary repairs needed yes if we are going to dispense justice in this country and we have i believe some of the finest jurists in the nation in rhode island we should give them the tools that they need to dispense that justice and that is a facility that has a courtroom a facility which could administer justice properly and one which is in repair we should not let this facility

estimated total cost of 90 million ompletion of the route 17 route 4 interchange project is heavily dependent upon federal funding full funding for the interchange should not be a problem since both route 17 and route 4 have been designated by the unitedstates department of transportation as components of the urbanized area portion of the nhs at the request of the nj department of transportation

of 1991 as a currently authorized project the route 17 route 4 interchange has already demonstrated its merit to the unitedstates congress unfortunately the desperate need for federal funding of this

over private groups in the hands of the federal government and not the federal government but one person who is going to decide whether or not they violated the law ahd the penalties for individuals is up to 10 000 and could be as mnh as 200 09 now the gentleman there said the ethics rules in this house would penalize a member of this house in the event that they broke the law that is in this bill i would like to ask anybody here when was the last time you heard of any member being penalized to the tune of 10 000 or s200 000 it just does not happen for to you say it happens is erroneous it simply is not going to happen you might chastise them or censure them here in this body but they are not going to be penalized like the average citizen who is going to get hit with a 10 000 or 200 000 fine now we talk about the pac contributions the gentleman from texas the sponsor of this bill from april 9 of this year to june 20 got 76 percent of his campaign contributions from pacs 42 500 now i am not saying that influences him but i would say that it would probably have nore of an impact on him than a big mac that he is getting from the same people who are giving him this money from january 1 to february 16 of this year he got 45 percent of the money from pacs or 26s357 11 now i am not saying that influences him but i would say it would have more of an impact on him or anybody else than a big mac yet if somebody takes a member of congress out and buys him a sandwich he is guilty of breaking the law and can be penalized 10 000 but he cannot be if he gives him 45 0 where is the logic in that it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever this bill will stop kill in my opinion many philanthropic organizations that give millions of dollars to cancer research projects child and wife abuse centers ronald mcdonald houses and others because it in effect prohibits any congressman from participating in those charitable zvents you are not going to be able to do it anymore believe it or not folks some people like us to go to these events and raise money for these charities that is prohibited so who is going to pick up the tab it is going to be the taxpayers because those philanthropic organizations are not going to get that money in the future my question to my colleagues is why not make all lunches or all dinners or any event reportable on the reports that we ble we have to ieport about 9 reports this year alone why not zoport all of that if we did that the public would know cur onstituents would know who we are having lunch with and who is taking us out to play golf or something and the media would know make no mistake about it the media watchers every single thing we do around here so they would know if we were grossly violating or even remotely violating any kind of ethics rules of this house u 1520 by doing that we would not create a new bureaucracy costing millions of dollars to the american taxpayer and infringing on their rights to contact their congressman under the threat of a 100 090 fine"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "1 minute is hardly enough time to cover it but i am opposed to the bill i have a book i just got on western wisdom the book is called dont squat with your spurs on that is good advice but it also says in there in other little bits and one of them is dont ask your barber if you need a haircut i sort of think about that when everyone who has spoken here in support of this comes from somewhere else other than the states dedicated to public lands we have 50 percent in our state some go as high as 80 percent these are not parks these are not wilderness these are lands that were left after the homesteads took place these are not highproductive areas we are talking about multiple use here the opportunity to use multiply these lands that are in public ownershil the rest of your states the lands went to private ownership or went to the state i have a suggestion why do you not deed it to the states why do you not do that in a fairness mood we will take care of it and you will not have the cost of dealing with it we have talked about the condition of the range the condition of the range is good the wildlife is up that is

the months to come to honor this great man but for now two terms come to mind when i think of bob michel being a former marine myself the first term i think of is esprit de corps bob michel has been the spirit of the republican party for all these 38 years bob michel is a great man the living embodiment of all that is best about the republican party there is one other term that comes to mind when i think of bob michel that word that phrase is semper fidelis another marine corps term it means always faithful i think back to the first 2 years of the ronald reagan presidency when bob michel put his heart and soul into passing the reagan program through congress he made tough votes that were difficult to make cutting back on entitlement programs doing things that we should have been doing all along he almost lost the election because of it in 1982 but he was always faithful to his beliefs to the republican philosophy of limited government and to putting the vital interests of our country

facts in the case of walla walla i would like to express the facts in the case of the providence courthouse this is not in my district but because we only have one federal courthouse in the state of rhode island it is in fact imperative that this body understand the facts on which this amendment is being based i have the greatest respect for my distinguished colleague the gentleman from illinois but the courthouse in rhode island is in serious need of repair in fact yesterday during the rain the computer room flooded and was unusable if we are going to have a crime bill which is going to put billions of dollars to try and deal with crime in our nation we must have a facility which can administer justice in this particular courthouse which was built in 1908 this is not a new building this is merely an appropriation to repair an existing structure this building has 56 000 square feet of office space which house 107 federal employees who are involved in trying toadminister justice in rhode island it is one of the busiest courthouses in the country these renovation plans have been in the system for over 10 years for the last 4 years gsa has been working on them the alternatives to not funding this renovation are first to build a new courthouse which would be almost four times as expensive as these renovations the second alternative would be to vacate this courthouse and lease spaces which over a 30year present value figure would again be four times the expense of renovating this courthouse we have a situation where a jury which is trying to be empaneled whici would normally take 70 to 100 people can only sit in one individual room 40 people we have people in thecorridors waiting to hear jury instructions when our prisoners are brought into this courthouse they must ride in public elevators and stand with the public because there are no facilities yes there are times when i think we ought to look beyond rules which would limit our ability to deal with serious issues and i would suggest this is one of those times no one who is running a company would say that we should bind ourselves and not fix and protect our assets no one who is a legislator would say we should become so involved that we do not take appropriate action when we see necessary repairs needed yes if we are going to dispense justice in this country and we have i believe some of the finest jurists in the nation in rhode island we should give them the tools that they need to dispense that justice and that is a facility that has a courtroom a facility which could administer justice properly and one which is in repair we should not let this facility become deteriorated to the point of uselessness we should in fact appropriate this money"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "1 rise in strong

act of 1994 as members know this legislation will accelerate the construction of the information superhighway it will promote competition in local telephone by allowing cable companies to provide telephone service and will promote competition in the cable industry by enabling telephone companies to offer video services i want to praise chairman markey congressman fields and every member of our energy and commerce subcommittee on telecommunications and finance for the long hours of work they put into crafting this legislation what makes this significant legislation possible is the clear consensus which has emerged in favor of competition deregulation and entrepreneurialism the approach that this measure takes toward the development of the telecommunications supersystem is one that i have endorsed for years by lifting marketentry prohibitions and reducing government regulation we will ensure that american consumers are served with the most advanced telecommunications system in the world equally important i am confident that by providing competition in the video service industry this measure will give consumers the cable rate relief that the 1992 cable act did not i would like to add that while advancing private competition and deregulation are traditionally republican themes i was joined in my early efforts to promote this approach by a clearthinking demoract the gentleman

interchange in paramus nj i am deeply concerned that 3 million is simply insufficient to significantly advance this s90 million project in a timely fashion the route 17 route 4 interchange is a major east west to north south link in northern new jersey and its improvement is vital for commuters and commerce the interchange lies at the heart of the borough of paramus and bergen countys commercial hub and it is a critical crossroad for all of northern new jersey fortunately local officials have worked closely with the new jersey department of transportation to formulate the approved interchange design at an estimated total cost of 90 million ompletion of the route 17 route 4 interchange project is heavily dependent upon federal funding full funding for the interchange should not be a problem since both route 17 and route 4 have been designated by the unitedstates department of transportation as components of the urbanized area portion of the nhs at the request of the nj department of transportation the north jersey transportation coordination council and other local planning organizations and in accordance with applicable provisions outlined in the intermodal surface transportton efficiency act of 1991 as a currently authorized project the route 17 route 4 interchange has already demonstrated its merit to the unitedstates congress unfortunately the desperate need for federal funding of this project has been accelerated due to a land dispute brought about by the specifications of the nj department of transportation approved design the owner of the socalled alexanders property have threatened to raze the existing retail structure and construct three new retail facilities unless a minimum of 8 million in federal funds can be made available lo purchase the property
