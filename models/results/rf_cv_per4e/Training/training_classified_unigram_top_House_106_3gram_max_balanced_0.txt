should say so so that we can move beyond the failure of the conferences committee every day that goes by without passage into law of a real patient protection bill means that people are being harmed by hmos that care more about their bottom line more about their most recent stock quotes on wall street than they care about patients let me give some examples of people who have been harmed by hmos before coming to congress i was a reconstructive surgeon i took care of little children that were born with birth defects like this little baby with a cleft lip and palate do my colleagues know that in the last several years more than 50 percent of the surgeon who care for children born with this birth defect have had cases like these refused by hmos who call this a cosmetic deformity this is a birth defect the operation to repair this would be to restore towards normalcy that is not a cosmetic case under any definition a couple of years ago now this ladys case was profiled on the cover of time magazine this woman lived in california her hmodid not tell her all that she needed to know furthermore they put pressure on the medicare center treating her not to tell her because she did not get that information in a timely fashion and because her hmo did not play straight with her on getting her the treatment that she needed as medically necessary she died today her children and her husband do not have a mother and a wife a couple of years ago a young woman was hiking in the mountains about 70 miles west of washington d c she fell off a 40foot cliff she broke her pelvis fractured her arm broke her skull was lying at the bottom of this 40foot cliff when her boyfriend who had a cellular phone managed to get a helicopter in they took her to the emergency room she was treated she lived but then do members know what the hmo would not pay her bill because she had not phoned ahead for prior authorization was she supposed to have a crystal ball that was going to tell her that she was going to fall off a 40foot cliff so she could make a phone call to her hmo i have shared these stories with my colleagues in the past but i have some new ones tonight that are going to amaze my colleagues this is also a story a true story about a little boy we can see him here tagging on his sisters sleeve one night his temperature was about 104 or 105 degrees and his mother phoned the 1800 number for their hmo and said my baby needs to go to the emergency room he is really sick she got somebody thousands of miles away who said well i will only authorize you to take him to one emergency room and when the mother asked where it was the person said i do not know find a map it turned out that the hmo was about 60 or 70 miles away en route this little baby had a cardiac arrest if one is a mom and dad driving this little baby to the hospital members can imagine what that was like when they finally found it the mother leaped out of the car holding her little baby screaming save my baby save my baby a nurse came out started resuscitation they put in the i v lines gave him mouthtomouth resuscitation gave him the medicines and they managed to bring his life back all because that hmo did not have the common sense or decency to say if your baby isreally sick take him to the nearest emergency room because en route they passed three emergency rooms but they were not authorized by that hmo this little baby managed to survive but because he had that cardiac arrest he lost the circulation to his hands and his feet and he had to have both hands and both feet amputated why do 80 percentplus of the american public think that congress should pass an hmo reform bill a patient protection bill a real bill because their friends and neighbors have had problems just like some of those that i have shown the members a few years ago there was a movie as good as it gets in that movie helen hunt is talking to her friend jack nicholson and explaining how this hmo that they belong to will not properly take care of her son who has asthma then she let loose a string of expletives that i cannot repeat on the floor of congress but i can tell the members what happened in the theater that my wife and i were in it happened all across the country people started cheering and clapping and even standing up in applause because they knew the truth of that allegation no law has passed because the hmos have spent over 100 million lobbying against real patient protection legislation they have given generously to keepthat legislation bottled up in conference committee even worse the hmo industry is trying to get legislation passed that would undo the progress that is being made on behalf of patients in state legislatures and in the courts the gop bill that recently passed the senate the nickles amendment is worse than no bill at all in fact it is an hmo protection bill not a patient protection bill would members like some proof of this let me tell the members about some of the things that have been documented in a recent article in smart money magazine in their july issue l 2000 consider the case of jim ridler it was shortly after noon on a friday back in august 1995

his lawsuit his health plan wanted to take a big chunk out of it that they had spent on his care youre joking right said jim nope said the lawyer jims health plan had a clause in its contract that allowed the hmo to stake a claim in his settlement a claim known in insurance as subrogation so i pay the premium and then something happens that i need the insurance for and they want their money back ridler asked incredulously the way i figure it my health insurance is just a loan well ridler eventually settled his lawsuit for 450 000 which was all the liability insurance available his health

expressed in congress and by an overwhelming majority of the american people who oppose allowing the hunting of whales particularly for commercial purposes as i have been predicting from the well of this house and across america for several years the push for resumption of worldwide commercial whaling is on in earnest and it is not about heritage it is all about money we have heard that a gray whale can be sold in japan for 1 million those who want to end the ban on commercial whaling have been using the pretext of restoring whaling rights to indigenous people to expand the scope of whaling worldwide but if we allow people to use the excuse of historic whale hunting for resumption of whale hunting worldwide you have got to remember many nations most nations with coastlines hunted whales japan and norway definitely would have as good as anybody an historic whale hunting opportunity japan and norway are the most notorious now for going ahead and hunting whales newsweek magazine reported april 17 information i have already given this body that japan has been quietly packing the international whaling commission with small nations willing to do their bidding willing to vote for the resumption of commercial whaling we are dangerously close to a renewal of the barbaric practice of commercial whaling to millions of americans including myself this is totally unacceptable when the clintongore administration last year financed the makah tribal whale hunt and colluded with the prowhaling nations of the international whaling commission our nations government lost its moral

capitals throughout the land governors and legislative leaders republicans and democrats from states from california to new york are meeting their policy challenges in exciting innovative ways with our beyond the beltway project we are hoping as freshmen to open new doors for these leaders we know that for far too long federal rules and bureaucracies have held them back and smothered their

their state programs if those plans deviate from the details of federal programs e0 0915 the idea of this legislation is that where a state has been granted a waiver on a particular program if another state seeks a similar waiver we believe that they should only have to go through a streamlined or expedited waiver review process we want to encourage the laboratories of democracy we want to encourage modeling we want to encourage benchmarking we want to encourage borrowing of ideas i would hope that my colleagues would join us in this expedited review bill and more importantly join the

right on the beach in front of my house the death of this gray whale should call our attention to those who would like to reverse the will expressed in congress and by an overwhelming majority of the american people who oppose allowing the hunting of whales particularly for commercial purposes as i have been predicting from the well of this house and across america for several years the push for resumption of worldwide commercial whaling is on in earnest and it is not about heritage it is all about money we have heard that a gray whale can be sold in japan for 1 million those who want to end the ban on commercial whaling have been using the pretext of restoring whaling rights to indigenous people to expand the scope of whaling worldwide but if we allow people to use the excuse of historic whale hunting for resumption of whale hunting worldwide you have got to remember many nations most nations with coastlines hunted whales japan and norway definitely would have as good as anybody an historic whale hunting opportunity japan and norway are the most notorious now for going ahead and hunting whales newsweek magazine reported april 17 information i have already given this body that japan has been quietly packing the international whaling commission with small nations willing to do their bidding willing to vote for the resumption of commercial whaling we are dangerously close to a renewal of the barbaric practice of commercial whaling to millions of americans including myself this is totally unacceptable when the clintongore administration last year financed the makah tribal whale hunt and colluded with the prowhaling nations of the international whaling commission our nations government lost its moral authority to lead the fight against killing whales for profit this was truly a tragedy whales were hunted almost to extinction in the late 1800s we must not allow the clock to be turned back topast days of barbarism republicans and democrats in this body must stand with the american people and stop this conspiracy against these magnificent creatures we must not return to commercial whaling"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "2 decades ago i had the privilege of being first elected to serve here in the congress and one of the greatest members of that class in 1980 was the gentleman from virginia who as has been pointed out by virtually everyone here has served extraordinarily well as chairman over the past 6 years of this very important subcommittee i listen to my colleagues who are proud to represent this washington d c metropolitan area and yet i have to say that the gentleman from virginia has also done an awful lot to help us deal with one of the most pressing problems that we have in my state especially in the southern part of the state which i am privileged to represent and that is transportation the gentleman from massachusetts"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "2 weeks ago 19 republican freshmen stood shoulder to shoulder on the front lawn outside this very building we did so to launch our classwide project that we are calling beyond the beltway the republican freshmen are a diverse group coming from diverse backgrounds and representing equally diverse parts of america but despite that diversity we are all excited by some of the ijnovative reforms that we are seeing take place in state capitals throughout the land governors and legislative leaders republicans and democrats from states from california to new york are meeting their policy challenges in exciting innovative ways with our beyond the beltway project we are hoping as freshmen to open new doors for these leaders we know that for far too long federal rules and bureaucracies have held them back and smothered their efforts through unnecessary burdens and restrictions now the freshmen are reaching out to leaders like my own governor governor tommy thompson in an effort to help them unleash a whole new wave of creativity and innovation in state after state it is the freshmen who are initiating this project because even though we are members of congress we are very much still state legislators local officials and private sector small business persons at heart here specifically is what the beyond the beltway project will do the freshman class as a group have asked our governors legislative leaders directly and through the various associations to help us identify some of those federal rules and restrictions that are holding them back we want to turn these suggestions into an ongoing action agenda member by member and issue by issue we want to provide relief we are coming forward now with the beyond the beltway initiative because we have also introduced the first measure result from this new dialogue this legislation would direct each federal agency to develop an expedited review process for waiver requests as we know oftentimes states need federal approval or waivers to initiate their state programs if those plans deviate from the details of federal programs e0 0915 the idea of this legislation is that where a state has been granted a waiver on a particular program if another state seeks a similar waiver we believe that they should only have to go through a streamlined or expedited waiver review process we want to encourage the laboratories of democracy we want to encourage modeling we want to encourage benchmarking we want to encourage borrowing of ideas i would hope that my colleagues would join us in this expedited review bill and more importantly join the republican freshmen in developing beyondthebeltway ideas this is more than a shortterm project we hope it is the beginning of a new longer more open relationship between congress and the states instead of the governors coming to us on bended knee we are hoping to go to them for ideas and suggestions we want to turn them loose we believe that there is no telling how many of our major social political challenges can be met if only we will move power and authority out of washington and beyond the beltway"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "2 years ago this house and this congress and the president joined with us in enacting the first balanced budget in 28 years a balanced budget which contained key middle class tax cuts thanks to that middle class tax cut we are enjoying a booming economy and a 3 trillion projected budget surplus of course under the republican budget we set aside twothirds of the surplus for medicare and social security onethird we use of course for ta4 relief i would also point out under this republican budget this year the third baianced budget in 3 years we are going to set aside 6 for debt retirement for every dollar in tax relief i also want to point out in this tax relief package that we are working on right now that we are addressing a question that i have raised in this house and that is is it right is it fair that under our tax code today married working couples pay more in taxes just because they are married a key provision of the financial freedom act of course is efforts to eliminate the marriage tax penalty for almost 28 million married working couples who will receive 243 in marriage tax relief and it is time think about it 243 that is a

savings accounts where the money can be invested in order to grow tax free and where it can be added to each year so that it can grow enough to help pay for college tuition ever since we managed to get education savings accounts enacted into law we have been trying to raise the amounts parents are allowed to put into their childrens accounts each year we have been trying to extend education savings accounts so that parents grandparents or other interested parties will be able to use them to prepare for private or parochial elementary or high school expenses if a family vere able to put 2 000 in an education savings accounts every year from the time a child was born and if the account averaged 7 percent interest annually it would hold 14 500 by the time the child got to 1st grade if nothing were withdrawn and annual savings continued that amount would rise to 46 500 when it was time for high school president clinton vetoed an extension of education savings accounts last september but i am confident that most of us in the house think parents should be encouraged to save for their kids futures and that is why we are going to try again"]]}
