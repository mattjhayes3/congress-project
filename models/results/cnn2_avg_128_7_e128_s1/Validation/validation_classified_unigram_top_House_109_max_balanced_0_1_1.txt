time and time again the democrats want to put these fiscal restraints in place so it doesnt matter if there is a republican congress or a democratic congress the rules are in place these rules were in place all throughout the nineties that is why we had surplus money that is why we made the targeted investments focused in certain areas that yield results that yield tax money investments in education you get a good return on that we had a study done at the university of akron a few years back this was on state tax money in ohio but when the state spent 1 on tax money that went towards higher education they got 2 back in taxes education is a great investment lets make this investment lets invest and do it in a way that we can get a good return on our money down the line but today the republican congress has just been tied up in knots with the special interests the oil companies the energy companies the health care industry time and time again they are given public tax dollars in the form of corporate welfare stop the corporate welfare stop the corporate welfare and lets move forward but i want to say that it is not me it is not me it is pat toomey it is newt gingrich it is a lot of the conservatives or some of the conservatives that are still left on the republican side all we want to do is get this country back together because where we are getting the money because we are running deficits how do you plug the hole you got to go borrow it the republican congress continues to borrow from the chinese government from the japanese government from opec countries this is really happening this is one of the k street fairy tales this is like a k street fairy tale the republican majority is borrowing money as we run these deficits and they give millionaires tax cuts 42 000 they are going to give them more next year as they do that and we run these huge budget deficits we cant fill the gap so this republican congress and this republican president they are going to opec to borrow money from opec to help plug the hole can you imagine it is like you are making it up it is another k street fairy tale that we have here running huge deficits gas is 3 a gallon you not only give the oil companies 16 3 billion in corporate subsidies but you also borrow money from opec countries to help plug the deficit because you are giving tax cuts to millionaires now i am not opposed to giving middle class people a tax cut i am not opposed to giving a small business a tax cut but i am against giving a millionaire 42 000 back when you are fighting two wars your average people are struggling tuition costs have doubled in the last 5 years and you are giving bill gates another tax cut that just doesnt make any sense i dont care what your party affiliation is that is irresponsible that is irresponsible governing and until we get the republican congress out and the democratic congress in we are not going to be able to fix this thing because we have tried mr spratt

relates to whose side they are on now one may say ms jacksonlee and i am glad that those of us here in the 30something working group we do our homework before we come to the floor i cant say that about all members that come to the floor as it relates to having the facts because what is important here is the truth facts where people can follow up and not fiction and folks are not used to that out of this majority and not used to that here in washington dc and that is what we are saying we want to provide because nothing is better than the truth because no matter what party you are affiliated with we still salute one flag thanks to our men and women that were in uniform veterans and those that are in uniform now the least that we can do is be straight withthem and being straight with them is basically just saying just recently june 22 here on this floor democrats worked to raise the minimum wage and this was appealing to the rule of the chair by mr rangel in a motion to offer the minimum wage increase and he was ruled out of order and it was appealed and then the republicans voted against us from having it on the floor by 229 votes to 195 and that is rollcall vote 313 again june 27 which is a couple of days from the first time from that attempt that we moved to get the minimum wage up the science state justice commerce appropriations bill when it was here on this floor ms jacksonlee you were here that day i saw you the rule to block consideration of the obeyhoyermollohan amendment to increase the minimum wage rollcall vote 319 the rule was adopted but there was a procedural move to block us from getting this on the floor the house adopted a resolution to adjourn for the fourth of july recess without bringing up the bill to increase the minimum wage that is rollcall vote to adjourn which was rollcall vote 353 to adjourn and i think it is important that was 220 supermajority voted for it 197 voted against it it was only one republican that was on our side and saying that we shouldnt leave until we deal with it so ms jacksonlee i wouldnt get concerned about what they say because that is what speaker gingrich has said he has the chart and if staff can give me the chart that said they that they that is what he calls the republican majority that is what they called the republican majority you remember that mr ryan because he felt that they are no longer responsible in a way that he thought they should be when he was the father of giving case in point once again thirdparty validator this was the speaker of the house when the republicans took control of the house and this is what he has to say and this was in the knight ridder newspaper friday march 31 2006 they are seen by the country as being in charge of a government that cant function they he is talking about the republican majority they goodness gracious if speaker foley came and called us they i mean this would be a travesty this is newt gingrich this is not someone in some club somewhere or someone that doesnt have house credentials he was here on this floor he was the speaker he was the leader in the republican majority and he was the speaker he wasnt majority leader he wasnt a whip he wasnt over the conference he wasnt over a caucus he was the speaker he sat there on the speaker rostrum he was the man his picture hangs up back here in the speakers lobby i cant boil this down any further to say that it is substantial when a chief republican says they and so what we are talking about here ms jacksonlee and mr ryan is something that everyone should understand republicans have to have a problem republican voters and independent voters and democratic voters have to have a problem with a dysfunctional government that is making history in all the wrong ways and i am going to share that chart but i am going to yield to you i see mr ryan is here and i want to come back on our chart of irresponsibility that has taken place because i want to make sure if we have got to say it 1 000 times i that we have said it 1 001 times so that the american people when they are asked to make a decision in november"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "before we went to war president bush and other administration officials made three promises to the american people one we would find weapons of mass destruction two we would be welcomed as liberators and three the reconstruction of iraq would payfor itself well all three promises proved to be false today i will focus on the reconstruction effort in iraq and the massive waste fraud and abuse that have undermined our efforts stuart bowen is the special inspector general for iraq reconstruction he often talks about the reconstruction gap which is the chasm between the presidents promises and reality mr bowen is absolutely right the gap is enormous but it is dwarfed by the incompetency and corruption gaps in iraq the consequences of mismanagement and corruption are serious waste fraud and abuse have flourished the taxpayer has been repeatedly gouged iraq is not being rebuilt we have lost credibility and are now viewed in iraq as occupiers and our troops did not get essential equipment when they needed it we have now spent 50 billion on iraq reconstruction including 30 billion from unitedstates taxpayers lets look at what we got for the money despite spending 2 billion iraqs oil production is still well below prewar levels running about a half million barrels below 2003 levels we have invested 4 billion into improving electricity generation not only is the administration 2 000 megawatts short of reaching its goal for peak output but generation is actually below prewar levels and we spent 6 billion on oil production and electricity generation and we have actually lost ground the situation is the same for drinking water in essence we have squandered 50 billion profiteering has been rampant and the taxpayer has gotten gouged and the work has not gotten done and what is especially shameful about the wasteful spending is that we needed this money for our troops when we first went into iraq our troops did not have enough body armor families had to purchase armor off the internet and ship it to iraq in a desperate attempt to protect their loved ones on congressional delegations individual servicemembers have taken our staffs aside and begged for more night vision goggles patriotic americans even had to donate their frequent flier miles so troops who were dumped at the baltimore airport by the pentagon could make it home for the holidays this should never have happened it is inexcusable that our troops face desperate shortages of essential gear while billions of dollars were frittered away to understand the magnitude of this there is no better place to start than halliburton halliburton is the largest private contractor operating in iraq the company has three contracts that total more than 20 billion we now know that political appointees not career civil servants decided to give halliburton a secret nobid contract for 7 billion to operate iraqs oil fields as gao has reported the key decision that led to the award of the secret contract violated federal procurement law when a career attorney properly objected he was simply overruled and despite statements from the vice president we know now that his chief of staff scooter libby was personally briefed on this entire plan months before the war the decision to give those lucrative contracts to halliburton has been expensive according to pentagon audits halliburtons total unreasonable and unsupported charges exceed 1 4 billion well the examples of waste fraud and abuse are numerous halliburton charged 45 for a case of soda 100 for a 15pound bag of laundry when they had brandnew 85 000 halliburton trucks they abandoned them or torched them if they got a flat tire or experienced minor mechanical problems halliburtons contracts are costplus that means that halliburton is reimbursed for all of its costs and then receives an extra percentage as additional profit in practical terms this means that the more halliburton spends the richer it gets now we talked to former halliburton employees who worked in iraq they told us the informal company motto was do not worry about price it is cost plus halliburton was supposed to be in iraq to provide support for the troops but the company used one standard for the troops and a completely different standard for its own executives halliburton employees stayed at the fivestar kempinski hotel in kuwait where it costs taxpayers 10 000 per day this is the fivestar kempinski this gorgeous hotel offered maid service complimentary fruit baskets to halliburton employees our troops stayed in tents in the desert at one point a costconscious army official asked halliburton to move its employees into airconditioned tents but they refused to their credit career government auditors identified these overcharges when they examined halliburtons second oil contract they harshly criticized halliburtons performance citing profound systemic problems and exorbitant indirect costs but their recommendations were rejected after reviewing halliburtons first oil contract in iraq auditors recommended that the army not pay 263 million in unreasonable and unsupported charges but the army ignored those auditors and paid halliburton 254 million over 95 percent of the disputed charges and in spite of theauditors findings halliburton was paid nearly 100 million in profits and bonuses for overbilling taxpayers well halliburton symbolizes what went astray in iraq but it is not the only contractor abusing the system parsons received the c6ntract to rebuild health clinics throughout iraq but despite spending 186 million parsons completed just 20 of 142 health clinics they promised to build another firm custer battles received two security contracts a federal jury recently found that the company committed 37 separate acts of fraud these are not isolated instances there are over 70 corruption investigations currently under way in iraq these cases involve allegations of fraud false claims theft bribery and kickbacks some of the worst problems in iraq are almost beyond comprehension the unitedstates management of the development fund for iraq which was the fund that held the proceeds of iraqi oil sales is a classic example of what not to do the coalition provisional authority handed out over 8 8 billion in cash in cash to iraqi ministries and they had no idea what happened to the money 8 billion in cash simply vanished one former unitedstates official who was in iraq at the time frank willis described conditions as the wild west he said the lack of controls effectively created a free fraud zone iraq was awash in brandnew 100 bills with no accountability to prevent corruption all the while the white house looked the other way and congress put its head in the sand under the constitution we are supposed to be a check and balance but we have abdicated this responsibility the republican majority is terrific at applauding the president and they are proving it again today with this dishonest resolution congress isnt doing the serious and important work it must do to protect our troops rebuild iraq look out for american taxpayers congress must be more than a cheerleading section for the white house the fiasco in iraq was a windfall for some halliburton made more than 2 billion in profits last year its total revenue has increased by 66 percent since 2002 another beneficiary was david brooks he is the ceo of a company that makes bulletproof vests in 2001 mr brooks reportedly earned 525 000 in 2004 he earned 70 million last year the unitedstates marines recalled more than 5 000 of the companys armored vests but by that time mr brooks had pocketed 186 million well the american people might think that congress would rise up in the face of such unconscionable profiteering when our troops are willing to sacrifice so much and they do sacrifice so much how can we let others create cynical fortunes off their blood as we debate this resolution 2 500 of our bravest men and women have been killed in iraq over 18 000 have been wounded and the total cost of the iraq war is over 300 billion those of us privileged to serve here have been spared any of the personal consequences of being on the front line but we should not be spared the responsibility of doing our job we owe more to our troops than slapping i support our troops bumper stickers on our cars and extolling their courage instead of wasting time on bipartisan charades we should acknowledge and fix our mistakes so that iraqis can take over and our troops in iraq can come home we owe more than empty promises to american families who are paying for this costly war in iraq they count on us to make sure that their money is spent well and we havent done that an honest unsparing look at the record of the past 3 years tells us a stark truth the white house and congress have failed our troops the taxpayers and the iraqi people they deserve better than a partisan resolution that pats ourselves and the white house on the back it is shameful that we are squandering money on halliburton at the very same time that we dont have enough money to protect our troops it is shameful that congress has abdicated its oversight and legislative responsibilities to rein in the incompetence and corruption that has undermined our efforts in iraq"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "for a change instead of giving it to bill gates and warren buffet who

laid the foundation for continuing our discussion as it relates to responsibility i can tell the members the ideas that we had here on this floor as it relates to sensible tax policy that will not drive us further into debt what happened today on the floor not because of our votes but because of the majority vote the republican majority they took this country further into debt 0 1700 they made it so we are going to have to change our board here because we are going to be borrowing more money from foreign countries because of the deficit i will say this again president bush with the republican majority i guarantee you he could not do it by himself without the republican majority here in this house has borrowed a recordbreaking mindboggling 1 05 trillion in the last 4 years more than 42 presidents prior to the president taking office 42 presidents republican and democrat some of the gentlemen here on this board were once members of the whig party but i can tell you they were only able to achieve borrowing from foreign nations 1 01 trillion over 224 years this is the same majority and the same president that says that we know exactly what we are doing as it relates to putting this country on the right track well i can tell you members of the congress that i am very very concerned we used to have a discussion about future generations and putting the burden on their back we are putting the burden on this generations back it is going to cost more for kids to go to school it is going to cost more for parents to send their children to school it is going to cost more for those young americans that would like to educate themselves to be able to save enough money to be able to go to college because we cut it by 14 3 billion so i think it is important that we take all of this into account but what i would also like to say in my opening comments i cannot help but commend our democratic leader for her privileged resolution here today outlining a culture of corruption and cronyism and incompetence in washington d c i think it is important that we say that out loud so that individuals understand that we must not only police ourselves in how we conduct business but what we are doing when we haveinvestigations unprecedented here in this congress and investigations over in the white house dealing with national security breaches it is important that we make sure that the american people know exactly what is going on and that we take appropriate action in a bipartisan way right now we are not taking any action there is discussiofi about action and i

budget conference report which stands before this body today sadly this body has just now received a copy of the budget conference report its truly tragic to think that this piece of legislation actually affects every single american and yet here we are inthe peoples house and there is no real deliberation on this monumental bill the budget conference report clearly does not improve upon the severely flawed republican budget which barely passed in the house a little more than a month ago the needs of average americans are still ignored the interests of a wealthy few outweigh the needs of an entire nationin this budget i say this not out of partisanship but from a statement of the facts i want to highlight a few areas in this budget conference report that are particularly egregious this president and the majority party in this body have spent so much time talking about their record on education and as hard as i try i can not see what they have to be proud of it is one thing to address areas of critical need with rhetoric but to advocate a policy and then not fund it sufficiently is plain irresponsible this budget conference report eliminatqs 48 education programs that receive 4 3 billion this year these eliminations include wiping out 1 3 billion for all vocational education programs 522 million for all education technology programs and 29 million for all civic education programs the budget eliminates other large programs including the even start family literacy program 225 million and state grants for safe and drugfree schools and communities 437 million the presidents budget cuts 2006 funding for the department of education by 1 3 billion below the amount needed to maintain purchasing power at the current level and by 530 million below the 2005 enacted level of 56 6 billion this is the first time since 1989 that an administration has submitted a budget that cuts the departments funding this administration and the majority in this congress promised to leave no child behind but clearly they have reneged on their promise our brave american veterans are another group who were outraged by the presidents budget and will unfortunately be disappointed with the budget conference report i hear so much in this body from the majority party about the greatness of our armed forces and their rights but again its just empty rhetoric on their part those brave men and women fighting on the front lines in our war against terror will come back home and find that the republican party looks at them differently once they become veterans almost all veterans need some form of health care some will need drastic care for the rest of their lives because of the sacrifice they made in war but the republican party continues to turn a blind eye to their needs the fact is that 3 2 billion more than the current budget proposal is needed just to maintain the current level of health care programs for veterans the entire department of veterans affairs is going to suffer because of the republican agenda i have heard from veterans groups throughout my district in houston and i am sure each member of this body has heard from groups in their own district because vet erans are one group that come from all parts of this nation these brave veterans have told me their stories of how they are suffering now with the current state of veterans affairs i am going to have trouble telling them that not only will things continue to stay bad but if this budget conference report passes this body things will only continue to get worse that is not what our returning soldiers from iraq and afghanistan should have to look forward to a future where their needs are not only unprovided for but are in fact ignored education and veterans affairs make up only two areas where the budget conference report fails americans the truth is there are many other programs and services vital to our nation that are at risk because of the republican agenda at this point an average american may be asking why the republican party finds it necessary to cut so many fundamental programs the answer is simple yet disturbing the majority party is cutting important programs in order to finance all their irresponsible tax cuts they will continue to make the argument that tax cuts provide stimulus for our economy but millions of unemployed americans will tell you otherwise in fact the congressional budget office itself said tax legislation will probably have a netnegative effect on saving ihvestment and capial accumulation over the next 10 years while the republican party continues its offensive for irresponsible tax policies they allow our national deficit to grow increasingly larger when president bush came into office he inherited a budget surplus of 236 billion in 2000 now however this administration has raided those surpluses and its fiscally irresponsible tax policies have driven the country ever deeper into debt a 5 6 trillion 10year projected surplus for the period 20022011 has been converted into a projected deficit for the same period of 3 9 trilliona reversal of 9 5 trillion much like the presidents budget the budget conference report before us omits the longerterm costs of either the war in iraq or fixing the amt yet still tries to make claims of reducing the deficit it is clear that the republican party is hiding from the american people this president and this majority in congress have yet to advocate a fiscal policy that helps average americans special interests have become king in this budget conference report at the price of sound fiscal policies this body was made to stand for the will of all americans if we allow this budget proposal to take effect we will have failed our mandate i for one wil not stand by silently i have a duty to my constituents and indeed to all americans to work for their well being and i will continue to honor that duty"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "i rise today to commemorate asian pacific american heritage month and to celebrate the lives and accomplishments of asian americans and pacific islanders in unitedstates history i want to thank the gentleman from california chair of the congressional asian pacific american caucus for organizing this special order i thank the gentleman verymuch i represent one of the most diverse congressional districts in our nation with african americans hispanic americans and anglo americans each making up about 30 percent of my los angelesbased district los angeles korea town also in my congressional district is home to 80 000 asian americans who make up roughly 13 percent of my constituency my congressional district includes sony studios capital records american film institute and raleigh studios it is the home of our nations and a great deal of the worlds entertainment industry today i want to address the need for adequate and accurate representation of asian americans in film and television many of my colleagues speaking today have already mentioned the fact that there are over 13 million asian and pacific islanders living in the united states and that by the year 2050 there will be an estimated 33 4 million selfidentified asian americans in the united states however while the asian american and pacific islander communities continue to grow our nations entertainment sector continues to fall behind in recognizing their presence through film and television and their influence in shaping the course of our nation just last week the national asian pacific american legal consortium released a report called lights camera and little action detailing the shortage of asianamerican characters on prime time network television the report finds that while asian americans and pacific islanders make up 5 percent of the united states population they represent only 2 7 percent of regular characters on prime time television the report also finds that virtually no asian actors are cast in situation comedies and the characters they play in dramas tend to have less depth and development than most regulars with minimal onscreen time and few romantic roles for example programs such as king of queens set in a new york city borough features no regular asian characters despite the fact that almost one in five residents of the city are asian americans the show charmed on the network wb also includes no asian actors despite being set in san francisco where a third of the population is asian american such whitewashing of prime time television not only fails to reflect reality it also denies viewers the opportunity to learn about other cultures and the chance to further crosscultural understanding and communication 0l 2130 and finally i think an equally disturbing trend is the studys finding that when aapis are depicted on a television show they are placed in roles that reinforce stereotypes let me give the members an example while the 2000 unitedstates census showed that half of aapi adults do not have college degrees all of the asian american characters on prime time television have professional jobs that often require advanced degrees these are admittedly very positive portrayals and many ethnic groups have railed against their negative portrayals in the media as gang members pimps drug dealers and prostitutes nonetheless any ethnic stereotyping by media even positive stereotyping tends to eliminate the larger publics understanding of the real conditions of the ethnic group the tontributions of asian pacific americans to the growth and success of this nation cannot be overstated the history of their struggle and triumph in the united states must be captured and remembered one of the most effective means of commemoration is through the accurate portrayal of aapi characters in film and television that illuminates their hopes dreams and struggles the aapi communities have played instrumental roles in advancing the freedom and equality of all americans yet we do not see their achievements adequately documented and reflected by the media in commemorating this years asian pacific american heritage month i call on the entertainment industry to further improve their depiction of the aapi communities and urge everyone to remain vigilant about the roles the media play in capturing the shared heritage of asian and pacific islander communities in our nation"],

excellent presentation today today the house is considering the ultimate values debate the question bafore us today is do we want to cut taxes for the ultrasuperrich or instead do we first want to give hardworking americans a raise do we want to live in an aristocracy or do we want to live in a democracy do we want to perpetuate wealth or reward work the estate tax is central to our democracy it is rooted in our commitment to create a strong and vibrant middle class and to give every american the opportunity to achieve the american dream after the gilded age in which the elites of the time held power and wealth that far far far outstripped what the average american had america decided to go in a new direction one of americas great republican presidents theodore roosevelt made the argument for an estate tax saying that the really big fortune the swollen fortune by the mere fact of its size acquires qualities which differentiate it in its kind as well as its degree from what is possessed by men of relatively small means therefore president theodore roosevelt said i believe in a graduated tax on big fortunes properly safeguarded against evasion democrats believe that we must create wealth we recognize that that we must reward entrepreneurship and risk and we must encourage hard work that is why democrats supported a targeted estate tax relief for small businesses and farmers and fami lies that would ensure 99 7 percent of all americans dont pay any estate tax this is in the spirit of theodore roosevelt targeting the vast fortunes that differ not only in the quantity of wealth but in the kind i salute congressman earl pomeroy for his leadership in giving congress an alternative that is morally and fiscally responsible unfortunately once again the republican leadership just as they have blocked a vote on the minimum wage are blocking mr pomeroys option to bring his proposal to the floor which is responsible which is paid for and which is fair to all americans under mr pomeroys proposal only the top 3 percent that means 99 7 percent of americans most people in america would not pay any estate tax but it would leave that 3 percent the very very superwealthy to pay their fair share there are very few people involved but a great deal of money we will have a chance to vote on it in the motion to recommit unfortunately we will not have the time to debate it as an alternative we have these questions that have come before us when we are talking about this we are talking about giving 800 billion to a few families in america democrats stand for fiscal responsibility payasyougo budgets and no new deficit spending republicans instead have put forth the bill that will cost the american people again almost 800 billion 800 billion that we dont have that we are going to have to borrow our national debt is becoming a national security issue countries that now own our debt it is over 1 trillion already and this doesnt include this 800 billion those countries that now own our debt will not only be making our toys our clothes and our computers they will be soon making our foreign policy they have too much leverage over us with this bill today the republicans are giving tax cuts to the wealthy and asking the middle class to pay for it by writing checks to china and japan for the interest payments on the debt and ultimately the payment on principal it isridiculous it is ridiculous let me get this straight we are at war in iraq many of the same people who wanted to support the staythecourse that the president is on in iraq which has around a 400 billion price tag on it that is off budget they dont want to pay for that and that is a huge figure and now the republicans are saying not only that not only are we not paying for the war it is off budget we will just heap that debt on to future generations they are saying we are going to give twice as much as that to a few families in america it is so unfair this same week that we are taking this up as i said earlier this is the ultimate values debate how can a person of conscience say to the congress we do not support an increase in the minimum wage instead we are going to give 800 billion to the wealthiest people in america the minimum wage is 5 15 an hour it hasnt been raised in 9 years this is a shame it is a disgrace it is unfair and what does the leader on the republican side say about the minimum wage mr boehner says i have been in this business for 25 years and i have never voted for an increase in the minimum wage i am opposed to it and i think the vast majority of the republican conference is opposed to it so thank you mr boehner for making a differentiation for us you are for 800 billion for the wealthiest families in america and not an increase of over 5 15 an hour for americas working families so instead of giving 7 millionamericans a raise by increasing the minimum wage again the republicans are proposing 800 billion that is nearly 1 trillion as a gift to the wealthy this is robin hood in reverse we are stealing from the middle class to give to the wealthy pope benedict just recently put out his new encyclical god is love and in his encyclical he quoted saint augustine when he wrote this is in the popes encyclical you can find it there he talked about the role that politicians have and that a government should be just and we should be promoting justice and he goes on pope benedict does to quote saint augustine he says a state that is not governed according to justice would be just a bunch of thieves this is the pope saying this in an encyclical quoting a saint a state which is not governed according to justice would be just a bunch of thieves i ask this congress is it justice to steal from the middle class to give tax cuts to the ultrasuperrich it is not just and it is an injustice we cannot afford americans can no longer afford president bush and the republicans it is time for a new direction we can begin by rejecting this estate tax giveaway to the wealthy and insist on a vote to increase the minimum wage that would be a real values judgment"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "i want to start by thanking the gentleman from new york for reserving the 1 hour of time this evening for the congressional black caucus to make preliminary comments on the presidents proposed budget when the congressional black caucus met with president bush on january 26 we presented a cbc agenda that would close disparities and create opportunity we outlined six areas in which significant barriers exist that prevent african americans from enjoying the same quality of life as white americans we requested the presidents support and asked him to demonstrate it both verbally and substantively unfortunately the budget that the president sent to congress yesterday falls far short of the substantive goals that we hoped the president would have set forth to eliminate disparities the first area we presented to the president was in the area of closing the achievement and opportunity gaps in education in his budget the president proposes eliminating the perkins loan program which provides lowinterest loans to low and middleincome college students this proposal would have disastrous effects on african american college students many of whom rely heavily on federal financial aid programs to offset the cost of obtaining higher education as it is african americans attend college at a lower rate than white americans if the president succeeds in his plan to eliminate the perkins loan program a college education would simply be unaffordable and unattainable for many african american college students african american college enrollment rates are 10 percent lower than white college enrollment rates college graduation rates are even worse for african american students only 46 percent of african american freshmen ever graduate from college compared to 67 percent of white freshmen according to the education trust the typical american college or university has a graduation rate gap between white and african american students of over 10 percentage points a quarter of institutions have a gap of 20 percentage points or more in a recent study by the luna foundation for education the foundation found that the single most important financial variable influencing whether or not a student will attend college is the amount of needbased financial aid being provided in spite of these disparities the president seeks to not only eliminate the perkins loan program but he is proposing to eliminate the gear up and the trio programs as well the sole purpose of the gear up program which our congressional black caucus colleague the gentleman from pennsylvania introduced and the trio program both of those programs are designed to prepare lowincome and disadvantaged students for college in other words the president through his budget wants to eliminate the very programs that would help close the achievement and opportunity gaps in education in fact one out of every three programs that the president proposes to cut or eliminate in his budget is in the department of education so the president has not been responsive at all to the cbc agenda in that area the second area we outlined to the president was in the area of health care providing quality health care for every american the presidents proposed budget slashes at least 45 billion from the medicaid program which provides health coverage to 50 million lowincome children working families seniors and others who would otherwise be uninsured the presidents proposed cuts to medicaid would have devastating effects on the working poor and would have particularly devastating effects on african americans according to families usa african americans are generally less likely to receive employerbased health care because african americans are more likely than whites to work in positions where health care benefits are not offered work for companies typically small companies that cannot afford to pay for employee health insurance and to be unable to afford health insurance premiums when coverage is offered the third area we asked the president to respond to was in the area of economic security building wealth and business employment the african american unemployment rate is consistently more than double the average national average in inner cities that number is even larger yet the president proposes cutting the budget for the department of labor by 4 4 percent including workforce investment act state grants further while the african american homeownership rate is over 20 percentage points behind that of white americans the president proposes cutting funding for the department of housing and urban development by almost 3 7 billion we asked the president to address disparities in foreign policy eradicating poverty hunger and armed conflicts around the world especially in africa and the caribbean which is a major component of the cbcs agenda unfortunately the presidents budget offered no solutions on how to strengthen the economic stability and selfsufficiency of countries in the african diaspora the caucus supports reducing the heavy burden that debt has on many countries and reengaging with the united nations regional organizations and countries throughout the world to help promote civil society global health fair trade and peace while we applaud the president for his proposal to fund the global initiative to fight hiv aids we implore him to also provide financial assistance to end the fighting in african countries that are engaged in civil war and in genocide we asked the president to help address retirement security for african americans and the disparities that exist there during the last several weeks preaftent bush has traveled the country selling his social security reform proposal to the american people because african americans rely heavily on the survivor disability and retirement benefits provided by social security the cbc is extremely interested in the details of this proposal contrary to the presidents claims african americans receive a higher rate of return than whites due to their heavier reliance on the full range of benefits offered by social security the cbc has made it clear to the president that we are against any proposal that would result in future benefit cuts or divert payroll taxes from the social security trust fund african americans are 8 percent of all retired beneficiaries 13 percent of survivor beneficiaries and 18 percent of all disability recipients social security is the only source of retirement income for 40 percent of older americans and if those benefits were reduced the poverty rate for older african americans would double almost overnight social security is one of the most effective programs in the history of the united states and is essential to the livelihood of african americans we asked the president to ensure justice for every american the cbc supports criminal and juvenile justice reform that focuses greater emphasis on prevention and rehabilitation reduces recidivism by successfully reintegrating former inmates into society and ends arbitrary mandatory minimum sentences we also strongly support preserving affirmative action until all the effects of past and present discrimination have been eliminated while the presidents budget does include 75 million for a prisoner reentry initiative much more rehabilitation needs to be done for prisoners while they are in prison in addition we are disappointed to report that the presidents fiscal year budget proposes to cut funding for the justice departments civil rights division even while we all know that more enforcement is necessary and despite that fact our election system does not work properly the presidents budget proposes to eliminate grants to states for election reform in summary the budget that the president sent to congress yesterday reflects priorities and values that are not in line with those held by the majority of american families or by the congressional black caucus today the president told reporters that his budget sets priorities he went on to say our priorities are winning the war on terror protecting our homeland and growing our economy i would say to the president that while we fight the war on terror americas families also want to fight the war on poverty while we protect our homeland we must also ensure that american families are able to buy affordable homes while we must grow our economy we must also provide retirement security for american families in times of economic downturn these mr president are americas priorities i hope the president will work with the congressional black caucus to turn these priorities into realities the following is a summary of some of the draconian cuts that the president has proposed in his budget"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "i want to thank the gentleman from california a member of the blue dog coalition jim costa for joining us this evening the gentleman mentioned the financial report of the united states government for 2005 you pointed out that in that the debt is really not for 2005 it really wasnt 319 billion it was really 760 billion and i just want to make sure that you understand we are not trying to make things sound worse than they really are or make up some numbers or anything the 760 billion deficit for 2005 is contained here in the financial report of the united states of america which was published by john snow president bushs secretary of the treasury now how does this financial report say that the deficit is 760 billion in 2005 when everyone else has been saying it is 319 billion and again there is no reason to make it any worse than it already is it was already one of the largest deficits ever in our nations history there is no reason to try to make it worse but here is a little known fact that very few members of congress are even aware of it is not well published on capitol hill when the budget rolls out you will see them bringing it to capitol hill with a lot of fanfare it is about that thick and several volumes this is quietly brought to capitol hill and not even provided to every member of congress why is that because this is true accounting the difference is that the budget uses cashbase accounting which only the tiniest businesses in america use because it hides future obligations thus painting potentially an unrealistic and misleading picture of the federal governments overall performance that is according to david walker the comptroller general of the government accountability office so when you do cashbase accounting the deficit for 2005 was 319 billion but in this financial report of the united states of america as required by law the treasury secretary has to report what the real debt is the real deficit is based on accrual accounting and accrual accounting is something that most businesses in america are very aware of because it is the method required by law it is the method required by this congress to be used by every business in america with revenues over 5 million this financial report takes into account future obligations of the federal government presenting a clearer more understandable picture of federal finances so the real deficit for 2005 was not the 319 billion contained in the budget using cashbase accounting but rather it was 760 billion as contained in the financial report of the united states government for 2005 issued by the secretary of the treasury john snow as required by law using accrual accounting this is the same accounting method required by this congress for businesses with revenues over 5 million to use and if they dont use the accrual method of accounting they are slapped with all kinds of fines by the irs and in all kinds of trouble with the justice department so i thank the gentleman from california for bringing that to our attention this evening now as i said earlier the blue dog coalition has a plan on how to fix all of this we have a 12point plan for meaningful budget reform i mentioned one of them which is requiring a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget fortynine states require a balanced budget most businesses require a balanced budget and i can assure you in the ross family my wife requires a balanced budget a second idea we have in our 12point plan for curing our nations addiction to deficit spending is dont let congress buy on credit back when president clinton gave us the first balanced budget in 40 years we had something implemented on this house floor called paygo rules pay as you go if you want to fund a new project you have to show us which project you are going to cut if you want to pass tax cuts you have to show us which program you want to cut in other words pay as you go dont continue down this track that we are on today of running up the deficit running up the debt and borrowing money from china and japan and korea and opec to pay for this reckless spending another thing that we are doing as members of the blue dog coalition is we have a plan to restore accountability the author of this plan is a founding member of the fiscally conservative democratic blue dog coalition john tanner of tennessee let me just say that under the united states constitution congress has an obligation to provide congressional oversight of the executive branch congressional oversight prevents waste and fraud ensures executive compliance with the law and evaluates executive perfermance however under this republican leadership congress has abandoned this responsibility by failing to conduct meaningful investigations of allegations of serious waste fraud abuse and mismanagement of taxpayer dollars by failing to serve as a check and balance for overspending waist fraud and financial abuse within the e ecutive branch this republicanled congress has failed the american taxpayer every 24 hours 279 million of your tax money is being spent in iraq but dont ask the president to be accountable for it he will tell you you are unpatriotic that is where i disagree with this president i believe we have a duty and an obligation to be accountable for taxpayer money the current federal debt as you know is 8 346 trillion much of which as we talked about earlier is borrowed from foreign countries this president this administration and this republican congress must be held accountable for our massive federal debt and for the 279 million of tax money that is being spent in iraq every day now as long as we have troops in iraq i want to support them and i want to send money there but i want to make sure that money is accounted for and being spent on our men and women in uniform american taxpayers simply deserve to know how their money is spent they deserve answers as to why their children and grandchildren will have to foot the bill for this administrations fiscal mismanagement of the federal budget and this includes answers as to why the federal emergency management agency continues to pay 250 000 a month to store almost 10 000 mobile homes to be exact as of tonight 9 957 of them at the hope airport in hope arkansas in my congressional district here is an aerial view of it while many victims of hurricane katrina and other storms remain homeless it is past time for fema to be held accountable and provide these new fully furnished mobile homes to the victims of hurricane katrina femas response so far has been oh my goodness they are liable to sink in this pasture as you can see here from a better view and you have to see this to believe it here are the 9 957 mobile homes just sitting in a hay meadow here is the barbed wire fence at the hope airport in hope arkansas instead of moving them to storm victims that have been left homeless from various natural disasters femas response has been oh my goodness the inspector general is right they are liable to start sinking in the hay meadow so now they are spending 6 million putting gravel in this hay meadow at the hope airport in hope arkansas it is time it is time for fema to be held accountable for this mismanagement no business in our country could succeed financially if it failed to fully report back to its shareholders on how it is spending its money but that is exactly how our federal government is operating the administration is not telling its shareholders the american taxpayers how it spends the money coming into washington we have a plan to fix this it is house resolution 841 introduced by representative john tanner a founding member of the fiscally conservative democratic blue dog coalition and at this time i want to call on mr tanner to use as much time as he so desires to explain this bill our solution to try to address this lack of accountability in our government i am real proud that we are not just here to criticize this administration this republican congress but also to offer up a solution at this time i yield to the gentleman from tennessee"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.9999942779541016, 0.9999942779541016, 0, "today the house will undoubtedly vote down this resolution and signal strong support for remaining in the world trade organization this is the right decision to make it is the right decision to make because the wto and its predecessor the gatt have served as a catalyst to reduce both tariff and nontariff barriers for unitedstates exports since the formation of the gatt average tariffs in industrialized countries have gone down from 40 to less than 4 percent since the creation of the wto in 1994 unitedstates exports have increased by 300 billion of course the wto has also served as a useful forum to breakdown barriers to unitedstates agricultural exports where bilateral negotiations could not while i will vote against this repolution today it is not without any reservation i believe the resolution on the floor today provides the ideal time to pause and reflect on the shortcorgings of the current wto system and on ways both the congress and the administration can make changes to the wto structure so that it works better and rebuilds confidence in the system among our constituencies i find the lack of any serious effort to reform the current wto culture and structure to fix the flaws with the unsatisfactory there are a host of problems with the wto and the number of problems is only growing the wto completely lacks any degree of transparency hearings are closed to the pub lic and public transcripts are not released where in a very limited manner wto rules permit limited transparency by allowing the assistance and resources of private parties who h4316 are supportive of the unitedstates government position the administration has chosen not to utilize this allowance transparency is not the only problem contributing to the wtos failure to move rulesbased trade forward globally but it is the central factor allowing the wto and its bureaucrats to escape the scrutiny which would quickly eradicate other abuses in geneva through the lack of transparency the wto dispute settlement and appellate bodies are emboldened to disregard the proper standard of review in disputes involving trade laws for example in this way past wto panels have issued rogue decisions against the unitedstates with no basis or standing in the context of previously negotiated agreements this rampant judicial activism is rapidly undermining the support for the wto as the wto is particularly prone to yankeebashing support for the current broken system is perhaps fading fastest here at home a slew of activist decisions against the unitedstates attacking our trade remedy laws and another decision amounting to micromanagement of unitedstates tax policy have come at a steady pace these decisions have been particularly frustrating to many members of congress because of limited opportunity for oversight by congress of the wto or its decisions which affect our domestic laws and domestic employers i along with several of my ways and means colleagues last congress introduced the trade law reform act this legislation included a provision to establish a wto dispute settlement review commission this commission composed of retired federal judges would report to congress after reviewing wto decisions adverse to the unitedstates in order to determine whether the relevant decision makers failed to follow the applicable standard of review or otherwise abused their mandate today we have spent two hours debating whether congress should withdraw from the wto yet absent a new entity to administer and advance rulesbased trade there is no question that we must remain committed to and engaged in the wto i would submit that instead of debating whether to withdraw from the wto congress should have an active debate on ways we can make the current system work properly as it was designed to do and ways to make it better the unitedstates must move swiftly to put an end to judicial activism in the wto and reorganize the structure and culture of both the appellate body and the dispute settlement body additionally the ustr should deputize private parties with a direct and substantial interest in a case to appear and participate in wto proceedings and devote greater resources to litigation in wto disputes congress must also establish new mechanisms to increase oversight of the wto"], [0.9999908717627477, 9.128237252298277e-06, 1, "for their bipartisan spirit and our colleagues in the other body i am blessed to be on a couple of committees where there is bipartisan spirit at least some of the time and we are able to get a few things done and this is one of them the perkins act aims to prepare youth and adults for the future by building their academic and technical skills in preparation for postsecondary education and or employment the bill we are considering today enhances perkins by ensuring both secondary and postsecondary students participating in the program are acquiring rigorous academic and technical skills and will have the opportunity to transition into further education and or successful employment the perkins act governs widely supported programs of both the secondary and postsecondary level for example nearly all high school students complete at least one vocational education course and approximately 26 percent of students are considered vocational concentrators those students who focus on a single occupational area in my home state of delaware we have five career and technical high schools that enroll a total of 5 500 of the 29 500 total high school students at the postsecondary level the perkins act supports a broad array of options primarily at the community college level including delaware technical community college in the 19992000 school year over 50 percent of all students enrolled at the less than 4year postsecondary level reported that they were majoring in vocational areas todays conference report seeks to build upon reforms made in past reauthorizations and seeks to enhance this popular program to ensure its success in years to come the legislation before us today makes significant reforms to academic achievement and accountability to ensure students have the skills necessary to enter the workforce or continue to an institution of higher learning as i mentioned there are five career and technical high schools in delaware while all these schools met adequately yearly progress under the no child left behind act there is more to be done in academic achievement in these schools and schools across the country today we will improve vocational and technical education by increasing the focus on academics in conjunction with the skill attainment that is incumbent of the program one of the unique attributes of vocational and technical education programs is their ability to show students a path that could end in a certificate credential employment military or postsecondary education the techprep program within the perkins act is intended to focus on a welldefined link between high school and at least 2 years of postsecondary education research has shown however that funds are rarely if ever used to meet this goal rather funds are often used for purposes within the larger vocational and technical education program therefore the conference agreement revises requirements of the program in order to ensure articulation agreements between secondary and postsecondary institutions are in fact being implemented along this same track we include a new requirement for state development of career and technical programs of study for career and technical program areas these sequences of course will incorporate a nonduplicative progression of both secondary and postsecondary elements which will include both academic and vocational and technical content local recipients at both the secondary and postsecondary level would adopt at least one model sequence of courses as developed by the state i believe this will also help drive program improvements by ensuring that states clarify the progression of academic and vocational technical courses needed for the postsecondary education training or employment of a students choice it is clear that we are making some significant and positive changes for the schools and students impacted by this program one of the biggest changes that i think we are making is for congress to finally make the switch from vocational and technical education to career and technical education in my opinion this was an important statement for the congress to make while the president has proposed another avenue for high school reform in the perkins act i believe strongly that the reforms we consider today go a long way in driving program improvement and ultimate success for students across the country the dialogue surrounding high school reform is important and is happening in earnest i trust that the conference agreement will complement these efforts as a result of the changes in the bill i believe it will help states community colleges and other postsecondary education institutions and local educational agencies to better meet the needs of students participating in career and technical education i urge my colleagues to support this report so we may send this bill to the president for his signature i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.9998770952224731, 0.9998770952224731, 0, "i want to thank mr

instruments of her goodness i rise in support of h r 3858 the pets evacuation and transportation standards act which we do refer to as the pets act which congressman lantos and i as cochairmen of the friends of animals caucus introduced this commonsense bill requires state and local preparedness planners to include plans for evacuation of pet owners pets and service animals as has already been described by previous speakers hurricane katrina left so many victims in its wake including an estimated 600 000 animals that either lost their lives or were left without shelter hurricane katrina taught us the hard lesson that as we prepare for future emergencies it is important we incorporate pet owners and their pets in our plans many pet owners had to choose between their safety and the safety of their pets and anyone who owns a pet understands the difficult decisions that they had to make i in order to qualify for federal emergency management agency funding a jurisdiction is required to submit a plan detailing their disaster preparedness plan the pets act would simply require state and local emergency preparedness authorities to plan for how they would accommodate household pets and service animals when presenting these plans to fema animals do not go before people but animals will have a place in this plan the human horror and devastation in louisiana mississippi and alabama was a tragedy we are addressing but it was also heartbreaking to hear stories of forcing evacuees to choose between being rescued or remaining with their pets this bipartisan legislation is necessary because when asked to choose between abandoning their pets or their personal safety many pet owners chose to risk their lives and would continue today to risk their lives and remain with their pets the plight of the animals left behind was truly tragic this is not just an animal protection issue this is a public safety issue roughly twothirds of american households own pets we need to ensure the pets and their pet owners are protected i urge my colleagues to support passage of this legislation i too want to make reference to that young man i guess he was around 7 years old i think of him and think this young man may have lost his home he may have lost everything he owned but he had his pet as long as he had his pet he could deal with it to see this pet being grabbed from him to me it was the height of cruelty that i still have a hard time understanding and appreciating when my mom and dad moved when i was 8 or 9 years old to another place our pet dog mack

everyone to join in extending congratulations to ms slaughter now let me say that i look forward to working in a bipartisan way in the spirit that was outlined by speaker pelosi and i of course will

escorting the new speaker of the house my fellow californian and i am very pleased that we have the first woman the first californian and the first italian american as speaker of the house of

disappointed i am disappdinted as i look at this package that we are about to consider because i do join with you mr speaker pro tempore the distinguished majority leader and speaker pelosi as we have discussed privately and publicly in our quest and i think speaker pelosi put it extraordinarily well focusing on the priorities that we have we are first and foremost americans we are here to do the peoples business and they sent a very strong message last november and i believe we have an opportunity to do just that i will say that i remember very well the opening days of the 104th congress 12 years ago i remember the very heady feeling that came from knowing that for the first time at that juncture in almost half a century we republicans were in the majority of the house of representatives and we were going to do all that we had promised the american people we were that optimistic quite frankly because we didnt knowany better none of us had ever served in the majority and we were blissfully unaware of the pressures and problems associated with trying to govern this institution during the 109th congress the democratic caucus many of whom actually served in the majority before 1995 made a lot of promises about how they would run this place if they ever achieved the majority again of course they unlike republicans in 1994 had the experience of having run this place having served in the majority and i have a great deal of admiration for my colleagues because they know exactly what they are facing knowing that knowing exactly what they would face in the majority they made a commitment to minority rights should they regain the majority and that is why i said i am disappointed the resolutions before us bear very little resemblance to the rhetoric on this floor and on the campaign trail the much ballyhooed commitment to minority rights is virtually nonexistent in the measures before us today they undermine minority rights that were constantly guaranteed when we were in the majority the rights of the minority are undermined their promises are for a delivery date at some later point if we agree to be cooperative according to one member ofi the other side of the aisle and we have as an iou now a wink and a nod and a gentle trust us trust is something that is in short supply in this house and the actions of the incoming majority are based on the package that has been brought before us early last evening certainly less than 24 hours before we are considering it here on the house floor are not doing a lot to bolster our reserves when it comes to the issue of trust despite an oft repeated commitment to provide members with as i said at least 24 hours to review legislation before voting on the floor we received this package at 6 15 last night 6 15 only after that package was delivered to our friends up in the press gallery now despite speaker pelosis principle that we need to return to regular order for legislation including a full committee process of hearings and markups and i quote ms pelosi here when she said we need an open full and fair debate consisting of a full amendment process that grants the minority the right to offer its alternatives including a substitute now we in spite of that great directive that came forward we have a rules package that actually selfexecutes closed rules for bills that havent even been ntroduced and wont even be going through the committee process the section of the package that includes those closed rules is debatable for just 10 minutes this is thd polar opposite the polar opposite of how the republicans opened the 104th congress when our priorities were considered in regular order and under an open amendment process also providing a stark contrast is the fact that we put in place from day one a guaranteed bite at the apple for the minority in the form of a motion to recommit we felt so strongly about the fact that when we were in the minority we were denied that chance so that is why at the be ginning of the 104th congress we put into place that guarantee for the minority but i must remind my democratic colleagues on the rules committee that time and time again they have made clear their view that the motion to recommit is an insufficient opportunity to articulate their alternative that argument was propounded constantly as we were dealing with public policy questions so you can imagine how surprised i was when the speaker recently replied to a reporters question about republican alternatives to the democratic priorities by saying theyll have a motion to recommit even worse than five closed rules is the rollback of one of the most essential elements of transparency that republicans put into place back at the beginning of the 104th congress that is the right to know how a member of a committee votes on legislation this rules package exempts the committee on rules from the requirement to publish the votes of its members on its committee reports something required of every other committee except the ethics committee now in my 12 years as a member of the rules committee majority we took more than 1 300 votes in committee every single one of which was accurately reported in the committees report at best this is a solution in search of a problem at worst it is an attempt to shield the rules committee from the public scrutiny of its actions we were told by the distinguished chair of the rules committee that ethics reform and rules reform were not just election year issues for democrats now sadly this docu ment says something quite different than that promises were made and they are not being kept that is the thing that i find to be most troubling we intend to explain the many inconsistencies for the record and as the debate moves forward at the same time we want to work with our democratic colleagues even with this treatment of minority rights we stand here determined to work in a bipartisan way to confront the challenges that we all know face thi country unfortuilately this rules package shuts us out from the start it is my hope that the promises made will indeed be kept but this package does not inspire a great deal of hope in that they in any way will and so i rise with a great deal of disappointment and a great deal of concern about the first actions that we are taking here with that i reserve the balance of my time"],

claims to attack this bush administration mr joe wilson endorsed senator john kerry in october of 2003 according to media sources mr joe wilson contributed 2 000 to the kerry campaign in the same year the boston globe has reported that mr wilson spoke to the kerry campaign at least once a week during the campaign well he himself has even said that he advised the kerry campaign on foreign policy so now this kerry supporter and adviser is on television pointing fingers at the administration he despises now during my tenure as a judge credibility of witnesses could usually be judged by seeking to learn if the witness had a bias obviously this witness has quite a bias it has also been reported that he and his wife supported albert gore for president against george w bush in 2000 the motive for bias seems to deepen the press has reported mr joe wilson was in fact the last unitedstates diplomat to meet with saddam hussein in 1991 he was also the envoy sent to africa to investigate reports that the iraqi president had tried to buy nuclear material there was it possible he hated president bush so much that it got in the way of his ability to assess the facts and actions and motives of his old acquaintance mr saddam hussein perhaps his intentions were loyal to the security of the united states in 1991 but if that is the case while serving as an official envoy to niger as he claims it appears he brazenly spoke out publicly against our own administration the senate intelligence committee found that mr wilsons report rather than debunking intelligence about purported uranium sales to iraq actually bolstered the case for most intelligence analysis so now it appears that like his favorite former presidential candidate mr wilson is flipflopping the typically softspoken senator pat roberts chair of the senate se lect committee on intelligence was harsh in his condemnation time and again joe wilson told anyone who would listen that the president had lied to the american people that the vice president had lied and that he had debunked the claim that iraq was seeking uranium from africa not only did he not debunk the claim he actually give some intelligence analysts even more reason to believe that it may be true roberts went on to say that it was important for the intelligence committee to declare that much of what wilson said had no basis in fact contrary to what he has said publicly mr wilsons wife a cia employee did recommend him to serve as envoy in 2002 it appears obvious that neither mr wilson nor his wife had conducted themselves properly in the best interest of this country why would a former ambassador privately report inaccurate facts about iraqi officials potential dealings with business men in niger why would his wife float his name to serve as envoy on this trip if they wanted to stay out of the public eye i have come to know people after they retired from being covert agents of the government it seems that the best covert agents are the kind of people who go into a room and when you look around that room you do not notice them they blend in they keep their names off lists so they do not make contributions especially to political figures they keep a low profile they certainly avoid having their picture put in popular magazines it really appears that the wilsons disdain for this administration will likely go down as one of the greats in history but they have been so blinded to something we would call the truth some of our colleagues across the aisle and senate democrats down the hall have embraced this man on little credibility in efforts to harm this administration that is determined to protect us from evil men with evil motivations desiring to destroy our way of life their rhetoric is based on two news storiesboth of which appear to exonerate rove the facts are simple joe wilson said the vice president sent him to niger and that his report was shown to the vice president the senate select committee on intelligence confirmed that rove was right and wilson was wrong the vice president didnt send wilson anywhere karl rove then discouraged a reporter from writing a false story that was based on a false premise promulgated by a lying or blindly prejudiced mr joe wilson the main questions now on the matter should be what else has joe wilson lied about and why is anyone putting him on television perhaps if recommending a blindly prejudiced man to go to niger to do critical research for our country is any indication as to mr wilsons wifes judgment then maybe it is a good thing she has not been trying to be covert for several years"], [0.9996199607849121, 0.9996199607849121, 0, "today i rise to honor those brave american and filipino soldiers who fought side by side during the pacific battles of world

arrived at after considerable effort of a bipartisan group involving both house and senate judiciary committee staff over several months from hearings in the house and from other reports we have learned that current federal law designed to protect animal enterprises have been proven to be reasonably effective in protecting animal enterprises however serious gaps and loopholes have been identified in current law with respect to protecting employees and associates of animal enterprises present law protects employees of an animal enterprise but we have found that employees board members and family members of businesses and nonprofits affiliated with or doing business with such enterprises are complaining that they are now being stalked harassed intimidated or threatened with some individuals even being physically assaulted and had their homes businesses or cars vandalized since the animal enterprise terrorism law was enacted in 1992 there have been some1 100 complaints of such incidents with property losses reported of being more than 120 million those complaining include farmers scientists biomedical and biotechnology industries research universities teaching hospitals financial institutions magazines newspapers and other advertising groups and others who are viewed as assisting or enabling targeted animal enterprises the evidence is that in many instances extremist elements among the animal rights groups are taking advantage of the fact that the animal enterprise laws do not cover affiliates and associates by using threats harassment intimidation and fear and other extreme tactics to pressure them into severing their activities with such enterprises s 3880 is designed to cover these gaps or loopholes by providing to employees businesses and associates of animal enterprises similar protections to those already covered in other words the bill prevents a person from doing indirectly to an animal enterprise what they are prohibited to do directly now citizens engaging in legitimate animal enterprise activities and anyone associated with them are entitled to be protected from criminal acts and to be able to go about their daily a tivities free from threats to their person or property and that of their family and associates state laws are generally good at providing those protections however the interstate nature of the planning and execution of the criminal harassment tactics used by some individuals or groups skilled at exploiting gaps or weaknesses in the laws have made it difficult for states to get at problems effectively that is why this bill is deemed necessary while we must protect those engaged in animal enterprises we must also protect the right of those engaged in first amendment freedoms of expres sion regarding such enterprises it goes without saying that first amendment freedoms of expression cannot be defeated by statute however to reassure anyone concerned with the intent of this legislation we have added in the bill assurances that it is not intended as a restraint on freedoms of expression such as lawful boycotting picketing or otherwise engaging in lawful advocacy for animals in addition we also wanted to recognize that there are some who conscientiously believe that it is their duty to peacefully protest the operation of animal enterprises to the extent of engaging in civil disobedience if a groups intention were to stage a sitin or liedown or to block traffic to a targeted facility they certainly run the risk of arrest for whatever traffic trespass or other laws they may be breaking but they should not be held more accountable for business losses due to causes such as delivery trucks being delayed any more than a boycott or protest against any other business to violate the provision of the bill one must travel or otherwise engage in interstate activity with the intent to cause damage or loss to an animal enterprise while the losses of profits lab experiments or other intangible losses are included it must be proved that such losses were specifically intended for the law to be applied if there is no damage or economic loss or damage or loss is less than 10 000 the offense is a misdemeanor not a felony this bill does not satisfy everyone but it does represent a reasonable compromise in protecting employees and associates of animal

department of homeland security to develop acquire and deploy the global nuclear detection architecture to prevent nuclear material from being smuggled into our country the office coordinates with a variety of public and private sector organizations including the departments of defense energy and state the fbi state local and tribal governments the office is jointly staffed by experts from many of these agencies as the ranking member of the homeland security subcommittee on the prevention of nuclear and biological attack i have to say i am kept awake at night by the fear that a terrorist could smuggle nuclear material across our borders to detonate a bomb in one of our cities these radiation detectors are our last best chance to prevent a catastrophic nuclear or radiological attack and our intelligence analysts tell us the threat is very real the dndo is already in the process of deploying radiation detectors at our border crossings ports and other points of entry they have a goal of deploying more than 3 000 of these detectors by 2009 but i believe the risk is too great to wait until 2009 worse yet a recent gao report stated that the dndo could not even meet the 2009 goal without additional funding an additional 36 million will help speed the deployment and the development of radiation portal monitors handheld and mobile radiation detectors and the next generation advanced spectroscopic portals which all provide a varying range of detection capability i have great faith in the dndo but they need sufficient resources to complete their vital mission every year we spend more than 9 billion in missile defense surely we can spend an additional 36 million to prevent nuclear smuggling which intelligence analysts insist is a far greater threat earlier this afternoon
