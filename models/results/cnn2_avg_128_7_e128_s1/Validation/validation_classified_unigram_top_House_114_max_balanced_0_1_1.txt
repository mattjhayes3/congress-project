conference report on h r 22 the surface transportation reauthorization and reform act of 2015 which provides for what used to be the customary sixyear reauthorization of surface transportation programs to provide certainty and stability to the needed effort to repair rebuild and revitalize the nations crumbling infrastructure the senate amendment to the conference report on h r 22 the surface transportation reauthorization and reform act of 2015 passed by a vote of 6534 nearly a twothirds majority while the version of the bill passed by the house version of the bill which included two jackson lee amendments passed by an overwhelming bipartisan majority of 36364 i reluctantly support this emergency but temporary measure because as the department of transportation has reported if we do not act now highway trust fund balances will reach dangerously low levels by november 20 and result in a reduction of payments to states by an average of 28 percent many states have already canceled or delayed planned construction projects threatening 700 000 thousands of jobs including 106 100 jobs in my home state of texas the highway trust fund was created in 1956 during the eisenhower administration to help finance construction of the interstate highway system which modernized the nations transportation infrastructure and was instrumental in making the united states the worlds dominant economic power for two generations our national leaders then understood that investing in our roads and bridges strengthened our economy created millions of goodpaying jobs and improved the quality of life for all americans it is currently composed of two accounts that fund federalaid highway and transit projects built by states federal funding from the trust fund accounts for a major portion of state transportation spending the highway trust fund is financed by gasoline and diesel taxes which until the last decade produced a steady increase in revenues sufficient to accommodate increased levels of spending on highway and transit projects however those tax rates18 4 cents gallon federal tax on gasoline and a 24 4 cents gallon tax on diesel fuelhave remained unchanged since 1993 and were not indexed to inflation so the value of those revenues has eroded over the years and combined with the fact that vehicles have been getting increasingly better mileage the revenues deposited into the highway trust fund beginning last decade have not kept pace with highway and transit spending from the trust fund consequently since 2008 congress has periodically had to transfer at the 11th hour general treasury revenues into the trust fund to pay for authorized highway and transit spending levels and avoid a funding shortfall the total amount to date is more than 74 billion obviously this practice is economically inefficient and injects uncertainty in the highway construction plans projects and schedules of state and local transportation agencies not to mention the anxiety it causes to workers and businesses who economic livelihood is dependent on those projects the last transportation authorized by congress for 4 years or more safetealu expired on september 30 2009 at the end of fy 2009 because congress and the administration could not agree to a new reauthorization it was necessary to resort to stopgap temporary extensions on no less than eight occasions spanning a period of 910 days before congress finally enacted the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act map21 act on july 6 2012 which reauthorized highway and transportation programs through fiscal year 2014 a little more than two years or until september 30 2014 map21 was intended as a shortterm measure to give congress and the administration breathing room to reach agreement on a longterm reauthorization bill yet as mr levin the ranking member of the ways and means committee has often pointed out since gaining the majority in 2010 our republican colleagues have failed to take any action to sustain the highway trust fund over the longterm and shore up vital infrastructure projects and has not held even a single hearing on financing options for the highway trust fund it is long past time for this congress and especially the house majority to focus on the real problems and challenges facing the american people and one of the biggest of those challenges is ensuring that america has a transportation policy and the infrastructure needed to compete and win in the global economy of the 21 st century to do that we have to extend the reauthorization of current transportation programs and to authorize the transfer of the funds to the highway trust fund needed to fund authorized construction projects and keep 700 000 workers including 106 100 in texas on the job but that is only a start and just a part of our job the real work that needs to be done in the remaining days of this congress is to reach an agreement on h r 22

a bipartisan way in our democratic caucus for years irans rapidly accelerating enrichment capability and burgeoning nuclear stockpile has represented one of the greatest threats to peace and security anywhere in the world we all stipulate to that that is why we need an agreement that is why i am so pleased that we have so many statements of validation from people the experts say this agreement is one of the greatest diplomatic achievements of the 21st century it is no wonder that such a diverse and extraordinary constellation of experts have made their voices heard in support of thisagain i

and admirals and diplomats by the scoredemocrats republicans and nonpartisan we heard from our most distinguished nuclear physicists we heard from those scientists and we heard from people of faith i would like to quote some of them more than 100 democratic and republican former diplomats and ambassadors wrote in our judgment the jcpoa deserves congressional support and the opportunity to show that it can work we firmly believe that the most effective way to protect unitedstates national security and that of our allies and friends is to ensure that toughminded diplomacy has a chance to succeed before considering other more risky alternatives that is the diplomats the generals and admirals wrote there is no better option to prevent an iranian nuclear weapon if the iranians cheat our advanced technology intelligence and the inspections will reveal it and unitedstates military options remain on the table and if the deal is rejected by america the iranians could have a nuclear weapon within a year the choice is that stark twentynine of our nations most prominent nuclear scientists and engineers wrote we consider that the joint comprehensive plan of action the united states and its partners negotiated with iran will advance the cause of peace and security in the middle east and can serve as a guidepost for future nonproliferation agreements i quote and can serve as a guidepost for future nonproliferation agreements this is an innovative agreement with much more stringent constraints than any previously negotiated nonproliferation framework they went on to say more 440 rabbis urged congress to endorse the statement writing the obama administration has successfully brought together the major international powers to confront iran over its nuclear ambitions the broad international sanctions move iran to enter this historic agreement they urge support 4 100 catholic nuns wrote to congress stating as women of faith followers of the one who said blessed are the peacemakers we urge that you risk on the side of peace and vote to approve the iran nuclear deal treasury secretary jack lew warned of the hazards of rejecting the agreement reminding us that foreign governments will not continue to make costly sacrifices at our demand i say this in response to something that my distinguished colleague from california said indeed they would be more likely to blame us for walking away from a credible solution to one of the worlds greatest security threats and would continue to reengage with iran he went on to say instead of toughening the sanctions the decision by congress to unilaterally reject the deal will end a decade of isolation of iran and put the united states at odds with the rest of the world we certainly dont want to do that today something very interesting happened it was a statement put forth by u k prime minister david cameron french president francois hollande and german chancellor angela merkel they wrote an oped for the washington post and said this is an important moment it is a crucial opportunity at a time of heightened global uncertainty to show what diplomacy can achieve this is not an agreement based on trust or any assumption about how iran may look in 10 or 15 years it is based on detailed tightly written controls that are verifiable and longlasting they went on to say we condemn in no uncertain terms that iran does not recognize the existence of the state of israel and the unacceptable language that irans leaders use about israel israels security matters are and will remain our key interests too we would not have reached the nuclear deal with iran if we did not think that it removed a threat to the region and the nonproliferation regime as a whole we are confident that the agreement provides the foundation for resolving a conflict on irans nuclear program permanently this is why we now want to embark on the full implementation of the joint comprehensive plan of action once all national procedures are complete our own president wrote to congressman jerry nadler i believe that jcpoa which cuts off every pathway iran could have to a nuclear weapon and creates the must robust verification regime ever

their elected representatives in the normal process despite the various myths circulating about tpa i sincerely believe that it is not in the best interest of our nation as written at this time you have heard it said that a vote against tpa is a vote against international trade but actually a vote against tpa is a vote for a better construct and trade agreement i am a strong supporter of trade when deals are negotiated strategically in the best interest of the united states economically militarily and diplomatically with the president leaving office in just months i have serious concerns about the rapid pace and content of any deal that could have decades of implication many have said tpa will strengthen our international relationships and that may be but while tpa would fasttrack the transpacific partnership in specific currently being negotiated by the president with 11 other pacific nations i am not convinced that this is a partnership that must be done in haste before the president leaves office we currently trade with 6 of the 11 other members our vital yet delicate relationship with chinaa country not included in the transpacific partnershipwould likely be damaged by a rivalry for economic influence in the region the transpacific partnership rewards nations with serious human rights violations while slighting our faithful trade partners with shared values in europe while i support the lifting of trade barriers and promoting better standards of living i believe we must do the right track not the fast track others have claimed tpa will strengthen national security on this point we should take careful note the president has used dangerous and isolating language regarding china with words coming from the white house like hegemony and containment to ask

cold war ii the trade promotional authority can be granted and trade agreements inked without making china excluded or worse our enemy we need to use the next 20 months to repair the relationships as we move towards better trade agreements the trade promotional authority some say gives congress a seat at the negotiating table but the tpa allows congress to set broad objectives for negotiationand that comes at a high price under the trade promotional authority congress sacrifices its authority to make any changes on the final deal and they are left with a simple yes or no vote i believe the american people deserve their voice in trade agreements which impact all of our livelihoods and affect all of our families finances and while trade is vital to economic opportunity and our international friendships i cannot support granting the president permission in light of these concerns with trade promotional authority america has long been fascinated with china from the time of columbus who sought to find a western approach to china and instead discovered america we have been drawn to its ancient culture and its people the earliest american vessel pulled into a canton port in 1748 forty years later we began free trade with the cantonese the first mention of china obtaining a favored nation status was actually as early as 1844 when we signed the treaty of wanghia the way seemed open to engage china and her market but there were concerns wrote one negotiating diplomat regarding this treaty it is the most uncivilized and remote of all nations it is in an isolated place outside the pale solitary and ignorant not only are the people entirely unversed in the forms of edicts and laws but if the meaning be rather deep they would probably not even be able to comprehend it would seem that we must make our words somewhat simple what is amusing is that the diplomat was chinese and his comments were directed toward the united states china moved ahead slowly and cautiously with its relations with the west the interplay of western covetousness with chinese reluctance kept the door to china at a mere crack european attempts to force the crack with opium and acquisition of port cities broadened the natural distrust unlike demands of europe though the united states wanted trade not territory unitedstates ambassador burlingame was able to secure the first treaty that china ever made with any western nation in 1861 and china was regarded as an equal chinese workers began to flock to the united states and literally began to move mountains in california as economic opportunity thrived unfortunately the goodwill of lincoln faded in just one generation the plundering of chinese port cities by european competitors changed how americans began to view china the flood of chinese immigrants to california became an easy target for any setback on its economic ascent equals were now called coolies racism reached such a height that in 1882 the united states congressthis bodypassed and the president signed the first ever act that excluded a specific race on immigration we did not even make any pretense about it calling it the chinese exclusion act the provisions remained in effect for nearly 60 years as these events played out commodore perry of the united states navy entered tokyo in 1850 and demanded that japan open up the japanese obliged japan embarked on a stunning modernization program where china was reluctant in an incredible span of only 50 years japan adopted western technology governance law industry and military doctrines her rise from mystic feudalism to world power alarmed the west in response the goodwill of lincoln towards china would take hold again in the form of his youthful personal secretary john hay now an older wiser and towering figure of respect serving as the secretary of state in 1900 hay saw the best way to compete with japan would be to open up china to trade while protecting her territory hays opendoor policy was widely heralded across the globe as the solution to imperial japanese ascendancy this would have longlasting implication but one important side effect was to restore unitedstates chinese relations hay even secured a guarantee from japan in 1908 to respect chinas open door independence and territory it would last only 7 years as china moved to become more enlightened to the west with sun yatsens revolution in selfgovernance in china imperial japan made what was known as the 21 demands during world war i great britain and unitedstates secretary of state william jennings bryan moved quickly to prevent japan from attempting to make china its own protectorate americanchinese relations warmed even further when the united states declared chinas right to autonomy with tariffs and trade in 1928 as oncewarm japanese relations with the united states turned sour over imperial japanese policy in china regarding manchuria america established what became the stimson doctrine which refused to recognize japanese acquisitions in china and upheld chinas rights to its own sovereignty the 1930s saw a mercurial imperial japan plunder china pull out of the league of nations and commit horrific atrocities in nanking and hong kong the unitedstates responded by calling for a global quarantine against japan in defense of china in 1937 chinas own struggles internally with mao zedongs communists paled in comparison to losing its industrial heart and its coast to the imperial japanese army by 1941 america was sending lendlease war material and economic aid to china in her defense american volunteer pilots cut dashing figures as they flew american p40 warhawks for the chinese air force as the famed flying tigers ultimately americas defense of china led it to be attacked at pearl harbor and resulted in a brutal pacific and chinese theater of war during world war ii the united states committed an entire effort in china with vinegar joe stilwell as the commanding general the building of the burma road and by training equipping and launching a chinese army to attack japanese forces immigration restrictions that were imposed in 1882 were now finally repealed america had sympathy for chinas struggle by wars end china was an important partner and ally her struggle did not end however ripped again internally by civil war once the japanese were defeated china would be led by mao zedong and the communist party the united states did not recognize communist china but neither did it materially aid fleeing nationalist chinese on the continent a period of isolation and strained relations with the united states began once again under mao in 1949 china began to arm communists in french indochina the unitedstates became embroiled in a deadly struggle with north korea and countered her assault in the south with an attack that pushed them all the way north to the yalu river on the chinese border alarmed china struck back for the first time since 1900 americans and chinese were fighting each other by 1953 an uneasy line had settled on the korean peninsula chinese relations remained cool with the west but were not always promising with the soviet russia when the unitedstates fought in vietnam china continued to arm and send troops to the communist government of ho chi minh then a series of odd events from 1969 to 1971 brought americans and chinese back to warmer relations in the most unlikely way when soviet russia attacked outposts on the northern border of china mao zedong reassessed relationships with the united states he reasoned that china could not be isolated by both world powers overtures from president nixon in his inaugural address and a series of pingpong matches created dialogue for the first time in decades in 1971 henry kissinger

government cracked down on dissidents in tiananmen square the unitedstates alarmed imposed sanctions and restrictions tensions loomed through the 1990s culminating with the unitedstates bombing of the chinese embassy in belgrade serbia in 1999 during the kosovo campaign calmer heads prevailed and tensions eased by 2001 trade restrictions were loosened once again china pledged a deep commitment to fight the war on terror and committed material aid in great amounts for the effort by 2006 chinaunitedstates relations deepened under the strategic economic dialogue business in both countries

the united states really wish to believe that we can leave a capabilitiesbased military to create some new threatbased military and it would be in our favor while china is not our enemy we could

bulbs that meet the standard i have bought them myself they are the same as the old bulbs except that they last longer they use less electricity and they save consumers money we have heard for years that the energy efficiency standards restrict consumer choice but if you have shopped for light bulbs lately you know that simply isnt true modern incandescent bulbs compact fluorescent light bulbs and leds of every shape size and color are now available consumers have never had more choice the efficiency standards spurred innovation that dramatically expanded options for consumers critics of the efficiency standards claimed that they would cost consumers money in fact the opposite is true when the standards are in full effect the average american family will save about 100 every year that comes to 13 billion in savings nationwide every year but this rider threatens those savings and that is why consumer groups have consistently opposed this rider here is the reality the 2007 consensus energy efficiency standards for light bulbs were enacted with bipartisan support and continue to receive overwhelming industry support unitedstates manufacturers are already meeting the efficiency standards the effect of the rider is to allow foreign manufacturers to sell old inefficient light bulbs in the united states that violate the efficiency standards that is unfair to domestic manufacturers who have invested millions of dollars in the united states in those plants to make efficient bulbs here that meet the standards why on earth would we want to pass a rider that favors foreign manufacturers who ignore our laws and penalizes unitedstates manufacturers who are following our laws but it even gets worse the rider now poses an additional threat to unitedstates manufacturing the bipartisan 2007 energy bill requires the department of energy to establish updated light bulb efficiency standards by january 1 of next year it also provided that if final updated standards are not issued by then a more stringent standard of 45 lumens per watt automatically takes effect incandescent light bulbs currently cannot meet this backstop standard this rider blocks doe from issuing the required efficiency standards and ensures that the backstop will kick in ironically it is this rider that could effectively ban the incandescent light bulb the burgess rider directly threatens existing light bulb manufacturing jobs in pennsylvania ohio illinois across our region it would stifle innovation and punish companies that have invested in domestic manufacturing this rider aims to reverse years of technological progress only to kill jobs increase electricity bills for our constituents and worsen pollution it is time to choose common sense over rigid ideology and it is time to listen to the manufacturing companies consumer groups and efficiency advocates who all agree that that rider is harmful i urge all members to vote no on the burgess light bulb rider no matter

very hard on this bill but many of us have difficulties with it we dont have difficulties with the end goal with what we want to accomplish we have difficulties by the way this is done this seems again more to us like embarrassing the president calling him names than really putting our heads together in a collaborative way and really doing something that will hold irans feet to the fire so i believe in the old adage that politics should stop at the waters edge when we are talking about foreign affairs that is why i love the foreign affairs committee our nations security and our interests abroad are too important to let partisan politics get in the way ninetynine times out of 100 the foreign affairs committee operates in that spirit and this bill is an exception to that i think the lack of input from both sides of the aisle the lack of time the foreign affairs committee didnt spend working on it is reflected in the final product i am not pointing a finger at anybody again i think mr russell is sincere about this i think we want the same thing this bill is deeply flawed it would force the president to meet an impossible standard on an issue where congress had already spoken that is no way to advance our interests abroad that is no way to hold iran accountable so lets vote down this bill go back to the drawing board and come back with bipartisan legislation that would actually help us achieve our aims i urge a no vote again the question here is not whether iran can be trusted they cannot iran is a bad player three people on this side of the aisle who spoke against this bill voted against the jcpoa so it is not a matter of just trying to rubberstamp what the administration wants or anything like that no we dont think that this bill goes in the right direction we dont want to embarrass the president we want to work with the president to make sure that irans feet are held to the fire again we had the vote on the iran deal i voted no my friends on that side of the aisle voted no but we lost so lets not repeat what we have done with the affordable care act 62 times again and again and again playing gotcha with the president lets do something that really works lets put our heads together to make it work we can take parts of this bill and put it together into a bipartisan bill i am not opposed to that but we have got to do it together politics need to stop at the waters edge so lets now work together to ensure that iran is complying with the jcpoa that would be a positive step forward lets hold their feet to the fire lets make sure they do what they are supposed to do because i dont trust them anymore than anybody on that side of the aisle so i urge a no vote lets go back to the drawing board lets do what the foreign affairs

last resort and only to preserve that liberty most of the republican presidential candidates have attacked president obama for acting in some ways that are unconstitutional and he has but where in our constitution does it give us the authority to run other countries as we have been doing in iraq and afghanistaneven making small business loans and training local police forces my republican party was always the party of fiscal conservatism yet with a national debt of over 18 trillion how can we justify continually spending megabillions in religious civil wars between the shia and sunni some people and companies that make money off of an interventionist foreign policy always very quickly fall back on the slur of isolationism but most conservatives believe in trade and tourism and cultural and educational exchanges with other countries and in helping out during humanitarian crises we just dont believe in endless war we are told if we dont support an interventionist foreign policy that this means we dont believe in american exceptionalism but this nation did not become exceptional because we got involved in every little war around the globe it became exceptional because of our great free enterprise system and because we gave our people more individual freedom than any other country i have said in thousands of speeches that we are blessed beyond belief to live in this country and that
