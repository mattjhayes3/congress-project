hurricane katrina americans came together when needed thats why its so sad to see house republicans draft a budget reconciliation bill that carries dangerous implications for millions of americans and will fundamentally erode our shared values of course this is nothing more than political theater because authorization for budget reconciliation has to pass both the house and senate which it hasnt but that hasnt stopped the house republican majority from trying to deem it to be so therefore the republican majority has directed six house committees to use this reconciliation ruse to find drastic and damaging investment cuts not to reduce the deficit mind you but to prevent any cut in military spending which they originally agreed to and to give the richest 1 percent yet another big tax cut last year congress agreed in a bipartisan fashion after the majority brought us to the brink of default to cut 2 1 trillion from federal deficits establishing automatic cuts designed to be universally painful to encourage us to reach an agreement on a longterm deficit reduction proposal that more equitably spreads the burden a bipartisan majority of the supercommittee including every senate republican did come up with just such a plan to put everything on the tablespending cuts revenue increases entitlement reformbut it needed a supermajority and sadly every republican house member on that committee voted no which leaves us where we are today facing damaging automatic cuts to defense and nondefense spending but republican reconciliation ruses wont stop the automatic cuts to the nations seniors and disadvantaged it doubles down on the pain the republican reconciliation ruse literally takes food out of the mouths of needy children and senior citizens it eliminates social services block grants providing assistance to states and localities across the nation to serve millions of disadvantaged americans it ends the meals on wheels program for 1 7 million seniors it guts the supplemental nutrition assistance program formerly known as food stamps that serves 46 million of our fellow americans every month under their plan 1 8 million people would lose the most basic of assistance in addition 300 000 lowincome children lose their free and reduced lunches at school this reconciliation ruse once again singles out federal employees for ever more sacrifices federal workers already have contributed 60 billion to deficit reduction through a 2year pay freeze theyve contributed another 15 billion through recent changes to their retirement system the ryan budget demands an additional 3year pay freeze the new proposal goes further and cuts paychecks by 5 percent to shift more of the burden to employees this draconian measure would add another 79 8 billion in the sacrifice put on the backs of federal workers more than double the 75 billion theyve already made the reconciliation ruse actually will increase health care costs for millions of american families it eliminates tax credits that help lowerincome families maintain affordable health insurance premiums in fact 350 000 people will actually lose their health insurance with their plan of course the one glaring omission in the republican reconciliation ruse is not surprisingly revenue while millions of lower and middleincome families are being forced to sacrifice what do republicans ask of the wealthiest 1 percent nothing over the last 4 years oil and gas companies made a profit of 290 billion private companies should make profits and its a good thing but in that same time frame they lobbied to keep their 16 billion in tax breaks representing less than 6 percent of their profits but it sure would make sure a lot of hungry kids go to bed with full bellies at night the ryan budget actually seeks to cut the top income tax bracket from 35 percent to 25 percent who pays the current top tax bracket those making more than 388 000 each year not only are they not asked to join in any of the shared sacrifice but theyre actually offered a new christmas present early just for them its time to call the republican budget plan what it is an outright attack on american values how else do you explain shifting the burden from partisan priorities entirely to the middle class and those who are less fortunate thats never been an american value i urge my colleagues to reject this ruse to reject the reconciliation process and to work toward a comprehensive and responsible and bipartisan deficit agreement reflective of our nations values"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "as the gentleman rises i ask myself the question and i ask this body who will speak for the children and thats why my amendment attempts to fully fund the women infants and children program that provides food for the nations children it provides federal grants to states for supplemental foods nutrition education and health care referrals to lowincome pregnant and postpartum women infants and children up to 5 years old we must remember that children have always been the largest category of wic participants of the 8 7 million people who received wic benefits each month in fiscal year 2008 about 4 33 million were children and 2 2 million were infants this bill cuts 650 million out of wic and i am so glad my good friend from georgiaand i appreciate his friendshipjust got up and said the agricultural research service is pretty darn well funded 900 million i am simply asking to address the question of the staggering devastation of malnutrition in our children and i have indicated that when you look at worldwide numbers malnutrition can kill but here in the united states there are children that go to bed hungry there are women that do not eat properly there are babies that do not get nourishment in texas alone between 23 000 and 40 000 people are expected to be dropped from the wic program if the funding is not restored and each and every state in the union is going to receive that kind of devastating impact can you imagine 40 000 women infants and children not being able to eat because we wont restore full funding texas has three of the top 40 districts with the highest national food hardship rates and in the 18th congressional district there are 159 000 food insecure people the food insecurity rate is 23 percent and texas stands 32 in the nation out of 435 districts we are 32 in food insecurity so let me just say alongside of obesity eating wrong we have to face the actual question of hunger children who are served by the wic program in texas are less likely to eat fast food in comparison to children who are not in this program again i want you to look at this picture healthy children need to eat healthy and i ask my colleagues why in fact would we not want to fully fund the program of women and infant children i will say that the impact of not eating healthy is obesity and poor health this healthy baby healthylooking baby has a future that is undetermined when you have an issue of lack of healthy food and access to such so 650 million when were in essence funding research for 900 million i believe you can share a little because the wic program is beneficial in helping the most vulnerable in our country i ask the question who will speak for the children it is important that the wic program 9 2 million through 10 000 clinics among this group 4 9 million children 2 1 million infants and 1 million women have the ability to be served around the nation its a complementary program having healthy mothers healthy pregnant mothers to give birth to healthy babies to raise healthy children not obese nourished and ready to be leaders in this nation who are we if we are not going to speak for our children and i ask my colleagues to consider waiving procedural issues to ensure that children are served i believe that is an important issue and in my district in the 18th congressional district with 1 000 census tracts of people who are food insecure i am arguing vigorously for the full funding of the wic program to help our women our infants and their children who will speak for our children what will their future be and how will they lead this country if we do not invest with them today i ask my colleagues to support this amendment i rise today in support of my amendment to h r 2112 agriculture rural development food and drug administration and related agencies appropriations act 2112 as it restores full funding to the women infant and children wic program as the founder of the childrens caucus and a member of the womens caucus i have firmly stood in support of the nutritional needs of our nations families as a country we must protect and safeguard the health and nutrition of our nations lowincome families women infant and children wic provides federal grants to states for supplemental foods nutrition education and health care referrals to lowincome pregnant and postpartum women infants and children up to age 5 who are found to be at nutritional risk during the final quarter of fiscal year 2009 the number of women infants and children receiving wic benefits each month reached approximately 9 3 million we must remember that children have always been the largest category of wic participants of the 8 7 million people who received wic benefits each month in fiscal year 2008 about 4 33 million were children and 2 22 million were infants wic is essential because it affords many women especially women of color in lower income brackets the opportunity to care for themselves and their newborns after birth without programs such as wic many mothers would not be able to maintain a healthy lifestyle during pregnancies and after childbirth because of wic mothers can afford the nutritional foods they need to sustain their pregnancies and avoid miscarriages stillbirths and defects caused by malnourishment during pregnancy today i am proud to support a full restoration of funding to wic this program which is distinctly american demonstrates that we place a high value on feeding our nations children and tending to the needs of our nations poor thomas jefferson wrote in the declaration of independence that we are endowed with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed i believe that it is no coincidence that life is listed firstfor without it the founders realized no other rights can be realized over many years the millions of americans who could not access medical services were denied their right to lifea life with access to quality and affordable health care let me set the record straight wic is good for the american people and will go a long way in ensuring access to quality and affordable care to those millions of americans who will need access to proper nutrition wic helps to ensure that our country will not succumb to one of the most staggering causes of death in children around the world malnutrition malnutrition remains a significant problem worldwide particularly among children it should not be a problem within the united states that is why we have programs like wic according to the united nations world food programme severe acute malnutrition affects an estimated 20 million children under the age of five worldwide and is responsible in whole or in part for more than half of all deaths of children malnutrition kills approximately one million children each year or an average of one every thirty seconds this is not the direction we want to take the united states when i stand here today and reflect upon what we are about to embark upon i cannot help but think of some of the last words that the great senator ted kennedy shared in his letter to president obama the senator said and so because of your obamas vision and resolve i came to believe that soon very soon affordable health coverage will be available to all in an america where the state of a familys health will never again depend on the amount of a familys wealth and while i will not see the victory i was able to look forward and know that we willyes we willfulfill the promise of health care in america as a right and not a privilege well senator your lifes work shall today be proven to not be in vain i continue to stand by protecting the health needs of low income families and yes this program ensures the health of infants and children will never again depend on the amount of their familys income in the words of the great president john f kennedy the voters selected us in short because they had confidence in our judgment and our ability to exercise that judgment from a position where we could determine what were their own best interests as a part of the nations interest while my colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem to believe that without a cut to wic this will harm americans nothing could be further from the truth this bill is indeed in their best interests there are 110 million schoolaged children suffering from hunger every day and they are counting on americas leadership and generosity to provide them with an opportunity to break the cycle of poverty the wic program provides that leadership and generosity and it is for this reason that i urge my colleagues to join me in voting for restoring full funding to wic in the words of the great civil rights leader dr martin luther king jr we have also come to this hallowed spot to remind america of the fierce urgency of now we cannot wait we will not wait to protect the lives of our children we can not delay in providing the most vulnerable citizens of this great nation access to proper nutrition"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "i appreciate it let me just say breast cancer accounts for one in four cancer diagnoses among women the american cancer society estimates that in 2011 more than 26 000 african american women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and another 6 000 will die this impacts all women of all backgrounds and my interest is to make sure that every subset has a seat at the table chairman young so that no matter what ethnic background you come from you will not in essence suffer the opportunity for full research my amendment was 500 000 it is in tribute to the honor and the leadership and the life of yolanda williams i would like to ask my colleagues here on the appropriations committee to allow me to engage with you and to possibly modify as we go forward language to just say that this money will be available for difficult strains of cancer so that her life will be honored and that we would be able to move forward in conclusion i would indicate that i had the privilege and honor of paying tribute to ms williams at her homegoing service i want to offer to her family again her husband her children her mother and all her family members my deepest sympathy for this valiant american woman with that i know that we will work together mr chair i rise today in support of my amendment 67 to h r 2219 the fy2012 department of defense appropriations act my amendment would increase funding under title vi defense health programs by 500 000 in order to fund research related to triple negative breast cancer and will be offset by reducing the general operations and maintenances and activities of the department of defense triple negative breast cancer is a specific strain of breast cancer for which no targeted treatment is available the american cancer society calls this particular strain of breast cancer an aggressive subtype associated with lower survival rates i offer this amendment to increase funding for research in order to develop a targeted treatment for the triple negative breast cancer strain breast cancers with specific targeted treatment methods such as hormone and gene based strains have higher survival rates than the triple negative subtype highlighting the need for a targeted treatment breast cancer accounts for 1 in 4 cancer diagnoses among women in this country it is also the most commonly diagnosed cancer among african american women the american cancer society estimates that in 2011 more than 26 000 african american women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and another 6 000 will die from the disease between 2002 and 2007 african american women suffered a 39 percent higher death rate from breast cancer than other groups african american women are also 12 percent less likely to survive five years after a breast cancer diagnosis one reason for this disparity is that african american women are disproportionally affected by triple negative breast cancer more than 30 percent of all breast cancer diagnoses in african american are of the triple negative variety black women are far more susceptible to this dangerous subtype than white or hispanic women last month i spoke at a funeral for yolanda williams one of my constituents in the 18th congressional district of texas yolanda died from her battle with triple negative breast cancer like many other women who are diagnosed with this aggressive strain she did not respond to treatment yolanda wife and mother of two daughters was only 44 years old this strain of breast cancer is not only more aggressive it is also harder to detect and more likely to recur than other types because triple negative breast cancer is difficult to detect it often metastasizes to other parts of the body before diagnosis seventy percent of women with metastatic triple negative breast cancer do not live more than five years after being diagnosed research institutions all over the nation have started to focus on this dangerous strain of breast cancer in my home city of houston baylor college of medicine has its best and brightest minds working tirelessly to develop a targeted treatment for the triple negative breast cancer subtype it is time for the department of defense to follow that example and commit additional funding to study the triple negative strain i urge my colleagues to join me in protecting women across the nation from this deadly form of breast cancer by supporting my

losing their ability to feed themselves and their families that is because this week the majority party in the house is ready to vote on a measure that will undermine the safety net in this country designed for our nations women infants and children we all know that one of the greatest challenges before us is reducing our deficit but we have to do it in a way that is consistent with our values consistent with the values of our great country and this week we will be voting on a measure that fails those values miserably if the majority party has their way and denies necessary funding to a critical safety net for some of our nations most vulnerable citizens nearly 1 000 women infants and children in rhode islands first district will be denied the assistance they need to survive wic represents the most basic obligation we have to our fellow citizens most in needfood and nutrition on top of that it is an incredibly costeffective program serving nearly 10 million americans each year and costing less than 100 per person in my district more than 18 percent of the residents suffer from food insecurity and depend on wic to make ends meet at a time when the middle class in our country is being crushed with high unemployment and still reeling from a housing crisis that has left countless families in foreclosure we are seeing more and more people in need of assistance just to get by and it is not just affecting people without jobs it is folks who have a job as well but they have had their wages cut or they have had their wages diminished or their hours cut this is not the time to allow people to lose the lifelines they need to survive we have helped the auto industry we have helped big banks it is time to sustain support for families that are most in need and have been most devastated by this difficult economy yet we see again this week another attack by the republican majority in the house on working families while they continue to fight to protect subsidies for big oil and to protect tax breaks for the outsourcing of jobs overseas first they come after seniors by trying to end medicare and now they are coming after women children and infants who rely on food assistance we should not be destroying programs upon which citizens rely for their most basic needs in order to fund tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires or big subsidies for the big oil companies if we got rid of tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires for one week we could pay for the entire wic program for an entire year i urge my colleagues to reject this proposal to ensure

this bill fails to create jobs deeply hurts our families and seniors and responds with extremes at a time when our fragile economy can least afford it i am committed to a budget that lives within our means while investing in the future and cutting our deficit however this irresponsible republican spending bill hampers job creation and jeopardizes investments in american innovation american education and american infrastructure that is why president obama vowed today to veto the irresponsible republican spending bill because it undermines critical priorities for national security and curtails the drivers of longterm economic growth and job creation we must do more to focus on jobs grow the economy and protect our middle class certainly while responsibly tackling our nations debt and deficit that is why ive offered 8 amendments to this bill which will protect seniors protect energy innovation strengthen our childrens education and most importantly will protect and grow jobs as the fragile economy slowly recovers we simply cannot afford to pull the rug out from underneath progress not now not when we are finally rebounding from the bush recession not with the extreme spending bill this represents i refuse to take america back to the failed policies that sunk our economy my first two amendments would restore funding from the cuts to the social security administration to prevent its shutdown the cuts that the irresponsible republican spending bill propose in this section alone would raid 625 million from the social security administration this would affect the 53 million americans who are collecting social security by furloughing every employee and closing the doors for a month or more an estimated 400 000 people mostly seniors would not have their claims processed this year creating a huge backlog and threatening the timely payment of benefits my amendments would restore this funding because i do not believe we should use our nations seniors that have worked hard and played by the rules their whole lives to somehow painfully balance our budget this is simply extreme and again painfully irresponsible the low income home energy assistance program or liheap is also cut in this irresponsible republican spending plan by some nearly 400 million those are cuts that are made on the backs of the lowincome residents seniors the disabled and those with children like those i represent in the now cold and snowy capital region of new york who struggle to pay to keep the thermostat set at a livable level liheap keeps those receiving help from having to make the heartbreaking decision about whether to pay to keep the heat on or to pay for food and prescription drugs to pull the rug out from underneath our nations most vulnerable is both simply extreme and painfully irresponsible my fourth amendment would maintain funding for the weatherization assistance program and the state energy program it is amendment number 4 and is set up for a recorded vote today i encourage my colleagues to support this bill the state energy program yields 7 22 in annual energy savings for every 1 invested in it while renovating our 13 000 buildings per year the weatherization assistance program helps lowincome and elderly save over 437 on their annual utility bill and decreases oil consumption by the equivalent of 24 1 million barrels annually to cut these jobsproducing energy savings programs that clearly work is both simply extreme and painfully irresponsible i have also offered two amendments that would protect the clean air act and clean water act from being jeopardized under the irresponsible republican spending plan the clean air act protects public health and safety and has saved hundreds of thousands of lives since 1970 by reducing air pollution by 60 percent while the economy has grown by 200 percent the clean water act protects drinking water for 117 million americans and safeguards 20 million acres of wetlands and wildlife habitats from big polluters seeking to inappropriately legislate against these programs in a spending bill the continuing resolution would threaten the air our children breathe and the water we drink this is simply extreme and painfully irresponsible my seventh amendment removes unobligated funding from fossil energy research and development and transfers these funds to the office of energy efficiency and renewable energy this would prioritize our investments from dirty oil and dirty fossil fuel sources of the past to the energy of today and tomorrow clean energy that would create jobs and make us competitive in a global market choosing to go sit out the clean energy race of today for the outdated energy sources of yesterday is simply extreme and painfully irresponsible my eighth amendment would restore funding for education and special ed to ensure our children and the future of our country have the resources they desperately need to compete in a global marketplace for generations to come it prevents thousands of teacher layoffs the irresponsible republican spending bill cuts over 1 25 billion in education funding that goes directly to states

inclined to recognize the importance of this amendment and work with those of us who are interested in healthy food my amendment would fund and seek to have the secretary of agriculture focus on the healthy food funding initiative this initiative would increase the availability of affordable healthy foods in underserved urban and rural areas and as well particularly through the development or equipping of grocery stores and other healthy food retailers we call these food deserts and the reason why i am standing next to this tragic picture of the disasters that have hit the american public is to emphasize what americans go through in this instance we see a disaster of unbelievable proportion from missouri to alabama to the flooding that occurred up and down the mississippi i can assure you that these individuals are suffering from the lack of access to healthy food weve got to get them back on their feet this idea of food deserts impacts rural and urban areas but it also impacts the millions of americans thousands upon thousands of americans who have recently been impacted by disaster everything is gone and although they are now probably experiencing the distribution of food from food centers sponsored by fema and volunteers they will come back to a food desert particularly in the african american and hispanic communities for example food comes from fast foods and convenience stores and as i indicated before those fast foods come from if you will the places where the expiration dates are sometimes way over the time of expiration according to the centers for disease control and prevention 80 percent of black women and 67 percent of black men are overweight african american children from lowincome families are at a much higher risk for obesity why because there is no access or limited access to good food the cdc also estimates that african american and mexican american adolescents ages 12 to 19 are more likely to be overweight at 21 percent and 23 percent respectively this amount of money will allow us to focus on the importance of correcting food deserts the unitedstates department of agriculture identified 92 food desert census tracks in harris

mile from a grocery store according to the kaiser family foundation 32 percent of all children in texas are overweight or obese these statistics underscore the staggering effect food deserts have i am asking that we look at the idea of ensuring healthy food targeting federal financial assistance to food desert areas through the healthy food finance initiative will provide more healthy food to affected areas we can create jobs we can help farmers and we can bolster the development in distressed areas it is an easy fix and the fix is to find a way to cooperate collaboratenot do a handout not dole outto make sure that we provide the incentives to come into our areas to ensure that we have a healthy child this is a healthy child we hope getting access to health care but i can assure you that their health is based upon not only health care but the food that this little one will eat i can tell you that i represent communities that have the inability to access good food this initiative will increase the availability of healthy food alternatives to the 23 5 million people living in food deserts nationwide we must be reducing the deficit i agree but cutting programs that provide healthy foodand create jobs because it would certainly create jobs by adding access to healthy food and sites for healthy food meaning grocery stores farmers markets all of those will be part of this initiative and it would assist the many many census tracks in houston alone that are now suffering from the lack of access to good food just a picture of green vegetables inspires us to support this

rural communities particularly through the development or equipping of grocery stores and other healthy food retailers these food deserts communities in which residents do not have access to affordable and healthy food options disproportionally affect african american and hispanic communities fast food restaurants and convenience stores line the blocks of low income neighborhoods offering few if any healthy options many of my colleagues across the aisle have made arguments about the economic climate and the need for budgetary cuts and i agree that we must work to reduce the deficit we cannot however continue to make irresponsible cuts to programs for the underserved lower income families and minorities since the mid1970s the prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased sharply for both adults and children and obesity is a grave health concern for all americans however food deserts have taken a toll on low income and minority communities and exacerbated growing obesity rates and health problems according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc 80 percent of black women and 67 percent of black men are overweight or obese african american children from low income families have a much higher risk for obesity than those in higher income families the cdc also estimates african american and mexican american adolescents ages 1219 are more

overweight compared to 20 percent of african american children and 14 percent of nonhispanic white children food deserts have greatly impacted my constituents in the 18th congressional district and

and is really crucial to spurring the contributions of corporate and foundation partners through their support through philanthropy sponsorships and volunteerism that help to sustain and leverage arts investments in communities all across this country this investment in the arts becomes all the more important during a time when states and cities all across this country face greater and greater fiscal constraints and at the same time are searching for opportunities to leverage federal dollars and to spur economic development and job creation i represent a state that has realized an extraordinary return on investments generated by the arts in rhode island the presence of the arts is really sown into the fabric of our communities and of our economy according to recent data from americans for the arts in just the first congressional district in my district alone more than 1 400 artsrelated businesses employ nearly 6 000 people and that represents more than 5 percent of the businesses in my district as the former mayor of providence ive seen firsthand the economic impact of the arts and the power of art to transform people and places i know the benefits of the arts in enriching our communities and uniting them as well arts nourish our soul the united states conference of mayors sent a letter to members of congress urging us to protect funding in the arts and to reject this amendment recognizing that arts create jobs and produce tax revenues that arts put people to work and that arts attract tourism revenue arts in the creative industries are an enormous part of what fuels our local economies bringing hundreds of thousands of visitors to our cities generating activity in restaurants hotels transportation and hospitality services this activity not only strengthens the vitality of our communities it generates revenues for state and local governments across our country the arts industry provides much more than aesthetic benefits it creates meaningful economic benefits and opportunities during this period of budget austerity we shouldnt neglect those investments with a proven positive rate of return we shouldnt siphon off the fuel that helps power the american arts industry a sector of our economy comprised of more than 750 000 businesses employing nearly 3 million people nationwide and generating more than 166 billion in economic activity cutting the national endowment for the arts undermines our responsibility to create jobs and grow our economy and diminishes us as a nation as one study demonstrates when we consider the overall direct federal cultural spending of 1 4 billion were achieving a return on investment thats nearly 9 to 1 if were really serious about strengthening our economy putting more americans back to work and reining in our deficit then we have to be smart about our investments and about our reductions with estimates indicating that every dollar of federal funds invested in the arts generates 9 in economic benefits further reductions to the national endowment of the arts are counterproductive and in fact will move our nation backwards it moves us backwards not only in the effect that we lose the immediate economic return on the investments but this cut also pushes our country further behind our competitors and the global economy it was one of the great giants of the united states senate the great and passionate leadership of rhode island senator claiborne pell that led to the creation of the national endowment for the arts in 1965 the program that were fighting to defend today in 1963 senator pell opened hearings on preliminary legislation on this issue by stating i believe that this cause and its implementation has a worldwide application for as our cultural life is enhanced and strengthened so does it project itself into the world beyond our shores let us apply renewed energies to the very concepts we seek to advance a true renaissance the reawakening the quickening and above all the unstunted growth of our cultural vitality in those words senator pell said clearly that this disinvestment that were discussing today for the national endowment for the arts nearly 50 years later is a stark and appalling contrast to the renaissance and reawakening embodied in the national endowment for the arts for too long the arts have been the first target for spending cuts in our public schools and here at the federal level it is at our own economic peril that we continue to deprive our youth and our communities of their connection to the arts the acting chair the time of

budget committee to talk about choices you know government is all about choosing it is setting priorities and it is choosing what we are going to spend the peoples money for how much we are going to ask the people to pay to the government and how we are going to spend those dollars it is all about choosing it is also about values this week this issue of choices is playing itself out in two arenas in government one in the continuing resolution battle that took place on this floor this afternoon the idea that we have to figure out how to fund the government for the rest of this fiscal year ending september 30 and whether or not we are willing to let the government shut down tomorrow night because of the choices that we either make or refuse to make and it is also playing itself out now in the development of the budget for the following fiscal year yesterday in the budget committee we considered the budget proposal offered by chairman ryan and the republicans that offered some very stark choices for the american people they are similar to the choices that we have been debating week after week after week for the last couple of months about how we are going to fund the government for the rest of the year from the democratic perspective at least i know from my perspective the reason i have not been willing to support the republican versions of the continuing resolutions that have come to this floor is that they make choices which dont seem very fair to me they dont seem to represent the values that this country has always embraced the values of fairness and justice and the idea that we are all in this great journey together and that we are trying to create a country that works for everybody and not just for a very few today the republicans brought to the floor a continuing resolution to fund the government for one more week these are the choices they made as to what we should cut in order to avoid shutting the government down they wanted to eliminate 143 million for school lunch assistance programs 187 million for education for the disadvantaged programs school improvement funds education innovative improvement programs and adult education it cuts the wic program nutrition for lowincome families women and their children the office of national drug control policy they want to cut 495 million from femas first responder program all these things they wanted to cut and yet when you ask them whether they want to have other people the wealthiest people the big corporations the people who have done very well in this country over the last couple of decades if you ask them why dont we make them share some of the burden of balancing this budget they say oh no we cant do that we cant do that let me just illustrate with this chart one of the choices that they made in the 2012 budget proposal they chose to include refused to eliminate 800 billion in tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of americans and instead cut 771 billion from medicaid over the next 10 years this was a choice do we want to make sure that our senior citizens have access to nursing homes that our disabled population has access to assisted living facilities and home care our young lowincome poor families do we want to make sure that they have health care or do we want to make sure that the wealthiest 2 percent of americans continue to have their cake and eat it too their choice in the budget and in the continuing resolution is to let those wealthiest americans have their cake and eat it too and let the most vulnerable segments of society pay the price of helping to balance the budget i am a big fan of political cartoons and todays cartoon in the washington post i think said it all because one of the other proposals that the republicans made in their 2012 budget proposal was not just to maintain the tax breaks for the wealthiest americans but to increase them they want to cut the maximum tax rate from 35 percent which was the rate that it was cut to by the bush administration they wanted to cut it even further to 25 percent in other words a 10 percent additional tax cut for the wealthiest americans as a matter of fact i offered an amendment in the hearing to rescind the bush tax cut for only those people making over 1 million a year only those people making over 1 million a year they voted it down unanimously but here is the cartoon by tom toles in the washington post it has and i wont name him but a republican member of the budget committee offering a platter that says more tax cuts for wealthy and the truly rich guy says stop i cant eat another bite and the republican says sorry everybody has to share the pain this is one of the choices we have it is stark again tax cuts for the wealthiest americans or health care education nutrition for the other 90 percent of the american people who have not done so well so as we move through this process of choosing both how we are going to fund the government until september 30 and how were going to fund it into the future the american people need to know whose side the republican majority is on and whose side the democrats are on with that i yield to my colleague a member of the budget committee from new york"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "thank you very much let me thank the gentlelady from the virgin islands for once again coming to the floor and organizing us to make sure that we sound the alarm to make sure that we put out the facts about what is taking place tonight of course we are talking about the unionbusting efforts of governor walker in wisconsin so thank you congresswoman christensen for your leadership and for your tireless work i am pleased to participate in this special order tonight as we provide some perspective about the importance of preserving and respecting the process of collective bargaining and of supporting the rights of public employees to protect union benefits won by virtue of the blood sweat and tears of unionized workers we are talking about the implications of the unionbusting efforts undertaken by wisconsin governor walker but the reality is there is a sweeping antiunion sentiment overtaking our nation and public employees who are union workers are being used as scapegoats to balance state budgets this practice is not only wrong it is cruel and is calculated lets take a look at the facts in wisconsin for example governor walker is attempting to ram through legislation that cuts state employee benefits and strips unions of their collective bargaining rights by allowing them to bargain only on wages keeping benefits and other issues off the table severely limiting union say on hiring firing assignments and other work rules the governor appears ready to rush through radical changes that would take away rights from workers without making any effortany effortto talk to those workers much less negotiate a fair agreement with them governor walker is calling employee unions unreasonable but his administration has made absolutely no effort to work with or to even contact any of the unions he is attacking he is demonizing public employees who are protesting at the capital thats why 74 percent of wisconsin residents oppose this and the republicans bill to take away these rights from the struggling middleincome middle class residents of wisconsin his proposals are an affront to all workers when he says that state employees should contribute more all he is really saying is that they should accept massive cuts in salary without being offered a seat at the negotiating table and were not talking about huge salaries here this is not about budgeting this is about union busting and it is the kind of policy that will only hurt workers in the state and across the country but it only leads to stalled economic growth and the slashing of jobs the process of collective bargaining has led to the rise of the middle class it is a fair process that allows employers to sit at the table and craft an agreement that serves both parties its a fundamentally american process its a democratic process yet governor walker is bent on undermining decades of hardearned concessions won by organized labor and its membership if the governor is successful in his unionbusting efforts we will see further assaults around the country on union workers and in other states that are really experiencing budgetary woes so in response to governor walkers action elected officialsand we are very proud of and stand in solidarity with the elected officials in wisconsindecided to protest against his actions public employees have shown that they are serious about balancing the budget by agreeing to governor walkers pension and health care requests concessions that the governor himself says will solve the budget challenge but still it seems like this is not enough the governors efforts are denying the rights of taxpaying nurses educators emergency response workersall people who probably are our nextdoor neighbors we all know public employees who this will hurt these are union workers who need and should have a voice at the same time he is pressing for a bill that will do nothing to fix the budget this bill will shatter relationships among educators and school leaders undermining current innovations around teacher compensation evaluation and improvement it will really have a chilling effect on teacher recruitment and sends a terrible message about the value of public service there are ominous signs on the horizon that reflect a growing sentiment by governors who seem bent on unionbusting antidemocratic initiatives to really undo longstanding collective bargaining agreements union workers and public employees are being used as scapegoats to balance the budget teachers nurses police firemen and others who perform their jobs dutifully are being treated shabbily by this governor and those who share his unionbusting and anticollective bargaining philosophy i hope that cooler heads prevail and i urge the governor to pull the state back from this radical governmental overreach i see my colleague from wisconsin congresswoman gwen moore will be with us and i just want to say to congresswoman moore that my constituents in the ninth congressional district stand in solidarity with you and with all of those bold and brave leaders who have left the state and also on behalf of all of the union workers and all of those who have come to the capitol to say enough is enough so thank you congresswoman moore for your leadership thank you congresswoman"]],

something to change social security and medicare and all these things he agreed to do publicly but the republicansjohn boehnercould never go against grover norquist the republicans shake in their boots they will not do anything even though the american people by a more than 70 percent majority say people making more than 1 million a year should contribute to what the problems are in this country so that fell apart then we had the gang of 6 senatorsthree republicans three democratswho had been on the bowlessimpson commission who said we should do something about this they were in the press they had press conferences and this was going down the road and doing all kinds of great things while that was going on there was a decision made and a law was passed to create a supercommittee to which i appointed senator patty murray of washington to run no one in the senate democrat or republican has more respect than patty murray she worked so hard with the other 11 members of congress to come up with something a few days before they were to arrive at a decisionand the gang of 6 members are out here doing all this stuff all the timei get a letter signed by virtually every republican senator saying we are not going to raise revenue for anything the supercommittee didnt work there the gang of 6 is gone so we passed this last august to fund government for 2 years and to say if we dont arrive at another 1 2 trillion in deficit reduction during this year it automatically kicks in at the end of this year or the beginning of next year so that is where we are and the republicans in the house are trying to change that so that is what this little history lesson has been all about i dont like to sequester i wish we didnt have to do it it was a hard pill to swallow but it was the right thing to do if we are ever going to reduce the staggering deficit we are going to have to make some hard decisions so that is what this is all about but that is the point it is hard to do therefore we have to do it to sequesterwhich in effect would take almost 500 billion from domestic programs and almost 500 billion from defense programs they were designed to be tough enough to force two sides to reach a balanced deal it hasnt happened yet as i said earlier with general eisenhowers statement i didnt make that up that is what he said my complaint about the republicans being so unreasonable about everything is something where i am not a lone wolf crying in the wilderness we have two longtime nonpartisan watchers of congress one from the american enterprise institute which is a conservative think tank another from brookings institute that wrote an article saying it is the republicans cant you see what they are doing here is one thing they said we have been studying washington politics in congress for more than 40 years and never have we seen them this dysfunctional in our past writings we have criticized both parties when we believed it was warranted today however we have no choice but to acknowledge that the core of the problem lies with the republican party they further said the gop has become an insurgent outlier in american politics it is ideologically extreme of scornful compromise unmoved by conventional understanding of facts evidence and science and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition what brave men to do that to write these commentswhich are true i have been saying that i dont want to fight about everything republicans insist on balancing the budget on the backs of the middle class seniors students single mothers and those who could least afford it that is what they are doing over there today it is their refusal to compromise that leaves us facing the threat of sequester and it is difficult but it is balanced going back to the august budget agreement now in order to protect wealthy special interests is no solution neither is refighting the battles of last year democrats agree we must reduce our deficits and make hard choices but we believe in a balanced approach that shares the pain as well as the responsibility is the sequester the best way to achieve that balance no but republicans refuse to consider a more reasonable approachone for example that asks every american to pay his fair share while making difficult choices to reduce spending democrats will not agree to a onesided solution that lets the superwealthy off the hook while forcing the middle class and those in greatest need to bear all the hardship democrats believe we can protect americans access to health care create jobs while investing in the future and protect the poor and elderly but we cant do it alone it will take work and compromise and so far republicans have been unwilling to make a serious effort to achieve that result republicans have rejected our balanced approach their onesided solution to acrosstheboard cuts would take away from the many to give to the few here is what the plan would donot all of it but here is what their plan would do remember they are taking it up over there in the house today it would cut medicaid benefits increasing the number of uninsured children parents seniorsand that is in addition to people with disabilitiesby hundreds of thousands just eliminate them it would also put seniors in nursing homes at risk some of them would have to move out of the nursing home i guess it would punish americans who receive tax credits to purchase health insurance when their financial circumstances change causing 350 000 americans to have no coverage this would add to the tens of millions who already exist that way it would weaken wall street reforms protecting big banks at the expense of consumers their legislation would once again target middleclass workers food inspectors air traffic controllers border patrol agents drug enforcement and fbi agents they would have to be laid off it would cut funding for preventive health care programs that fight chronic illnessessuch as heart disease cancer strokes and diabetesthat cause 70 percent of the deaths in america preventive care would be reined in it would slash block grant funding in the united states to help 23 million children seniors and disabled americans live independently and out of poverty no segment of the population is immune from this painful absurd republican planexcept maybe millionaires billionaires and wealthy corporations the republican proposal cuts meals on wheels and reduces food assistance for almost 2 million needy people one of the republican candidates running for president said president obama is the food stamp president there are more poor people our economy has been in bad shape people are struggling the millionaires are doing fine and in addition to what i have already mentioned this thing that they are taking up in the house today cuts off almost 300 000 children from free school lunches at a time when one in five children lives in poverty the unitedstates conference of catholic bishops said the republican plan fails a basic moral test this budget sets very clear priorities the problem is what they are taking up in the house sets up the wrong priorities president franklin roosevelt said human kindness has never weakened the stamina or softened the fiber of a free people a nation does not have to be cruel to be tough so republicans would do well to remember our

educational stability when identifying foster care placements and coordinate with local school districts to ensure that young people stay in their current school when placed in foster care or are immediately enrolled in a new school if that is in their best interest over the last 4 years student privacy law has made it difficult to properly implement the educational stability provisions of the

can this suggests that we can leave by the end of the year if we dont well be there for another decade would be my prediction the american people are now with us a group of us here in the congress a bipartisan group for nearly a decade have been talking about this arguing not to expand the war not to be over there not to be in nation building and the american people didnt pay much attention now they are the large majority of the american people now say its time to get out of afghanistan its a fruitless venture too much has been lost the chance of winning since we dont even know what we are going to win doesnt exist so they are tired of it financially theres a good reason to come home as well some argue we have to be there because if we leave under these circumstances well lose face it will look embarrassing to leave so how many more men and women have to die how many more dollars have to be spent to save face that is one of the worst arguments possible we are not there under legal conditions this is a war who says it isnt a war everybody talks about the afghan war was the war declared of course not it wasnt declared there was a resolution passed that said that the president at that time under the emergency of 9 11 could go and deal with al qaeda those who brought upon the 9 11 bombings but al qaeda is not there anymore so we are fighting the taliban the taliban used to be our allies at one time when the soviets were there the talibans main goal is to keep the foreign occupation out they want foreigners out of their country they are not al qaeda yet most americansmaybe less so now but the argument here on the floor is we have got to go after al qaeda this is not a war against al qaeda if anything it gives the incentive for al qaeda to grow in numbers rather than dealing with them the money issue we are talking about a lot of money how much do we spend a year probably about 130 billion up to 1 trillion now in this past decade later on in the day we are going to have two votes we are going to have a vote on doing something sensible making sense out of our foreign policy bringing our troops home and saving hundreds of billions of dollars then we also will have a vote against npr to cut the funding of npr there is a serious question about whether that will even cut one penny but at least the fiscal conservatives are going to be overwhelmingly in support of slashing npr and then go home and brag about how they are such great fiscal conservatives and the very most they might save is 10 million and thats their claim to fame for slashing the budget at the same time they wont consider for a minute cutting a real significant amount of money all empires end for fiscal reasons because they spread themselves too far around the world and thats what we are facing we are in the midst of a military conflict that is contributing to this inevitable crisis and its financial and you would think there would be a message there how did the soviets come down by doing the very same thing that were doing perpetual occupation of a country we dont need to be occupying afghanistan or any other country we dont even need to be considering going into libya or anywhere else fortunately i guess for those of us who would like to see less of this killing we will have to quit because we wont be able to afford it the process that we are going through is following the war powers resolution this is a proper procedure it calls attention to how we slip into these wars i have always claimed that its the way we get into the wars that is the problem if we would be precise and only go to war with a declaration of war with the people behind us knowing who the enemy is and fight win and get it over with that would be more legitimate they dont do it now

limited pier space and theres no drydock capability to allow private sectors to invest huge monies or to come back here later after we get the authorization to say we want more money from congress to appropriate there would not be appropriate because as the gentlelady from hawaii said we already have sufficient capacity both in pearl harbor in washington in california and in guam and to show that there are no requirements for this further ship repair capacity in the pacific region you can just look at last year where the absence of need was perhaps best exemplified by the fact that the navy only received one bid when it had a proposal from shipyards in the pacific region for a longterm operating lease for the guam ship repair facility property and that bid was from the current guam shipyard operator the distance from overseas home ports and from the regions in which the msc ships operates makes a shipyard in the mariana islands prohibitive in terms of operating costs to and from

all id like to thank the gentleman from california mr denhams service in uniform to this nation is to be commended and his service to our veterans has been unwavering hes right weve worked on this a long time i had the opportunity on numerous occasions to travel downrange to visit our veterans the last one with my good friend from california and the care and concern that he showed listening to his veterans of what they need listening to them talk about this one of the things on the minds of our veterans as theyre fighting downrange defending our freedoms and doing whats asked of them is how are they going to be able to take care of their family when their service obligation ends so mr denham came back and working and reaching across the aisle and working over in the senate crafted a piece of legislation thats not only morally the right thing to do taking care of our veteransyou hear a lot about the 99 percent and the 1 percent theres truth in that 99 percent of us enjoy the benefits of security and national defense while 1 percent provide it so the moral obligation of providing this is pretty much unquestioned but the thing that i think mr denham looked into on this is making sure the economic impact was felt also and on this i think this is very important to keep in mind we spend 140 billion a year training our military thats an investment into those folks when they finish their career whether it be a stint of 4 years or whether its a 20 or 30year career they come out with incredible skill training with incredible professionalism and they are a very mature workforce why would we not want to get our best and brightest back working in the economy these are entrepreneurs these are the folks that can get things done this piece of legislation was crafted in such a way to do exactly that implementation of concurrent credentialing has no undue burden on the military nor on its readiness in fact opportunities for credentialing will be a selling point for our military you can come out and move directly into a job as an aviation mechanic or whatever it may be id like to mention just quickly here in my state of minnesota an average active duty servicemember with an aviation mechanic or avionics occupation will have attended over 18 months of training and had a minimum of 4 years of practical experience a certified aviation maintenance technician school costs 20 000 a year so weve invested we have a trained mechanic but were going to have them come back have them be unemployed have them try and use their gi billwhich is federal dollarsto get the very same credentialing that they had when they left at a time when we need to put them into the job so in minnesota thief river falls is the only place you can get this were asking folks to line up and get positions that they dont have enough spots for it makes no sense so id like to thank the gentleman for a commonsense piece of legislation for a piece of legislation that addresses both our moral and economic need and id also like to say as the members in this house see we can work together to solve problems we can understandand on this issuethe sacrifice that our

gentlelady from texas offering this amendment and i want to restate what it attempts to do it will prohibit outsourcing of dod functions until the secretary of defense conducts an outreach program to benefit women and minorityowned small businesses well in fact it is a duplication of what is already in the law it duplicates section 891 of the fiscal year 2011 national defense authorization act which requires the establishment of an outreach program to firms near dod installations this act simply delays allowing for outsourcing to come back in and be part of the benefits that it provides to this nation reducing cost streamlining the process so again this is already in law as i said this is nothing more than a delay tactic to stop outsourcing we need to use outsourcing where it makes sense to utilize the benefits of reducing cost which has the potential to help our small businesses which i think we all support whether they are womenowned or minorityowned businesses small businesses are important and i think outsourcing does that in fact in my district letterkenny army depot has publicprivate partnerships today through outsourcing with small businesses and large alike the heritage foundation did a study commending what is going on at letterkenny army depot utilizing dod civilians as well as the private sector coming together where it makes sense where we can have a tremendously positive impact on the work that goes there so there is a model out there and outsourcing is important again i urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment because again it already is established in last years defense authorization bill exactly what the gentlelady from texas wants to be established with that i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.9977112712804228,

where i was were in the southeastern portion of arizona over here everybody has heard of tombstone but i was a little further south than tombstone all the way to the border and douglas arizona which is in the corner the southwestern corner of arizona and next to new mexico and along that portion of the southern border of the united states visiting primarily with the people that were in charge of border security the border patrol and the ranchers who live along the border let me talk about the ranchers first one of those ranchers mr krentz a year ago was murdered on his ranch apparently by illegals coming into the united states he was gunned down and killed the culprits that committed that crime by the way have not been brought to justice i met with other ranchers in the entire region and just asked them the question tell me what its like to live on the border of the united states and mexico as a ranch owner and they went on forever and forever and told me things that i was just really somewhat surprised about how they feel like the border is wide open that people cross across their ranches people come in they destroy their property they destroy their water lines all of this costs money to the ranchers and of course they have to be the ones that pick up the bill for the destruction on their property and they dont feel safe about the people that cross into the united states across their land they feel like the federal government has really not protected them and their rights and seems to neglect them even though the border patrol who i also met with i believe is doing as good a job as they possibly can do i want to make that clear the border patrol is doing as good a job as they can do as we will let them do as a nation and they are trying to protect the border the best that they possibly can and so i talked to both groups but in reality the people who live there are very concerned about their own safety and the consequences they have to pay for people illegally coming into the united states i heard something that was kind of surprising to me when illegals not all but when some come into the united states and they are captured by border patrol some of them ask the question are they in the 9th court or the 10th court and i said what are they talking about the 9th court or the 10th court well what theyre talking about is the 9th circuit court of appeals or the 10th circuit court of appeals you see the ninth circuit court of appeals that is a federal appellate court has jurisdiction that includes arizona but goes up to the new mexico border and so when illegals cross into the united states near new mexico or arizona some of them ask the question am i in the 9th court which would be in arizona or the 10th circuit court of which the jurisdiction is new mexico and the reason for that in my opinion those two courts have different reputations about enforcing the rule of law on the border and of course those that cross into the united states hope if they are caught the 9th circuit court of appeals would eventually have jurisdiction over their case when in their perception its a much more friendly court to folks who cross in illegally than the 10th circuit so i thought that was somewhat interesting they are also given when they come into the united states if captured their property some of them you will find a whole list of things and places they can go the churches that give them sanctuary places that they can go for medical help and they are given in a very organized way what they can do when they come into the united states that is provided in some cases by the coyotes that make money off those immigrants who come into the united states because immigrants have to pay the coyote money and sometimes the coyotes and the drug cartels all work together because you see drugs and people are going north and money and guns are going south because you see mexico doesnt protect its border any better than the united states does but in any event while i was down there in the corner of arizona i learned firsthand about the seriousness to the ranchers the people who live on the land their concerns about the fact that they believe that the border is not secure in reality they have to worry about their own safety on a daily basis after visiting a corner of the southeastern corner of arizona we moved and traveled across interstate 10 to interstate 8 over here to san luis arizona so that travels goes up to san luis across interstate 10 interstate 10 turns into interstate 8 comes all the way across arizona into california goes into yuma arizona and i went down here into the southwestern corner of the state of new mexico to also see what that border was like now coming across interstate 8 right here interstate 8 we pulled off the side of the road to the sonora national reserve and that is a national reserve that the federal government controls because i wanted to see the sonora national reserve interestingly enough you get about a quarter of a mile almost a halfmile off of interstate 8 right up here by the sonora desert and you come across this sign this sign is facing toward mexico so interstate 8 would be to this direction and mexico would be behind the sign how far behind the sign its 80 miles to the mexican border and here is a big sign that says traveling caution smuggling and illegal immigration may be encountered in this area so it seems to me that the federal governments answer to border security is to warn people that it is a smuggling and illegal immigration area once again this sign is not on the border this sign is 80 miles this side of the border so what is the government saying are they just ceding that entire portion of arizona to the drug cartels saying its a smuggling area and that you need to take care of yourself because we cant protect you i dont know but i was somewhat surprised to see that our federal governments answer to border security was to erect this sign and other signs that are similar to it i dont believe of course thats the answer to border security you wouldnt need these signs if the border were secure in reality not in just political statements that seem to be made by different individuals the texas department of public safety has issued some statistics regarding crossborder crime i have already mentioned about how the 34 5 percent of the people in local county jails on the border are foreign nationals but just since 2010 january 2010 the texas department of public safety has identified 22 murders 24 assaults 15 shootings and 5 kidnappings among other crimes directly related to spillover violence from mexico now sometimes we hear this comment well the violence in mexico isnt coming to the united states the question is is the crime from mexico coming into the united states we have already shown that that is occurring because 34 percent of the people in those local jails are committing crimes and theyre foreign nationals but also the violence is coming into the united states because of the statistics that i just gave you and now we learn of another phenomenon that is taking place you dont hear much about it because the victims of these crimes dont say much about it people who live in border towns the populous border towns in the united states periodically would get somebody who would come to their front door or they would get an email or a text from someone who says we know your cousin who lives in mexico and unless you pay us so much protection money your cousin in mexico is going to disappear something to that effect so we hear reports of that extortion on the american side of the border this is primarily among hispanic americans and what do they do well they may or may not report it what they i think generally do is pay the extortion because they want their relative in mexico on the other side of the border to be safe so we have that extortion racket taking place if the border were secure that certainly would not have occurred so it concerns me that we have that crime on the american side going back to the southern border of arizona i was asking the border patrol which was very gracious and explained a lot of their operations to me how do they bring drugs into the united states and they said every way they can bring them into the united states one of the ways that they are using now is the concept of ultralights an ultralight for lack of a better description is a kite that has a motor on it one person can fly that at very low altitude and they bring in 200 or 300 pounds of drugs into the united states they never land the ultralight into the unitedstates they just fly across from mexico into arizona and they drop their load 200 300 pounds of drugs and then they fly back to mexico then there is someone at a rendezvous point who picks up those drugs i say that because the drug cartels are using every means necessary to exploit the open borders and do everything they can to make sure that they bring in those drugs and they will continue to do so the border patrol is the agency that we have to protect the border of the united states like i said i think they are doing as good a job as we will let them do but primarily the border patrol patrols the border up to 2535 miles inside the united states that is their duty that is their jurisdiction the place that they are supposed to protect the unitedstates past that 35 miles or so they dont patrol that that is somebody elses responsibility now of course the bad guys know that is the duty of the border patrol to patrol that section of the border so when people are smuggled into the united states when drugs are smuggled into the united states the goal is to get past the border patrol demarcation line because once you do that you are pretty much in my opinion home free to get into the united states with people or drugs so that is the area of their primary concern and it is certainly the area of the jurisdiction that they are trying to patrol the best they can i have asked the border patrol tell me how you do this and i think they use as many different means as they can to patrol the border they will have vehicles go up and down the border they will have border patrol agents behind the border they will have some use of the national guard behind the border with the use of electronic equipment to view what takes place on the border so they use the equipment that they can but they obviously dont have enough border patrol agents to be directly on the border so they have some on the border and some behind the border monitoring the activity of the people coming into the united states and then they try to catch those that they can when i was visiting with one of the border patrol agents this is a photograph of one of their vehicles it is a typical border patrol vehicle that patrols near the border of the united states and mexico now you notice that this vehicle has steel mesh on the windshield and on the side windows it has steel mesh even above the lights the red lights on top so i asked the border patrol agent that drives this vehicle explain to me the steel enclosure you have on your vehicle he said here is what happens we will drive close to the border as we drive close to the border there are people on the other side of the border who when they see us start throwing rocks at us they throw them over the fence if we dont have this protectionand they are not little bitty pebbles these are rocksthey throw them over the fence and break the windshield the border patrol agents are injured they do that for various reasons one of those reasons is a diversion they will try to divert the attention of a border patrol agent at one location so that other folks illegally can sneak into the united states now we dont hear much about assaults on border patrol agents unless somebody is murdered which has occurred but in the last couple of years assaults on border patrol agents by people illegally coming into the united states is about 1 000 a year a thousand assaults on border patrol agents a year in the last couple of years and they are by every means necessary including the rock throwers who try to injure border patrol agents so you can see the relentlessness of some people who want to come into the united states they violate the law of course by coming here illegally and they will continue to violate the law and take on our border patrol agents even by assaulting them so they can sneak into the united states so it seems to me maybe we need to refocus on the primary mission of the federal government and its responsibility the federal government does have the responsibility under the constitution to protect the american people and the united states government should do that now the united states protects the borders of other nations we protect the border of afghanistan with pakistan we are protecting the korean border between the two koreas we protect the borders of other nations and we use our military to do it why dont we have the same resolve to protect the american border both borders the southern border and the northern border because in my opinion we dont have the moral will to do so we should make sure that we understand that people and other people should understand you dont come to the united states without permission it is the rule of law you dont come to the united states without permission now we have to solve that immigration issue that is a different issue but you cant solve that issue until you solve the issue of people illegally coming into the united states you know we are getting everybody we are getting the good the bad and the ugly and right now were getting a lot of bad and ugly crossing into the united states so the rule of law must be enforced by the federal government that is their duty now many of us do not believe the federal government has secured the border obviously people in arizona feel that way because they have passed legislation to try to protect their own state using state law enforcement of course the federal governments answer to that was rather than help arizona sue arizona take them to court you know its kind of like this sign their answer to border security is erect a few signs and sue states that try to protect themselves why dont we deal in reality and make sure that the border is secure and make sure that it is an area that is safe on both sides by securing our side we can protect the mexican side as well of course we need to work with the mexican government to do so they are our neighbors to the south while the united states now has decided to go into libya and spend 100 million or 200 million a week i dont know by bombing that country maybe we should come back home and focus on national security in the united states and spend that money on border security and securing the united states at the border because it is not secure in spite of what the secretary of homeland security has said border patrol it seems to me should have the mission to secure the border i will say again they are doing as good a job as we will let them do but they cannot stop people from coming into the united states although they are trying to when they had those vehicles going up and down in front of the border that keeps people from coming across we have fences in some appropriate areas we dont have fences everywhere but we have some fencing also the border patrol knows they cannot stop people from crossing so they try to catch them if you can that is the phrase that i think is our policy catch them if you can in other words they cross into the united states we see them we try to catch them but once we catch them they become our problem and then we have to send them through the entire legal process as we should but they are our problem they become our medical problem they become our prison problem if they go to prison if they have committed a felony then we have to deal with them and we have to try to get them back to the country they belong to in spite of those countries that refuse to take back criminal aliens so it is catch them if you can why dont we rethink that and prevent people from crossing into the united states if our policy was border security not behind the border security but have security on the border then people coming up to the border cant get across why because there are more boots on the ground and i think we should use whatever we have available we certainly should use the border patrol but also maybe we should use the national guard we have a few national guard troops that are down on the border although they are being relieved and their primary purpose is not to be on the border but behind the border looking at cameras watching folks cross now that is great to watch people cross but when they cross and they come into the united states once again they become our problem once they have crossed and we catch them if you can and send them back home if we can so it would seem to me to be a better use of the national guard to put them on the border i have introduced legislation to put 10 000 national guard troops on the 1 957mile border between the united states and mexico and put them on the border to not allow people to cross into the united states it is the federal governments responsibility of national security to protect the people so the federal government should pay for that and get the money out of the department of defense or somewhere reappropriate money to have the national guard paid for but put them under the supervision of the four state governors so that the governors can control their own border and protect them from entering the united states unlawfully no matter who it is i do not believe that we can say our border is secure when the government accountability office by their own statistics say that only 15 percent of the border is airtight that doesnt seem like a winning percentage to me and when they say under the best circumstances 44 percent partially secure what does that mean well it is sort of secure but sort of not but when you have 56 percent of the border is wide open spaces for anybody that wants to come back and forth that is not protecting the dignity and the sovereignty of the united states so it is long past time we quit talking about border security and actually secure the border from people coming into the united states without permission everyone and to say that the crime doesnt occur in the united states well it does not just to mention the border county jails that i mentioned the 27 percent that are in federal penitentiaries that are foreign nationals that are illegally in the united states but all of the drugs that are sold throughout the united states those are all criminal gangs primarily that are working with the drug cartels in mexico and colombia selling those drugs so the crime affects the united states the insecurity of the border is something that all of us pay for we pay for it in every way possible whether its with health care whether its with education we pay for it in the criminal justice system americans pay and legal immigrants pay the united states has the greatest the most liberal immigration policy in the world we let more people into our country legally every year than does any other country on its own so we have to fix that immigration issue but we have to secure the border first because when all is said and done so far more has been said and less has been done i urge my fellow members of the house of representatives that we come back home that we come back to the united states that we think about the security or insecurity of our borders and that we make sure that the federal government under the constitution fulfills its first obligationto protect americans and thats just the way it is"], [0.9968400150537491, 0.0031599849462509155, 1, "i
