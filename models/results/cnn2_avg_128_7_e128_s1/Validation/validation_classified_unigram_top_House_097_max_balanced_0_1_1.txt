{"top_correct": [[0.0, 1.0, 1, "i thank the very distinguished chairman of the full committee on banking i also wish to emphasize the importance of his message that he eloquently has given us there should be no reason for any member to be ignorant as to the exact thrust and nature of what is being foisted in the house but in general terms the chairman has done this i would like to be given the privilege to get into some matters of special importance the committee on banking had the biggest cuts to make of all the committees in the house of all the subcommittees in the house the subcommittee on housing had the biggest amount of the outlays and authority to cut the current service estimate for programs within the subcommittee on housing and urban affairs jurisdiction is 40 8 billion in authority we were told and mandated by the budget resolution to take the standard omb cut of 25 percent now for reasons beyond the reach of rational minds to understand the stockman formula says that domestic programs must be cut by 25 percent it matters not whether the program is for education housing or sidewalks if it is a program for people it goes down by 25 percent needless to say this arbitrary kind of target leads to the necessity of making equally arbitrary decisions nevertheless the subcommittee with the great help and leadership of the overall chairman of the full committee struggled with the numbers juggled the programs and produced budget authority cuts of 10 5 billion we made those cuts in as rational and humane a way as possible with the steady constant and undiluted opposition of the minority but there is no denying the reality that there will not be enough money in this budget to provide anything like the level of community development assistance that our cities require and neither will there be anything like the commitment needed to provide decent and affordable housing for those millions of h 3506 co citizens who are living in substandard and high cost housing we started with a current services level that was already inadequate and then faced the command to cut those services by onefourth thus we began with an assisted housing production level that meets about onethird of a reasonable goal and we ended up with an assisted housing production level that will meet perhaps a fourth of the goal in short beginning with inadequate program levels we were forced to go to absurd and inhumane levels there is no way to accomplish that kind of task without pain the results of this vast budget cut will be with us for years to come in the form of overcrowded overpriced housing in the form of growing numbers of substandard homes and in less visible but equally damaging forms of inadequate community services and underdeveloped local economies if the administration gambles luckily and we do not have more immediate social eruptions and disturbances as are being registered in less fortunate countries such as belgium france and even west germany under very similar conditions in housing that is the commitment that this administration has demanded and which the majority here has accepted we have done our duty to produce the required cuts to protect the existing housing stock we acted to provide 1 64 billion in operating subsidies for public housing this covers operating and maintenance requirements and will enable housing authorities to begin restoring operating reserves that have been depleted through extraordinary utility costs the operating subsidy goes largely to utility costs40 percent of it in fact budgets for 1980 and 1981 assumed that utility costs would increase by only 11 4 and 12 percent respectively when in actual fact utility costs went up by twice those amounts the utility cost shortfall for 1981 alone was 250 million housing authorities were forced to deplete their reserves in order to pay their bills the administration also has failed to provide 100 million to make adjustments in cases where the performance funding system formula does not accurately reflect the real needs of housing authorities which often happens in the case of larger housing authorities altogether the administration budget request was 440 million short of what is required to make the housing authorities whole this bill provides a sufficient amount to cover that shortfall failure to do so will only mean that housing authorities will be forced to cut further back on maintenance and other services which in turn would lead to loss of housing that we cannot afford to lose the public housing stock is valued at 60 billion and it is imperative that this housing be preserved which this bill provides for second this bill alms to protect the poor the budget resolution assumes that housing subsidies will be cut by 60 million through imposition of rent increases we reject that because the evidence is that the rent increases could well result in either no increase in revenue or an actual decline in revenue information we gathered shows that in san antonio for example public housing rents could go up by 5 to 36 a month the trouble is that the people who occupy this housing are so hard pressed that they do not have that kind of money to spare witnesses told us that they would have to move out of public housing into substandard housing rather than pay the increased rent the reality is that these are people who would have to choose between shoes for children and rent increases or choose between food and higher rent the administrations rent increase proposals would hit hardest at working poor families who already pay most of the rent received by housing authorities these are the families that would move out in order to be able to buy ordinary necessities even at the cost of moving into substandard shacks who would replace them in all likelihood even lower income tenants who would pay far less in rent i do not believe that the administrations rent increase proposal would produce the revenues claimed and i know that it would only create greater hardship among people who already have as much as anyone can bear therefore in rejecting the rent increase proposal we believe that we are not just protecting the poor but acting to protect the housing authorities from losing the very families that now provide the greatest rents and the greatest stability aside from turning back the counterproductive rent proposal we acted to provide at least a minimal level of modernization funds too many of the nations public housing units are in a state of disrepair it is imperative that we keep those units in operation it will be far less expensive to do that than to pay the cost of replacing them again we acted to protect the interests of the poor people who live in public housing so that the units they occupy will be safe and decent and at the same time we acted to keep the housing stock from declining third this bill provides as much new housing production as possible a realistic national housing goal requires that 600 000 assisted housing units be produced but in 1981 we expect only a third that many to be started from that already inadequate base the budget resolution called for a vast reduction there is in fact no way to keep up existing production levels and still meet the requirements of the budget resolution however we have provided funds for 1 billion in annual contribution commitments for a total of 20 billion over the life of the resulting contracts this will produce 176 000 assisted housing units55 percent of them in the form of existing homes and 45 percent of them in the form of either new or substantially rehabilitated homes the minority substitute offered a level of 158 000 units which is 17 000 below what the president proposed what we have provided in this bill is far from enough to meet any reasonable goal but is the most that can be done within the budget targets it would be a genuine tragedy to see any further cuts in housing production at a time when we know that the supply of the decent and lowcost housing is actually falling in relation to the need for it there is no disputing the fact that in this decade the nation needs to produce more housing than at any other time in history unless that need is met we will see continued demand pull on housing prices and we will see the continuation and worsening of the pressures that have already priced housing out of the reach of all but the most fortunate of our citizens for that reason we rejected the administration plan to stop ginny mae tandem plan operations and provided 1 1 billion in tandem commitments which should enable the purchase of mortgages with an aggregate value of 1 9 billion during 1982 this is essential in light of the continued high interest rates that make housing unaffordable without some form of relief and assistance we do not believe that the administrations plans to kill fha are realistic and this bill extends fha authority and adjusts insurance limits to reflect existing market trends we also provided an extension of the 202 program for elderly housing at a level of 850 million in fiscal 1982 those are the highlights of the housing portion of this bill i want now to turn to the community development issues for the community development block grant program this bill provides 3 64 billion in fiscal 1982 which is a slightin todays termsreduction from current levels the reduction is 220 million the bill also provides for continuation of the udag program at a 425 million program levela reduction of 250 million the administration proposed vast changes in the community development programs taken as a whole these cuts would have killed off the provisions that assure that community development funds are targeted and used in ways that put the funds into the areas with the greatest needs in short what the administrations changes in cdbg would have done would be to make this into another form of general revenue sharing in addition the administration proposed to put small city cdbg money under control of the states a move that even secretary pierce says the states are not prepared to cope with it is also a move that no city asked for and that an overwhelming number of small cities are opposed to we believe that community development block grants ought to be kept in their present form the program was developed after years of effort and in a bipartisan effort it has been subjected to thorough review by the committee most recently in 1980 we concluded that there is nothing to be gained and much to be lost by the radical changes put forward at the last moment by the administration likewise we rejected the notion of putting the urban development action grant program into a block grant in point of fact the arrangement proposed would have destroyed the merit of udag which is that it has a specific purpose for specific areas it is a highimpact program and its impact and effect would simply be frittered away if it were placed into a general revenue sharing type of program at a time when aid to cities for community development is going down taken as a whole the proposals for community development asked for by the office of management and budget and putatively supported by hud would merely create revenue sharing unders new name both parties have agreed for a decade that the cities need flexibility but they also need funds that are targeted and directed toward their areas of greatest need that is what community development block grants and udag does and that is the concept this bill preserves the housing and community development provisions of this bill are intended to keep essential programs alive some programs have been killed701 planning and others on the whole however our aid is to provide the greatest assistance to the areas and people of greatest need and in the most sensible way possible we have avoided any radical action we have been judicious and prudent we have met the requirements of the budget resolution this is a bill that has been painful to draw and ispainful for me to have to support but in the circumstances it is the best that can be done the housing and community development title is realistic and it merits your support i yield back to the distinguished chairman of the banking committee and in so doing want to take this opportunity to commend him and my colleagues for a splendid job under the most distressing and painful circumstances imaginable i yield back to the distinguished gentleman"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "let me first of all pay tribute to the chairman of the committee on the budget the gentleman from oklahoma for really having done a brilliant job in putting together the resolution which was reported out of our committee and which is under consideration today i think it is very important at this stage of the debate to be very clear as to exactly what the differences are between the two resolutions we are about to vote on if we eliminate tile differences between them which are due to differing economic assumptions it is quite clear that both the grammlatta substitute and thle house budget committee resoluition~ call for roughly the same level or federal spending in the next fiscal year and both of them therefore require roughly the same lcvel of reductions in federal spending the issue therefore is not whether to cut federal spending or for that matter even by how much to cut federal spending but where to cut the federal budget and how to cut the federal budget it seems to me that when we look at it in that respect it is very clear that the resolution reported out by the budget committee is infinitely more desirable by adding to defense interest and the socalled safety net programs thle grammlatta substitute decreases the allother categories of the budget from 28 1 percent of the total in 1981 to 17 9 percent in 1984 as the house budget committee resolution makes clear it is possible to cut the budget more equitably than the administration has done reagan is using budget cutting as an excuse for an attack on social programs cuts in afdc food stamps and medicaid will reduce the spendable income of over 7 5 million poor and working poor families at a time of high inflation and high unemnployment the proposed cap on medicaid will place an intolerable burden on states and localities and will inevitably result in service cutbacks the house budget committee restores 700 million and rejects the cap the proposed education block giantsi will cut 1 5 billion or 25 percent irn fiscal year 1982 the administration claims that increased efficiencies will result in the same level of service to our schoolchildren when administrative costs average 4 percent it is more realistic to assume savings on the order oi 1 or 2 percent rather than 25 percent the school districts which will suffer from these cuts will be those with the largest enrollments of lowincome students the budget committee restores 900 million or 15 percent of these education cuts the administration proposes 700 million in afdc cuts that eliminate the work incentive this cut is shortsighted and bad social policy the budget committee restores 500 million and preserves the work incentive the administration cuts 2 3 billion in child nutrition programs which will force many schools to elin~inate their school lunch and nutrition education programs altogether the budget committee restores 1 1 billion of these cuts and fully funds the wic program for mothers and infant cliiidren at a time when rental housing in urban areas is in short supply and rents rising the administration proposes to reduce subsidized housing from 250 000 units to 175 000 units the committee resolution funds a level of 250 000 units while we are still dependent on foreign energy supplies the administration proposes to rely on the inequitous technique of energy conservation through price grammlatta proposes to cut 1 billion from conservation and solar programs the committee restores 350 million for these programs qrammlatta suggests a cut of 25 percent in lowincome energy assistance the committee restores 400 million or 80 percent of these cuts finally grammlatta assumes that the strategic petroleum reserve can be entirely funded through the sale of bonds it is bad policy to rely totally on untested schemes in so important an area as quickly filling spro the committee provides for partial financing with government backup with the administration cuts we mortgage our future the latta proposal guts the guaranteed student loan and pell grant programs at a time when we must educate young people to be more productive in a world where our ability to compete is eroding the committee restores 650 million for these programs grammlatta guts ceta training at a time when minority youth unemployment is between 40 and 50 percent we will create a permanent underclass with this kind of proposal the committee restores 600 million for training grammlatta mainly assumes that the private sector will provide capital resources for highways railroads mass transit longterm scientific research and development and support for the arts and humanities it assumes the private bar will provide legal services for the poor the reason the federal government is involved in these activities is because the private sector cannot or will not afford them in all of these areas the committee assumes that there must be a federal presence equally bad is that grammlatta assumes the kemproth tax cut its obvious inequities aside kemproth is inflationary we need no more proof that the recent rise in interest rates which the administration is now blaming on the federal reserve the committee tax cut is smaller and more oriented to productivity than consumption when the economy declines further the administration will find another scapegoat in the end the american people will put the blame where it belongson poorly conceived and poorly implemented shortsighted reagan policies the real issue is whether we attempt to cut the budget on the backs of the poor the elderly the hungry the unemployed the deprived and the disabled or whether we move in a more equitable and compassionate manner as the committee budget resolution does i urge my colleagues to reject the republican budget amendment"], [0.0, 1.0, 1,

comment on the issue of striking official unitedstates coins to commemorate the 1984 summer olympics and raise money for our athletes than a former director of the mint for this reason i would like to direct your attention to a message i have received from another former mint director eva adams president kennedy appointed ms adams as director of the mint in 1961 at the completion of her first 5year term president johnson reappointed her to a second term which she served until august 1969 during her tenure at the mint ms adams launched a successful program to alleviate a nationwide coin shortage and supervised the construction of the new mint in philadelphia through her position on the joint commission on the coinage eva adams was frequently called upon to make recommendations to the president the congress and the secretary of the treasury on coinage and related problems ms adams oversaw the change from silver to clad coinage in 1965 she has received a number of awards for her outstanding work as mint director including the treasury departments exceptional service award in light of this considerable experience ms adams c9mments on the two olympic commemorative coin proposals now before congress are particularly noteworthy in her letter she endorses my bill h r 3879 which calls for a single silver dollar to be sold directly to the public by the mint the former director opposes the other proposal contained in s 1230 and h r 3958 which calls for the minting of numerous coins to be sold through private marketers ms adams objections to this legislation as outlined in her letter are very similar to those i have previously raised s 1230 and h r 3958 call for the minting of 25 different coins i have repeatedly stated my opposition to this provision multiple issues are confusing and discouraging to the buying public and the cost of owning a complete set of coins under this bill would be prohibitive as a result i fear that these coins will not sell ahd that the entire program will end in failure ms adams shares these concerns and worries that this unnecessarily elaborate program would place an unfair burden on the mints facilities as the mint has already been ordered to reduce its budget by 16 percent since the administration suggests that we all do more with less i wonder why s 1230 and h r 3958 suggest that we do less with more ms adams also opposes the private marketing of official unitedstates commemorative coins i believe that this provision will contribute to the high costs consumers will be forced to pay should this program get underway in addition i have frequently questioned the propriety of allowing the consortium of lazardfreres an international investment firm occidental petroleum and the franklin mint to market these coins it is not clear why this contract was made without the benefit of the competitive bidding process and as ms adams reminds us in her letter it was the private marketing of coins that led to the termination of commemorative coinage in 1954 both eva adams and i agree that the 1984 summer olympics should be marked by the minting of a commemorative coin americas olympic athletes have certainly earned our respect and they deserve our financial support however we would like to approve a sensible program to celebrate this event and raise money for our athletes the proposal set forth in s 1230 and h r 3958 is not the best way to achieve these goals i contend that the plan outlined in my bill h r 3879 is a much more realistic proposition former director of the mint eva adams

essential elements of president reagans program for economic recoverythe tax cut i would like to take this opportunity to express my unqualified support for the presidents tax plan as reflected in the conablehance bipartisan approach and which is urgently needed if we are to get our economy moving again and to put our nation back on the right track last novemver 4 when the amerclan people voted president reagan into office they did so because they were ready for a change they were and are fed up with high taxes inflation rising unemployment and astronomical interest rates they want a change from the misguided economic policies of the past the old policies of congress and previous administrations have failed the inflation and unemployment which we are experiencing were created by those old policies and are the continuing and visible evidence that more and more spending and more and more taxation will not work due to the failed policies of the past and the resulting inflation unemployment and high interest rates too many americans cannot afford the basic items which their parents could they cannot afford to buy cars or to purchases new homes they cannot afford the high rents of even higher mortgages the homebuilding industry has been forced to a virtual standstill and small businesses are in equally bad shape the small business administration estimated last year that 660 000 small businesses across the country would go under in 1980 yet some would have us continue on as we have done to repeat the mdstakes of the past we cannot and should not repeat those mistakes we cannot spend money which we do not have we cannot pile tax upon tax and say it benefits all americans but we have a choice we have a chance to change the past and the american people know this that is why they voted for a 0f =uge last november why they voted to put a new man in the white house president reagan haa listened to the voice of the american people and has since put forth a program of tax and spending cuts designed to put our country back on the road to economic recovery the centerpiece of the presidents tax program is a 25percentacrosstheboard cut in marginal income tax rates for all american when combined with other elements in the presidents tax package this will help restore the incentive to save and invest thus making more money available for mortgages and business loans this in turn will lead to the creation of more jobs during the past few days and weeks there has been extensive discussion regarding the merits of the various provisions contained in the presidents tax bill versus those contained in the alternative tax plans but that is not the issue the main issue is that the presidents bipartisan tax bill is the only tax plan which will provide real tax relief to all the american people not to one group or another not to some more than others but to all americans there are those wh6 feel however that a tax bill should not be designed for all americans but for groups of special interests let me point out one thing which we have forgotten and the people have remembered the total of all the special interests in america does not equal the public interest slanting tax cuts to favor one group and appealing to political and economic prejudice does not serve all americans yet that is what the opponent of the presidents tax plan have donethe old politics as usual we have proposals before us giving one group of taxpayers a special dea and then increasing taxes for another group in order to fund greater government spending that is wrong and americans know it is wrong and that is why over 500 coloradans called my office in support of the presidents tax plan and why 26 099or 86 percentof those who answered my districtwide questionnaire indicated they favored the presidents tax package the presidents tax cut plan of 25 percent across the board for 3 years followed by indexing is a real and permanent tax cut other plans would actually allow taxes to continue to increase for the american wage earner treasury department calculations show that at least a 22percent reduction in taxes is required by 1984 in order to offset the automatic increases caused by bracket creep and already scheduled hikes in social security payroll taxes therefore a 2year temporary tax cut of 15 percent is no tax cut at all tihe message from the american voters last fall was unmistakably clear the american people want a change in economic policy they want a tax cut as proposed by the administration and they want it now i agree with president reagan that we should not delay any longer in giving working citizens the kind of real tax relief which they want and need the democratic leadership of the house has already toyed too long with the presidents tax cut first the democratic leaders were not sure if any tax cut was necessary therk they decided a tax cut was needed but opposed the idea of a muiltiyear cut and now they support a 2year watered down version of the presidents tax plan with only a tentative cut in the third year i believe the american people deserve better than that they have already suffered too long from the shipshod policies of the federal goverrnent i urge my colleagues to act now to give the american people a breaka real break let us approve the tax plan of the administration which provides a

advice to read see them as they are and act accordingly i worry that in our collective rush our collective mandate to fix the economy to revitalize industry in short to make a political masterwork we forget the harshest most unforgiving critic much regulation in all fields has been approached idealistically foolishly unimaginatively stupidly dogmatically harmfully and this has firmly written the terms catch 22 and murphys law into the language but that means it should be made better not erased reality also is that the mine safety and health administration brought about a reduction in mining deaths of about 15 percent comparing last year with the year before the reduction is respectable and significant it shows regulation will work further reality is that the gao has attributed recent declines in coal production to labormanagement problems and failure to adopt new technology rather than to safety regulation and reality is that all mining activity particularly coal will increase greatly under the spur of developing markets and administration policy but no one has been nominated to direct the mine safety and health administration as yet grain elevators particularly the big export elevators will be more active now that the grain embargo is gone the 62 deaths of the 2 explosionfilled months 3 years ago came at a time of high activity reality has warned us australia and other grainexporting nations handle their elevators without such a high cost in blood and bone labor secretary donovan and occupational safety and health secretary auchter set aside careers as construction executives to work in government and they are aware of a reality that might have escaped most of the house the reality is that 20 percent of all jobrelated deaths in 1979 were in construction which accounted for only 5 percent of the industrial employment the primary cause falls one brand of dogmatic idealism that ignored reality led to regulatory excesses that needed correcting because many dealing with regulation thought only of what might be but correction is not in dogmatically applying another kind of idealism that seeks to write what might be in production

follows the administrations economic program consists of supertight money a fiscal 1982 expenditure cut of around 50 billion in which military increases areoffset by cuts in the social budget and a 148 billion a year income tax reduction when fully effective in 1984 heavily weighted toward personal income tax cuts for the affluent is the program equitable will it work is there an alternative neither the proposed budget cuts not the proposed tax cuts are equitable no doubt cuts in budgetary expenditures are needed they are needed because the mandate of the november 1980 election is qite clear cut expenditures reduce the present federal take of some 23 percent of gross national product budget cuts are desirable too because of the need to get the deficit under control only a budget deficitwhfch is under control can eliminate the treasurys need to borrow heavily to meet the deficit with a lowered deficit the nations savings could get through to the needed ultimate investment in plant and equipment so the question is not whether there should be budgetary retrenchment the question rather is on whom the burden should fdl and here even a cursory look at the reagan budget shows that a disproportionate part of the cuts fails upon those in the dawn of life the children those in the twilight of life the elderly and those in the shadows of life the disadvantaged the handicapped and the poor health programs are ruthlessly cut med icaid is slashed 1 2 billion which means not only less medical care for the needy but a greater burden thrust upon state and local governments

and the international dollar and in the next round inflation moreover even the uttle bit theoretically saved from current consumption may in todays inflation be spent by speculating in corporate takeovers or in commodit la such as bunker huntand his blillondollar silver manipulations the administration projects the 1984 workout of its policies as producing a balanced budget and inflation unemployment and interest rates all hovering around the 6 percent level the administration disdains econometric studies and derived its euphoric results largely by hoping or guessing that everyone

the assumptions the federal reserve would actually not keep money as tight as the administration is ordaining congress would not by its spending and taxing measures allow the kind of budget deficits that reagan arithmetic postulates so al of these projections fell to take reaganomics nt its word however forbidding the word might be so i asked the joint economic committee staff to put into the computer the reagan program without improving a line of it and out came the result unemployment no better than today inflation down to 8 percent but underlying inflationthe general trend of wage ratesstill at its present 9 percentplus level ~ and a budget deficit of 111 billion the greatest in history rather than a budget in balance what would be happening the computers were telling us was that the reductions in social spending would be more than outweighed by the increases in military spending and the reductions in income tax revenue the added deficits coupled with a very stringent monetary policy would bring about high inbierest rates and slow growth these in turn would further increase the deficit in short the republicans far from learning by the mistakes of the democrats seem doomed to repeat them in 196l the democratic ndministration combined guns and butterguns for a major war in vietnam butter for a whole gamut of new social programs and the result was years of stagflation now fourteen years later along come the republicans and want to repeat the same mistakeguns for the greatest peacetime increase n military spending in history and butter in the form of outsized tax reductions for the affluent with a resulting renewed bout of stagfiation and budgetary deficits a particularly unfortunate element in reaganomics is what it will do to income distr~budion it is too much perhaps to hope for the moment that amnerica can achieve a fairer income distribution a diminution of the gap between rich and poor and a closer approximation to the situation which prevails in countries like germany and japan but income distribution in the united states has been getting worse for the last 16 years and now is certainly no time to accelerate the worsening during 19651978 the share in the national income earned by the lowest quintile of american families the poor remained about even but only because of the treniendous increase in transfer payments such as health welfare education food and housing benefits asto the second and third quintilesthose making 10 00020 000 a year and 20 00030 000 a year today respectivelythey definitely lost their share of the national income declined from 28 percent to 26 percent the fourth quintile those in the 30 00040 000 bracket just about kept even and the top quintile not surprisingly absorbed what the lower middle income second and thi1rd quintiles were losing it raised its share of the national income from 42 percent to 44 percenta total of many billions of dollars under reaganomics the people in the lowest 60 percent are going to lose more the poor will have their transfer payments shorn the second and third quintiles dont have those transfer payments to lose but they will get piddling income tax cut benefitsthe reductions from keniproth will be swallowed by the increases in the payroill tax and in inflationary bracket creep being borrowers rather than lenders they will be hurt by a perpetual high interest rate regime and the tax loopholes that gladden the hearts of the upper income bracketsitemized deductions oil and real estate shelters investment creditsare simply not available to them the top ten percent of american families will profit mightily from reaganomics with the lowest 60 percent taking it on the chin this does not sound like a good way to keep up the demand necessary to take off the market what the economy can produce and thus avoid a recession nor does it seem a good way to make for social peace either in the central city or in the lower middleclass suburbs the view that rehganomics in not likely to w~ork is not held just by congressional democrats reaganomics is also viewed with some private skepticism by a good many congressional republicans ranging from those on the moderate wing who see super tight mones as a real barrier to the necessary growth to those on the conservative wing like the three conservative republican senators who outraged the white house by voting against the budget on the senate budget committee just before the april recess who fear with considerable reason a huge reagan budget deficit down the road and many a market letter from many a respectable wall street firm nowadays is pointing out that the markets are not exactly prophesying success for reaganomics as indicated by the fact that longterm interest rates auguries of inflation have been stead ily rising since the inaugural the president in hisstate of the economy address on february 18 asked anybody with a better alternative to step forward and present it very recently the democrats led by chairman jones of the house budget committee and chairman itostenkowskl of the house ways and means committee have done just that mr jones proposes a slightly gentler hand on social program budget cuts than mr reagansomewhat on the order of 10 percent rather than 25 percent cuts for economic development mass transit food stamps school lunches legal aid and so on by cracking down on military waste and by mandating a somewhat smaller tax cut mr jones is aiso able to reduce the 1982 reagan budget deficit of 40 billion to 25 billion mr rostenkowski would cut 1982 taxes by only 40 billion rather than by mr reagans 52 billion and would shift the benef its very modestly from those at the top of the income scale to those in the middle the democratic alternative represents as does the democratic party nowadays a pale and somewhat more human imitation of the republican programa little tougher on fatcats a little easier on thincats and a bit more responsible about the deficit in short an improvement if hardly a call to the barricades while the two great parties of the middle square off on the minutia of macroeconomics nothing much is being done about the structural problems of our economy yet it is in improving our economic structure that the game will be won or lost for even the most admirable monetary and fiscal policies are insufficient to bring both steady jobs and stable prices at the same time the structural aspects of costpush inflation productivity energy and national defense must be addressed 1 against inflation our only policy is supertight money by itself as thatchers england is proving it cannot lay a glove on inflation without creating unacceptable stagflation recession and unemployment yet the administrations freemarket mythology immobilizes it from addressing the wagepice spiral in steel in automobiles in coal and in a score of other major sectors there are overseas examples of what to do about costpush inflation that we seem intent on ignoring in austria the government has for ycara successfully worked a social contract in which labor and management agree on a compact which puts a productivityrelated ceiling on the spiral in holland the government has had a comprehensive system of wage and price controls in place for the last couple of years and inflation is today less than 7 percent 2 in productivity we have only a fragmentary policy though accelerated productivity increases are one of the best inflationfighters going republicans and democrats are generally agreed on the need for liberalized depreciation for business investments and on the simplification and reformp of regulatory excesses but labormanagementgovernment cooperation for productivity improvement is still frowned on despite the splendid results of cooperation in the two postwar miracleworkers germany and japan in lsth these countries labor has been weened away from inefficient workrules and management from concentration on shortterm and financial fetishism why not hfarerica nor does the reagan budget do anything noticeable for productivity infrastructure programsrebuilding america ruined streets and bridges and sewer systems and waterworks and railroads and utilities and mass transitis badly shortchanged so is manpower training and industrial research and development both public and private 3 the administration is considering killing the department of energy but there is precious little of an energy policy to kill to stand up to opecand in the process make ourself the hero of the nonoilproducing worldwe need to build up a

most important industry mr hagedorn was a strong advocate of president reagans tax plan and introduced legislation to assist unitedstates farm families in maintaining possession of their farmland through changes in the estate tax laws his proposals to allow unlimited transfer of property between spouses with no payment of estate or gift taxes and to allow special use valuation of farm property at the time of a farmers retirement rather than at death will help preserve the structure of the independently owned business and farm tom hagedorn is the ranking minority member on the livestock dairy and poultry subcommittee as such he has been very instrumental in dealing with the major problems confronting these vital industries his accomplishments include introduction of a bill requiring humane treatment of horses being transported for the intention of slaughter recommendations to secretary of agriculture and the industry concerning the control and eradication of pseudorabies in swine exhorting the department of agriculture to use all existing and potential outlets to dispose of surplus dairy products cosponsorship a bill suspending import duties of sulfa drugs necessary for use by hog producers in treating their herds in addition mr hagedorn was a cosponsor of a bill to make improvements in current food safety laws mr iiagedorn was an ardent supporter of a move to cancel the grain embargo and has advocated increasing agricultural exports abroad particularly dairy products finally rom hagedorn has been a tireless legislator in the development of the 1981 farm bill he sought to develop a bill which will provide adequate stability and income protection while trying to operate within the budget restrictions to develop appropriate modifications and improvements that will enhance basic agricultural programs tom coleman of missouri has been the leader on the republican side when it comes to the food stamp prograin as the ranking republican on the domestic marketing consumer relations and nutrition subcommittee he has been in the forefront for reform of the food stamp program while insuring that this program also helps those poor elderly and disabled who are truly in need it was through his efforts that the omnibus reconciliation act contained true legislative form of the food stamp program rather than the artificial savings originally reported by the budget committee the reconcillation act included such major reforms as mandating retrospective accounting and periodic reporting for food stamp recipients elimination of boarders and outreach from the program tightening of tie eligibility criteria and provisions for a block grant for nutritional assistance for puerto rico savings for fiscal year 1982 for the food stamp program exceeded 1 6 billion in the reconciliation act due to toms leadership an additional 700 million was saved through legislation contained in the farm bill total savings for 1982 for the food stamp program exceeded 2 3 billion because of tom colemans desire to make sure that the food stamp program serves only those truly in need he has watched closely the activities of local state and federal agencies who are responsible for both program administration and the elimination of fraud from the program through these activities tom has observed the activities of the department of agricultures office of the inspector general although this is the one agency charged with the responsibility for investigating criminal fraud in the food stamp program it did not have basic law enforcement authority for pursuit of criminal fraud the usdas office of inspector general has originated and participated in criminal investigations of food stamp fraud resulting in almost 800 indictments in fiscal year 1981 they uncovered activities in which food stamps were sold at a discount and the money used to buy such items as guns and illegal drugs tom coleman has stated that food stamps are used just like moneythat they are a second currency in this countryand that this type of involvement by criminals in a program for lowincome people must be stopped therefore he introducted h r 4530 the food stamp law enforcement act of 1981 this legislation which was incorporated into the 1981 farm bill will provide basic law enforcement authority for the usda office of the inspector general so that they may

ourselves in as negotiations go on this very afternoon to try to develop a budget compromise the situation is simple the president of the united states offered his budget several months ago almost everyone had improvements from their standpoint liberals wanted more social spending conservatives wanted less social spending liberals wanted higher taxes conservatives wanted a smaller deficit but it was a budget whatever one may say about the presidents first efforts they were in writing they were clear they were through and they represented his best first effort as he and his staff saw it at that time they were a starting point now several months later several monts during which interest rates have remained high during which economic anxiety has increased during which the people of america have worried we are at an impassean impasse we have been at almost from the day the president offered his budget the major cause of that impasse is in this body the house of representatives the liberal democartic leadership in this body has refused to produce any alternative budget they have produced criticisms they have produced counterattacks they have produced comments but they have not shown how they would solve the fundamental problems for the last 3 weeks the republican leadership in the house and the senate has been meeting with the democratic leadership in the house and the senate with the help and assistance of the white house team that effort going on day after day in negotiating sessions seeking to find an answer that will bring down the budget deficit that will bring down interest rates that will create new jobs that will restart the housing and automobile industriesthat effort is still going on but today thanks to the speakers comments yesterday the effort is a little more doubtful the chance of success is a little weaker frankly in an election year it is tempting for all of us to be partisan it is tempting for everyone to seek advantage for their party but the fact is that while we talk in washington people are laid off across the country while we talk in washington high interest rates cripple housing and automobiles while we talk in washington small businesses are forced into bankruptcy i hope that the people of america will decide that their congressmen and their senators should join in an effort to seek a compromise i hope that there will be a nationwide outpouring of telegrams and letters and phone calls demanding that both parties join in an effort to seek compromise surely the nations economy the jobs the hopes of the american people are too important for petty partisan advantage the current maneuvering is beneath the dignity of all of us it is beneath the dignity of a free people what we need is to get the options out in the open we need either in the next 2 days to see a true compromise or as a legitimate alterna tive we need to see a democratic budget we need to see a negotiating document which says here is how we would raise taxes here is how we would spend money this is what we would do differently than the president the economy of this country is too vital for mere partisan maneuvering it is legitimate to disagree about tax rates it is legitimate to disagree about spending on social programs it is legitimate to disagree on the size of the defense budget but it hurts all of us when one side the side which controls the house of representatives the democratic party hides behind a cover of no figures no documents no budget and simply nitpicks the presidents proposals hopefully this compromise effort will yield results in the next 2 days however if we return next week and there are no results there is no compromise then i think it is urgent in the name of saving jobs and in the name of selling cars and selling houses in the name of revitalizing the american economy and bringing down interest rates it is vital that the democratic leadership bring their budget out in the open so that the american people can

individual rates and so will benefit more from conablehance than from the committee bill how much more well about 40 percent by 1984 second depreciation conablehance is a better system it is fairer and simpler it provides greater benefits for small business and in a clear easytouse way the committees bill contains complicated hardtounderstand provisions and apply rules which change from year to year as it is phased in what about the smallest companies with no taxable income conablehance liberalizes the leasing rules so these companies can share in the benefits of acrs depreciation the committees depreciation provision does nothing for these companies what about used equipment many small businesses can only afford used equipment conablehance increases the amount eligible for the investment tax credit to 150 000 the committee on the other hand phases out the credit altogether third let us take accounting problems here is one area that really increases costs to small companies

president reagan called it an empty promise the republican package does just what its proponents claim it provides a real acrosstheboard federal tax reduction the committee bill endorsed by the liberal democratic leadership of the house is merely a political ploy to maintain the discredited status quo and create an obstacle in the path of president reagans program for economic recovery it is no more than an attempt to follow the businessasusual approach that the liberal majority in this house has followed for the last 25 years the american electorate soundly rejected the old liberal policy of taxing spending and electing at the polls last november now the leadership of the house is giving us the opportunity to again reject that stilldiscredited policy by voting down the committee bill and voting in favor of the conablehance substitute it seems that we have a problem of interpretation here let me attempt to clear it up when a conservative says he supports a tax cut he means just that a tax cut but when our liberal friends uncharacteristically begin talking about a tax cut they mean something else in this case they mean an elaborately designed package which will actually bring about a tax increase a couple of years down the road in looking over the ways and means committee bill i note that my own state of ohio will be penalized nearly 100 million in the next 3 years i do not buy that and i will not support it like most of my colleagues i listened to president reagans address on monday evening and to the democrat rebuttals which followed i was surprised to hear one of my colleagues from the other side of the aisle proudly proclaiming that the democrats had enacted five tax cuts over the last 10 years surprised because federal taxes have actually increased by more than 400 billion in those 10 years i would imagine that most american taxpayers shared that surprise as they recalled handing over 25 or 30 or 40 percent of their income to the federal government in the form of taxes i was also surprised that my democratic colleagues chose to argue that the republican tax bill is geared toward the wealthy any member of congress who has followed tax legislation knows full well that threefourths of the republican tax cut will go to middleincome taxpayers those individuals who now pay 72 percent of all taxes will be the beneficiaries of 74 percent of the tax cut opponents of the conablehance substitute also claim that they are supporting a real tax reduction which will provide needed relief to the american taxpayers yet they fail to mention the builtin tax increase which will occur in the next 3 years as a result of inflation and the increase in payroll taxes the ways and mean committee bill provides for a 2year 15percent tax reduction while the 3year tax increase is estimated to be 22 percent you do not have to be a phi beta kappa to understand that the democrat tax package calls for a tax increase i would also like to briefly comment on the democrat claim that their bill is a tax bill for the average american taxpayer and the small businessman it is funny that my liberal colleagues should all of a sudden become the protector of the working man i do not know about the rest of the country but the working people in my state blame the congress for their economic troubles and the congressmen who have been writing the tax laws for the last 25 years are democrats those very democrats who gave us those five mythical tax cuts in the 1970s and those multibilliondollar federal deficits and that trillion dollar national debt and now they are the party of the working man i find that a little hard to swallow let us talk about the working productive american for a moment the autoworker who faces a 30percent unemployment rate in his industry the construction worker who in sonmc areas faces a 50percent unemployment rate how do you suppose it came to be that he has become increasingly concerned about whether or not his job will be there tomorrow whether or not he can make that house payment whether or not he can feed his family is it because the government taxed him too little is it because the government allowed him to keep too much of his money and spend it as he sees fit i think not if i had my way we would go even further on this tax cut we would cut deeper enough compromises have been made already if we are really

would like to take this opportunity to express my support for the efforts of this group to contribute to a peaceful resolution of the conflict in northern ireland the friends of ireland came together primarily out of concern over the violence prevailing in northern ireland our objective is not only to develop a close working relationship with the republic of ireland but also to inform the american public of all aspects of the conflict working toward a solution which will respect the rights and traditions of all the inhabitants of northern ireland two recent events relating to northern ireland seem to me to hold out hope for an end to the fighting the first is the result of a poll conducted by the london sunday times among the people of northern ireland which offers a revealing glimpse of the mood and aspirations of both catholics and protestants more important it suggests promising directions for future talks the sunday times poll shows that contrary to the stereotypes arising out of the endless violence the vast majority of the people of northern ireland are strongly opposed to the use of violence to achieve political ends even the tiny violentminded minority has declined radically in the past few years negotiations toward an adequate political solution would receive overwhelming popular support right now furthermore the results of the poll show that although the majority and minority have radically different views of the ideal settlement there is common ground between them two thirds of all respondents representing a crosssection of the population indicated that they would aecept a settlement based on an independent assembly with powersharing guarantees for the catholic minoritythe principle embodied in the sunningdale agreement in 1973 which was blocked at the time by extremist elements eight years of violence are a powerful argument against extremists on both sides other poll results indicate that the political polarization which led to the election of irish repuiblican army terrorists and protestant hardliners in the last election has decreased and may diminish further if moderation ii 4493 results in progress toward a settlement however continuation in the status quo may cause this conciliatory mood to evaporate especially among the catholic minority the sunday times poll notes a vast and growing gulf between the catholic community and the british government the british army originally welcomed as protectors by an embattled minority have earned the fear and dislike of most catholicsnot just the ira and its sympathizers this gulf however could narrow if the government demonstrates a willingness to make concessions to the minority point of view abandoning the narrowmindcd approach which is leading to increased tension in the province a second event may provide a chance to end the current stalemate membe~rs of the irish commission on justice and peace an agency of the catholic church in the republic have succeeded in drafting a settlement which would end the hunger strikes in the maze prison and lessen the tension between the two sides brought on in part by the propaganda victories of the ira i join many of my colleagues in congress in urging that prime minister thatcher and her government review the opportunities presented by this draft and consider the advantages of waiving their insistence on points which serve only to limit british op1 tions in pursuing an end to the violence in its approach to the conflict in northern ireland mrs thatchers government has concentrated on controlling the activities of the ira british government officials in northern ireland appear to view their role as that of the forces of law battling terrorists criminally masquerading as political dissidents in this light better policing may seem to be the key to suppressing the violence however the catholic community has been understandably uncooperative with this effort in the bloody context of irish history the catholic minority cannot see british attempts to stabilize an unsatisfactory social order as anything but continued oppression for the catholics the army brought british rule without british justice due process and protection of individual rights britains most revered legacy to america are notoriously absent from proceedings against alleged terrorists in northern ireland the right to trial by jury protections against selfincrimination the right to counselall are abridged or suspended in the socalled diplock courts set up under the prevention of terrorism act accused terrorists are tried and usually convicted by a single judge as many as 90 percent of convictions are obtained solely on the basis of confessionselicited after an average of 3 days of detention followed by months of waiting for trial in an atmosphere tainted by repeated charges of physih 4494 co cal abuse and psychological torture under the judges rules prevailing in the rest of the united kingdom or under any reasonable judicial system these confessions would be considered highly suspect in the diplock courts they result in a conviction rate of 94 percent most of those arrested and convicted under these procedures are catholic the british government dismissed bobby sands and his compatriots as common criminals perhaps they were but they were not convicted under common conditions bobby sands it is said had a string of murders and terrorist attacks on his conscience he was convicted only of being present in a car in which a gun was found for which he was sentenced to 14 years in jaila term which anywhere else in england would be considered presposterous the british goverrnent claims he was just a common thug but it has never adequately proved that to a jury of his peers let alone the world is it any wonder that men convicted under special procedures demand special treatme t mrs thatcher has refused to negotiate with the prfsoners in the maze in her words one of the most humane and liberal prison systems in the world on principle one does not negotiate with terrorists since the british government has already waived so many of the basic principles of british justice in northern ireland however one may wonder why this particular principle is of such overriding importance that it must be upheld at the cost of continuing bloodshed at any rate the british government does not object as a rule to negotiating with terrorists lord carrington the british foreign minister recently stated that he was willing to meet with noted terrorist yasir arafat in the interests of peace in the middle east inspired negotiations with rhodesian terrorists led to the birth of the nation of zimbabwe a proud achievement of british foreign policy however suppose the british instead of negotiating with mugabe and his associates had instead cordoned off the suburbs of salisbury and announced that they would defend forever the inhabitants right to remain within the british empire meanwhile allowing this little enclave to govern itself in a fashion repugnant to the principles of british democracy would they be as eager to denounce the violent response of black dissidents as terrorism terrorism cannot be condoned under any circumstances the vicious behavior of the ira and of the ulster volunteer force serves no legitimate purpose it only poisons the atmosphere and adds to the fear and suffering of the people whose rights these organizations supposedly champion as mrs thatcher has accurately pointed out these terrorist groups are engaged chiefly in deny ng others their first right the right to life random violence and brutal often misdirected retaliations have taken the lives of thousands of innocents since the fighting began in 1969 1 am proud that the efforts of prominent irishamerican politicians have succeeded in dimninishing the american base of support for ira operations and i hope that by participating in the activities of the friends of ireland i will help to diminish that support still further americans of irish descent must understand that support for the ira whether direct or channeled through organizations such as the irish northern aid society recently ordered by a federal district court to register as an agent of the ira can only inflict further suffering on tht people of northern ireland catholic as well as protestant aid to extremists will only thwart any efforts to moderate the conflict and end the violence mrs thatchers government has stated that it considers its prime responsibility in northern ireland to be protection of the lives of its citizens all other considerations are secondary this is an approach made in good faith to a tragic and seemingly intractable political impasse and it is true that the violence has abatedat least outside the detention centerssince the terrifying days when the british army first marched in to rescue the catholics of bogside from their fellow citizens however the authoritarian attitude carries with it certain risks selective protection of rights under an arbitrary system of justice amounts at best to order without law in short tyranny clearly the catholic community sees it that way the sunday times poll shows that the catholic community in belfast overwhelmingly disapproves of the british governments handling of the situation in northern ireland their profound and increasing alienation is demonstrated in the same poll by increasing despair about the prospect of peace in the future especially among the young after hundreds of years of oppression and 50 years of gerrymandering discrimination and the hostility of the ruling class the catholic minority took its cue from the american civil rights movement of the sixties and began to march for civil rights and an equitable share of power in the local government this movement was met almost immediately with violence in 1969 as in 1914 the extremists of the ruling order were the first to arm mrs thatchers government in denouncing the undeniable atrocities of the ira should keep in mind what the catholics of belfast and bogside have never forgottenthat the provisional ira was born out of catholic fear to defend the minority against the ulster police and their auxiliary thugs mrs thatcher justifies her attitude toward the ira by saying that ~ if 1 the bomb is seen to succeed then the terrorist has beaten the ballot box 0 but the catholics of northern ireland have never had much success with the ballot box people who cannot turn to statesmen for protection will inevitably turn to terrorists the ira will continue however unjustly to win the propaganda war until the british government can offer its citizens more than the unpalatable choice between repression and lawlessness in 1969 the catholic minority demanded civil rights and found itself in danger of mass violence the british government has protected their lives to a certain extent but their original aspirations civil rights and equitable representation have been all but forgotten in the drive to impose order on an unresolved conflict most catholics now identify the british army as an ally of the other side the claim that british rule weighs equally heavily on the protestant majority is hardly credible to a people who remember that the arrival of the army was followed by mass internment a barbaric action directed almost exclusively against the catholic community or who listen to the pronouncements of a government which alternates assurances to the majority that their wishes will forever be respected with denunciations of the ira as the root of all evil in the province more years of military rule in northern ireland will have anything but a stabilizing effect continuation of the present order can only result in further alienation of the catholic community perpetuate violence and increase despair it is time to stop wasting the lives of british soldiers and irish civilians trying to maintain an unworkable status quo the settlement drafted by the irish commission for justice and peace offers a ray of hope in the grim impasse between british prison authorities and ira prisoners i urge the government to seize this opportunity it is rare for the ira to show signs of moderation such concessions must be rewarded if northern irish politics are to recover from their sectarian paralysis the people of northern ireland are weary of violence most would be ready to accept a reasonable settlement concessions on both sides would improve the climate for achieving such a settlement and lighten the despairing view of the future held by most of the catholic minority this chance is too important to be thrown away for the sake of a hypocritical and inconsistent principle sidney smith a british essayist of the 19th century once observed sourly thatthe moment the very name of ireland is mentioned the gnglish seem to bid adieu to common feeling common prudence and common sense and to act with the barbarity of tyrants and the fatuity of idiots unfortunately the history of british rule in ireland bears out this bitter view the british government is no mere impartial peacekeeping force the army bias in favor of one side has become so obvious that one observer has characterized its role as that of the third combatant britain bears a heavy responsibility for the distrust and hatred prevailing in northern ireland today so far the response of the british government to the irishi commission proposal has been discouraging while british authorities remain intransigent even on symbolic concessions another hunger striker has died the terrorists of the ira in abandoning the demand for political status have shown themselves more willing to make concessions than the government which holds them prisoner casting doubt on mrs thatchers claim to flexibility and putting the government at a severe disadvantage in its efforts to discredit the ira dr garret fitzgerald the irish prime minister has pointed out that the greatest responsibility must as always rest on those with the greatest power 0 i amn encouraged by dr fitzgeralds determination to make a settlement in northern ireland the highest priority of his new government and i urge the president of the united states to join with the government of eire in calling upon the british government to act now in good faith to end the crisis before a new wave of violence ravages northern ireland the world hailed the british settlement in zimbabwe under equally difficult circumstances i hope and pray that at this crucial juncture mrs thatchers goveniment will act with equal clearsightedness and compassion"], [0.9999990267721159, 9.732278840601793e-07, 1, "i am pleased to rise in support of and advocate for passage of this legislation which is critical to the fiscal health and economic wellbeing of the district of columbia h r 4910 seeks to make certain technical and clarifying amendments to the home rule act with respect to the issuance f general obligation bonds and notes and revenue bonds and notes as well as other obligations passage of this legislation would accomplish three major and necessary goals it willfirst eliminate the legal impediments to a successful public offering of d c bonds notes and other obligations second make those technical and conforming amendments which are necessary to resolve several ambiguities relating to the procedures for authorizing and issuing d c bonds notes and other obligations and third give the district of columbia government debt management flexibility comparable to that afforded many other jurisdictions from the beginning of home rule the district has had the authority to issue taxexempt bonds and notes while none have been issued to date passage of this legislation will place thedistrict well on the road to entry into the bond market this proposed legislation does not significantly nor materially alter any provision of the home rule act but simply removes certain ambiguities and legal hurdles which have been noted by the district government and its excellent bond counsel one of the major legal hurdles the district has experienced in contemplating a bond issue is the inability to pay for certain necessary planning costs this inability is due to the current definition of the term capital project in the home rule act section 1 of the bill amends that definition to include certain costs which are not now expressly included reimbursement of expenses for planning payment of incidental financing costs and expenditure for the purchase of equipment or furnishings is expressly provided in the definition these costs are typically included in capital projects in the states the district is simply being placed on equal and in my view firmer footing in this area another legal hurdle lies in the appropriations process for the district because of the line item congressional review of the districts budget there is a cloud of doubt on certainty of payment for bond issues marketing the bonds would thus be difficult the bill removes the annual formal ity of congressional enactment of debt service appropriations and provides assurance to bondholders that bond proceeds will be available as needed under current law debt service payments must be made opi an equal basis this rigid requirement results in limited access to the bond market section 8 of the bill deletes the level debt service requirement thus allowing greater flexibility and improving the prospects for success for district bond issues negotiated sales of bonds is permitted under this legislation the bill also authorizes the issuance of general obligation notes in anticipation of revenues thus positioning the district to respond more easily to cash flow problems the prohibition in subsection b of section 490 of the home rule act against the mortgaging of property as additional security for an issue of revenue bonds is removed by provisions of h r 4910 removal of these legal hurdles is necessary to assure success of district bond issues there are other clarifying and enhancement provisions embodied within h r 4910 one of the important features of this bill is to shore up section 490 of the home rule act which allows in part certain classes of organizations including our local colleges and universities to request the district to issue taxexempt revenue bonds in their behalf a new subsection a of section 490 would remove a perceived limitation and permit the district to issue revenue bonds or notes for refinancing or assistance in refinancing of undertakings by such organizations whether and how referendums on bond issues is to be conducted is unclear under current provisions of the home rule act the bill clarifies the process of referendum when issuing general obligation bonds by mandating that the district of columbia council establish a firm policy questions have been raised about the federal governments obligation to repay the districts debts from a bond issue in the event the district fails to do so h r 4910 affirmatively states that the full faith and credit of the united states is not pledged to the payment of principal or interest on any bond note or other obligation issued by the district because of these impediments to the districts entry into the bond market that i have described the district goverrnent has had no alternative but to continue to borrow funds at a premium from the unitedstates treasury to finance its capital improvements this borrowing authority will expire on october 1 1982 or on the date of enactment of the d c appropriations act for fiscal year 1983 whichever is later if the congress is to avoid a further extension the district must be given the legal means of accessing the municipal bond market passage of h r 4910 will remove the impediments and will facilitate less dependence by the district onthe unitedstates treasury a goal which all of us share the provisions of h r 4910 will in no way relieve the district from adequately addressing and resolving all financial problems and satisfying the creditworthiness tests of the municipal bond market bond ratings will be necessary and the district must convince potential investors that it will sustain balanced annual budgets and develop and pursue an acceptable method of eliminating the existing accumulated operating deficit in short the market will ultimately determine whether the bonds can be sold or not it should also be noted that the 14percent limit on the use of bonds as contained in the home rule act remains in place on november 12 1981 following the hearing the subcommittee met to mark up h r 4910 the bill was approved without objection and ordered favorably reported to the full committee together with any technical amendments deemed necessary by counsel on november 17 1981 the committee on the district of columbia met to mark up h r 4910 the bill was approved with four technical amendmnents by unanimous vote and ordered reported to the 11ouse h r 4910 is a bipartisan effort to further assist the district of columbia to achieve a level of financial responsibility and independence commensurate with that of many other jurisdictions while this bill does not dramatically change existing provisions of the home rule act it enactment could cause a dramatic result the amendment and repealer provisions lof this bill are not major are noncontroversial but are desperately needed you may note that some of the provisions of this bill are similar to provisionscontained in h r 1807 the socalled deficit financing bill which has also been passedby the house district committee passage of this bill however does not forestall the pressing need for passage of h r 1807 and i remain hopeful that this congress will soon take up that legislation h r 4910 together with h r 1807 can mean a healthy economy for the district of columbia thank you"],

lndicatts the american willingness to save has substantially decreased over the last 10 years by the end of 1978 the rate of disposable income savings in the united states reached a 30year low of under 5 percentfar less than any other western democracy for example great britain has a 13percent savings rate west germany 15 percent and japan 25 percent each of these countries offers generous tax concessions or government bonuses to savers the importance of savings to productivity and our overall economy cannot be overstated onethird of all the capital in this country is made available through personal savings without adequate savings there cannot be sufficient investments in industry small business and home construction the result is higher consumer prices and increased unemploymnent last year recognizing this critical need to stimulate savings the congress enacted two measures that gradually raised the interest a person could receive on his or her savings deposits and allowed 200 400 for couplesof that interest to be taxfree for a 2year experimental period unfortunately while these two landmark laws represented a positive shift in unitedstates economic policy they have not resulted in any noticeable rise in personal savings interest rates on savings deposits have remained close to their original levels and as feared the 200 400 temporary interest tax exclusion does not seem to be enough of an incentive to save in fact studies show that an estimated 95 percent of all the money saved in america is earned by individuals and businesses whose interest and dividends income exceed the 200 400 limit earlier this year i introduced a bill h r 3049 to remedy this situation my legislation would make permanent the current 200 400 tax exclusion on interest and dividends and raise it to 1 000 2 000 for savings interest only in addition my bill would allow all persons age 65 and over to earn taxfree interest on their savings deposits the conablehance substitute offers similar relief aimed at providing a shortterm and much needed boost to our slumping savings and loan and thrift industry under the terms of this legislation depository institutions would be authorized to issue 1year taxexempt savings certificates they would allow single taxpayers to earn as much as 1 000 2 000 for couplesin taxfree interest the certificates which would cost 500 and above would yield 70 percent of the interest rate on 52week treasury bills and would be available for a 15month period beginning on october 1 the certificate would allow depository institutions to retain and attract many of the investment dollars that have recently gone to competing investment opportunities that currently offer higher returns i might add that these pavings certificates are far more prefprable than a proposal that has been offered to lower the returns on competing money market funds rather than penalizing the small saver by eliminating one of their few opportunities to get a fair market return on his or her dollar additional investment opportunities should be made available the taxexempt savings certificates provide such an opportunity as an original member of the house select aging committee i would like to emphasize however that these taxexempt savings certificates are not the final solution to our nations dismal savings rate especially as it relates to the elderly first the certificates would only be offered for a 15month period allowing the troubled depository institutions to revitalize thermselves over a 2year period but falling to provide any longterm relief for either the institutions or the saver second many senior citizens cannot afford to tie up 500 or more of their savings for a 1year period they depend heavily on their savings to pay for daily living expenses including emergency medical needs under the proposed certificate plan a person would receive stiff interest penalties for withdrawing funds early i favor a more flexible savings incentive plan that would incorporate the taxexempt savings certificate idea with the bill i authored providing acrosstheboard taxfree interest for senior citizens unfortunately i am restricted by the rule from offering such a compromise proposal in the form of an amendment as a result i am supporting the taxexempt certificate plan as the most responsible plan under these circumstances and another major step toward permanent and meaningful small saver relief we must not forget however that savings interest represents nearly 25 percent of the total income for persons age 65 and over in additions twothirds of all savings accounts in the united states belong to persons 5 years and older certainly then any longterm small savers relief should address the special needs of our elderly that is why i continue to offer my bill h r 3049 as an effective solution to the savings rate problem in our nation let me finally express my support for the additional savings incentive contained in the substituteincreased retirement investment opportunities under the conablehance amendment the current 1 500 limit on individual retirement account ira contributionrq would be increased to 2 000 2 250 for couples in addition for the first time employees contributing to an employersponsored pension plan could also claim the 2 000 2 250 ira tax deduction in addition the maximum tax deductible contributions to selfemployment keogh retirement plans would double from 7 500 to 15 000 both of these retirement savings in centives are expected to attract millions of new savings dollars while allowing individuals to plan for a more financially secure retirement simply stated increased savings by americans will do as much to stimulate our economy and increase productivity as any other economic tool the conablehance substitute provides responsible and effective tax incentives for savings and i urge that it be adopted today 9"], [0.9999975869600348, 2.413039965176722e-06, 1, "i was absent from the

to the initiative in this house that was so boldly undertaken many months indeed years ago to get the bureaucracy of the federal government under control and to make it more responsible to the desires and wishes of the american people the reason i take this special order and begin this discussion is that for reasons which are unexplained to me and i think unexplainable the initia tives that have been launched in this direction have ground to a silent and mysterious halt someplace in the halls of this house what is regulatory reform all about mr speaker it is a method a means by which the american people seek to regain control over their own government the fact of the matter is that more decisions are made more rules and regulations are issued by unelected officials affecting the lives and the livelihood of all americans than there are as a result of laws passed by the congress of the united states during the average session of a congress somewhere in the neighborhood of 500 laws are passed during that same period of time almost 20 000 rules and regulations can be passed the ratio of those rules and regulations having the force and effect of law on nonelected officials as compared to those made by those elected by the people of the united states is something to contemplate much of the cynicism that the american people feel about their government is a result of the unaccountability of a bureaucracy that is remote insensitive arbitrary and sometimes yes oppressive it was out of this concern that members of congress both in the house and the other body rose up and said that we are going to change this in a bipartisan way members of my party democrats took the initiative in this effort originally to bring the bureaucracy under control through a streamlining and accountability even through the use of the legislative veto which lets members of the congress elected by accountable to the people have the final say so by reviewing and where necessary rejecting and vetoing regulations issued by unelected bureaucrats in 1975 when that issue of legislative veto first came to the floor of this house for a vote up or down on all agencies that should be covered by it 265 members of this house voted in favor if it since that time for reasons again unexplained and unexplainable there has never been an effort made to get that legislation back to this floor for action even though over a majority of the members of this house of both parties have cosponsored legislation to that effect we have amended pieces of legislation on an itembyitem basis to place this mechanism in effect to get control over these unaccountable bureaucrats and it has had an improving impact on our government recently we added this type of control over the federal trade commission different programs in the environmental protection agency and the department of agriculture but the need to make the entire bureaucracy accountable to the american people still remains in years gone past while the house of representatives has moved forward the other body has been reluctant the other body has been the one that has failed to pass this legislation but this year this year the other body by a unanimous vote adopted legislation providing for regulatory reform including a legislative veto what has happened in this house mr speaker what has happened i think is a shame because it reflects upon the members and the leadership of this house what has happened is that although regulatory reform legislation was reported out of the judiciary committee on february 25 of this year that legislationa major bipartisan effort to return control of the bureaucracy to the american peoplehas not yet been able to be voted on by the members of this house the legislative veto legislation h r 1976 which has over 250 cosponsors well over a majority of the members of this house of both parties has yet to be considered in committee or brought to the floor of this house i think it is regrettable that for reasons that cannot be explained there are those in power in this house who have been unwilling to let the voice of the american people be heard who have been unwilling and refuse to understand the force behind more than a majority of the members of this house seeking to have this opportunity to make the bureaucracy accountable and the cynicism of the american people persists about who runs their governmentis it the elected officials or the unelected bureaucrats then that cynicism is understandable and will grow until the members of this house are given the opportunity to do their will and to express the desires of the american people i think you are going to see more and more fingers pointed at the leadership of this house asking the question why is it that legislation which would require accountability on the part of unelected bureauracts is being locked in a closet pigeonholed and not even given the opportunity for consideration i suggest that there are members of this house who in november when the people get an opportunity to go to the polls and express their concerns about the future of this nation are going to hold the leadership of this house and members of this body accountable for once again frustrating the opportunity and the will and the desire of the american people to be heard on this matter what can be so wrong with a piece of legislation that passed the other body by a unanimous vote by people of both conservative and liberal persuasion by the most conservative senators and by the most liberal senators indeed the senators from your own state the commonwealth of massachusetts supported this legislation as it came through the other body what can be wrong with legislation like that that it is not even possible to let the members of this body speaking on behalf of the american people have that chance to bring accountabflity i do not know what you hear when you go to your district but one of the things that i hear is that the american people are fed up with a bureacracy that will not listen with people who control their lives and livelihood whose names they do not know and if they did could not hold them accountable that is not a phenomenon of this administration or the last administration or the administration before that that is a fact of life about the government we have the american people under our system of government are entitled to look to their elected officials and not be put upon solely by the unelected officials yes there are many indeed most of the people in the civil service of this country are dedicated and reasonable and committed individuals many of whom serve at a sacrifice for the american people and consider themselves public servants but there are others who because of this unaccountability have delegated to themselves decisionmaking powers an imposition on the american people that is unwarranted asi said this is not a liberal or a conservative issue some people have suggested that it is an approach that would favor business as opposed to consumers or environmental groups or public interest groups nothing could be further from the truth it is a twoedged sword the voice of the people can be heard through their elected officials when they cannot even get in the front door of many agencies of government there are many regulations which have been issued by this administration undoing the gains and accomplishments in the field of consumer protection or environmental protection but environmentalists and consumer advocates would have had the opportunity to deal with through regulatory reform and legislative veto just as in other instances the excesses of zealots who have gone too far could have been curbed and restrained and made accountable to the american people where those who did not suffer the inconvenience of running for public office have taken it to themselves to pass rules and regulations affecting every aspect of the life of the american public so therefore i appeal to you i urge you bring this legislation to the floor of this house it would take no more than a word from you for this legislation to come forth and let the members of this house work their will upon it on behalf of the american people failing to do that i fear that many members of this house in the elections that are coming up later this year are going to have to answer to the fact why it was that that which was wanted and desired by the american people control over their own government accountability of the federal bureaucracy was not even given the fair opportunity to be votcd on even through a majority of the members of this house have sponsored legislation to do that that is no way to run a democratic institution and if people have to pay a price for that failure of democracy then it is an appropriate price to be paid the american people want their government to be accountable to them it is indeed a government of the people and by the people and in that way it can be a government for the people therefore i urge you do that which the members of your house the members who elected you speaker of their house have asked for let the regulatory reform legislation and the legislative veto opportunity come to this house so that the members can join with their counterparts in the other body pass this legislation and help restore true democratic principles to our government"], [0.9999969179802974, 3.082019702560501e-06, 1, "the bill h r 1029 would amend section 1 of the act of june 5 1920 to authorize the secretary of commerce to

department of commerce in an executive communication dated july 6 1977 it is identical to the bill h r 234 in the 96th congress which was the subject of a f avorable report by the department of the

ocean survey an agency of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration of the department of commerce shall be found to be responsible this authority does not extend to a negligent or wrongful

authorized settlements from 500 to 2 500 the bill in increasing the dollar amount for authorized settlements from 500 to 2 500 will provide the authority to settle claims arising from the many diversified scientific endeav6rs and experiments of that administration the settlements could be made where the claim arose from damage clearly caused by activities of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration and the qovernment has a moral obligation to compensate the injury even though there may be an absence of negligence the examples of such activities as described in the report of the department of commerce included weather instrument operations such as the radiosonde this is a 3pound device that is sent into the atmosphere by balloon which after reaching 5 or 6 miles in altitude is returned to the ground by parachute in most instances the instrument reaches the earth surface without incident and many of them are recovered as a freefalling object however there is a possibility that the instrument could frighten domestic animals or have other possible effects during marine surveys coastal hydrographic ships operate in areas where fishing occurs and despite precautions fishing nets lobster pots or other fishing gear may be damaged the national earth satellite service of noaa has command and data acquisition stations et gilmore creek alaska and wallops

may be used for several months and it is possible that damage could be done to the land and its appurtenances the existing language in section 853 of title 33 of the united states code which provides for the settlement of claims up to 500 has performed a valuable function over the years since enacting in 1920 to provide compensation to persons injured from activities similar to those outlined above the increase of that authority to the amount of 2 500 is a realistic increase in view of current costs which can be expected in the event of damage claim further the activities of the national

separate offense and consecutive sentencing in felonies involving the use of a firearm or other deadly weapon under current law anyone who uses or carries a firearm when committing a felony as defined by federil law must be sentenced to not less than 1 year and not more than 10 years in addition to the sentenuce imposed for the underlying felony it self under this law it is possible for th~ose convicted to receive a suspended selitence a probationary sentence and also parole second or subsequent convictions require a sentence of an additional 2 to 25 years and the court does not have the discretion to suspend it or impose a probationary sentence howeyer parole is still possible the purpose of my bill is to see that those convicted of carrying a firearm or other deadly weapon do not avoid imprisonment as we have discovered through experience leaving the length of the prison sentence to the discretion of the court often allows offenders to return to society after having received few if any ipcnaltie8 for their crimes free to resume their criminal activity because of the uncertainty of imprisonment the offender knows the chances nre great that even if convicted he will spend little time in prison and once again he will be out on the streets victimizing innocent hardworking productive members of society it is this injustice that i propose to help remedy with my biill the most important provision of h r 35 imposes a mandatory minimum sentence on anyone convicted and it removes the possibility of parole specifically the first time a person is convicted of coznmittinv a felony with the use of a dangerous weapon he would receive not less than a 1year prison sentence which would be served in its entirety in addition to any other sentence for the commission of the crime itself a felon who is convicted a second time would receive a minimum 5year prison term over and above any other prison sentence while these provisions remove any discretion by the judge in sentencing below the minimum or granting a suspended or probationary sentence the court does retain discretion as to thle length of the sentence so long as it remains within the minimum and maximum set by law however and i wish lo stress this point no matter what length the sentence it must be served in its entirety in prison once the sentence has been imposed the judge may not suspend it or any part of it nor may he grant a probationary sentence for any part of it nor may the felon be paroled the number of years the judge declares as sentence in court will be tile number of years served by the felon in prison i do not regard my bill as the soiution to our societys problems with crime i do believe however that my proposal will be more effective in putting those who are a danger to our society in prison than our present system under my proposal the risk of imprisonment is increased by the certainty of punishment whereas under the present law the chance exists that a person convicted of a crime will not have to serve any time at all there is no certainty of punishment and very little risk which might serve to deter unlawful behavior also if penalizing the use of dangerous weapons during the commission of a felony has any deterrent effect at all it could well have a larger effect on deterring crime in general by deterring the use of weapons the law is punishing the criminals means of coercion if he is deterred at all he will be less likely to commit crimes of coercion since he will be less likely to carry a weapon i urge the support of my colleagues for h r 35 e hi 529"]],

amendment is in the best interest of the futures industry and the commodity futures trading commission i urge my colleagues to support this amendment h r 5447 contains two new sections of the commodity exchange act that are intended to facilitate the tr sfer of the cftcs registration program to the industrywide registered futures associationthe national futures association nfa the first provision is specifically targeted toward futures associations new section 17 o would authorize the cftc to require any registered futures association to perform any poi tion or all of the cftcs registration functions under the act the futures association would be required to perform this registration function for each member of the association and each associated person of such member the second provision is more general under new section 8a 10 the commission would be empowered to authorize any person to perform any portion of the commissions registration functions under the act the nfa is eager to begin as soon as possible to assume at least a portion of the cftcs registration functions according to nfas most recent schedule it plans to be able to begin on or about january 15 1983 to conduct registration proceedings for all classes of cfc registrants nfas intention to assume cftc registration duties at such an early time bodes well for a complete assumption by nfa of that function since every registered commodity professional except floor brokers must be a member of nfa in order to fulfill the 1978 congressional grant of authority to the cftc to make membership in a registered futures association compulsory nevertheless despite the best intentions of the cftc and nfa problems could arise that might delay nfas assumption of the registration function unless we take great care at this time to spell out with some degree of specificity the authority in this area of the cftc and nfa the amendment i am proposing would accomplish this goal without hampering in any meaningful way the broad discretion and authority vested in the cftc under new sections 8a 10 and 17 o of the act as contained in h r 5447 in fact under h r 5447s provision for new section 8a 10 as well as the provisions contained in this amendment the commission would be empowered to authorize a registered futures association to perform any portion of the cftc registration program even if the commission were to require a futures association to register persons who are not members of the association in order to perfect these provisions the amendment would make four basic changes or additions to new sections 8a 10 and 17 o first both section 8a 10 and section 17 o would be amended to clarify that the exclusive procedures governing registration proceedings conducted by a registered futures association or any other person authorized by the commission would be set forth in rules of the registered futures association or other authorized person submitted to the commission for its approval h r 5447s provisions in new sections 8a 10 and 17 o refer to performing the registration function merely in accordance with rules approved by the commission it is not absolutely clear under this language which rules govern these registration proceedings the amendment contemplates that futures association rules submitted and approved by the commission will be the exclusive procedures followed in conducting an1 aspect of the registration function thus the amendment will clarify that a registration proceeding conducted by a registered futures association or any other person authorized by the cftc in accordance with the pr dural rules submitted to the cftc may not be subject to legal challenge on the ground that procedures contained in the administrative procedure act or any other statute or regulation were not followed the second aspect of the amendment expressly provides for cftc review of final registration decisions rendered by a futures association the amendment would also make explicit that a futures association may take the full range of registration actions available to the commission under the act and commission regulations this is consistent with the provisions in both new section 8a 10 and new section 17 o of h r 5447 which state that any registered futures association or other authorized person may perform a cftc registration function subject to the provisions of this act applicable to registrations granted by the commission in addition the amendment provides a standard for cftc review of futures association registration decisions that mirrors the standard for appellate review of cftc registration decisions under the existing scheme this will avoid petitions being filed with the commission requesting that it conduct a laborious costly aad duplicative de novo or other form of factfinding review of a futures association registration proceeding the third aspect of the amendment covers cftc oversight of registration granted by a futures association under this provision registration of an individual would be conditional until 15 days after notification of the cftc by the registering futures association unless the cftc directs the association to revoke or reconsider the application during that 15day period the fourth and final aspect of the amendment would comport with basic notions of due process of law by providing any person against whom a futures association has issued a final registration decision and the commission has declined to review the merits of such decision to petition an appropriate unitedstates court of appeals for appellate review of the decision under the procedures in section 6 b of the act that govern appellate review of cftc registration decisions this aspect of the amendment will therefore merely make explicit in the statute that the right to judicial review from registration decisions will not be affected by authorizing a futures association to perform these functions it should be noted that the last three aspects of the amendment i have explained would apply only to a registered futures association and therefore only to the national fu tures association at this time this is because the context in which new section 17 o appears in h r 5447 warrants that these perfecting amendments apply to registered futures associations authorized or required by the commission to perform any portion or all of the cftcs registration functions the amendment will resolve any potential uncertainty concerning the appropriate interpretation of the relationship between new sections 8a 10 and 17 o of the act in the event a registered futures association like nfa is called upon to assume the cftcs registration function i believe this antendment is needed in order to allow the national futures association to get its functions into operation this amendment is supported by the futures industry and the cftc also is in agreement i urge my colleagues to support its passage"],

direction will our economy take through the remainder of this century will we retreat to the tax and spend policies of the great society where programs grew and deficits grew and inflation grew or will we go fundamentally in the direction we have charted in this congress to cut taxes to reduce the burden and to allow economic growth to cut spending so that we can show our children and our childrens children that they will not be faced with a continual expansion of federal programs to reduce government regulation so that the private sector and individuals can join hands in an economic

programs that are important to their districts but at the same timeto maintain that fundamental balance between military and social services and targeted entitlements and of course other programs as well it is extremely difficult to do there are fundamental differences here the republican bipartisan proposal assures only 20 billion of new revenue as opposed to 32 billion in the other proposal our deficit is some 8 billion less than in the jones alternative but more importantly we have been able to cut the growth of nonsocial security entitlement programs which has very important implications to the growing cost of federal spending during the next 3 or 4 years finally let me say that there are some things we certainly cannot do if we expect to get this problem under control we cannot simply add back all of the spending in 1982 that this congress cut in 1981 if we do that all our efforts to control the deficit will surely fall we cannot expect economic growth and expansion if we add h 3384 back all the takes that we cut in 1981 this would surely place a burden on the private sector and on our ability to increase industrial activities that strengthen the prospects for those who are looking for jobs and economic security finally the bipartisan budget sends the right signals sends the right signals to the american people to our trading partners and allies overseas to wall street and the fed but more importantly than that it setp us on the proper economic track to create jobs reduce expansion of federal programs put americans back to work and demonstrate to the
