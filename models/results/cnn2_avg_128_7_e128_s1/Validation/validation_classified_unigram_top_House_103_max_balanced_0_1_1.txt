mr lasater was known to use cocaine and distributed cocaine freely at many parties and he was convicted convicted by the arkansas authorities of trafficking in cocaine he received a prison sentence and his prison sentence was partially reduced after he got out of prison he was in a halfway house for a few months he was pardoned exonerated by thengovernor clinton his friend during the time that he was incarcerated in this halfway househe really was not in a penitentiary he was in a halfway house most of the time during the time he was incarcerated a lady named patsy thomasson who is his chief financial officer took over control of his businesses and she ran his businesses as the chief financial officer while mr lasater was away at prison when he got out and was pardoned by president clinton ms thomasson continued to be the chief financial officer of his companies and she also became the chief officer of what was called the phoenixthe phoenix group a subsidiary of the phoenix group was the phoenix mortgage co and mr lasater became the president of the phoenix mortgage co so the relationship between patsy thomasson and mr lasater and bill clinton was of long duration and continued even after he went to jail and was out as a matter of fact mr lasater paid an 8 000 drug debt drug bill for cocaine use that bill clintons brother had incurred so he paid off a drug bill for bill clintons brother so there was a very close relationship between the clintons and mr lasater now patsy thomasson to give you some more background my colleagues now is one of the chief officers at the white house she is the personnel director at the white house she conducts quote unquote the drug testing of personnel at the white house now yesterday the people of albuquerque nm awoke to another tale of corruption that may involve the president president clinton the front page of tuesdays albuquerque journal reports that ajoint federal state narcotics investigation of the presidents friend mr dan lasater was called off before it was completed a former arkansas state police investigator j n doc delaughter told two journal investigative reporters that the investigation included lasater a close friend of the president and highdollar contributor to mr clintons campaign and the presidents brother roger clinton delaughter said the investigation was cut off prematurely for political reasons the state police investigators say he briefed the clintonappointed arkansas state police director tommy goodwin twice by telephone about the lasater clinton investigation on both occasions tommy goodwin the state police investigator was using a phone in then governor clintons personal office mr delaughter who was then on the force was not sure whether or not governor clinton now president clinton overheard the conversations but it is very clear that governor clinton now president clinton was very close to the arkansas state police director who was getting the information about the investigation delaughter said and i quote moneys could have been seized and planes could have been seized because we had evidence that cocaine was being used on planes used by mr lasater as i said before mr lasater quite frequently flew then governor bill clinton around in these planes delaughter told the newspaper that he and another investigator were barred from interviews with lasater roger clinton and another lasater associate in other words his superiors on the state police said you cant go and investigate this they stopped him cold in his tracks eventually lasater was convicted of possession and distribution of cocaine as i said before he was sentenced to 30 months in prison but served only 10 months most of which was in a halfway house before being released on parole lasater was later paroled by his friend thengovernor bill clinton now right in the thick of all this is patsy thomasson who is now the personnel director at the white house she took over the daytoday operations of the lasater companies while lasater was in prison as i speak to you tonight she is responsible for the daily administration of the clinton white house the newspaper is careful to point out that there is no evidence to support any indictment of ms thomasson or establish a direct connection between the illegal activity that led to the conviction of lasater and the presidents brother now harkening back to an earlier washington scandal one has to wonder what did ms thomasson know about the illegal activity which surrounded her and when did she realize that her boss lasater was a largescale drug pusher the albuquerque journal found no one in that firm no one in that firm other than ms thomasson the chief financial officer had any doubt about what was going on in the lasater companies i quote the newspapers story former lasater employees interviewed by the fbi said tney left or joined the firm between 1982 and 1985 because of its reputation tor cocaine use as the chief financial officer for lasater during that period are we to believe that ms thomasson now the chief personnel director at the whitehouse haa no clue about what was going on in the company the albuquerque journal reported that the fbi received sworn statements from lasater employees therethat were there at christmas parties at which cocaine was available in ashtrays cocaine was freely available at lasater company outings in lexington ky hot springs ar and elsewhere according to lasater employees reporters dick lynch and mike gallagher quote federal grand jury testimony which said that cocaine was served like hors doeuvres but we are asked to believe that the chief financial officer even though everybody else in that firm knew about it knew nothing of this and we are talking about ms thomasson ms thomasson patsy thomasson was a key player in the lasater operations the newspaper cites numerous public and court records which show her as president of the various lasater enterprises including new mexicos angel fire corp which lasater purchased in 1984 and sold in 1987 articles of incorporation show that thomasson as an incorporator of the phoenix group which was the successor to lasater co records of the sale of angel fire in 1987 to a texas investment partnership bear patsy thomassons signature she was tied to mr lasater all the way through all of his operations at the time of this sale the customs service and the fbi were busy investigating money laundering and drug trafficking she signed the partnership agreement the two agencies formed an organized crime drug enforcement task force and named lasater as the chief target of the probe pasty thomasson was given power of attorney power of attorney by mr lasater in january 1987 while he was in prison and surprisingly appears to still be acting as a registered agent for lasaters phoenix mortgage co calls by the newspaper to patsy thomasson at the white house were not returned i understand ms thomasson has taken leave of absense from her position as the director of administration for the president i continue to be concerned about the presidents association with people like mr lasater pardoning him after he was convicted of dealing in drugs giving him 65 million i believe in state bonds during the time he was being investigated and later indicted by the arkansas state police and the federal authorities for drug trafficking i continue to be concerned about his association president clintons with people like mr lasater and ms thomasson in the very limited hearings that we had on

request for an increase in his white house budget when all is said and done the appropriations committees response funds white house activities at precisely the same level they were funded in 1992 george bushs last year yet as a candidate bill clinton talked about a 25percent cut in the white house staff many anericans are wondering at current levels whether we are not paying too much already particularly in light of the continuing allegations of grave misconduct by members of the white house staff yet bill clinton the man who promised a 25percent cut tb the american people has this year proposed an 8percent increase for the white house budgetv i congratulate my colleague the kdntlelnan from florida who did not see fit to give mr clinton more money but is instead proposing that we hold him to at least some of the spending cuts that he proposed as a candidate in light of what the white house staff has been up to it seems to me they hardly deserve a raise just 18 months ago the clinton white house started out with travelgate it consisted in the firing and smearing of honest career employees in the white house for the benefit of the clintons relatives and campaign workers even the white house press corps were scandalized by such a noxious mixture of cronyism political manipulation of law enforcement and scapegoating the likes of which washington has not seen since the spoils system was first set into motion by andrew jackson all of this certainly set the tone for what we have now come to know as the prototypical clinton scandal the cornercutting the greed cronyism and above all the deceit there has been more serious misconduct by the clinton white house than travelgate but certainly nothing more contemptible than firing and smearing longtime apolitical lowlevel government workers in order to benefit the presidents cousin and his wealthiest friends no less disgraceful was the tampering with the fbi by the white house counsels office the office in which i once served as senior associate counsel to the president the white house counsel is supposed to be preeminently responsible for preventing ethical lapses by the president and senior white house officials instead it was this white house counsels office that was the very source of the scandal including flagrant qbvious misconduct by white house lawyer william kennedy who did not contact the attorney general who did not contact fbi director sessions but interfered directly in the operations of the fbi to target specific individuals yet kennedy remains in the white house two reprimands and several additional scandals later as a seemingly permanent sourceof ethical trouble for this president and the other white house staff as we all know mr kennedy like webb hubble and vince foster and hillary rodham clinton was part ofthe same law firm that represented arkansas wheeler dealers in whitewater and madison savings and loan and dozens of other transactions including the clintons own personal finances one of the most unsavory aspects of this staff arrangement is the cronyism from the first it turned the highest echelon s of the white house legal staff and the justice department into little more than the washington branch office of the kose law firm the predictable result was the president and hillary rodham clinton felt they could treat the white house lawyers as their personal lawyers bu t federal law prohibits government employees including the white house counsels office from performing private services for the president yet shortly before his death vince foster was working in his white house office in the west wing on government time at taxpayer expense at preparing the delinquent whitewater tax returns not only was this improper because it was the personal investment business of the clintons rather than official business but it also covered a period well before the clintons took office most observers who have commented on this fact have speculated on its relevance to mr fosters death as a former member of the counsels office i am at least as struck by its obvious impropriety using a fulltime government lawyer to work on the clinton familys personal business affairs is clearly improper i recall very well the extraordinary pains that for example president reagan took to ensure that none of the white house lawyers worked on his personal business his tax returns were prepared by his own private lawyers and his accountants even his blind trust which unlike the clintons was set up before his inauguration was prepared at his personal expense obviously the clinton white house does not follow the same ethical guidelines what does this mean from a budget standpoint obviously it means today in 1994 we are already paying for too much white house staff yet the size and the composition of the white house staff whose budget we are debating foday is itself another mystery the clintons have repeatedly denied requests from congress for a list of white house staff members and salary levels"], [2.2124938823253615e-06, 2.2124938823253615e-06, 0, "this one to me speaks volumes about where we are as a soclety it is unbelievable to realize that during the same 30year period violent crime has gone up 560 percent the fbi tells us and i find this unbelievable but i do believe it because it is their figures and they are based on their analysis that during the life of an individual 8 out of 10 americans will be the victim of a violent crime that is truly shocking but we all know it do we not look at what is happening in our communities this next oneis fascinating we just heard how during the 0year period that spending at al levels of government has gone up fivefold and welfare spendinghas 630 percent this next chart tells us about the miserable failure of liberalism in this country this chart shows starting hack here you can see in the 50s here is the poverty rate the poverty rate if falling falling falling falling and falling look when it levels offand goes back up this happens when lbj comes into power and launches the war on poverty look at the dramatic increases in spending the more spending goes up look what is happening to this line the line is level it goes down it goes up a little bit then herwe axre in 1990 whereit starts heading up of course these are the last years we have figures for so i cannot tell you more recently but the factof the matter is we have spent in this 30year period i believe 3 5 trillion that put us deeply in debt to alleviate poverty we have created a dependent culture that just saps up more and more of out taxpayer dollars this is resulting in broken homes and more violent crime of enormous proportions this is why we have got to have further time to really talk about this on another occasion next is births to unmarried women look at this line right here in 1960 it was about 5 percent of unmarried women who gave birth look over here in 1990 we are almost at 28 percent a fivefold increase what is happening to these children these children are emotionally deprived for the most part you saw that statistic on the 560percent increase in violent crime the fastest growing component of those violent crimes is juvenile crimes that is what we are creating by the social policies that are entirely misplaced here is the chart that illustrates the increase in welfare spending it is never enough all these trillions of dollars and we still havepeople in power in the federal government from the president on down who tell us oh we have got to spend more that is what president clinton was quoted as saying on the front page of the washington post last friday we have got to raise some more revenues and get this economy going which is totally inconsistent why so that we can spend more this is completely unbelievable then he has given us a plan and let us go back to this chart for a minute a plan which is going to add 1 trillion to the national debt cumulatively and which is going to end us up after the largest tax increase in history at the end of the clinton 5year plan with an annual budget deficit of s228 5 billion some plan the famlily we see federal taxes look at this increase in the average family with median income a family of four in 1948 paid about 2 percent of its total income to the unitedstates government in taxes the same family in 1986 paid 24 percent of its income to the unitedstates government in taxes and that figure went up where by 1990 it looks like over 25 percent now from 2 to 25 percent is a twelvefold increase a 1 200percent increase in taxes to the federal government that is truly dramatic this last chart which i think is very illustrative and maybe we can end on this note represents the federal budget deficit the annual deficit going clear back to the 1940s these are inflation adjusted now of course look at what we have during the world war ii years we have annual budget deficits one of them here looks like about 1943 we have an annual budget deficit inflation adjusted of about 680 billion this is truly staggering but look at what happens here of course during the war years this goes on then we get right to here which appears to be about 1947 you can see what it is it is about 180 billion a dramatic reduction just by way of comparison our budget deficit this year is 320 billion for the fiscal year ending september 30 we are not in world war ii under the clinton plan in 5 years we are going to go from 320 to 228 5 billion look at what happened here you go in 5 years from an enormous budget deficit here at over 500 billion and my word you are up to here where you have nearly 100 billion in surplus now can you see the chauge there it is a 600 billion change we went from deep deficit to surplus we are not in world war ii right now why can we not act more quickly why can we not eliminate these tax increases out the spending bring the economy back up by reducing the deficit reducing the regulation reducing the burdens on the family strengthening our families provide incentives for people to help themselves in the inner cities and in the suburbs and pull these families back together transmit family

go home in the next election and ask for their constituents votes after raising their taxes by 402 billion 402 billion = billion in new taxes and 74 billion in hidden taxes that they are not owning up to 402 billion their net spending cuts over 5 years are 3 billion and that includes 112 billion in defense cuts so if you take the defense cuts out that were going to take place anyhow you are actually increasing domestic spending by 109 billion you tell the american people you are going to get control of spending you are going to cut this deficit and you are increasing domestic spending 109 billion and increasing their tax 402 billion more than double the largest tax increase in unitedstates history and if that aint recessionary folks i do not know what is let me just give some information here that my democrat colleagues may not be aware of the nashville center for policy analysis says that this plan will lower capital formation in the united states by 1 8 trillion that is money that we need to have invested for plant and industry expansion that will create more jobs but no and because of this slower growth that you are going to create they estimate 1 4 million fewer jobs over the next 5 years but that is not all this economic loss is equal to more than 1 000 for every man woman and child in the country or more than 2 600 for the average household by 1998 the clinton plan will cause wage income in the united states to be 160 billion lower than it would have been that means that about every fulltime employee is going to take a 1 600 pay cut and on average workers will lose 8 in aftertax income for every dollar lost by investors this is the program you are going to present to the american people i cannot imagine that we created 21 million new jobs in the 1980s we had economic growth and here you are you are going to put 1 4 million people out of work with these huge tax increases not to mention the companies you are going to drive overseas with the btu tax increase truckers the airline industry farmers foundries every industry is going to be adversely impacted by the 15centagallon gasoline tax and fuel tax that is going to be loaded on the back of arilines yet you are going to go right ahead with it i hope you know what you are doing it certainly does not appear as though you do right now let me just give a constructive alternative that we have proposed and i hope the committee on rules will allow us to bring to the floor tomorrow and that is a freeze plus 2 percent i wish my good friend the gentleman from minnesota would listen to this part of my talk a freeze plus 2 percent if we froze at last years spending levels plus a 2percent growth over the next 5 years we could reach a balanced budget by 1998 using cbos figures as far as income is concerned if we go back to a 3percent growth in tax revenues as we have had traditionally we would actually have a surplus by the year 1998 without a tax increase i hope all my friends across this country that may be paying attention to this debate will listen the republicans have the kasich plan which is far superior to the democrat plan in that it does not increase taxes and it gets to a lower deficit figure in 5 years second we have a plan that is a 2percent above freeze that gets us to a balanced budget without a tax increase so if you do not want your taxes raised america if you want to cut the fat and waste out of government spending if you want to take a meat cleaver to government then vote for the republicans because they are the ones that are trying to do something about it they will tell you we do not have a plan we have two plans the kasich plan and the 2percent plus freeze and both of them do it without massive tax increases they tell you we need more money they tell you we need 400 billion more in taxes ten years ago we were bringing in 500 billion in tax revenue and today we are bringing in 1 2 trillion we have almost tripled the amount of taxes coming into this country in 10 years and yet they want 400 billion more is that not amazing we have almost tripled the tax revenues coming in in 10 years and they still want 400 billion more and they are still not going to reach a balanced budget in 5 years our plan a 2percent plus freeze will get us to a balanced budget without any tax increases and that is what i think america wantscut spending cut

middle class will be hit the hardest under this plan whether they are young middle class families middle class federal employees or middle class eldery the middle class will be hit by the btu tax which will cost the average family approximately 500 in additional taxes they will be hit with fewer jobs an estimated 400 000 to 600 000 fewer jobs throughout the country including approximately 1 600 jobs lost in my district along according to the national taxpayers union every worker and every business throughout my state and throughout this country will be hit with this new tax big this will in turn hurt our competitiveness abroad as we raise the price of doing business for every employer and producer in the united states this btu tax penalizes lower and middleincome families hurt schools and hospitals and increases our dependence on foreign oil under this tax hospitals will have to spend more or energy and less on healing schools will have to spend more money on transporting kids to school and less on educating them parents will have to spend more money getting back and forth to work less on supporting their families adding tens of thousands of dollars to school and hospital budgets will have a devastating impact on local economies and dramatically harm the physical and educational welfare of millions of individuals the affordable energy alliance estimates that had this proposed btu tax been fully implemented in 1990 virginia residents and businesses would have paid 701 4 million in additional energy taxes a tax burden this large would hit virginias economy particularly hard at a time when we have defense cutbacks hitting our area disproportionately along with millions of federal employees who will be subject to a wage freeze the national association of counties has noted that these increased federal taxes will reduce local revenues and result in the need for local governments to increase property taxes sales taxes and service fees at a time when local governments are still experiencing the adverse effects of the recession again the middle class will be hit the hardest the elderly on fixed incomes are also hit hard under this clinton plan the democrat plan promises to raise taxes on seniors making as late as 25 000 and while the energy tax is indexed the income level at which social security benefits will be taxed at a higher level is not indexed so millions of seniors will graduate into this new tax bracket each year and this increased tax in a breach of trust with the american people will not be returned to the social security trust fund but will instead be diverted into the general revenue fund for increased government spending no country in the world has this kind of tax this tax will be very difficult to administer and will require all kinds of new regulations and regulators to enforce it this bill reserves for the treasury department the power to unilaterally change new energy tax rates expand or contract the products subject to the tax and the power to exempt certain taxpayers this means the rules on this tax can continue to be changed and businesses will be subject to ever changing rules again this will hurt competitiveness and is not fair the republican alternative to the democratic tax plan is superior in many respects and i will support it because it achieves considerable deficit reduction without the burdensome taxes which i have just described my republican colleagues who helped fashion this plan did so under considerable time restrictions and have made many tough decisions in crafting this plan the kasich plan will reduce the budget deficit by 352 billion yet does not increase taxes or touch social security benefits while the clinton plan places a disproportionate burden on federal and military employees and retirees the republican plan eases this heavy burden i believe the men and women who serve in the civil service and milltary should be treated fairly it is important to consider the longterm benefits of having a qualified and effective federal and military workforce and be cautious in producing shortterm savings at their expense unlike the clinton plan the republican substitute wont delay federal retirees cost of living adjustments and it wont put limits on federal employees colas or locality pay also it does not delay military retirees colas and it does not freeze military pay the way the democrat plan would do coupled with the tax increases federal and military employees and retirees would suffer more than any other segment of the population under the clinton plan the republican plan is a dramatic improvement over the tax and spend democrat budget however the republican plan has some aspects i am concerned about under the republican substitute federal employees retirement age would be increased from age 55 to 62 and nondisabled military retirees would have their colas delayed until they reach age 62 federal employees have relied to their detriment on certain promises made by their employer the federal government and these promises should be respecied no other nongovernmental entity can unilaterally alter the terms of an employment contract its illegal and wrong while the congress can change the terms of an employees employment or retirement legally it is still unfair i reiterate that the republican substitute is substantially more equitable to federal and military employees and retirees than the democrat version however if i had the opportunity to amend either version which i dont because the rules committee gagged every member of this body by only allowing one amendment on the floor today i would offer additional spending cuts to make up the difference in maintaining the federal and military employee and retirees benefits what could we possibly cut to make up the difference i suggest and many would agree that we cut funding for the superconducting super collider others concerned could find other cuts if given the opportunity under the rules plagued with dramatic cost overruns management problems and no foreign contnbutions to the projects as was promised i believe this is a project that we cant currently afford given our budget defict yesterday mr victor s rezendes director of energy and science issues resources community and economic development dmsion of the unitedstates general accounting office testified that the total estimated cost of the scc is not yet known but the projects total cost will exceed 11 billion this 11 billion is more than enough to keep our commitment to federal and military employees and retirees if this plan passes the house i would work to restore these benefits by cutting the scc all americans have a deep concern about the deficit which i share and want us to cut the deficit so our children and grandchildren dont bear the burden of our ex cess the clinton plan increases taxes increases spending and as a result the deficit will not be reduced in order to cut the deficit americans want us to cut spending first and the republican plan best fufills this goal"], [1.0077015758724883e-05, 1.0077015758724883e-05, 0, "some years ago there was a movie with bob

democrats from around the nation whom im asking to take part in this important survey now obviously this is a computer glitch that got this to me but it did reveal some very fascinating things for

at the white house does know the answer to many of these questions which have been left unanswered i have taken the floor of this house many times over the past several months during this session to raise questions about a number of incidents connected to this white house in every instance the clinton white house has not responded and we need full congressional hearings on many of these issues not these limited parameters that are being set by the democrat leadership and the democrat chairmen of these committees which would limit us in our questioning of white house employees and people who have relevant information to these questions when we had the whitewater hearings the members of the committee on banking finance and urban affairs had 5 minutes to question 10 members of the white house staff and get answers not 5 minutes to question each one of them 5 minutes to question all 10 of them and get a response that in my opinion smacks of a whitewash and certainly was not full congressional hearings the thing that bothers me is during the reagan and bush administrations there were 23 fullblown hearings on everything from irancontra to the october surprise to everything else and something as important as the whitewater investigation is being swept under the rug and i believe for political purposes and it is unfortunate now the smoke is starting to clear around the clinton white house i think the american people are not being fooled by a lot of this and as clinton loyalists continue to resign the pattern of distortion is continuing to change we need a full investigation of the presidents association with mr lasater and miss thomasson we need a full investigation of possible obstruction of justice in the investigations of drug ijse and drug trafficking by mr lasater and the presidents brother and there are other questions that need to be answered like mr vince foster we still have not gotten all the answers concerning his mysterious death and finding him at fort marcy park so this is another in a series of special orders i will be taking over the next few weeks until we adjourn and when we come back in january if we have not had an agreement by both the majority and minority to have fullblown hearings on many of these issues relating to whitewater and other mysterious things that have been going on like the special order i took last night regarding two savings and loan associations in the state of flinois who had the rose law firm and hillary rodham clinton representing the government in going after mr lasater himself at a time when they were friends which smacks of a conflict of interest i am hopeful that we will be able to get a bipartisan agreement so that we can actually have fullblown hearings and get to the bottom of it the questions need to be answered if the president and the white house has nothing to hide then they should be very happy to answer the questions that the congress will raise at these hearings"],

first and foremostsomebody has to be honest with the american people the presidents plan in not honest it promises deficit reduction that is not there it promises economic growth which is not there it promises budget cuts that definitely are not there it is a sham the simple truth is that you cannot create prosperity with tax increases i have never seen a single economic model which comes close to suggesting that you can create private sector jobs or private sector growth by raising taxes 267 billion it cannot be done the only thing that will grow with tax increases like that is the federal government and if history is any guide the federal deficit will grow with it you cannot tax your way to prosperity you cannot tax your way to a balanced budget it is not going to work just yesterday the director of the congressional budget office testified before the ways and means committee and he said that this budget package does not reduce the deficit to satisfactory levels and that congress is going to have to come back in 3 or 4 years and pass another package just as big or even twice as bigbefore fiscal year think about that when you vote for these tax increases they are just the first installment on a new taxandspend spiral the other point that i want tomake is that the cornerstones for the presidents budgetand the democrat budget we are considering here todayare basically unfair i am speaking of the btu energy tax and the tax on social security benefits the btu energy tax is inflationary it is a tax on low and middleincome tax payers it is a tax on unitedstates business and industry which will reduce competitiveness it is a killer tax on jobs and on heavy industry and american farmers and american coal the btu energy tax is just bad policy the other cornerstone of the presidents tax proposal is even worse the social security tax increases proposed by the president and the democrat budget are grossly unfair they clearly penalize any senior citizen who managed to scrimp and save and put enough money away for his or her retirement years to have a modest income it is a retirement planning penalty and not only does it penalize savings and investment it also breaks a sacred promise to social security recipients when the tax on social security benefits was enacted in 1983 the revenues were directed to the social security trust fund to ensure its future solvency that was the purpose of the taxto keep the social security trust fund strong the administrations proposal doesnt do that the presidents proposal would divert the additional revenues to medicare we are talking about an outright raid on the social security trust fund the presidents proposal to increase taxes on social security benefits is an outrageous breach of faith to social security that is what we are talking about today an economic program that does not live up to truth in labeling laws a program built on the cornerstones of unfairness and broken promises a program built on the faulty belief that you can tax your way to prosperity it is a bad budget it is bad policy and it just will not work we can and should reduce the deficit but for gods sake let us do it the

democratic strategy of frightening senior citizens is despicable and it is totally false lets look at the facts house republicans have proposed a balanced budget amendment to the constitution house republicans know the federal government is too big and spends too much house republicans believe that over a 5 to 8year period a transition to a balanced budget is possible house republicans believe that cutting spending not raising taxes is the right direction liberal democrats and their liberal news media allies seem terrified at the idea the republicans might actually cut government spending cut democratic political pork and work to balance the budget the democrats have now come up with a totally phony analysis which suggests that republicans would cut social security rather than debate discretionary rather than debate other entitlements rather than debate changing the bureaucracy the democrats at least in this white house release today seem to have decided that only by scaring senior citizens do democrats have a chance to survive this is a totally false accusation let me read the record on meet the press yesterday i said the following we have to look at transforming virtually h 10675 every area of the budget except social security you take one part of that pie chart called social security set it to one aide as the contract that virtually all americans agree on i think you have got to look at every single aspect of the budget the fact is social security is the widest accepted contract in the united states it is one that i think should be off the table now that was on meet the press yesterday today the clinton white house decides to lie about my position the gentleman from t6xas congressman dick armey on a cspan viewer callin show september 28 said the following about social security it is a paid annuity program i cant be party to a process that says to the american people one were going to take your aftertax dollars into this annuity and then tax you when you take your benefits out laterbut thats what the democrats want to do i think thats unfair its unkind secondly we cant break our contract our responsibility our fiduciary responsibility to those people who spent their entire working years paying into this contract now here are the no 2 and no 3 ranking house republicans the people who almost certainly will be the no 1 and no 2 house republicans next year and what we are saying to the american people is we are not going to touch social security we have said publicly and on the record the result is not an honestdebate from the clinton white house and the debate about how to get to a balanced budget not an honest effort to understand what we are trying to do but a deliberately distorted deliberately false accusation that we are going to cut social security let me carry this a step further if you look at what gov fife symington has done a republican in arizona he has taken medicaid a very expensive program and he has turned it into managed care he no longer allows people to show up at the emergency room to get aspirin he no longer allows people to simply waste dollars if they are on medicaid the result is he is saving millions of dollars in arizona and applied nationwide we could save billions of dollars in new york state alone there is one study that suggests that we could save 11 000 per welfare family in health care costs in new york state if we went to managed care without in any way cutting off any care but simply by turning it into an organized orderly process gov tommy thompson republican of wisconsin has gone to a learnfare and workfare program and has discovered that when you require people on welfare to work fewer people show up for welfare and you change the whole program and you dramatically both lower your costs and you improve the experience of the people on welfare it is a program that will work it is a program we ought to be trying i have been talking with ross perot with corporate leaders around the country looking at successful downsizing what happens when ford or general motors or chrysler or xerox or ibm decides they have to shrink their middle managements how do they go about doing that i believe we can save billions of dol lars by downsizing the federal bureaucracy and using effective systems i believe with a thorough overhaul of our defense procurement system we can get more weapons and better weapons faster for less money that is the essence of the concept that dr edwards deming developed which is quality quality but which is an approach to doing

just for a second on what is special about this debate on the bartontauzin amendment this debate today focuses not necessarily on whether or not one supports the concept of a balanced budget amendment i believe agreat majority of this house does this debate focuses on how we are going to achieve that balanced budget amendment this amendment the bartontauzin amendment is very much like the stenholm amendment the only difference in the balanced budget features of this amendment and the stenholm amendment is the year 2000 date for the accomplishment of the balanced budget goal but the major difference the thing we ought to be focusing on today is the feature of the bartontauzin amendment that provides for some restraint on tax increases as a vehicle for achieving balanced budgets now what restraint is in here the restraint that is in here is a simple provision that says in achieving the balanced budget that all of us or a great majority of us i think want to achieve that we ought to do it without raising taxes any higher than any greater than the income of americans is growing at the time we raise taxes in other words government should not grow faster than the pocketbooks of americans americans individually and american businesses it says in effect that we can raise taxes if we need to in short the amendment we debate today says that while the government of the united states may in fact have to raise taxes it ought not do it except with a supermajority any faster than the rate of growth of income in american pocketbooks and businesses in short it says balance the budget over the term allotted principally by reducing spending wherever you can if we were to poll americans across the width and breadth of this country today i think they would agree with that principle so we are debating an amendment today that really incorporates the stenholm balanced budget amendment with the addition that the balanced budget amendment ought to be achieved with as little as possible in tax increases and as much as possible in spending cuts if members agree with that principle they will want to vote for this version of the balanced budget amendment those who have said they are concerned about this version ought to be concerned because this is a real amendment if we really want to achieve a balanced budget for america we ought to be concerned that this amendment will do it and other amendments may not do it so if we have a concern about the effect of the unitedstates constitution commanding those of us representing this nation in this body to abide by responsible spending limits then we ought to be concerned abut this amendment it will require this congress and this nation to put our fiscal house order without unnecessarily raising taxes again on the american public people have asked us why should we do this at all let me give the members an illustration of the most important reason why i think it is important for congress to enact not only the balanced budget amendment but this version of it with a limitation on tax increases it is incumbent because we need to examine the reason the mandate is normally sent to washington in town meetings across my district folks ask why do you guys keep spending money over and above the income of this government why do you keep putting us in debt why do you keep crowding out money we could be using for useful purposes in america by paying all this interest on the debt conservatives and liberals make this same request why dont you put your house in order quit paying all this interest and spend the money we send you on projects that are good for america instead of paying interest on debt to countries all over the world who buy our tbills the answer is that most congressmen come to washington with a simple mandate the mandate is go to washington get as many of those federal dollars we send you backinto your district and spend them at home the truth is that we all carry out that mandate pretty doggone good the truth is that most of us end up bringing more money home than our folks have sent up here that is why we are out of balance we carry out the mandate pretty good i think what americans want to do in this balanced budget debate is to ask us to give them a chance in voting for a constitutional amendment that would send a new mandate to all of us who come up here and the mandate would be very simple do what you can about bringing projects home do what you can about carrying out the necessary spending in government but dont spend more money than we send you each year at some point stop this crazy borrowing trend that is crowding out the funds we need to carry on a progressive and good economy for our country in short i think the message americans have been sending us in town hall meetings in our mail and in messages to members of congress is that while we want you to do a good job in making sure that projects come home and federal programs are still carried out we also want you to carry out a new mandate and the mandate is dont spend more money than we have sent you and quit raising taxes on us in order to accomplish the purpose of a balanced budget amendment the bartontauzin amendment is the only one that carries out those two mandates of urging americans to live in this government within our means and second to stop raising taxes unnecessarily

tensions on guam and increases the demands for a comprehensive land solution while this bill is not that comprehensive solution it does show that solutions are possible ultimately the best solution is to give guam as much authority as possible to resolve land issues on guam where land issues are most clearly understood just last week i convened a land conference on guam to begin the task of forming a consensus on land issues while there was frustration and disappointment expressed by the people of guam there clearly was also hope for the future our action today conveys that there is reason for

great military leaders since that time let me quote from that speech i believe the postwar period has taught us several lessons and from them i have developed six major tests to be applied when we are weighing the use of unitedstates combat forces abroad let me now share them with you first the united states should not commit forces to combat overseas unless the particular engagement or occasion is deemed vital to our national interest or that of our allies that emphatically does not mean that we should declare beforehand as we did with korea in 1950 that a particular area is outside our strategic perimeter second if we decide it is necessary to put combat troops into a given situation we should do so wholeheartediy and with the clear intention of winning if we are unwilling to commit the forces or resources necessary to achieve our objectives we should not commit them at all of course if the particular situation requires only limited force to win our objectives then we should not hesitate to commit forces sized accordingly when hitler broke treaties and remilitarized the rhineland small combat forces then could perhaps have prevented the holocaust of world war ii third if we do decide to commit forces to combat overseas we should have clearly defined political and military objectives and we should know precisely how our forces can accomplish those clearly defined objectives and we should have andsend the forces needed to do just that as clausewitz wrote no one starts a war or rather no one in his senses ought to do sowithout first being clear in his mind what he intends to achieve by that war and how he intends to conduct it war may be different today than in clausewltzs time but the need for welldefined objectives and a consistent strategy is still essential if we determine that a combat mission has become necessary for our vital national interests then we must send forces capable to do the joband not assign a combat mission to a force configured for peacekeeping fourth the relationship between our objectives and the forces we have committedtheir size composition and dispositionmust be continually reassessed and adjusted if necessary conditions and objectives invariably change during the course of a conflict when they do change then so must our combat requirements we must continuously keep as a beacon light before us the basic questions is this conflict in our national interest does our national interest require us to fight to use force of arms if the answers are yes then we must win if the answers are no then we should not be in combat fifth before the unitedstates commits combat forces abroad there must be some reasonable assurance we will have the support of the american people and their elected representatives in congress this support cannot be achieved unless we are candid in making clear the threats we face the support cannot be sustained without continuing and close consultation we cannot fight a battle with the congress at home while asking our troops to win a war overseas or as in the case of vietnam in effect asking our troops not to win but just to be there finally the commitment of unitedstates forces to combat should be a last resort as we as a nation consider this weighty decision i think that we must reflect back on these questions asked by secretary weinberger and also ask ourselves is this a fight we are willing to go to the finish i do not think so i hope that the carnage of the last weekend the tremendous emotional appeal and the desire of every honorable person

accountable and credible mr swift argues that many of the goals cited by reformers are directly contradictory he would argue that you cannot be more democratic more representative more responsive more accountable and more deliberative on the one hand andumore efficient decisive orderly and productive on the other well it must be conceded that democracy is inherently inefficient and even messy at times and that the singleminded pursuit of efficiency and order can only diminish our democratic character but as far as i know to true reformers are urging us to commit democracide for the sake of making the trains run on time but i would argue that true reformers can have it both waysthat they can make this institution more efficient while also making it more open accountable responsive and deliberative these goals are not contradictory or mutually exclusive one of the greatest inefficiencies of this institution is the duplication of effort that goes on in our 22 standing committees and scores of subcommittees all because of something called multiple referrals that was an innovation of the 1974 bolling reforms before that any bill could be referred to only one committee but the part of the bolling committee reform package that was not enacted was the realignment of committee jurisdictions along more rational and functional lines so what we ended up with was pretty much the same tangle of jurisdictional responsibilities as before combined for the first time with the possibility that bills could be referred to two or more committees at a time or in sequence and the multiple referral authority which was mandated on the speaker encouraged committees to fight to broaden their jurisdictions even further into the territories of other committees so what we have endedup with is a double inefficiency two or more committees holding hearings and markups on the same bills and also expending time and resources in constant jurisdictional turf battles to preserve protect and expand their own legislative authority what we have proposed in the alternative on the republican side is that first we reduce the number of committees and subcommittees second realign and consolidate jurisdictions where possible third eliminate joint bill referrals require the designation of a principal committee for each bill and keep sequential referrals as discretionary with the speaker subject to time limits for reporting and fourth place strict limits on the number of committee and subcommittee assignments a member may serve on all these reforms are designed to make our legislative process more efficient by eliminating duplication of effort and maximizing the amount of time and effort a member may devote to each assignment moreover by pinpointing responsibility for each bill in a single primary or principal committee we will restore the kind of accountability which has been lacking since the institution of multiple referrals back in 1974 at the same time the implementation of these reforms should help to make the process more representative and deliberative with members having fewer committee and subcommittee assignments there should be greater member participation in hearings and bill markups meaning that the legislative products of these subcommittees and committees will receive fuller and more representative participation deliberation and results in short in the case of these reforms efficiency and deliberative democracy are not contradictorythey are mutually complementary and with fewer committees subcommittees and member assignments it should also be feasible to eliminate the practice of proxy voting now some democrats argue that proxy voting is more efficient since it does not require the presence of members for their votes to be recorded on amendments and reporting bills but it is clearly an efficiency that runs directly contrary to deliberative and participatory democracy and certainly contradictory to a members constitutional obligation to responsibly represent his or her constituents because by giving away a proxy vote members do not know what specific amendments will be offered or hear the arguments for or against them when they entrust their proxy to another member and the resulting decisions will not necessarily reflect the true sentiments of a committee majority and the constituents they represent by the same token onethird committee quorums for amending bills and a new rule allowing socalled rolling quorums for reporting them whereby members can drop by and vote after the deliberative process is completed are absolutely contrary to majority rule and deliberative decision making e h4545 the principle for committee action enunciated by jefferson in his manual should apply with the same force today as it did in his tire and that is that a majority of the committee constitutes a quorum for business they can only act when together and not by separate consultation and consentabsolutely nothing being in the report of the committee but what has been agreed to in committee actually assembled and members when one looks at the waywe handle major legislation on the house floor we are again confronted with a system that increasingly embraces undemocratic procedures in the name of efficiency at the expense of deliberative and representative government in this congress 80 percent of the bills brought through the rules committee have been considered on this floor under a process that restricts the full and free right of members to offer amendments the survey of house members taken for the joint committee reveals that this is not merely a complaint or concern of the minority party it is a very legitimate concern when house members were asked whether they agree or disagree that there have been too many limitations on debates and amendments on the house floor this year 68 percent of the respondents agreed including 41 percent of the democrats and 98 percent of the republicans it is ironic but sadly true that the inefficiencies of our current committee system are being compensated for by an overly efficient house floor system that reduces rather than improves our chances of improving upon the legislative products of those committees is it any wonder the people have less respect for the laws we enact when they see how undemocratically we conduct our business around here we have squeezed out representative and deliberative democracy at both ends of the process through a combination of inefficiency and efficiency both the committee process and the house floor process have increasingly denied us the opportunity to be representative and responsive legislators in conclusion i must respectfully disagree with my colleague from washington on both of his charges that the joint committee never had any agreed upon goals and that the goals of reformers are contradictory the recommendations of the joint committee while not going far enough reflect the consensus not only of the joint committee members but of other house members who testified and responded to the member survey and that consensus is that the existing legislative structure and process are not sufficiently rational responsive representative or deliberative members are being asked to do n we than they can responsibly and c scientiously manage at the committee level and then are being prevented from doing what they were elected to do when a bill reaches the house floor there are reforms that can be instituted that are both internally consistent and which promote the fulfillment of those goals we can again make the committee system a more efficient and participatory policy process and if committees once again produce legislation that is more representative and responsive to problems and our constituents we have less to fear about an open amendment process on the house floor as with any genuine and bold reform effort the major obstacle to its success is the resistance of some powerful members who are wedded to the status quo out of personal power considerations in clear defiance of what is in the best interests of improving the organization and operation of the institution as a whole in the meantime public respect confidence and job approval ratings of the congress continue to decline to dangerously low levels the question confronting us is whether we will have the courage and foresight to reform ourselves now in a rational way before this tidal wave of sentiment engulfs us and imposes on us more extreme and irrational changes we must act now to bring the rec ommendations of the joint committee on congressional reform to the house floor as a single bill and consider them under an open amendment process that will enable us to further strengthen them and make the changes that are necessary in our organization and operations time is running out at this time i want to yield to a very very important person in the reform of this congress when our

around the world yet treated everyone the same with compassion concern and respect tips most famous remark was all politics is local and he remembered that tip knew that government ought to be caring

who wanted to speak with him not only presidents and colleagues but also to the people he loved police officers and cobblers teachers and retired folks no matter who you were or what you had to say tip listened i did not know tip as well as many people here but the few times i spoke with him tip always listened and recalled a story or two the first time i met him i mentioned i was from the town of danvers tip immediately recalled the name of a friend of his from dan vers a friend who had helped him out some 30 or so years before i thought it remarkable that after all those years tip would remember someone and not someone who tip had helped because even then tip had helped hundreds of people tip remembered someone who had helped him tip also didnt shy away from controversy or a fight if that was what was needed as the current speaker of the house mentioned tip oneill was the first speaker of the massachusetts house of representatives ever he did not become speaker because he rode on someone elses coattails but because he worked at it even when a lot of so called experts said it could not be done perhaps our best tribute to tip will be to remember not only him and the stories he loved to tell but also to remember what tip practiced all politics is local all people deserve to be treated with respect"], [0.9874584674835205, 0.9874584674835205, 0, "i yield myself such time as i

health care and are fully engaged in the unitedstates congress in business for the people of this country we have a foreign policy that is making life pretty darned miserable in a neighboring country a place called haiti i have talked many times about this we read about it almost every day today i had the opportunity to be on the telephone with some of the properly democratically elected members of their congress their chamber of deputies as it were and got an update on what is going on down there it is really sort of pathetic that we are not following up the option to negotiate with our colleagues who were democratically elected in the haitian chamber of deputies there are a great number of them they have invited us to come down and try and work out a negotiated settlement instead of this threat of invasion this talk of invasion all of these navy ships and coast guard cutters we have steaming around down there at this point and the sword rattling that is going on it is not working very well it is costing us a lot of money we have estimates of 1 billion or so and boy do we need that 1 billion i would love to be able to plug that into more law enforcement officers for our nations streets and to deal with some of these crime problems that we have been so engaged in be that as it may be we have a very misguided foreign policy in haiti it is very expensive it is probably illconceived it is not going to get results anybody is going to want in all likelihood but it has another factor i think it is time we pause every so often here we live very good lives in the united states of america most of us we are very fortunate and much blessed to be in this country while we are here have an embargo which is absolutely strangulating haiti it is absolutely devastating the poorest people in that country and the middle class in that country supposedly the rich can do for themselves and some of those who are the target of that embargo are actually not feeling the pinch anywhere near some of these other folks are we heard today that we have a unitedstates hospital up in limbe which is up near cap haitien up in the northwest part of the country that is completely now overwhelmed they have no more supplies they have nothing no medical attention which is desperately needed for hlwpositive people tb people and so forth all of this is on the rise there are no treatments there is no prevention there is overcrowding there is not even food we cannot simply say as we keep hearing from bill gray who is the spokesperson for the administration on this that we are addressing the food crisis in haiti by feeding 1 million people a day if we are feeding 1 million people a day we are not feeding them very nourishing food i understand sometimes it is just sort of one bowl of thin porridge there are some 7 million people in haiti and we wonder what is happening to the other 6 million if we are feeding 1 million it is very bad times we understand that we have supplies that are rotting on the docks that are needed for food and medicine for places like this hospital in limbe or the 6 million or so that need the food so badly and we discover that it cannot get anywhere because there is no gasoline no transportation because of the embargo we find infants are dying we find that young women who had jobs before cannot have any jobs now because there is no manufacturing they have had to shut everything down because of the embargo some have gone back to prostitution unfortunately aids is a serious problem in haiti and of course it is now on the increase as a result of all this all of this is happening because of the united states policy it is our foreign policy that is causing these results the people down in jacmel in haiti a city more on the southern coast go to a tb clinic people who have tb who are being treated and when they go to this clinic they are not able to get any medication any treatment for their tb because there is not any because of the embargo so they sing and they pray instead and they ash the good lord to save them because there is no medical attention available to them i admire that spirit i admire that commitment and i admire their trust in the lord but we could easily be providing them help for their tb to help correct the problem and the medical attention that they need and had been getting up until this embargo came along what i am saying is that we have a policy here in the wealthiest nation in the world of absolutely devastating a poor country and making life miserable for so many people it is hard to go to bed at night and think there are 6 million people who are not getting the kind of help treatment food compassionate relief and attention that i know every american would want to give if americans could see the face of poverty and the face of misery that is being directly caused by our foreign policy in haiti i do not think it would stand up for 1 second there would be a revolution here and people would demand that we change our policy and do the right thing for hai instead of trying to victimize the poor and the middle class i have not spoken much about the middle class but they are the people who make things work there they are the managers the manufacturers the people who keep things running and provide employment for the working class those people are being devastated because there is no job no investment no employment for them the factories do not work no energy for the factories and so forth so we are having a deterioration of the basic structure we need to rebuild that country while we are also starving the very poorest this is not a policy that makes any sense at all why are we doing this we want democracy in haiti we want to see them grow we want to see them have some prosperity we want to see them have jobs we want to see disease eradicated we want to see starvation eradicated and everything we are doing is counter to those directions i find it astonishing that our colleagues here who care so much about these things and will speak so eloquently and so much from the heart on these subjects when we are dealing with other countries that we talk about can somehow turn a blind eye toward what we are doing in haiti pretending it is not happening it is happening it is awful it is happening and we are responsible for it how can we do this i

larger sized equipment much of the recent funding has gone to building and installing engineeringscale equipment at the argonne west facilities in idaho this scaledup equipment is designed to carry out the crucial and final proofofconcept experiments for the ifr technology these experiments are scheduled to begin in september if the research on the ifr is abandoned at this time essentially all of the investment to date will be a total waste to date the ifr has proceeded on budget and on schedule there is no reason to expect that will not continue to be the case in other words we can say

we will begin to redirect the activities of the staff as appropriate in productive useful alternate directions i contrast this careful thoughtful fiscally prudent approach which embraces cost sharing by industry and allied governments with the panicdriven irrational stampede of some opponents to abandon the ifr technology your vote today is more about how we explore new ideas than about your final

designed to replace but you need not have reached that conclusion today let us simply acknowledge that it does not make sense to say in essence that scientists cannot continue to collect data as we
