at a commemoration a memorial tribute to one of the great people of the house sala burton basically what i said was that to me sala burton had the glamour of a marlene deitrich and the heart and good will of a mother teresa and the political savvy of a golda meir if anyone read the congressio al record when my distin guished colleague mr edwards dean of the california delegation introduced the privilege resolution they would know the overwhelming expression of grief and love for sala she was really a mother a sister and a friend to all of us she cared in a very special way for people she really did love her roots her family her country the congress and she had a real affectionthose callfornians stick togetherfor the california delegation she certainly loved san francisco she was extremely proud to represent and it was americas perfect city with its great diversity of people she meant very very much to the wives of the members of course she was the cofounder of the congressional wives task force and always reached out to make them feel a part of congress sala often told me of the pride and love she had for her daughter and her soninlaw and her grandchildren she admired her daughters abilities and independence her parents meant very very much to her her mother still is living god bless her and she had a marvelous impression from her parents she often talked about her fathers brilliance and her mothers common sense and their interest in current affairs she was very proud of her brotherinlaw john and believed he had tremendous values as did her husband and values that are known in california indeed nationally as the great burton tradition she was proud of johns personal courage as well and proud of her brotherinlaw bob as well she was very very proud of her brother and her nephew tom who was so gracious to so many of us during salas illness i want to say this about her staff she felt that they were an extended part of her family and they ought to know how much affection sala had for them and how much it meant to her that they carried on during her illness so in a very special way all of us can claim sala in a very real way of course she loved her beloved phillip as she would say you could not talk to her for any length of time without knowing of the respect and love she had for her husband she quoted him often she felt even after he died that she was an extension of him but sala in her own right was a magnificent congresswoman and a very savvy politician she was intensely political and long before she became a congresswoman she served her political apprenticeship she traced her interest to her childhood in prewar poland she said i saw and felt what happened n western europe when the nazis were moving you learn politics is everybodys business she had instant clout in the house when we look at her assignments we see that she was practically hmmedlately after a term of being here assigned to the prestigious committee the committee on rules she was a delegate to the north atlantic assembly where 60 parliamentarians from nato elected her vice chair of the political committee last spring in luxembourg i saw her chair the committee and i saw the love and esteem of our allies and our fellow and sister parliamentarians who really thought that she was so outstanding she knew how to get things done one can recall the many instances in which sala did in fact buttonhole her friends i said in san francisco that she buttonholed the men in congress by flicking the lint from their lapels rather than twisting their arms her style was different from phils to say the least but it was equally as effective so how do we accept her death one of the things that sala was most proud of really was her jewish background so i quoted from the mourners kaddish in which there are a line or two that indicate that thru the long centuries and this is a quote from that beautiful prayer thru the long centuries we have learned to rise in the face of every storm out of the abyss of anguish on the ashes of every destruction to praise gods name to maintain a stance of human dignity and to affirm our consecration to the task of life that was her goal life was so important to her and she was consecrated to this the wednesday before salas death i had the great privilege of visiting her along with senator alan cranston and my friend and colleague the gentleman from california don edwands and at the end i whispered a few words to sala and she said to me and the last words she said to me were tell everyone i think of them and love them and she said goodbye mary rosewell talk which was a common expression of saas we will talk about salafor we will think of her legacy and her values that wonderful burton tradition we know that already there have been a number of things that people are proposing to name after her such as the sala burton maritime museum which of course was part of her legislation to have that funded properly and the gentleman from arizona mr mo udall did change the name in the legislation naming it after her one of the things that i would like to suggest i have introduced a bill that would allow the staff and people who work on the hill to have access to a daycare center and that has been passed i think that it would really be an honor for me to know that my legislation somehowand the gentlewoman from colorado mrs pat schroeder is the one who suggested it and i think it is a great ideato somehow dedicate that daycare center to the memory of our friend sala burton so we accept her death in the sense of alfred lord tennyson when he recalled in his wonderful poem in memoriam when he had the death of one of his dear friends thrust upon him and he was wondering how he could accept this great tragedy one of the lines that he uttered then and which is recorded for all of us immortally is something that consoles me very much when i think of her and that is ris better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all we all loved sala burton and we will talk to her many many times"], [0.00017789994308259338, 0.00017789994308259338, 0, "it is clear that the congress is deeply divided on

sanlnista national liberation front fslnj lost an election the fsln would hand over government not power daniel oretga the new york times december 13 1987 the reason for outlining those statements is to show that the sandinistas are firmly committed to communism no communist government in the history of the world has ever agreed to convert to a democratic form of government yet that is what the sandinistas are asking us to believe they will do now we should be extremely skeptical of the sandinistas intentions in order to protect our own national security interests to help keep other central american governments from being subverted by communism and to help the people of nicaragua who do not want to live under a communist regime if the cnntras are defunded and killedoff the united states and her allies will depend upon soviet cuban and nicaraguan goodwill our insurance and deterrence of further communist expansion will no longer be the nicaraguan resistance but the military of the united states of america i do not think this is wise especially when nicaraguans are now willing to fight their own battles can the sandinista communists be trusted to democratize nicaragua perhaps another question should be asked instead why did they not democratize nicaragua when they came to power 9 years ago when president carter delivered economic aid to what was then billed as a free and democratic movement the reason is that the sandinistas decoived the world about their intentions then and they are deceiving the world now by playing games with the central america peace process in

mistakes over andover again in the early 1930s the liberal party forthrightly against building up the forthrightly against building up the military power of the british empire even though they knew that hitler was violating the treaty of versailles which was signed in 1918 they came up with this policy under the liberal government when the treaty of versailles was signed it said very clearly that the germans could not build up beyond a 100 000man army and yet what they did was they took the military and built a 100j000man elite corps that was to train millions of other people the liberal party and the british parliament would not ever believe whatwas actually going on before their very eyes the problem is that once a groupof people like the liberals in this body or the liberals in the british parliament get their head set in a certain direction it is almost impossible for them to turnit into another direction the liberal party in england did not change their approach even though hitler started violating the treaty ofversailles and becoming very aggressive with the surrounding countries infact when lord chamberlain flew to munich in 1938 and signed that infamous agreement and came back saying we have peace in our time he had just sown the seeds of world war ii they still were committed to fighting for a disarmament policy and fighting for a paper peace that is what we see on the liberal side of this congress the liberals are committed to a disarmament program for central america they do not want to help the freedom fighters down there and if they do not profit from history and start seeing what tyrant communists and fascists have done in the past we will be committed to the same kind of conflict that we faced in world war ii there is no question about it appeasement policies did not work in 1938 1939 and 1940 and they are not going to work in 1986 1987 and 1988 what is goingto happen is our position is going to be weakened to such a degree that the communists are going to expand their sphere of influence into nicaragua as they have promised el salvador guatemala honduras and up into mexico and when that happens we will be forced like great

planned to make any comment about the previous special order but i do have concern that that kind of scurrilous attack on an individual without them being able to defend themselves is something that kind of bothers me as far as i know there has been no indictment of attorney general meese there may be differences of opinion on how he should conduct himself in that office but many of us feel like he has done a pretty good job and so i would just say to those on the other side of the aisle who continually attack him we could take potshots at members on your side of the aisle who come under attack by the media but we do not do that too often and there are members on that side of the aisle who have been investigated for improprieties in the congress improprieties in their outside activities but we try to refrain from that kind of attack unless there is no other way to express ourselves and it is absolutely imperative that we do so so i think that the attack that was just made on the attorney general of the united states was unwarranted especially in a special order and i take issue with that now as to my special order there is a lot of euphoria in the united states right now because we just signed an inf treaty with the soviet union and everybody in the country seems to be happy that we are dismantling some nuclear weapons albeit only about 3 percent of the nuclear forces on both sides of the atlantic and pacific oceans but the fact of the matter is many people although not the majority feel like it may have been a step in the wrong direction i would like to tonight in my special order try to explain why i have reservations about the justsigned inf treaty it may be a post mortem on the position that i have taken and some of my colleagues have taken nevertheless i feel compelled to try to explain why these reservations exist i wrote a letter to the defense intelligence agency asking them a number of questions about soviet capability as far as their intercontinental ballistic missiles are concerned particularly the ss24s and ss25s and i just received a response today from them which i would like to read to my colleagues who may be watching back in their offices before i do that however i want to point out one thing the inf treaty provides that we are going to dismantle our pershing ii and ground cruise missiles and the soviet union is going to dismantle their ss20s and some other intermediaterange missiles they are going to eliminate about 1 400 nuclear warheads we are going to eliminate about 400 that sounds good but my concern has been since the treaty was discussed initially can the soviets cheat can they replace inp or can they replace the ss20s they are going to be dismantling with another generation of missile and does it really take us back from the nuclear precipice or does it merely weaken the free world as far as our nuclear deterrent is concerned and does it put us in an inferior position or will it lead to an inferior position the ss20s they are going to be dismantling are short and intermediaterange weapons the ss24s and ss25s that they have been building very rapidly are intercontinental ballistic missiles so i wrote to the pentagon the defense intelligence agency and asked them these questions can the soviet ssx24 and ss25 strategic missiles be retargeted to hit shortrange and intermediaterange targets those are the targets that the ss20s were going to be able to hit before we agreed to have them dismantled the answer from the defense intelligence agency is this both the ssx24 and ss25 like many of the other icbms which preceded them have the technical capability of being flown to a variety of ranges these would include flight ranges from those typical of the ss20 irbm up to amaximum range of around 10 000 km what that means simply is that if the soviets deploy enough ss24s and ss25s they can hit not only the intercontinental targets that they have said that they want to hit if they launch a first strike but they can also use those same weapons to hit the same targets that the ss20s would have hit so this inf treaty that is going to cause the dismantling of the ss20s and the pershing ii and ground cruise missiles is in my view going to be decidedly in favor of the soviets because they are building very rapidly ss24s and ss25s the ss25 is a mobilelaunched icbm with multiple warheads it is going to be very difficult to verify if not impossible because it is on the back of a railroad flatcar on rails they can go anywhere in the soviet union and it is going to be mounted on the back of trucks it is an integral part of a truck system so it can go anyplace in the soviet union and be launched on their intermediate shortrange targets as well as intercontinental targets i asked this question considering that both of these systems are mobile could they not be moved widely throughout the soviet union in order to adjust their flight range to strike targets anywhere in western europe or asia their answer was"], [0.0008135274983942509, 0.0008135274983942509, 0, "i rise in opposition to the bill on march 2 1 voted in favor of s 557 the civil rights restoration act because i have a deep commitment to civil rights in our country i wasand remainin favor of overturning the grove city decision and the continued execution of our four civil rights statutes however since that march 2 vote i have had additional time to further review the significance and ramifications of the provisions of this legislation in consideration of what i have learned from justice department officials the presidents staunch rejection andmost importantlymeasuring the wishes of church leaders school officials small business owners and farmers in my district i will vote in favor of the presidents alternative and to sustain his veto of s 557 i sincerely believe that s 557 would not just overturn the grove city decision but that it would expand on existing statutes to appoint of excessive costly and libertythreatening government involvement in our daily lives i repeat my support for the presidents alternative to this federal intrusion act because it would work to uphold civil rights in our country while keeping bureaucrats out of the lives of farmers small businessmen and religious leaders i am particularly interested in just how individual rights will be affected if this supposed restoration legislation is voted into law i sincerely believe that the citizens of our nation will be better protected from government intrusion by the presidents alternative while at the same time not jeopardizing the civil rights of women the aged minorities and the disabled to call this legislation a simple restoration of previous civil rights laws is just short of insulting in reality this bill is a significant expansion i am afraid that we are now using the good intentions of congressional members to give the federal government the green light in intrusive regulation and oversight of churches schools small businesses farms and other organizations restoration in this case is simply shorthand for expansion the civil rights restoration act would propel the federal government into situations where it should not be for example those groups in the united states with unique religious lineages would be subject to discrimination clauses that conflict with deeply hoeld benefits as far asl know the freedom of religion is still a right protected by the unitedstates constitution why then should schools which are distinctly associated with religious tenets be subject to litigation because they refuse to take action contrary to those tenants they could then be forced to hire someone who is not inclined to support the very tenets that the school is based upon you see this is just one area where the governmenis should not be this is why i support the presidents alternative to the religious tenet question the presidents proposal bolsters our constitutional rights in the area of religious freedom this is another example of why the presidents attemative is indeed superior lets look at just one area that would be covered by expanded discrimination clauses under this legislation grocery stores were grocery stores covered prior to 1he grove city decision no the justice department informs me that grocery stores and supermarkets that participated in the foodstamp program were not simply by virtue of their participation in that program subject to the four civil rights laws will they be covered under s 557 the answerseems to be yes i alongwith many of my colleagues would appreciate it if the sponsors of this legislation would stop misleading the public by saying it is merely a restoration when it is actually a power grab for the federal government speaking from personal experience my father owned a corner pharmacy in tully ny a typical momandpop operation i ask myself how he would have reacted to the possibility of being accused of discrimination simply because he could not afford to install wheelchair ramps lower shelves and adjust counters it would surely be excessive to force a smallbusiness owner to renovate his entire store just to curtail the chance of discrimination lawsuit but this is exactly what this legislation seems to require ultimately and ironically the reaction of small momandpop stores will be to withdraw from participation in federal foodstamp and medicaid programs because of the costs administrative burdens and legal liabilities that participation would impose and who would be the ultimate losers in this type of situation it will be those who rely on momandpop stores for their foodstamp and medicaid purchases this certainly isnt my idea of civil rights let us also look at the effect this would have on our already overburdened judicial system this bill would not merely encourage but would exacerbate excessive litigation as we all know the business community already faces an explosive growth in litigation s 557 would undoubtedly create multitudes of new plaintiffs to add to our current liability crisis litigation shopping would be a veiy real possibility in short the legal profession would have a heyday while our judicial system would be even further overwhelmed with lawsuits i implore my colleagues to contemplate the adverse effects this legislationas currently draftedwould have on our legal system our business community our farmers our schools our churches and our individual daily lives i am hopeful that we indeed have

plans to use that military against its neighbors and is willing to sacrifice its own economy to finance its military and ultimately represents a security threat to this country and particularly to one of our prime economic assets the panama canal therefore my choice is to take those rational steps necessary to deal with that communist threat there are others who disagree they see this situation as one where we the people of the united states are to blame where the communist threat is insignificant and in fact we have heard in this debate earlier today that we ought to learn to trust the communists there and any danger to our security or the security of the embryonic democracies in central america is secondary to the goal of peace even if it threatens freedom why do i say they do not believe there is any real communist threat the democratic study group letter was referred to earlier i have been through the whole letter and there is not one mention made in there of any communist threat in fact the only problem they see in central america in this letter is proverty and maldistribution of wealth something which is strikingly similar to the communist sandinista analysis of what is going on down there it seems to me also that you have got a situation where their measure that they bring forth advocates a position that is necessary to abandon our commitments there and accommodate the communist regime that will inevitably result is that too strong they have a presidential candidate one of our leading presidential candidates who told us recently that we should be

the hand of tyranny has again been truly thrown off and we are certain that the will of the haitian people will not again be thwarted make no mistake about it this congress likes what it hears general avril saying with the support of the noncommissioned officers and the haitian army general avril and those supporting him have stated their desire to return haiti to the path toward democracy he has reached out beyond the army to involve the opposition leadership and other key groups in a national dialog and that is an important step toward national reconciliation we like what has been done with the removal from office some of the most notorious defenders of the old order determined to halt a transition to democracy the last few weeks have seemingly brought about an almost unbelievable transformation where there was despair there now is hope but we in the united states have learned through harsh experience that the performance of haitis leaders seldom has reflected their democratic rhetoric while we hope and pray that the apparent alignment of the haitian army with the desires of the haitian people will bring a new day united states policy must be based on reality and not expectations if we are to again provide large amounts of assistance to haiti it must be on the basis of haitian government performance toward achieving the goals of liberty justice and prosperity laid down by the haitian people in the constitution they approved overwhelmingly in 1987 general avril has spoken well of democracy but without free open and fair elections there is no democracy it is to be hoped that the new government of haiti will promptly set a date for elections in the not too distant future and that it will establish an electoral process that will have the respect and support of the haitian people the concurrent resolution before us today is offered neither in a spirit of concession or confrontation the resolution sets forth clearly and simply the sense of congress with respect to those goals to which we deem the haitian government must be committed if in behalf of the american people the congress is ever to approve providing assistance to the haitian government today no such assistance is provided it is forbidden by the appropriations law just enacted while assistance to the haitian people continues through private voluntary organizations this resolution would make explicit the intent of congress that aid to the haitian government not be resumed until and unless the government of haiti has taken clear and decisive actions to acheive certain specified goals these are not washingtons goals but goals repeatedly called for by the haitian people themselves what are the steps we expect the haitian government to take to embark on a credible transition to democracy based on the 1937 constitution and announcement of an election date to respect human and civil rights to reform the corrupt bureaucracy to promote economic development and to assure the personal security and right to assembly essential to grassroots development to step up cooperation with us on narcotics trafficking and to demonstrate the militarys willingness to accept civilian rule and to abide by haitis constitution section 2 of the resolution provides that it is further the sense of congress that we not have a regular and sustained assistance relationship with the government until a civilian government has been elected through free and open elections and further provides that no assistance should be given until after there have been full consultations with the congress by the executive branch sectioti 3 of the resolution declares congress support for the aspirations of the haitian people for an elected civilian government and for economic government and urges appropriate committees of congress to take whatever actions they deem appropriate to promote free elections either through positive steps such as assistance or through the enactment of economic sanctions such as those now pending in h r 4152 if progress is not made toward free elections section 4 of the resolution calls on the executive branch to work with our friends and allies to shape a

first part of mr sihumways dear colleague letter to my people who follow the written record know what is coming up tomorrow dear colleague as you know the united nations human rights commission is expected to vote on a unitedstates resolution which simply asks the commission to investigate the continuing reports of serious human rights violations in cuba there is no disagreement about cubas human rights record it is one of the few countries in which a political prisoner that is our first amendment generally can be sentenced to 20 years survive the horrors of boniato or combinado del este prison and not be released two decades later even when he has served his entire prison sentence why is the vote expected to be so close again this year remember one member pointed out that india went against us mr gandhi the former 747 pilot the dashing figure who stood before us at that treasured spot up here where winston churchill stood and lectured us about central america and he put vietnam out of his ken he does not worry about that any more but he votes i guess because he has lenin square in front of his presidential palace and all of the soviet joint commitments to make migs even up to the mig29 fulcrum and let us hope that india comes to its senses as the worlds largest democracy in population why is it expected to be so close this year mr shumway says continuing because fidel castro is an expert at terrorizing his own people he is also an expert at terrorizing the democratic nations in this hemisphere last year cuba warned that armed disturbances would occur in countries which supported the united states resolution imagine the arrogance of this guy but then he is going to be watching his eighth united states president come into office in january while he has been there without having had an election the international community has ignored the suffering of the cuban people for nearly 3 decades 30 years the time has come for those countries who believe in fundamental human rights and freedoms to take a stand on cuba the gentleman from california has excellent material here fabulous statements of our great ambassador up there the incomparable linguist gen vernon walters he has statements from armando valladares when we came back from a factfinding trip in honduras and nicaragua and we put in a call to the white house to go down and give a report to

to the human rights commission and the u n and then castro together with the kremlin went into a highpowered disinformae n program to try to shred this mans reputation but anybody who has read valladares book against all hope or has met this compelling figure they know that this is just more communist lies to destroy a good man so i look forward to participating with you and the gentleman

saying as the gentleman from illinois said quoting the bible by their fruits ye shall know them let us just take a quick look at what the soviet troops have been doing to the people of afghanistan and why we should not trust them in an article last november by bryan brumley of the washington times i want to quote a little bit of his article soviet and allied troops in afghanistan have sexually mutilated political and religious opponents an international team of attorneys said yesterday their report cited systematic violations of geneva convention bans on genocide there is another violation of our previous agreementtorture and the use of chemical weapons the independent counsel on international human rights a group of lawyers funded by a conservative group the committee for a free afghanistan said its report was based on interviews with afghan refugees in pakistan as well as a visit to afghanistan the report said soviet and allied afghan government troops systematically destroyed farms and villages in order to depopulate large regions of afghanistan including the wakhan corridor bordering on china which it said has been effectively annexed by the soviet union the report also said the communist forces undertook a campaign against afghan culture and the moslem religion including the forced removal of children to the soviet union in violation of the geneva conventions governing the conduct of war the report said officials of the sovietbacked government regularly enter schools and select children and send them to the soviet union for up to several years over parents protests the report said the intent is to produce a new generation of afghans who share the values of the soviet union rather than those of their parents it said red army and afghan government actions also allegedly violate geneva convention protections on religion a former afghan air force officer testified that after a fellow officers wife had been found praying pilots in the unit were called together and given a political lecture and told that their families should not be praying the breasts of the pilots wife were then dropped in front of him in a plastic bag mosques moslem worship places are used as latrines by soviet troops occupying villages and pages of the koran used as toilet paper the report said among the witnesses interviewed were two who had been tortured as recently as last summer at a prison run by the government in kabul one of them had been shackled to a wail while an empty heated soda bottle was repeatedly forced in and out of his rectum the report said another released in june reported similar torture on one occasion his urinary tract was cut off he was forced to consume a large quantity of liquid and was then beaten on the stomach the report said the report did not specify whether those victims were tortured by soviets or afghans but it concluded after interviews of 40 torture victims that soviet advisers are allegedly often present either in the same room or an adjacent room in addition there have been reports of soviets torturing afghan prisoners the torturers reportedly were seeking information on activities of anticommunist guerrillas and details of foreign involvement in the conflict the lawyers group also found evidence that red army and afghan government forces violate geneva convention prohibitions regarding the use of violence against civilians and refugees and the use of chemical weapons once again that is another violation of an agreement by the soviet union many persons provided evidence on the use of chemicals to poison food and war supplies the report said the attorneys said they witnessed an air attack on a column of refugees on the afghanpakistan border they also heard testimony that one group of refugees headed for pakistan this year were captured by soviet troops in helicopters and thrown while alive into a bonfire made up of the possessions they have been carrying all captured were killed the report said dozens of witnesses told stories of returning to their villages and homes following attacks by soviet soldiers to find bombs and grenades placed in doorways so as to explode when a door is opened along paths and by plants and bushes which will be collected for firewood and food they have been dropping plastic toys which have blown off the hands and feet of little children over there these are the people with whom we are going to be signing this agreement in geneva tomorrow we should be resuppling the afghan freedom fighters totally so that they can drive the soviets out of afghanistan once and for all and get rid of the communist puppet regime in kabul that is what should be done not signing an agreement which very well might cut off aid to the freedom fighters and allowing the communists to continue to resupply the communist government in kabul and keeping the puppet regime there that will do be bidding of the soviet union what are we really for are we really for freedom are we really for democracy if we are we should live up to the agreements in the past and not sign this agreement with the communists in geneva"]], "top_incorrect":

answered that i had just moved to maine from arkansas and i felt alone i also thought that it would hurt my parents to know i began to cry i was handed a form to sign i do not recall any of the

programs if this amendment is adopted the federal government will find itself in the march 2 1 988 untenable position of providing federal assistance to programs that discriminate against minorities women the handicapped and the elderly the amendment opens up a giant loophole in the existing title ix religious tenet exemption since its enactment in 1972 title ix has permitted very narrow exceptions from the prohibition against genderbased discrimination in any federally funded education program one of the exceptions is available to an educational institution if it is controlled by a religious organization and there is a title ix requirement which conflicts with the religious tenets of that organization since this bill was introduced in 1985 supporters cf this loophole amendment have argued that such a change is necessary because otherwise these institutions which they claim are no longer religiously controlled will have to pay for or perform abortions they can no longer make that claim in light of the danforth amendment now at last they must confess their true motives which is they simply want to be exempt from title ix coverage in fact they have lobbied for this change each time title ix has been amended congress in its wisdom has rejected this effort during consideration of this bill a few weeks ago the senate rejected their claim by a vote of 56 to 39 the house refused to accept this proposal during floor consideration of the restoration bill in virtually every private school can establish some affiliation with a religious organization adoption of such a loophole would defeat the purpose of title ix not only is such a proposal unacceptable on policy grounds it is also unnecessary proponents of this amendment cannot cite a single instance in which legitimate exemptions have been denied it is critical that the control test remain in effect and enforced seriouslyfor that aspect of the test is the linchpin for assuring that only a limited number of institutions may discriminate with federal funds the proposed change to the corporate coverage section in s 557 is unacceptable and unwarranted the corporate coerage provision in the bill

have a full airing of the issue and hear from the industry and the regulators before this house acts the most compelling reason in my view for the house to reject this amendment is simly because it is unworkable the gentleman from texas said earlier that the issue is between the airlines and the regulator what the gentlemans amendment succeeds in doing is putting airport administrators in the middle people who have nothing to do with regulating airlines and making them into policemen of the airlines that is the faas job i suggest we let them do it do not put people who have nothing to do with this question in the middle we owe our constituents better than this and i think we can solve the airliner smoking question i urge my colleagues to reject this amendment let us do our job

presidents veto like many of my colleagues both my district and washington offices have received hundreds of calls to sustain the presidents veto 01 the grove city bill my oflices have tallied at least 666 calls a welcome the opportunity o do my part to ensure that civil rights are not threatened under the guise of restoration by voting to sustain the piesidents veto unquestionably we all abhor acts that dis criminate against another individual for reasons of race sex color religion national origin age or handicap however i believe that this bill h r 1214 would extend its enforcement authority far beyond the proper scope of the federal government if passed the language of the bill makes it clear that the government would have the authority to supervise intervene into and regulate virtually every entity in this country i support the presidents veto of grove city because it trespasses upon the civil rights of our churches schools farms and businesses and restricts much of the good many of the institutions are able to do in helping our government attend to those in need the presidents veto signals his concern over the religious and economic implications of this bill imagine the ironies involved here a church which accepts federally subsidized cheese for its soup kitchen is susceptible to a federal investigation not only is this an intrusion but it also wastes time that could be better spent feeding people the grocer who accepts food stamps for those customers who need them would also be susceptible to a federal investigation civil rights and the freedom to exercise them represent the great freedom that identifies and motivates our country my vote to sustain the presidents veto is cast in the spirit of this freedom"], [0.00023597478866577148, 0.5002359747886658,

the most capable presidents of this century harry s truman speaking to the silver owls of the club gen donald dawson february 1988 a top aide to the president provided valuable insight into trumans white house years general dawson recaled the leadership role that truman display3d during his two presidential terms truman had a hands on management style that worked his staff was continuously impresssed by his command of the facts and were aware that each briefing had to be accurate or else the president would correct them the general reported that truman held frequent press conferences not in response to the clamor of the press or concern with public image but due to his commitment to an informed american public when asked questions truman would respond with specifics not generalities harry truman wanted the public to know what he is doing he wanted his office to be open to criticism as well as praise dawson recalls the time that he tried to brief the president on ways he could decide an issue and derive the most political benefit characteristically truman replied what is best for the country as we prepare to elect another man to fill the office of president let us

act in 1964 congress passed landmark legislation the civil rights act which provided basic civil rights protections for most american citizens however this did not cover our own employees most recently this congress passed the civil rights restoration act which reiterated our responsibility to see that federal funds do not in any form support discriminatory actions however again we did not protect our own employees for over 24 years our employees have not been provided protection from discrimination guaranteed all other american citizens the question we must raise is why should congress not have to comply with the laws congress passes the answer is simply that congress should comply with these laws our employees provide us with valuable service yet currently have no recourse when confronted with discrimination entering employment of congress shouldnt be tantamount to entering a black hole of employment rights today we have the opportunity to pass legislation to rectify this
