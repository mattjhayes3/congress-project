{"top_correct": [[0.0, 1.0, 1, "2 weeks ago during our initial consideration of the first budget resolution the house spoke very clearly in adopting the oakar amendment to that resolution that it would not tolerate budget reductions in the medicare program today i am introducing legislation which will asture the solvency of the medicare trust fund by injecting general revenues into that fund these general revenues would be generated by repeal of some of the most outrageous provisions of the internal revenue codethose relating to tax preferences for oil producers and royalty owners we have a moral commitment to the health of our nations older citizens and medicare is perhaps the most significant and important federal pro gram helping to fulfill that commitment today 26 million older persons and 3 million disabled persons depend on medicare to help meet their health care costs sixty percent of these beneficiaries are older women as important as medicare is it only meets between 33 to 40 percent of the health needs of older americans clearly significant reductions or added outofpocket costs for beneficiaries would be a tragedy for many of our neediest elderly and disabled citizens i believe it is the height of folly to look to reductions in medicare benefits in order to cut federal expenditures when at the same time we have wholesale giveaways to oil companies existing in our tax code there are a number of provisions some of which passed last year as part of the economic recovery tax act that have little if any economic justification and which should be repealed i am proposing that the revenue collected by closing these loopholes be specifically earmarked and directed to the federal hospital trust fund from which medicare is financed last year i joined the gentleman from new york peter peyser and 74 of my colleagues in proposing to repeal those sections of erta which amended the windfall profit tax act by exempting 2 barrels of oil per day3 starting in 1985for royalty owners reducing the tax on newly discovered oil from 30 to 15 percent over 5 years and exempting stripper oil by independent producers altogether from the windfall profit tax these three provisions will cost the treasury 1 962 billion in 1983 2 333 billion in 1984 and 2 995 billion in 1985 for a 3 year total of 7 29 billion the bill i am introducing today would also repeal these provisions these massive unjustified exemptions for royalty owners and producers were motivated by nothing more than pure political gamemanship certainly not by economics or sound energy policy in addition to the repeal of the erta provisions i am also proposing significant changes in two other provisions of the codethe percentage depletion allowance and the expensing of intangible drilling costs under percentage depletion independent producers and royalty owners are given an option accorded to no other taxpayers in our country they may choose cost depletion which is essentially like straight line depreciation available to all taxpayers holding capital assets or percentage depletion which allows a deduction of 18 percent of gross oil related iricome with certain restrictions since percentage depletion can be used for whatever number of years the oil well continues to produce we are left with the outrageous result that total deductions can far exceed the taxpayers investment if it could be demonstrated that percentage depletion led to greatly increased production of oil perhaps it could be justified however economists question whether percentage depletion has any stimulative effect at all on the production of oil even worse the drain on the treasury is tremendous 1 5 billion each year in 1983 and 1984 and 2 2 billion in 1985 for a 3year total of 4 2 billion another preference accorded the oil industry is the allowance of expensing for intangible drilling costs idcs include drilling shooting and cleaning the well draining road making stirveying and geological work in preparation for drilling construction of derricks tank pipelines necessary for drilling and preparatiop of the well for production in any other context costs like these would be treated as capital expenditures and depreciated over the useful life of the asset or perhaps some other reasonable fixed period of time which bears some relation to its useful life however idcs can be expensed in the first year which results in a tremendous tax deferral opportunity for the oil industry although the 1976 tax reform act restricted the use of idc expensing the tax preference is still very much in existence analysis by the joint economic committee has concluded that the major oil companies who comprise 70 to 75 percent of those using this device can absorb the increased tax without a shortage of capital if the expensing option were eliminated the cost to the treasury due to idc expensing is staggering 3 5 billion in 1983 7 7 billion in 1984 and 8 4 billion in 1985 for a 3year cost of 19 6 billion the total in foregone revenue represented by these provisions equals 6 962 billion in 1983 11 533 billion in 1984 and 13 595 billion in 1985 for a 3year grand total 32 09 billion all the figures i have cited were generated by the joint committee on taxation we have a very simple choice we can continue to waste over 32 billion over the next 3 years on tax breaks for the oil industry provisions which do little to stimulate oil production or energy independence or we can take that sum of money and invest it in our nations elderly and disabled helping them to live a more healthy life the house has spoken once already in adopting the oakar amendment declaring that the health care needs of our older citizens are important than reconstructing brokendown obsolete battleships i ask my colleagues to speak once again and pass this legislation demonstrating that our commitment to the elderly and disabled takes a priority than giveways to the oil companies a chart detailing the figures discussion herein follows"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "first of all i would like to commend congressman wyche fowler for providing the time for this much needed discussion of a very critical issue the slaying of over 20 children in atlanta ga is clearly indicative of the sickness which is eroding the fibers of our society violence is becoming more and more a way of life throughout our nation the atlanta slayings and related attacks against children are very cogent symbols that we are moving further away from the highest regard for human life it frightens me deeply to acknowledge the significant psychological damage which is growing among all children due to the recent incidences while the victims of these murders have all been black it is no secret that such acts of violence do not discriminate the fundamental question we must face now is that any child may be forced to live in fear during every phase of a days activity surely the increased number of weaponcarrying schoolchildren momentary periods of panic if a parent is late picking up a schoolchild and decrease in academic achievement are not peculiar to the findings of several atlanta psychiatrists psychologists and mental health officials the feelings of distrust fear and apprehension wih spread among all of our nations children as they begin ti dread functioning in everyday environments this is a sad outlook for our future another fundamental question which is magnifici in the minds of those who fear for human safety is the continuing focus away from human needs we are forced now to question if whether or not the evils of poverty deprivation and unemployment may be so deep rooted in our society that respect for human life becomes secondary to mere survival we are also forced to question the validity of continuous violence as romanticized and glamourized on our television and movie screens the situations in georgia florida maryland and throughout most regions in this country leave us frustrated and angry they leave us to question the basic responsiveness of authorities who must become more adamant in the protection of human lives however they must not lead us to take the law into our own hands the widespread acts of violence must also remind us that the protection and preservation of human lives are crossjurisdictional when as many as 21 lives are lost it cannot be pegged as a state or local government matter both the president and the congress realized this and i laud the dispersal of federal funds to atlanta and the efforts to appropriate 1 5 and 1 8 million for use by this city we have to examine closely the cli mate that motivates and encourages psychotic violence the violence of racism the aforementioned influence of television and movies and the violence of war and militarismall of these inevitably get reflected in individual behavior to a greater or lesser degree he psychotic killers who murder our children in atlanta or any where else are victims of this climate and have apparently been affected to a greater degree we cannot excuse this behavior however we can and must deal squarely with the environment which fosters such actions several sociologists tell us that most of the slain atlanta children come from public housing neighborhoods which are more vulnerable and conducive to human mistreatment abduction and even death such conditions and incidences are not limited to this region of the country right here in washington d c children from lowincome housing projects are becoming more and more susceptible to conditions of drug abuse and molestation here the elimination of unemployment underemployment and poverty must precede the eradication of such criminal acts it is not easy to warn the blacks of atlanta to stay away from theories that the acts of violence against 21 black children are conspiratorial in nature or racially motivated the pattern of systematic murders rapes additional overt and covert actions against black citizens in the south and throughout this country is still just too prevalent however we must assist in the efforts of mayor maynard jackson the numerous task forces and concerned cftizens in addressing the problem in a rational way again until we eliminate the fundamental societal ills we cannot be shocked at deviant behavioral patterns of violence irresponsibility and total disregard for human lives there is little help in calling on citizens to care about each other when increasing inequities among neighborhoods schools living standards and opportunities have become a way of life those of us who are in a position to have impact on public policy must stand firm against further inequities and burdens on our children elderly and lowincome citizens we must promote the kind of solidarity which has been displayed as citizens across the nation have rallied behind the victimized atlanta families most importantly we must not be afraid to oppose and openly attack racism chronic unemployment poverty injustice and other societal ills which cloud any efforts to provide equal opportunities for each and every citizen e"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "i rise in support of the fauntroy substitute the congressional black caucus once again has presented an alternative budget plan that offers this nation the promise of strong economic recovery rather than the continued pain of unemployment high interest rates and runaway deficts this alternative is necessitated by the fact that this current administration continues to make excuses for its bankrupt economic policies which are bankrupting our nation we are told to just wait intil our economic recovery program takes effect we have been waiting now for 8 months with these results interest rates are the highest in history 16 million americans are either out of work working parttime or so discouraged that they no longer even look for work the housing industry is in the worst condition since world war ii business failures and farm foreclosures are running at the highest levels since the great depression this litany could go on and on but suffice it to say that if the congress had enacted last year the congressional black caucus economic recovery plan instead of president reagans we would not be suffering the economic contractions that are now wreaking havoc with our nation there is no joy however in pointing out that the congressional black caucus last year predicted the misery and human suffering that would occur as a result of the adoption of the reagan economic program the reagan record hs all too clearly shown that the congressional black caucus was right the congressional black caucus is right again this year we have once again met the presidents challenge to put up or shut up we put up once again a fair and sound budget proposal which will rescue our nation from devastating and debilitating deficits unemployment and economic stagnation the fauntroy alternative controls federal spending not by pushing millions more americans into poverty not by a continued assault on the nations young disadvantaged and poor but by an assault on wasteful military spending extravagant tax breaks to wealthy citizens and irresponsible tax subsidies for profitable corporations the fauntroy substitute rejects the reagan economic shell game which redistributes income from the poor and middle class to the rich more than any other alternative the cbc alternative embodies creative and comprehensive tax reformstopping the raid on the federal treasury through tax breaks for those who least need them rather the cbc alternative restructures the presidents tax cut to principally benefit those earning less than 50 000 per year moreover our alternative provides real tax relief to the poor and middle class by increasing the standard deduction and earned income tax credit the fauntroy substitute proves that fiscal responsibility can be achieved while maintaining compassion and concern for the american people by implementing tax reform and by reducing military expenditures the cbc budget would reduce the projected fiscal year 1983 deficit to 97 billion by 1985 a surplus of 4 2 billion would result let me emphasize once again that fiscal responsibility need not come at the expense of the poor and disadvantaged in our society the republican party platform for 1980 said the measure of a countrys compassion is how it treats the least fortunate yet we now know that this republican administration has systematically dismantled every program which was created to serve our least fortunate under the cbc budget the american tradition of compassion and concern for the needy and destitute would be restored to address the totally unacceptable rate of unemployment among our people the cbc alternative includes 6 billion for a desperately needed jobs program to train and put people who want to work back to work additionally the cbc budget restores funding for important education programs such as title 1 and student financial aid in order to maintain an investment in our human capital and in our future by educating our young people other vital national needs in housing social services and transportation which the reagan budget fails miserably to address are best met under the cbc alternative budget in short there is a way to move this nation toward the goal of reduced inflation without throwing millions of americans out of work there is a way to reduce the federal deficit without taking school lunches away from hungry children and snatching costofliving adjustments from the elderly there is a way to lower interest rates and to restore confidence in our economy without slamming the door on thousands of small businessmen and farmers the way is the fauntroy substitute i have a special concern in the area of health care and waut to discuss with my colleagues the cbc alternative budget proposals in this regard the fauntroy subutitute recommends that 85 5 billion be spent on health care programs in fiscal year 1p83 in order to provide the resources necessary to treat and prevent disease care for sick workers mothers children and the elderly this amount is a full 7 5 billion more than the reagan budget and 5 5 oillion more than the budget committee alternative as cochairman of the congressional black caucus health brain trust i enjoy the benefit of the special expertise of hundreds of experienced health care professionals throughout the country these health care professionals are appalled and rightly so about the ruthless impact of last years budget cuts on the ability of poor and disadvantaged americans to obtain high quality medical care it is all too obvious that the great progress that we have made in the last decade in expanding the availability and affordability of health care from inner city communities to isolated rural towns is swiftly being undermined last year 1 billion was slashed from the medicaid program forcing states to cut benefits and limit eligibility for the poor and working poor as a result over 1 million people lost med icaid coverage virtually all of the losers were women and children in lowincome families thousands of families with incomes at or below the poverty line when faced with overwhelming medical care costs have had to quit their meager paying jobs and go on welfare in order to keep or obtain vital medicaid coverage we believe that it is unconscionable to impose this type of pain and hardship on the poorest and most disadvantaged segment of the population the cbc budget therefore restores those cuts in medicaid imposed last year and maintains a basic level of medicald coverage for the millions of women children and lowincome famtlies who depend upon the government for basic health care similarly the fauntroy substitute restores cuts imposed last year in medicare and rejects any cuts for fiscal year 1983 more than 90 percent of medicare enrollees are senior citizens who have the greatest health care needs in this nation senior citizens have the highest percentage of heart attacks and the greatest number of strokes they are the individuals who for the most part have the greatest incidence of cancer and suffer the greatest incidence of crippling and debilitating disease moreover in addition to being the most sick the elderly suffer the double disadvantage of being sick and poor one out of six senior citizens is poor one out of every two black elderly is poor or marginally poor the cbc finds untenable any proposals which penalize our senior citizens and ask them to use their already limited resources to pay more for medical care the cbc also rejects as foolish and shortsighted any freeze in spendling on such vital health programs as maternal and child health alcohol drug abuse and mental health rervices health manpower and biomedical research additional spending in these areas now only serves to save money in the long run no where is the cost effectiveness of a strengthened federal investment in health care more evident than in the area of biomedical research the economic losses from illness and diseases which we still are unable to prevent and cure run into the billions of dollars last year i had the pleasure of hearing testimony from 10 nobel laureates who spoke about the fact that our nation is becoming scientifically and technologically illiterate they spoke about the need for more funding for biomedical research in order to maintain a leadership position in advancing new knowledge about medical care in order to continue progress in understanding the causes of disease and illness the cbc budget provides additional fundiqg to maintain a strong federal investment in biomedical research let us remember that the debate about health programs and out the larger federal budget is otri simply a debate about numbers and dollars and cents it is about human beingschildren parents elderly it is about their successes and failures it is about their hopes and dreams the cbc budget is an alernative which will allow all america te to enjoy human dignity and a high qusiity of life i urge my colleagues to support the fauntroy substitute"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "i think it is time to put the social security issue into perspective as a result of the reagan administrations scare tactics the public is confused and worried about the future of a program that has provided income security to americans for nearly half a century during his campaign for the presidency mr reagan promised that he would preserve the social security system as a safety net we now see that this was just so much more campaign rhetoric already mr reagan and his chief budget slasher david stockman have succeeded in eliminating the 122 minimum benefit this will hurt nearly 3 million americans at the bottom of the economic ladder now the administration is attempting to panic the congress into making benefits to most americans who have come to believe in the integrity of the system and to rely on it for security the president has proposed cutting 88 billion in early retirement disability and other benefits by 1986 attempting to frighten the american people into believing that the social security system will go broke unless he has his way this is a blatant example of overkill the measures proposed by the white house to protect the social security system it is clear that the president is interested in protecting something other than social security the tax bill that tie stampeded congress into accepting is guaranteed to produce huge budget deficits so he can keep his campaign promise to balance the budget by 1984 there is no question that the gigantic tax cut for the rich will reduce revenues and will require budget cuts beyond anything so far proposed reducing social security benefits is just another way to achieve these cuts some measures must be taken to insure social securitys immediate future but they need not be nearly as drastic as the white house proposes social security supports three separate programseach financed by a separate trust fund they are financed by a payroll tax on earningscurrently 6 65 percent for employees and 6 65 percent for employers up to a maximum of 29 775 a year first there is the old age and survivors insurance program that pays benefits to retired workers and their dependents and survivors next there is the disability insurance program that pays benefits to disabled workers and their dependents finally there is the health insurance program which is part a of the medicare program which pays for doctors bills is finance4 by monthly premiums paid by those enrolled in the program and from general tax revenues because i have encountered considerable confusion regarding some other programs i would like to set the record straight the supplemental security income program which provides a basic level of income for the aged blind and disabled is run by the social security aministration but is not part of the social security program it is paid for by general revenue tax funds and not from any of the social security trust funds a person does not have to work under social security to be eligible for ssi benefits this used to be called the old age assistance program when it was run by the states until a few years ago funds for the aid to the families with dependent children program afdc also come from general tax funds and are in no way related to social security it has surprised me to discover that many people think the programs are somehow related neither is the civil service retirement system related to social security this retirement system is funded by contributions from federal employees who are not covered by social security and matching funds from the employing agencies the social security program does have some problems that must be solved but solutions do not require the kind of severe remedies that the president has proposed in the past few years we have had historically high rates of inflation accompanied by high unemployment moreover wage rates have fallen behind price increases as a result social security has been paying out more and not collecting as much as had been anticipated it is expected that the economic picture will improve and that the social security outlook will brighten as well for the next 30 or 40 years until longrange problems begin to take hold it is apparent to me that this administration wants to mislead the public on the social security issue to achieve its own ends all through the tax debate mr reagan used the most optimistic economic assumptions to argue his case in his social security proposals he uses the very worst economic assumptions he cant have it both ways depending on which he wants to advance i dont want to mislead the people into thinking that there are no problems with the social security program the longrun problems are very serious they result from the fact that the population is aging at a time when the birthrate is declining social security is a payasyougo program where active workers pay the benefits of retired workers it is predicated on an everexpanding work force and today that work force is not growing what the reagan administration wants to do is solve the problems of the next century in the next few years none of us knows what is going to happen in the 21st century as in our private lives most of the things we worry about so much never happen none of us knows what the economic conditions will be like 30 or 40 years from now perhaps we will develop new energy sources that will expand our productive capacity beyond our wildest imagination we would not recklessly leap into solving predicted longrange problems when to do so will cause injury to millions of people right away the president wants to cut billions in benefits out of the program in the near future by discouraging early retirement 55 percent of full benefits rather than 80 percent allowed now at age 62 restricting eligibility for disability insurance limiting benefits to survivors and by taking other steps beyond what is needed it is not necessary to hurt millions of americans now when there is a good chance that such extreme measures will not be needed at allespecially if mr reagans assumptions for economic recovery should prove right in the meantime using the social security system to achieve shortterm economic ends such as a balanced budget is playing recklessly with the future of millions of americans there are a lot of things we can do we can amend the law to permit one fund to borrow from another we can allow the troubled old age and survivor insurance fund to borrow from the healthy medicare fund we can consider financing a portion of social security from general tax revenue funds there is an opportunity as well for creating standby loan authority from general funds whatever changes we decide to make should be thought through very carefully and should take effect sometime in the future we cannot simply say to americans who have spent all their working lives paying into a system that we are going to change the rules and they are going to have to make other arrangements do you say to a man or a woman 55 years old that they are going to have to start some kind of private fund for their retirement how much time do they have to build that fund many people made assumptions about retirement income based on social security they took out private insurance annuities and set up separate savings accounts or made other investments they figured out how much they would need based on how much they could expect from social security it would be heartless and unrealistic now to tell them they will have to find a way to increase their savings in the working years they have left working beyond 62 is fine for those people who want to and are able but recent studies by the social security administrat ion show that only 15 to 20 percent of those who opt out before 65 do so voluntarily most who retire before age 65 do so because of failing health or because they can no longer handle the job pressure in many cases the 62yearold worker who has labored 40 years in the steel mills or the auto plants is worn out if he works until he is 65 he may well be dead maybe that is what the administration is counting on there is something else to consider social security is a compact between the young and the old it was designed for a changing society where it is no longer possible for younger people to assume the responsibility of caring for their aged relatives because of changes in working and living conditions mr reagan wants us to return to the old world even though it is no longer possible if we fail to meet the income and medical needs of the older citizens we inevitably are going to shift this cost to the young who cannot afford it we would also create major problems in private pension funds that are tied to social security workers would demand higher employer contributions to make up the difference putting added pressure on price developments we simply cannot afford to destroy the confidence of a program that is so much a part of our society because we are worried about what might happen 30 or 40 years from nowor because mr reagan has gotten himself into an embarrassing revenue situation as the result of an illconceived tax bill"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "i would like to say to my friend the gentleman from ohio that his is exactly the point i was trying to make we are damaging our ability to have a strong defense by putting all this emphasis and huge expenditure into nuclear weapons in fact we are denuding not only our colleges and universities of professors in the sciences and engineering we are also at the present time already without this huge buildup creating shortages through our defense program in our industrial base on which we depend to produce weapons and on which we ri pend to try to keep an industrial base that can support a sound defense we are even injuring the military itself because so much of the military budget is going into nuclear weapons and nuclear delivery systems that we have not got adequate funds to be able to strengthen our conventional force to train our personnel so that they can operate the military equipment we were embarrassed not too long ago by having an initiative to try to recaputure our iranian hostages which went bad because we could not keep the helicopters flying i think increasingly we are going to see this with tle sophisticated technology we have ve have to give greater incentives to get qualified people into the military and to keep them in the military i have advocated a program which would give educational benefits very much like we do now at west point and the other military academies in return for people having an obligation of service for a period of time and obviously there is that critical need but we have not got money enough for that now i think from every aspect we are undermining our security by proposing to spend these trillions of dollars in nuclear weaponry there is another aspect of this that i would like to emphasize and then i will put the rest of my remarks in the record and that is the question of proliferation that also endangers our future and the future destruction of humanity i am very disturbed indeed that this administration is dropping the efforts that have been put together by all previous administrations republican and democratic to keep a curb on the weapons gaining capability of other countries who are not already nuclear weapons countries i think we need much greater effort internationally and in our own domain to end a fast growing proliferation which in many ways in more dangerous than the nuclear weapons race between ourselves and the russians i think it is highly unlikely that the russians are going to drop bombs on us knowing that they would be committing suicide in doing so they would be destroyed but if we allow reprocessing and enrichment in breeder technology to go around the world with plutonium and highly enriched uranium therefore very greatly available and not subject to effective controls we run the risk that a quadhafi in libya or an araot in the palestinian liberation organization or the red brigades in italy will gain control of a nuclear weapon and might be able to blackmail the world or anybody else and what is our response if the red brigades get a nuclear weapon you do not blow up italy the only real response is to assure that irre sponsible powers of that sort do not get access to nuclear weapons and nuclear materials from which weapons can readily be made today and yet this administration is not only dropping the previous administrations resistance to the spread of nuclear weapons capabilities the sale of reprocessing and enrichment and highly enriched uranium and breeder reactors abroad but we understand it is even being seriously considered that we would start selling reprocessed and enrichment material and equipment abroad ourselves and that we are even contemplating contaminating our civilian nuclear program by turning over spent fuel to be used for the production of weapons by our military forces i would like to say that if we proceed on that road i think we run just totally unacceptable risks that instead we ought to be calling an urgent international conference of nuclear weapons nations to try to restrict the further proliferation of nuclear weaponsmaking capability and the spread of plutonium and highly enriched uranium from which bombs can be made we ought to set up some kind of an international mechanism to assure countries that using fission reactors they would have an assured supply of lowenriched uranium we ought to put a tremendous effort into technology that the united states has developed to extend the lifetime and the burnup capability of existing fission reactors to do what we can to prohibit the sale to any other countries of the machines or the actual materials from which bombs can be made i think that this debate is exceedingly important again i congratulate its sponsors i am happy to take part in it to lend whatever efforts i can to have us stop saying nuclear policy overall and nuclear weapons policy in particular the reagan administrations stand accelerating the nuclear arms race is the crowning glory of a myriad of senseless destabilizing and dangerous policies it is thus especially gratifying to see so many americans finally rise up against this huge senseless nuclear arms buildup with its socalled tactical nuclear weapons neutron bombs and winnable nuclear wars and resist the administrations policies which are leading us on a course toward unprecedented nuclear calamity president reagan has initiated the most massive buildup of nuclear weapons in unitedstates history and on top of that an equally risky foray into develoying a new generation of chemical warfare weapons yet it has not even defined a coherent military or foreign policy the administration is planning a 6year 222 billion expansion of nuclear forces invulving land sea and airbased missiles space weaponry civil defense systems and more in the next decade reagans policies would add 17 000 new nuclear weapons to the 30 000 already existing in the unitedstates nuclear arsenal the stated purpose of this policy is to achieve the capacity to fight and win a nuclear wara goal as unattainable as it is dangerous the administration defends its buildup by claiming that we are vulnerable to the soviets in response to our repeated calls for priority efforts to control the development testing and deployment of nuclear weapons the administration has used distortions and inaccuracies to portray our present nuclear capability as inferior to the russians there is only one important fact in this equation howeverit is not comparability that matters but sufficiencyand we clearly have sufficient nuclear powerin fact the unitedstates has far more power than needed to destroy russia should it attackand russia knows it that is what mattersnot whethler we outnumber the russians or they us in particular weapons system even using the administrations comparisons however the united states and the soviet union are in rough parity today each possessing advantages and disadvantages in its nuclear weapons capability for example the united states leads the soviets by 9 400 deliverable strategic nuclear warheads to 7 800 according to the center for defense information moreover our warheads are more survivable because of more diverse unitedstates strategic force deployments despite the clear sufficiency and even advantage in strategic nuclear warheads possessed by the united states the administration has argued that the soviets are at an advantage in nuclear megatonnage but as paul warnke former director of the arms control and disarmament agency said in a recent interview which appeared in the new york times the fact that they might have a 2megaton warhead compared to our modest ones of something like 400 000 tons of tnt only makes one difference how big is the hole going to be where the high school used to be h 1260 again though all these comparisons are irrelevant we have more then enough power for our security already despite the incredible redundancy of nuclear weapons the reagan administration wants to continue spending hundreds of billions of dollars to fuel the arms race paralyzing our nations 1 the administrations continued development of more sophisticated nuclear weapons and delivery systems on this massive scale has created the impression that the united states is building a nuclear force to destroy the soviet unions nuclear arsenal in a preemptive attack as the united states and russia approach preemptive capabilities we both become much less secure requiring hairtrigger launch on warning policies enormous amounts of money will be spent and we will be less secure than ever as the military budget is absorbed by destabilizing nuclear weaponry really needed expenditures are denied for conventional forces spare parts improved pay and technical training for our military personnel we deny our soldiers sufficient education and training necessary to understand the tenets of military strategy and even how to operate the sophisticated weapons to which we entrust our national security thus again we will be less secure ever but the nuclear arms race is not the only problem risking nuclear destruction of humanity we need not only a freeze on nuclear weapons development but on the transfer of the materials and equipment for producing nuclear weapons the development of nuclear power on an international scale also carries with it the risk of increasing the number of countries that will have access to the technology and the materials for nuclear weapons specifically nuclear e richment and reprocessing facilities and breeder reactors are direct sources of bombquality materialshighly enriched uranium235 and plutonium if countries decide to use these facilities to develop nuclear weapons the rate of nuclear proliferation could increase and with it the chance of a provoked nuclear war or nuclear blackmail by terrorists against which there is no defense while we can deter russia from nuclear war by making it suicidal there would be no adequate response if a qadhafi or an araffat gains access to a nuclear bomb the only realistic recourse is to prevent terrorists from gaining access to weapons during the past decade the united states has expressed increasing concern over the proliferation risk assocated with nuclear power i one of the great ironies of reagans policies is that they will leave us much weakerweaker because of diversion of funds from our economly weaker because of the established nature of our nuclear investment and weaker because the billion to be spent on nuclear weapons will deprived our conventional military adequacy by 1985 25 nonweapon countries will have operational power reactors each generating enough spent fuel to manufacture a score of bombs annually if the plutonium is separated from the fuel more important some of these countries plan to build reprocessing facilities that will enable them to separate the plutonium from spent fuel once separated the plutonium could be put to weapons use quickly other countries have or are building enrichment plants that could be used to enrich uranium235 to bomb grade levels the reagan administration would greatly exacerbate this problem by condoning even promoting the intro duction and use of these sensitive nuclear technologies and materials on a commercial scale throughout the world once introduced they would be impossible to safeguard effectively providing too easy access to any terrorist group and nuclear weapons ca pability to countries that might use them for blackmail or in local conflicts if they got pressed to the wall the result could be incredible carnage in the late 20th century from the spread of nuclear weapons to other countries and the possibility of a third country provoking a nuclear war between the united states and russia the worlds most volatile regionsthe middle east and south asiaalready include five countries reported either to have the capability to construct nuclear weapons or to be actively seeking that capability in a worst case libya israel iraq pakistan and india could all have nuclear weapons within a few years the actions of these countries will not be independent of each other the nations are connected in a complicated fashion by enmity and cooperationthus the acquisition of nuclear weapons by one of these nations is likely to generate similar actions by others the region has suffered from major wars every few years the introduction of nuclear weapons into these wars could threaten millions of deaths in the region the destruction of the petroleum transportation facilities through which 40 percent of the western worlds oil must pass and the threat of annihilation of much of the worlds population through fallout or the provocation of wider nuclear conflict even the fear that one of these nations was attempting to acquire nuclear weapons could lead to armed conflict the iraqi nuclear program already has been the subject of assassinations and an air attack with conventional munitions of these five countries three of their governments came to power through internal military takeovers nuclear weapons in such internally unstable countries may not remain in the hands of the national governments subnational forces attempting a takeover are likely to try to seize the nuclear weapons sooner or later nuclear weapons or the material for their manufacture may fall into the hands of smaller military units or terrorists groups the middle east and south asia is the most dangerous region for nuclear proliferation in the near future but the capability to manufacture nuclear weapons reportedly has been sought by south africa south korea taiwan argentina and brazil and this is only the situation is the early 1980s the acquisition of nuclear weapons by one country is likely to lead to a chain reaction in which the enemies or rivals of that country then feel that they must acquire nuclear weapons some politicians in nigeria for example have already called for a nigerian weapons program aimed at the possibility that south africa will acquire nuclear weapons the same applies for syria visavis iraq proliferation need not stop with the acquisition of a few bombs of the type used by the united states against japan at the end of world war iiweapons that in the context of a small nuclear war could cause millions of deaths the next stop can be thermonuclear weaponsraising the death toll to tens of million of people or more or the next step may be long range delivery vehicles spreading the threat of nuclear destruction to nations far removed from the regional conflict in short proliferation is a major international security threat and it will certainly get worse if we do not take the lead with the other nuclear weapons powers to stop it for these reasons american policy has long featured a strong consensus opposed to the proliferation of nuclear weapons the reagan administration however is striving to undermine the good bipartisan unitedstates example set by previous presidents not only is mr reagan indifferent to the proliferation risks posed by civilian nuclear technology he has graphically illustrated that indifference by considering the use to make nuclear weapons of plutonium derived from spent fuel produced in civilian nuclear powerplants even worse he is considering for the first time in our history the export of sensitive reprocessing and enrichment technologies to nonnuclear weapons countries such exports would have tragic consequences and must not be permitted i intend soon to propose legislation to block mr reagans thoughtless move the united states simply must exercise its strongest leadership with its allies to prevent nuclear profits from overcoming the restraint necessary for nuclearage survival thankfully there are americans who are seeking to correct these irrational policies and to change our course away from nuclear devastation they recognize that nuclear war is not winable as this administration has claimed and they realize the danger in spending hundreds of billions of h 1262 co dollars on a massive nuclear weapons buildup without incorporating arms control and proliferation prevention into our national security policies i commend those who are resisting these senseless administration initiatives and i pledge my efforts to do all i can to see that congress does everything in its power to reverse those policies which come to us from the white house our efforts to stop this nuclear madness are essential if we are to live in a secure stable and peaceful world i am including in todays record the text of house joint resolution 404 followed by the text of the call to halt the nuclear arms race i commend both of these important resolutions to the attention of my colleagues"], [7.151080616552008e-09, 7.151080616552008e-09, 0, "today i am introducing a revised version of the regulatory control act of 1981 which i first introduced as h r 3740 on june 1 1981 this legislation was offered then and is reoffered now as a good faith effort to find some middle ground between the popular levitas legislative veto bill for federal regulations and the administrations opposi lion to such legislation on constitu tional grounds as my colleagues are aware the levitas bill h r 1776 would permit one or both houses to disapprove pro posed or existing federal regulations the administration has testified that it would accept nothing less than a joint resolution of disapproval requiring presidential signature foic execu live agency regulations but could accept a concurrent resolution of disapproval for regulations of selected independent regulatory agencies the house judiciary subcommittee on the other hand has reported a regulatory reform bill which includes a provision for disapproval of all major regulations by joint resolution only h r 3740 as originally introduced provides for disapproval of independent agency regulations by concurrent resolution and the same disapproval approach would apply to those executive agency regulations which a committee finds to be contrary to law or congressional intent executive agency regulations which a committee finds objectionable for other reasons would be subject to enactment of a joint resolution of disapproval as would any existing regulalion which either house forces an agency to reconsider and repromulgate h r 3740 would also permit executive agencies to appeal a disapproval action taken by concurrent resolution to the courts and permit the court to allow the rule to take effect anyway on a finding that it is consistent with the statute and that the agency has no alternative means of implementing or enforcing the statute these central features of h r 3740 are retained in the revised bill which i am introducing today however i have made several procedural changes in the original bill first i have elirninated section 2 of h r 3740 w~hich would have made certain changes in section 553 of the administrative procedure act second i have extended coverage of the legislative veto provisions to nearly all regulations of general applicability as opposed to just major and significant regulations as defined in h r 3740 third i have extended the initial congressional review period for regulations from 30 days to 60 days if either house adopts a disapproval resolution within that period the review period would be extended to 90 days from the date of submission of the regulation a rule could take effect sooner if either house rejects a resolution of disapproval or if a committee fails to undertake a review of a rule within 30 days after its submission fourth and perhaps most important i have added what i call a frontend discharge procedure for disapproval resolutions in the first house to act under myoriginal bill no special discharge procedure was provided if a committee did not report a disapprovai resolution within a specified period as the levitas bill would provide however a discharge motion would be in order in the second house to act if a committee has not reported the resolution within 15 days after its referral from the first house and if that motion is supported by onefifth of the membership of the house involved under my new discharge proposal if onefifth of the members of the house involved sponsor or cosponsor an appropriate disapproval resolution h 7746 within 25 days after submission of the regulation a committee would be required to announce and undertake a review of the rule and report a disapproval resolution with its recomendations not later than 45 days after submission of the rule if it does not report within 45 days the committee would automatically be discharged of the first such resolution referred to it this special discharge procedure however would not apply to concurrent resolutions for exeutive agency regulations since such resolutions must be accompanied by a committee finding that the rule is contrary to law or congressional intent in the second house to act discharge would be automatic 15 days after referral of the resolution if a committee has not reported it seems to me this discharge mechanism is best designed to both permit a committee time to review and report on a regulation about which there is substantial interst while at the same time insuring that a disapproval resolution cannot be bottled up in a committee when there is substantial objection te it but the important thing it seems to me is that the house involved have the benefit of a committee report on any regulation proposed to be disapproved so that we can act in an informed manner a committee could also obviously undertake a review of a rule on its own initiative but if it formally announces such a review to the speaker and in days after submission of the rule it would again be required to report a resolution of disapproval and it would be automatically discharged of such a resolution if it did not report within 45 days after submission of the rule finally i have eliminated the provision of h r 3740 which would have tied agency review of major existing rules every 10 years with the ability of either house to adopt a resolution for reconsideration of any other existing ruleboth of which would have forced an agency to repromulgate the existing rule and thus subject it to possible disapproval by joint resolution under my revised bill the joint resolution disapproval mechanism would only apply to those existing rules which congress forces an agency to repromulgate any existing rule which an agency decides to modify or repeal on its own initiative would be treated as a new rule under the disapproval mechanisms which apply to new rules mr speaker i think this revised bill does meet the administration halfway while doing the same with respect to the levitas bill i expect this issue will come to the house in the form of an amendment to whatever regulatory reform hill is finally reported from the house judiciary committee it is important that this be viewed as one component in an overall regulatory reform strategy and not as a panacea for our regulatory problems but i do think it is important that congress reclaim its prerogatives over the legislative powers we have delegated to agencies through the rulemaking proccss as elected representatives of the people we should be held ultimately accountable for the laws we pass including the regulations issued to carry them out at this point in the record i include a brief summary of my revised regulatory control act h r 4838bnixi summary of revised regulatory control acr by hox trent lott 1 coverage the congressional review

issues that remain at the top of our congressional agenda namely the budget and the economy as the first step in the congressional budget process the president submitted to the congress his budget recommendations i was happy to see that the president decided to reaffirm his economic recovery program and did not change it to increase taxes as some advisers were urging him to do i still firmly support many of the components of the presidents package however several of us find the budget deficit projections that are in excess of 90 billion to be completely unacceptable many here in this house firmly believe that the congress must do a better job in reducing what soon could amount to a tripledigit deficit as a member who has already offered 11 amendments to the budget process that were designed to balance the budget i will continue my diligence to reduce these unacceptable deficit figures during this session of the 97th congress after all government spending is as controllable as congress so chooses the founding fathers would turn over in their graves if they knew of the over 1 trillion debt the congress has allowed our nation to accumulate thomas jefferson wrote the public debt is the greatest of dangers to be feared by a republican government and it was president andrew jackson that observed we should look at the national debt as just as it is not as a national blessing but as a heavy burden on the industry of the country to be discharged without unnecessary delay as discussion focuses during the next couple of weeks on the size of the national debt the deficit and the budget i believe there is one point that must not be overlooked that is quite simply that even with the reagan budget and tax reductions that were enacted last year the unitedstates government will still spend more and tax more in fiscal year 1982 than any other year in history even though we are slowing the increases in expenditures the budget continues to run out of control in fact payment of interest on the national debt for fiscal year february 10 1 982 1983 will be 99 billion more will be spent paying interest on this debt than the unitedstates government spent or collected in taxes in fiscal year 1961 it is incredible to think that while it took nearly 200 years for the national debt to reach roughly 400 billion that during the past 10 years alone the government has allowed the debt to increase an additional 600 billion with deficit estimates of 98 6 billion for fiscal year 1982 and 91 5 billion for fiscal year 1983 there is much work to be done members of congress must take note americans wiu not stand for such a deficit it is ironic that it took us 50 years to discard the higher spending higher taxing policies of the past administration while some members are ready to pass instant judgment on the entire program for economic recovery after only a few months trial such criticism comes even before many key elements of the presidents program have taken effect for instance the citizens of our nation have realized only a 5percent tax reiaction of a total 25percent tax reduction which has yet to become ef fective these tax reductions were drafted in recognition of the fact that unitedstates citizens rather that the federal government know how best to spend their hardearned money recent public opinion polls show that the american people are willing to give the administration more time in order for the positive effects of the economic program to be able to take effect they realize that the president came into office inheriting a huge economic mess for instance in december 1980 the prime rate was at an alltime record high of 21 5 percent compared with 16 5 percent today in december 1980 the 90day tbill rate was 15 7 percent today at 14 percent it is slowly coming down from april 1980 to april 1981 the money supply as measured by m 8 increased at a rate of over 10 percent this is the highest growth for any 12month period since world war ii during the previous administration from 1977 to 1981 federal spending increased 61 percent the president came into office after the first backtoback years of doubledigit inflation since world war i 12 4 percent in 1979 and 13 3 percent in 1980 as my colleagues know a great turn around has been made on the inflation front as the consumer price index snapped the doubledigit levels and came down to 8 9 percent during president reagans first year of office these facts show quite clearly that the reagan administration inherited the economic mess from the previous administration unfortunately we are still suffering from an economic hangover as a result of the liberal economic policies that prevailed during the previous years the economic slowdown was an inevitable consequence of the past policies of high taxes higher spending and fast money growth the economic trend was well in place far before the reagan administration arrived in washington it was this worst economic mess in half a century that significantly contributed to the large deficit projections we have today consequently this administration was faced with a hard choice it could have easily continued the old policies of tax and spend or it could choose to enact a new program designed to snap the inflationary cycle and to lay the foundation for a strong economy for many years to come i am not alone in stating here today that the presidents program for economic recovery has established a muchneeded foundation for economic growth it is a comprehensive fourpart plan to restrain the rate of growth in federal spending to reduce personal tax rates and business taxes to reduce the burden of federal regulation and to adopt a stable monetary policy unemployment interest rates and inflation are still at unacceptable high levels however once the reagan program takes full affect these figures too will come down and should stay down we can be certain of one thing there are no economic miracles or quick fixes or instant solutions we have already enacted a program based on sound economic theory not on political expediency it is important that we hold firm and steady to that course to turn back now to the businessasusual policies of the past would be to forsake many of the economic gains we have already made of course the task that we have before us as members of congress will not be easy however the only other alternative would be simply to return to those feeble and shortsighted economic policies of the past which got us in this mess in the first place"],

bill before the house which offers the american people any hope of escape from the burdens of excessive taxation and economic stagnation in the future the american people are expecting a meaningful tax bill to be passed today they gave the congress and the president a mandate last november to enact such a bill that mandate should and can be fulfilled with passage of the conablehance bipartisan tax bill it should be obvious to any observer that the same policies of the last 20 years which have brought us ever higher inflation ever higher interest rates ever higher deficits ever higher unemployment and ever higher taxes are a failure the ways and means bill represents a mere continuation of those same policies therefore it is guaranteed to have the same results the american people understand how our economy operates and what causes inflation and high interest rates that is why they voted in november for a change that is why millions are today calling and writing their representatives urging support of the conablehance bill the choices presented between the bipartisan substitute and the ways and means bills are clear either we adopt the substitute and give the american people a true tax cut or we can adopt the ways and means bill and give the impression of a tax cut i think the american people are smart enough to know when their taxes are reduced and when they are not it must be said that the ways and means committee has come a long way in recent months in an almost desparate effort to give the leadership of the house a victory the committee has adopted many provisions contained in the presidents package however some of the most important provisions have been left out we should not be fooled by the gimmicks contained in the committees bill which seem to promise a third year cut because there simply is no chance that the triggers in the bill will ever be met we need the tax provisions contained in the conablehance version to improve the economy sufficiently to meet the presidents economic goals which would trigger the third year tax cut contained in the ways and means bill we cannot expect the presidents goals to be met unless we adopt his policies it would be almost impossible to discuss all of the provisions in each of the two bills i would however like to talk briefly about what i consider one of the most vital aspects of the tax debate in a word i want to discuss incentives incentives to save to work to improve ones income and to participate in the economic wellbeing of the nation the bipartisan substitute gives american taxpayers the incentive to increase savings and investments by cutting the marginal tax rates it gives workers incentives to work harder by lowering tax rates so that it becomes worthwhile to work overtime or to seek a pay raise the incentives contained in the bill extend to businesses as well businesses are encouraged to modernize through an improved capital cost recovery system corporate tax rates are also revised so that our business can make reasonable profits while improving productivity with passage of the presidents tax proposals we will have set the stage for total economic recovery later this week we may pass the conference report to the reconciliation bill which will cut federal spending around 35 billion that along with the provisons of the presidents tax bill will provide the requisite economic forces to bring our economy back to life it would be a cruel hoax to the american people to continue the politics and policies of the past when the president has proposed a plan for the future the presidents tax policy coupled with his budget cuts are designed to create an economic climate in which americans will be given incentives to work harder save and invest more and improve productivity the american people are demanding a change from the government and fiscal policies which led to todays stagnant economy only the presidents economic recovery

said dr rivlin is too liberal and ought to be replaced they said one year later we know that the cbo was right because their projections yere based on some familiarity with economics and they refused

of community offered to publish at its own expense situations wanted ads for detroits unemployed the response was six pages of free ads while the help wanted ads were listed on a single page our president tells us there are plenty of jobs offered in the newspapers for those who want to work it is time that this administration spent less time with the blue blooded and more time with the blue collar less time with black tie and more with black unemployment less time talking with people in reception lines and more time talking with people in unemployment lines there is a certain vindication for those of us who stood on this floor last year and denounced the midnight budget with its disneylike assumptions who predicted severe dislocations and resulting unemployment which would in turn create unprecedented need for assistance which would in turn drive deflbits upward which would in turn keep interest rates high which would in turn prevent economic recovery but that vindication is

members who have worked on this bill i think we have dealt with this bill in a responsible manner we have given our seabed mining companies what they need an interim legal framework under which they can proceed with their preparations for mining the seabed at the came time we have produced a bill that is supportive of our governments efforts to achieve a comprehensive law of the sea treaty and we have handled the timing of the legislation so as to minimize any adverse impact on the law of the sea conference in a true spirit of compromise the committee of lurisdiction have reeonciled all the differences among the varous versions of the bill which is what enables us to bring this bill before the house under suspension of the rules i think this is a remarkable achievement for which the members are to be congratulated i particularly commend the chairman of the merchant marine committee and his staff for their hard work and their constructive and cooperative attitude on this bill without their efforts we could not have produced this result this soon since it is at my suggestion that the floor manager is bringing this bill up under suspension of the rules i would like to comment on my reasons for suggesting that procedure at first glance this bill might seem too important and complex for that procedure however a similar bill passed the house in the last congress by a vote of 312 to 80 the changes that were made in the bill in this congress were carefully considered and agreed to by four different committees obviously no member is entirely satisfled with the bill but i am aware of no opposition on any of the four committees to passage of the bill in its current form in fact there is agreement among all the committees the administration and the mining industry that the earliest possible passage of the bill is imperative in view of the fact that the bill is both urgent and noncontroversial and in view of the crowded floor calendar i think the suspension procedure is appropriate the committee on foreign affairs has been involved with seabed mining legislation since it was first reported out of the merchant marine and interior committees in 1977 since that time the objective of the foreign affairs committee has remained the same to fashion a bill that would support and contribute to the achievement of this nations overriding interest in successfully concluding a law of the sea treaty while at the same time protecting the interests of our seabed mining industry this objective has required our attention to both the timing and the substance of the bill and in dealing with both timing and substance we have had to recognize the opinion of most countries of the worldeven though we may not agree with that opinionthat the united states does not have the right under international law to mine the seabed outside the context of a treaty premature enactment of legislation or enactment of legislation without certain necessary provisions could have scuttled the tre ty i join in bringing this bill to the floor at this time wit h the sincere intent and belief that it poses no threat to the negotiations or to those countries that do not have seabed mining capabilities several provisions of the bill are important in that regard first under the bill commercial mining of seabed nodules is prohibited before january 1 1988 this provision is intended to provide a reasonable period of time to bring a treaty into force before seabed mining begins second this is explicitly interim legislation on its own terms it will be superseded by a law of the sea treaty so that unitedstates seabed mining operations will be conducted under the terms of the treaty third while the bill states the intent of congress that the rights of us mining companies be protected in any treaty there is no statement as there was in earlier versions of the bill that the terms of the treaty should necessarily conform to the terms of the legislation finally should a treaty not be in force by january 1 1988 the bill provides that some of the proceeds of any seabed mining that may commence after that date must be deposited in a revenuesharing fund for future sharing with the international community under the terms of a treaty i want to say a few words about the socalled grandfather language in title 2 of the bill section 201 states that a law of the sea treaty should provide unitedstates mining companies assured and nondiscriminatory access under reasonable terms and conditions and security of tenure and that the attainment of these goals should be determined by the totality of the provisions of the treaty rather than by any one article or provision this section recognizes that a treaty negotiated by 150 countries with widely divergent interests cannot be expected to provide terms and conditions as favorable as unitedstates legislation drawn specifically to promote the development of our seabed mining industry the administration has testified many times and this section recognizes that a treaty will provide for additional financial obligations and other new requirements not contained in this legislation such as the transfer of technology on fair and reasonable terms and conditions it is our intent that section 201 does not exclude such treaty provisions section 201 simply states the realistic expectation that these and any other treaty provisions taken together must not impose significant new economic burdens that have the effect of preventing the continuation of mining operations on a viable economic basis i have said that no member is totally satisfied with this bill i would be remiss if i did not mention that i am deeply concerned about the implications of the unitedstates flag requirements in the bill the mining consortia are multinational in character and i do not understand how only one of the countries particiiating in a consortium can expect to reserve for itself the lions share of the shipping business associated with seabed mining foreign governments have expressed their opposition to these provisions in very strong terms in recognition that i would not have the votes i did not press for a procedure which would have permitted me to offer an amendment to delete or soften these provisions although i would have preferred to do so i can only express my hope that these provisions do not lead to the breakup of the consortia on the other hand i am gratified we were able to include sufficiently flexible provisions in the compromise bill with regard to the location of processing plants the successful conclusion of a law of the sea treaty is important to the national security of the united states when the united states entered these negotiations several years ago our principal objective was to secure provisions that would preserve the freedom of maritime movement necessary for unitedstates air and naval mobility and the projection of our national power as events in iran and afghanistan demonstrate this objective has never been mire important it is achieved in the current treaty text it is my sincere hope that our delegation to the law of the sea conference will be able to achieve a treaty that meets our interests in other areas as well that the senate will ratify such a treaty and that our mining industry will support such ratification ambassador richardson has written an article for foreign affairs examining the national security implications of a law of the sea treaty which i include at the end of my remarks in short i believe the bill before us meets the foreign policy and national security interests of this country as well as the interests of the seabed mining industry and i urge the members to vote for the motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill from foreign affairs spring 19801"], [0.9999974234378897, 2.5765621103346348e-06, 1, "it is my sad duty to inform the house officially of the

a blatant inequity in the federal bankruptcy code which has unfairly penalized unitedstates fishermen this legislation would simply provide fishermen with a degree of protection in bankruptcy cases filed by fish processirg firms and would close a loophole in the law which has allowed a few unscrupulous firms to bilk fishermen of millions of dollars of course it must be emphasized that in alaska as elsewhere the vast majority of processing firms are ethical and follow good business practices such firms realize that the longrun survival of both fishermen and processors depends to a large degree on both parties being treated fairly this is particularly true during difficult economic times and fluctuating markets passage of this legislation will not hinder those businesses acting in good faith it is designed merely to close a loophole in the law and provide fishermen with some protection against firms which would seek shortterm gain at their expense by taking advantage of their status as unsecured creditors under current law fishermen are treated as ordinary creditors of fish processors and are not entitled to protections given secured creditors or employees of the bankrupt firms although secured creditors and employees are not guaranteed repayment under the bankruptcy law they are entitled to priority in payment of debts to be discharged in bankruptcy proceedings priority is given to these parties in recognition of their special relationship to the debtor and their justified reliance debts will be repaid this legislation would amend title 11 of the bankruptcy code to provide that priority shall be given to unsecured claims of fishermen the change in the law would bring it into compliance with many state laws which treat fishermen as labor for purposes of filing materlalman liens also the code amendment would help emphasize to new and reorganizing firms that commitments made to fishermen are just as important as those made to other creditors the change in federal law is necessary because a few firms have taken advantage of federal law by inducing fishermen to rely on payments being honored and then obtaining protection from the bankruptcy code to discharge those debts which were lawfully owed secured creditors assured priority under the code are protected at least to the extent of being entitled to priority as the assets of the bankrupt firm are liquidated however fishermen with no priority are often left without any payment on the dollar and without any recourse or legal method of receiving payment in my state of alaska there have been instances in which fishermen have been left unpaid for a years work when a processor went bankrupt one bankruptcy last year left over 200 fishermen with unpaid debts totaling nearly 2 million another bankruptcy in 1970 left 300 fishermen with unpaid debts totaling 2 5 million there is little chance that these fisherman will ever receive any payments on the debts owed this legislation is designed to prevent a recurrent theme of some of the bankruptcies in the industry there have been cases in which some processors have taken advantage of the unsecured position of fishermen typically fishermen have been induced to rely on payments when proper initial payments have been made early in the fishing season later revenues from product sales or loans are diverted to disportionately pay loans and debts to secured creditors since these creditors are more important to the operator especially if the firm plans to seek additional financing while these revenues are being diverted to other creditors the fishermen are typically told not to worry that the firm is experiencing only temporary cash flow problems by the end of the season secured creditors will have received the largest portion of sales revenues while fishermen will have the highest levels of unpaid debt if a bankruptcy petition is filed the secured creditors have priority and some assurance of payment while fishermen without priority may never be paid i believe that fishermen should be entitled to more equitable treatment under the law because of the nature of the fishing industry fishermen have traditionally relied on informal business dealings in selling fish for processing most fishermen rely on payments from processors as the sole source of income and may sell their entire yearly catch to one processor trust and reliance on payment are essential elements of this industry both to fishermen and to processors i urge my colleagues to give this legislation prompt consideration e"], [0.9999877214431763,

together and which merely clarifies the role of the armed services committee and states that certain reports may be waived under certain circumstances i rise in support of the mccurdy amendment on selected acquisition reports with the understanding that mr mccurdy will accept my amendment concerning the waiver provision for sars the mccurdy amendment as amended by my amendment will have the effect of increasing congressional awareness of weapons costs while insuring that the department of defense is not forced to prepare the 100 or more sars that would be required by the increase in the sar dollar thresholds together the emery and mccurdy amendments will provide the congress with a more incisive look at the cost growth in major weapons programs a discussion of the problem that brought my colleague and i to these amendments would be in order in the fiscal year 1982 defense authorization bill senator nunn added a requirement for very strict cost reporting on weapons systems which are suffering from unacceptable cost increases and schedule slippages the mccurdy amendment incorporates the provisions of the nunn amendment and prbvides for exception reporting when there is a cost overrun of more than 15 percent the amendment also provides for 1 yearly sar of a comprehensive nature to be complemented by quarterly sars when problems develop in weapons systems finally the amendment eliminates the discretion of the secretary of defense in determining which programs will undergo the sar process the original emery amendment shared several provisions with the mccurdy amendment including the increase of the reporting thresholds to 200 million in r d and 1 billion in procurement funding in addition my amendment would permit the secretary of defense to ask the house and senate armed services committees to exempt certain programs like military trucks and transport vehicles from the sar requirement we must acknowledge that the sars are very comprehensive and exhaustive report and it is not the intention of congress to have reports prepared merely for their own sake there must be some flexibility in this area and this is the reason from my amendment to the mccurdy amendment to show the members the kind of loopholes that now exist in the sar process you may be disturbed to know that such major programs as the mx missile the trident ii missile the ddg51

honorary citizen of the united states and requesting the president to ascertain from the soviet union the whereabouts of raoul wallenberg and to secure his return to freedom raoul wallenbergs extraordinary record of saving the lives of countless thousands of jews during the holocaust at great personal risk and sacrifice amply justifies this nation conferringupon him its highest honor by proclaiming him an honorary citizen of the united states mr wallenberg undertook his perilous mission at the behest of the united states and the american war ref ugee board the passage of house joint resolution 220 will represent a ringing affirmation of americas commitment to the survival of the jewish people and our tremendous esteem for someone who risked his own life to try to save so many jewish lives from nazi extermination a number of bills have been introduced over the years to confer honorary citizenship on various persons but the only successful effort to date related to sir winston churchill the conferral of honorary citizenship on raoul wallenberg however will not establish a precedent for similar action on behalf of a number of other heroic figures the fact that our action today will not serve as such a precedent is clear for a number of reasons raoul wallenbergs valiant efforts to save thousands of jews from the holocaust provide an appropriate basis for distinguishing this bill from bills introduced on behalf of others conferral of honorary citizenship on wallenberg unlike any other honorary citizenship bill congress has considered heretofore will symbolize our commitment as a nation to remember the holocaust and vigilantly guard against the possibility of any recurrence congressman lan~os who introduced this joint resolution testified before the subcommittee on immigration refugees and international law thatwe need to establish a clear record for posterity that america through wallenberg did act to prevent the holocaust in its final days during the subcommittee hearings i requested congressman lirrros to develop this idea further and place mr wallenbergs actions in the context of other actions or even inaction by the united states to prevent the holocaust congressman lairros answer i believe should be brought to the attention of the house and for that reason i will quote from it at some length it is important to underscore that wallenberg was not a diplomat wallenberg was a young man living in the comfort and safety and affluence of neutral stockholm during the brutal closing days of world war 11 he left behind a most promising career as the son of swedens most prominent family the safety the security the comfort of stockholm to voluntarily assume the task of saving human lives so raoul wallenberg did not think of this mission himself this was not an activity that stemmed from his own plans it was a mission that he tundertook at the specific request of the secretary of state of the united states the united states thtrefoe bears a very heavy responsibility for the untold numbers of years that this young swede spent under the nightmarish conditions of the gulag archipelago whether he died earlier or whether he is alive today it is we the united states who are responsible for his tragedy and for his lost life a great deal of criticism has emerged over the course of years concerning the failure of the western powers to act in decisive ways to stop the slaughter questions such as why werent the railroads bombed why wasnt there an attempt to liberate the camps earlier here is a tangible demonstration that the united states officially acted and successfully acted to save approximately 100 000 people our record for world war ii is a better record because of the actions of raoul wallenberg undertaken at our own behest honorary citizenship is singularly appropriate in the wallenberg case not only because of the place the holocaust occupies in the history of human depravity and our national commitment to the survival of the jewish people the fact that wallenberg acted at the behest of the united states and suffered untold misery as a result of it establishes our interest as a nation in giving this special recognition to him the soviet union in addition never satisfactorily has accounted for what happened to mr wallenberg the conferral of honorary citizenship on him may give the united states added leverage with the soviet union in determining whether he is still alive and possibly in securing his release honorary citizenship is exactly what its designation impliesnamely an honor that does not confer on either mr wallenberg or any members of his family any rights or privileges under the immigration and nationality act the concept of honorary citizenship must be distingished clearly from citizenship itself no member of mr wallenbergs family as a result of our action today can possibly claim any derivative rights under our laws even mr wallenberg himself will not be recognized as an american citizen under united states domestic law or under international law if he is found to be still alive conferral of honorary citizenship in no way can be described as giving away anything tangible the meaning and significance of our action today is entirely symbolicbut it is a critically important symbolic gesture in an age when many nations treat human life so cavalierly a few of the statements in the legislative record underscore the critical significance of the step we are about to take today secretary of state alexander m haig jr said that mr wallenbergs contribution during the dark days or world war ii in hungary stands out as a beacon to all those who respect human rights and dignity he expressed his full support for this legislation assistant secretary of state richard fairbanks informed the judiciary committee thatthe conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would serve to underscore the seriousness with which the american government and people view sovietbehavior in the wallenberg case conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would also serve to reaffirm to the government of sweden that the united states firmly supports the quest to resolve wallenbergs fate former secretary of state edmund muskie informed two subcommittees of the house committee on foreign affairs that the chronological record of state department and war refugee cables and conmnunications 0 documents the unitedstates governments position of responsibility for the selection of wallenberg the directive and funding for his activities the appreciation for his work and the deep distress over his disappearance mr muskie concluded that its isthe uniqueness the extraordinary link between a man raoul wallenberg and our nations conscience that makes this action appropriate mr muskie went on to say raoul wallenbergs mission on behalf of the united states behind nazi lines in world war ii was without precedent what hie accomplished on our behalf risking his own life to save the lives of tens of thousands of people is unparalleled in our history the cost to him the years of his life can never be repaid the action of bestowing honorary citizenship on wallenberg undertaken by the congress of the united states will recognize his humanitarian sacrifice under our direction this is an important part of american history this adoption of raoul wallenberg as our own citizen makes clear to our posterity that the american government did act to save lives threatened by the holocaust i can add nothing further to the eloquent statements submitted by numerous witnesses before subcommittees of both the committee on foreign affairs and the committee on the judiciarywvitnesses who

genuine concern but i think that in fairness to the taxpayers the american people the department of defense and this administration perhaps we ought to put things in perspective because i think things are garbled and out of perspective and i do not know that we are considering them in their proper context some time back we were looking at a number of basing modes for the mx well first off do we need an mx what is the purpose of it well if i might go back a waysand i am sure this is rudimentary and wellknown to all within the hearing of my voice but let me go over it a bit we have the minuteman iii icbm in silos that are there as a deterrent so that no powerin this case the soviet unionwould feel emboldened and adventuresome and would ever try to take advantage of the united states by their nuclear capability well we came out some time back with the realization that we had a window of vulnerability that we were facing well now what does that mean window of vulnerability well we know from monitoring soviet missile shots over a long period of time that they have been increasing their accuracy without changing their yield because they already had the yield built in and we know that over a number of years they have been increasing their accuracy and increasing their technology all the time that salt i was in place and they were not prohibited from doing this salt i precludes deploying more missiles but it does not preclude increased accuracy and efficiency of missile systems so for a number of years while we have had salt in place the soviets had a bigger bank because they did not have the accuracy of united states missiles and in order to have an insured kill of the target they had a bigger explosion so that has been the basic philo sophical difference between the soviets and the united states going way back to the beginning so when salt i came about and was signed and put in place it limited the number of missiles that each side could deploy but it did not say anything about iriproving the missile system so wc had a smaller warhead because we depended on our technology and accuracy the soviets did not have this they went for a bigger bang a bigger throw weight and a bigger explosion at impact but all during the salt prohibitions on putting out new weapons they were improving their accuracy it is no secret now i am sure but one of the main things that we lost when we lost iran as a friend were two very important monitoring stations on the soviet border where we could monitor missile tests that the soviets were performing on a systematic basis we could see how much more accuracy they were building into their systems and we could project ahead and say look they are making this advance and we can project ahead to say that if they continue to improve their missiles by the year 1982 1983 at the latest 1985 all of our minuteman iii silos will be in jeopardy because they would have the accuracy to take them out whether they were hardened or nonhardened silos we know now that 1982 is the year according to our intelligence estimates and our minuteman silos are within the socalled window of vulnerability so this administration and the previous administration recognized that from this period of 1982 in a first strike the soviets could take out 90 percent of our icbms this leaves us so to speak rather naked so we have been of the opinion since this was recognized as a factand i think the entire intelligence community agrees to thisthat we have to do something well what do you do well in order to make us less vulnerable the department of defense has tried to come up with a different mode to base the icbms this has caused a great deal of consternation and it has not been resolved yet we came out with the theory of the racetrack where the missiles be shuttled among a series of sheltersbecause we are limited to the number of missiles we can employ but we are not limited in the number of holes in the ground so we have the mps the multiple protected shelters in which you could put these missiles so we had a field of missiles and then we had a racetrack so that one vehicle could go around the track and periodically move the missile from here to there to generate a level of uncertainty as to the missiles location this became a political brouhaha so to speak residents of the states where they were supposed to be based said thank you very much but we do not believe we would like them based in our state a number of political factors came into being and we examined additional methods including the continuous patrol aircraft we were going to have aircrafts flying all the time 50 percent of them would be in the air at all times carrying a missile nobody would know where they were they could not be targeted and there was the deep underground basing mode which is still viable then there is a dense packwhich is to be distinguished from the sixpackwhere enough missiles are placed in a confined area so if one nuclear explosion should go off there it would put up enough debris and so forth into the atmosphere so that any other fol lowing incoming missiles would selfdestruct they would hit rocks and debris and so forth and they would either be destroyed or would be inaccurate we do not know what is the best basing mode for this reason the national security council and our department of defense our research and development part of the department of defense has not come up with a single recommendation as this is the best for this reason the president of the united states has communicated to the congress and he has written me a letter a copy of which i have here in effect saying that if you give them a little more time they will come up with a recommendation based on the best scientific brains that we have in this country the best recommendation as to what would be the basing mode the president wrote me as he did other members of the committee dated july 15 of this year it says dear bill and i am skipping part i believe that we must make a solid commitment this year to deploy the mx missile we simply cannot allow the landbased leg of the triad to remain vulnerable we must show our allies that we can make the hard decisions necessary to modernize our strategic nuclear capability decisions that promise to have great influence on the pace of ongoing theater nuclear force modernization initiatives within nato and while it is my intention that the mx not be a bargaining chip in the start negotiations the president says we need to secure the powerful leverage that a commitment to produce the mx would provide as we begin effective arms reduction talks with the soviets and he goes on and it is signed ronald reagan the point is that we must make a decision the president who is the commander in chief has said that he will make this decision as a matter of fact the national security council is to make its recommendation to the president by november 1 of this year the president has assured us that he will make his decision and recommendation to the congress by december 1 of this year we have already approved money in this budget for the production of the mx missile what we are talking about now is research and development even leading up to the production we have already approved this last week what the simongreen amendment would do is take out the research and development money for basing even though we have already approved the production of it this hardly makes sense what we are asking from the committee and what the administration is asking

note my admiration for the strong leadership of the gentleman from florida the chairman of the science and technology committee i would also like to commend the gentleman from kansas the ranking minority member of the committee for his support of our efforts i also am particularly indebted not only to my democratic colleagues on the subcommittee but also to the gentleman from new york for his tireless work in effecting a responsible and workable authorization bill for noaa in a truly bipartisan way we could not have had a more diligent and cooperative colleague as ranking minority member of the subcommittee the atmospheric climatic and ocean pollution act authorizes 498 543 000 for the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa to conduct essential research and service activities in a wide variety of areas including weather forecasting climatic services tornado and hurricane warnings aviation weather ocean dumping research and atmospheric research included in this authorization figure are 2 2 million for reauthorization of the national climate program act and 5 1 million for noaa to operate a land remote sensing system from space landsat this is a bill which is responsive to our recognition of this nations budgetary problemsthe authorization figure in the bill is 4 000 below the administrations request h r 2803 marks the beginning of a new relationship between congress and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa was established by executive reorganization in 1970 with the mission of providing services and research in the sea and in the air over the past 11 years numerous environmental statutes have given naa additional duties so that the agency is now responsible for weather forecasting acid rain research fisheries conservation the national sea grant program the national ocean pollution office the national climate office conservation of muxine mammals and sensitive marine habitats and many more programs which the congress and the american people have regarded as legitimate and important government services throughout these 11 years the congress has voted on numerous occasions to authorize noaa to carry out a proscribed environmental responsibility however we in the congress have never reviewed and evaluated the missions and programs of this important agency as a whole with the view of understanding how its components ought to relate to each other and to the needs of the people we on the committee on science and technology for instance feel strongly that the primary mission of noaas weather arm ought to be protection of the public health and safety through timely and accurate weather forecasts and warnings however in the heat of the appropriations process it is easy for members for those evaluating these services and for the weather service itself to lose sight of the absolute primacy of the publics health and safety in setting priorities for the weather service i am confident that consideration of a comprehensive authorization bill for noaa will provide members with a good opportunity to review and if necessary reorder the agencys priorities and that this process will help noaa to keep its programs in tune with the needs of the public h r 2803 is the first step in a process which i hope will culminate in an authorization bill for the entire agency the bill authorizes funding for approximately 500 million of the agencys 800 million budget including all of its weather climatic and oceanpollution activities the noaa activities not included in this billfisheries sea grant ocean thermal energy and hard minerals development are under the jurisdiction of the committee on merchant marine and fisheries and we on the committee on science anbd technology are confident that in future years the two committees will report to the house a comprehensive authorization bill for the national oceanic and atmospheric administration in reporting h r 2803 the committee on science and technology increased funding above the administrations request for a limited number of noaa activities funding for these programs was increased either because they promise to provide needed informational services to policymakers or the public and they embody a critical transfer of research technology which will greatly enhance the usefulness of the service provided with respect to information services h r 2803 contains 500 000 for noaa to begin a comparative study of the environmental effects of waste disposal in various medialand sea and air there is increasing pressure to open up the ocean once again for disposal of wastes however because of the short sighted approach of federal agencies in the past crucial crossmedia comparisons of environmental impact have never been made so that the environmental protection agency must regulate waste disposal without an adequate understanding of what the relative impact of various disposal optionsl might be the committee feels that the most appropriate target for a pioneering study of this sort is the sewage sludge disposal problem in the new york city metropolitan area the bill also contains funding above the administrations request for upgrading the climatological data base at the national climatic center and for enhanced funding of the national climate program office both of these increases are based on the recommendations of the national academy of sciences the national climate offices 5year plan and our own committee that the greatest nearterm improve ment that can be made in our national climate effort would be to improve the accessibility and use of the data already available in government archives effective use of climatic data is an essential element in agricultural productivity and water management with regard to technology transfer h r 2803 includes enhanced funding for several projects which are expected to greatly improve the weather services ability to warn the public of severe weather the committee feels that the greatest challenge facing the weather service in the coming years will be in providing services particularly severeweather warnings in the face of stable or shrinking personnel levels thus in h r 2903 our committee strongly supported those projects which showed either promise for improving detection of severe weather or promise of automating routine functions a modest investment in capital equipment can produce substantial savings in labor and free up the time of skilled personnel in the weather service to perform important forecasting tasks we supported automation of field operations and services afos but agree with the committee on appripriations that a successful test of the system is needed before increased expenditures are warranted at this time funding was provided to accelerate design of the next generation radar nexrad system the weather service currently uses the outmoded and rapidly failing wsr57 radars built in the 1950s delay of nexrad would be a false savings in that it would lead to severely reduced service and to greatly increased maintenance costs additional funds were provided for testing and installing automated observing systems which will eventually be placed at over 500 airports to form the backbone of the groundbased observational network this program has the potential to free personnel to perform more critical forecast and service functions and any delay in this program would result in greatly reduced productivity finally the bill recommends enhanced funding for the national severe storms center in kansas city for its centralized storm information system csis csis allows the forecaster to integrate data from satellites radar and other observing systems at a finer scale than is presently possible and is recognized to be the most promising development in the detection of severe storms since the refinement of doppler radar in this bill the committee also strongly supported the administrations request of 1 876 000 for research in the sources and transport of acid rain this is a substantial increase from the 1981 appropriation for acid rain research which was under 100 000 acid rain is responsible for the biological sterility of hundreds of lakes in the northeastern united states and in canada and may fit the present time or in the near future be responsible for literally billions of dollars of damage to forests and to crops to metal and stone structures of all sorts and to human health in our hearings this year we had testimony that not only will the northeast and canada continue to be severely afflicted with the problems of acid rain absent a major intervention on our part but that also the west coast and the upper middle west are threatened with the poisonous problem of acid rain on their croplands on their forestlands on their waters and on their structures in the near future the administrations request for acid rain research was timely for several reasons including the importance of this issue to the clean air act reauthorization and the designation of noaa as a lead ageney in acid rain research by the energy security act of we have all observed from the newspapers that when president reagan visited canada shortly after he took office it was made very clear to him that acid rain was a matter of urgent concern to our canadian friends more recently i was a member of a group of american congressmen and senators who met with our canadian colleagues members of parliament and their environment minister in halifax and again it was made clear to us beyond a peradventure that the problem of acid rain and our contribution to their problem was a matter of most urgent concern to them so i congratulate president reagan and the administration for having requested a significant and timely increase in the budget to look into the question of acid rain in a comprehensive and holistic fashion i fully agree with the administration that we ought to know far more than we do now what will be the costs and benefits of our efforts to use inexpensive sources of fuel in terms of our environment and natural resources we should have information as to whether a given expenditure in scrubbing coal for instance will lead to a linear reduction of emissions and to improvements in the atmosphere and the fact is that today we do not know we need far more accurate information to make intelligent decisions from the point of view of cost and benefits when we pass legislation imposing major expenditures upon our utilities and upon our manufacturing industries this increase in the budget for acid rain research is totally consistent with this administrations concern that we make more thoughtful decisions affecting the regulatory process and it reflects also the presidents own experience in meeting with canadian leaders and the experience of this congress reflecting the very high priority that we put on a thoughtful logical and workable approach to reducing the problems of acid rain so i do congratulate the administration and the president and i congratulate my colleague the gentleman from new york for the role that he played in bringing them to this very intelligent and useful decision let me say a few words about section 4 of h r 2803 which provides noaa with 5 1 million to plan for develop and operate a civilian land observing system landsat in an era of resource scarcity our committee believes that the ability to obtain and interpret space remote sensing data and thus to locate and manage natural resources is of major importance our committee believes that a finite period of operation by the federal government would greatly mininize the technical financial and institutional risks involved in developing landsat would preserve our national leadership and ultimately would enable the private sector to operate a sound land remote sensing system in closing h r 2803 provides money for a large number of essential atmospheric and oceanic activities i urge my colleagues to support these programs and i recommend h r 2803 for immediate passage from the full house and again i commend my colleague the gentleman from new york for his highly professional and nonpartisan and thoughtful approach to this legislation and his support for it"], [0.9999717473983765, 0.9999717473983765, 0, "it is with great pleasure that i speak today on the oil shale bill before the house i am a cosponsor of both of these important pieces of legislation of which i ask the houses favorable consideration underlying utah colorado and wyoming there are an estimated 1 8 trillion barrels of shale oil scattered throughout 17 000 square miles of land according to the department of interior overall 72 percent of unitedstates oil shale lands containing nearly 80 percent of the total quantity of shale oil is federally owned although only onethird of this resource is thought to be recoverable with known technology the recoverable reserves still equal about 90 percent of the known world reserves of conventional oil that is greater than the conventional oil reserves of the middle east and africa combined utah shares a good deal of this countrys potential for oil shale development along with colorado and wyoming yet because its occurrence is less rich geologically than in the piceance creek basin in colorado the constraints of the mineral leasing act of 1920 on tract size make oil shale development in utah economically infeasible oil shale deposits may represent the most economically and environmentally favorable alternative source to oil for gasoline supply in the long term yet under current economic and policy conditions shale oil production may only reach 20 000 to 65 000 barrels per day by 1987 instead of the favorable condition projection of 100 000 to 250 000 barrels per day by 1990 specifically the bill before the house would first expand the acreage limitation on oil shale leases by providing for lease expansion in lowquality shale areas the bills would promote greater development of shale oil in utah and wyoming where unlike the colorado shale the thickness of the resource zone and quality of the resource are generally not sufficient to make development of 5 120 acre tracts economical by providing true leasing opportunities in all three of the states of utah colorado and wyoming we can expand our knowledge of different shale technologies of the environmental impacts these different technologies have in each of the areas and can gain experience with the emerging shale industry under different conditions all of which were major objectives of the prototype oil shale leasing program second increase the number of lcases an entity is permitted to hold this provision would also help to promote development in utah and wyoming in addition granting additional leases would give benefits to those who have taken the initiative to develop a technology by allowing them the opportunity to apply that technology again otherwise if a company knows it will only be able to obtain one lease chances are they will only purchase an existing technology instead of experimenting if we want innovation and development of a wide range of technologies we should offer industry incentive to do so the provision for the granting of an additional lease would further this objective third allow the leasing of fringe acreage to avoid bypass of oil shale deposits during mining it is commonsense to have a provision whereby small tracts that would not be economically viable to mine separately may be leased and not included in the ceiling on lease ownership in those cases efficiency rather than the exact number of leases is the major concern fourth allow leasing of minerals other than oil shale within an oil shale lease tract the secretary of the interior should be allowed to issue leases for multimineral development of resources found along with oil shale this would clear up any question of the secretarys authority to do what practical economics would dictate assuring full utilization of natural resources on leased hund the general accounting office in its january 1981 report on possible ways to streamline existing federal energy minerals leasing rules agrued that any oil shale leasing legislatlion should contain such a provision fifth allow the leasing of additional nonshale lands for operations connected with oil shale mining it only makes sense to not preclude the mining of lands containing oil shale by covering them with spent shale or operation facilities furthermore as reported by the gao projected costs for developing an oil shale industry will be very high and industry will need some economics of scale to make the venture attractive under this legislation the lessee would have to demonstrate that an additional tract is necessary and appropriate for its operation the legislation would also require that the fair market value be paid for any lease to be used for offtract disposal testimony received by the subcommittee in vernal utah indicated the need for these provisions if projects of a meaningful size are to be initiated and sustained this country has no greater need than to reduce its dependence on imported oil utah is fortunate to contain many renewable and nonrenewable resources whose development could greatly aid in reducing this dependence todays bill supporting increased leasing of oil shale deposits is a very important step in attaining energy independence"]], "top_unsure": [[0.0003217458724975586,
