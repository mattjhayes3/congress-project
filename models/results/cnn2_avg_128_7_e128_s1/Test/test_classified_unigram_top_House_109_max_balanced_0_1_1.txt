billion dollars out of this budget now when you look and you compare what we have to pay in interest on the debt compared to what we are paying for education or homeland security or veterans it is totally and utterly disproportionate to the kind of investments we need to be making because this money and on the chart here we are borrowing this money from the japanese government we are borrowing the money from the chinese government we are borrowing the money from opec countries we are ceding our country away to these other foreign interests and at the same time we are asking japan and cliina to borrow money because we do not have enough because we are giving out corporate subsidies to the oil companies and corporate welfare to the pharmaceutical companies while we are doing that we have to go and borrow the money from the chinese government and then we have to borrow it from the opec countries and as we showed before earlier an hour or so ago the chinese government is taking this money they are lending it to us collecting the interest and investing that money in the training of engineers to the tune of 600 000 engineers that they are going to train next year while we are training 70 that really is the bottom line that these kind of decisions are leading and costing they are leading to enormous problems for our country and they are costing us a lot of money they are really beginning i think to push the burden down on to the next generation we cannot continue to sustain the kind of deficits that we are running the next year or 2007 years budget deficit is projected at over 400 billion 400 billion and that is unacceptable while we are giving the oil industry 12 billion and 16 billion to the energy industry and we are giving to the tune of 50 60 70 billion to the health care industry in subsidies it is a coincidence or maybe it is not that the oil industrys profits are going through the roof so it begs the question why are we subsidizing them the energy companies profits going up subsidizing them too pharmaceutical companies profits through the roof subsidize them too this is paytoplay in washington d c and all the while it is happening at the expense of average people all this is happening at the cost of the american people there is a corruption tax there is a k street tax to average people who are trying to do business trying to make

a whopping 8 18 trillion i used the occasion to contrast the fiscal policies of the clinton administration namely turning the largest budget deficits in history to the largest budget surpluses in history with the fiscal policies of the current administration however my protestations and the warnings of my fellow blue dog democrats continued to fall on deaf ears it is inconceivable that deficits soaring as far as the eye can see mounting debt and the skyrocketing costs of military operations in iraq and afghanistan would be ignored for so long and that it would take a tragedy such as hurricane katrina to finally serve as a wakeup call for years members of the blue dog coalition have warned that we were spending money we did not have that the administration had no economic plan and that massive untargeted tax cutswere not a substitute for an economic blueprint for our countrys future and yet the congress continued to reject every proposal requiring us to do our budget in the same way that our constituents do by paying as we go now that hurricanes katrina and rita have wreaked havoc on the gulf coast causing hundreds of billions of dollars of damage it is clear that we must take immediate action to get our fiscal house in order members on the other side of the aisle have finally acknowledged what democrats have been saying for years that our current economic policies cannot be maintained unfortunately however some in the majority party have proposed that we ask those americans who have been impacted most by katrina namely the elderly and those with low incomes to bear the costs this is not the answer to the persistent poverty exposed so brutally and graphically by katrina we must pursue a comprehensive solution to our fiscal woes by suspending tax cuts for wealthy families by cutting spending and enacting paygo rules payasyougo and establishing an emergency rainy day fund the 2005 budget resolution included 106 billion in new deficit finance tax cuts over the next 5 years these additional tax cuts will impose a huge additional debt burden on the next generation if the government is forced to borrow the money to cover these added expenses the yearly interest payments alone will pile on the already enormous debt that our children and grandchildren will be faced with paying off most of these tax cuts will actually be doled out to individuals who do not need more of the governments largesse with american troops in combat in iraq and afghanistan and with our country coping with the rebuilding of the gulf coast all of us all of us must sacrifice for our troops and for our neighbors in addition to suspending tax cuts for wealthy families the congress must immediately restrain its voracious appetite for spending finding places where cuts can be made to pay the costs of katrina and iraq and in addition to making tough cuts the congress should move to immediately reinstate paygo rules to stop any further bleeding finally the congress must establish a rainy day fund for future katrinas so we will not find ourselves in this spot again the interest earned by such a fund could be used for disaster planning and preparedness to modernize our nations infrastructure fortify our levees and to update and makeinteroperable our communications systems the american people now understand the precarious state of the nations finances

parents taught me and what most of our parents taught all of us that is we leave the country a little better off than we found it in 1989 a new york city real estate developer named seymour durst placed a large national debt clock in times square in order to draw public attention to what he saw as a grim predictor of financial instability for 11 years the debt numbers on the clock rose at the breakneck pace of 13 000 a second in 1995 as the clinton administration began to pay down the national debt onlookers were shocked to see the numbers on that clock not only slow down but reverse the clock was retired in the year 2000 as president clinton announced record reductions in the national debt lir speaker unfortunately no debt clocks were at work this time drawing attention to this

our colleagues on this side of the aisle the rellublicans are locked in a dispute over how to pay for hurricane katrina the cost of which could fall between 100 and 200 billion maybe even more for the federal government alone some for the most part their most conservative members have proposed big cuts in programs that range from student loans to medicaid to food stamps about 50 billion in spending cuts spread over 5 years they present these spending cuts as a way to offset partially at least offset the spending increases that the response to katrina andrita are going to require but in actuality these spending cuts will not go to offset katrina because the republican budget the budget resolution operative for the year 2006 the resolution to be brought to the floor to be amended already calls for 106 billi6n in additional tax cuts 106 billion in new tax cuts and when these new tax cuts are passed the spending cuts proposed ostensibly to offset the cost of katrina will instead go to make up for the loss of revenues due to the 106 billion in tax cuts since the spending cuts are 50 billion and the tax cuts are 106 billion none of the spending cuts will ever make it to the bottom line where they might otherwise be available to offset the cost of katrina so the first problem that we as democrats have with what our republican colleagues are pushing is that it is not what it purports t6 be it is not a plan to pay for katrina it is a plan to facilitate 106 billion in additional tax cuts the second problem that we as democrats have with their plan is that we believe the cost of helping one state sustain the catastrophic loss and cost of a natural disaster a disaster like katrina hurricane rita should be borne by all of us by all of the states should be a matter of shared sacrifice has been in the past should be in future it works and it is right but we do not believe that those least able to bear the costs should be saddled with the lions share of the load and yet that is exactly what their plan will do because they are pushing a plan that will pay fof the cost of katrina by coming down hard and heavy on the backs of students borrowing to pay for their college education on the sick whose only access to care is through medicaid and on the very poor who depend upon food stamps to feed their families this is just some of those on whom the cuts they are proposing will fall and the reason we are proposing alternatives and opposing the plan that they are bringing to the house floor what we have coming before the house is a plan for spending cuts that basically and simply does not achieve its stated purpose because it does not go to cover the cost of hurripane katrina and the spending cuts it does select whether they are used to offset tax cuts or offset the costs of katrina as i have said come down on some of these who are the least able to sustain and bear them it is fair to ask i think as we begin to consider such a program why is it we are insisting upon offsets for rebuilding biloxi or bay st louis or new orleans but not insisting on offsets to pay for rebuilding baghdad or mosul or basra well one of the reasons i believe that we are experiencing this newfound interest in offsets that might diminish the deficit is that the evidence of a swellink deficit that is not going away it is a structural deficit built into the budget not a cyclical deficit deficit based on the ups and downs of the economy one that is going to be with us for a long time to come because of fiscal decisions that were made in 2001 2002 2003 and 2004 is becoming so obvious so widespread so obvious so significant that it simply cannot be denied i mean after all the basics are apparent and they are well known as yogi berra used to love to say you can look it up it is a matter of record back in the year 2000 we had a surplus of 236 billion matter of record the budget was in the black by 236 billion unprecedented that was a budget that was inherited by mr bush today just a few weeks ago as a matter of fact the administration closed the books on fiscal year 2005 and when they closed the books they finally declared the balance at 320 billion and they took some credit because that deficit is actually smaller than the deficit in 2004 which was 412 billion but a 320 billion deficit is nothing to crow about look at what has happened over the last four fiscal years the simplest way to show it to you on the back of an envelope is to look at how many times our republican colleagues have had t vote to increase the debt ceiling of the united states and what those total increases come to since 200t this chart shows it to you very very clearly it shows that in june of 2002 despite the administrations assurance that we would not have tn increase the debt ceiling the legal limit to which the united states can borrow for another 8 years they were back a year later saying we need an increase this year of 450 billion then in may of 2003 they came back and asked for an incredible amount 984 billion you would think that big an increase would take you at least several years this request was approved on may 26 2003 by the summer of 2004 the bush administration was back secretary snow came back hat in hand saying we have just about run through the 984 billion increase you allowed us last year we need another 800 billion increase and before we could leave for the winter break last november that had to be passed finally this year we had a budget resolution on the house floor passed the senate has now been passed as a concurrent budget resolution it calls for an increase of 781 billion in the year 2006 if you add all of these debt ceiling increases together you will see that to accommodate to make room for the budgets of the bush administration over the last four fiscal years we have had to raise the debt ceiling of the united states by 3 trillion 15 billion so why do we have this newfound interest in offsets it is because the budget is becoming undeniably unsustainable i yield to the gentleman from wisconsin"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "catholics have a sacrament the sacrament of penance which they call reconciliation it is a time

unitedstates government will deliver up to 106 billion to the multiple bank accounts of some of the wealthiest americans this government program to help wealthy americans spend more money now forces a false crunch on our resources a 50 billion cut that republicans believe should come from medicaid food stamps and student loans who will feel the impact of these cuts well almost 60percent of all people in nursing homes who are on medicaid and onethird of all babies who are born on medicaid and 8 million americans with disabilities who depend on medicaid and 36 million americans who have to worry about going hungry how do we as a congress reconcile the fact that these cuts will disproportionately affect lowincome americans the elderly and the poor the answer is we should not reconcile ourselves to such an action not for 1 minute not for a nanosecond if we are going to dramatically change for the worse the lives of millions of children and families and senior citizens across the country it had better be because we had to not because we chose to and there is no doubt that republicans have now chosen to rob the poor to maintain and create new tax breaks for the rich we are not simply robbing the poor of resources the proposedcuts are robbing the poor of opportunity the reconciliation budget targets programs that work to bridge the gap between rich and poor medicaid food stamps and student loans that strive to even the playing field for all american families eight weeks ago across the united states americans saw the faces of other americans staring up at them from television screens scratching out desperate signs on rooftops help us the signs said grandmothers brothers nieces nephews newborns the faces of families who could be our families neighbors who could be our neighbors but desperate alone and calling out to the world to see across the country americans answered with one voice we are better than this this is wrong this is immoral this must not be allowed to continue we must take care of our own it is our responsibility it is our duty it is who we are as a people as a country we saw that 100 000 people were trapped in new orleans because they did not have automobiles to escape the flood waters we found that 50 percent of all children in louisiana live in poverty in response to this national revelation republicans have revisited our national budget and made a decision to cut programs from the poorest of the poor while protecting a new tax cut giveaway to the richest of the rich instead of limiting these tax cuts to millionaires the republicans have decided to rebuild new orleans on the backs of the poorest people from the rest of the country this is a moral question not a budget matter the repjiblicans are building the high levees around their threatened tax cuts while letting the flood swamp the programs that matter for the rest of americans this is what the debate is really all about it is about our values as a nation and how they are reflected in how we govern how america should treat its neighbors our fellow americans who by an accident of birth came into this world unable to see or who were born into a family without the means to put food on the table or who had the misfortune to develop alzheimers should we let them starve should we tell their children they will never go to college because their parents cannot pay the tuition shall we turn them away from the hospitals because they cannot afford the care and do not have the insurance or should we as a country decide that in this land of plenty no one should go without basic human dignity as a catholic i was brought up to believe that character is judged by how we treat the least amongst us this budget does not pass that test and my hope is that

on 1 069 a month about 14 million americans are living on half of poverty a single mother with her child living at half of poverty is trying to survive on 535 a month that is two people living on 123 37 a week and each day in america 2 385 more babies are born into poverty the republicans will say that society has little obligation to help the poor because they fail to take personal responsibility for their lives the united states has highest gdp in the world we are first in military technology first in military exports first in gross domestic product first in the number of millionaires and billionaires and first in health technology but we rank 12th in living standards among our poorest onefifth 13th in the gap between rich and poor 14th in efforts to lift children out of poverty 18th in the percent of children in poverty and 37th in the health status of our citizens we should be working to close these gaps and ensure that all americans have a fair chance at life and are treated with basic human dignity instead this reconciliation plan will take away food health care education and the abilityto live in dignity in old age from people who have no other options this budget will proliferate existing inequalities i simply cannot reconcile this budget with my values because this budget does not reflect who we are as a nation and what we believe our responsibility is to other

the culture of corruption that we have seen in this chamber on capitol hill and now we have come to find that this is also extended into the executive branch the republican oneparty rule inevitably when one party controls all the levers of government inevitably it leads to corruption and today we saw another taste of that my friend from florida is here and before we get into the corruption and the cronyism that has been going on in the way that this government has just been corrupted i want to talk for a few minutes about what our friend was saying who was here prior to us i want to make this perfectly clear the republicans control the house of representatives the republicans control the senate the republicans control the white house we have a oneparty government here in washington dc

want to do is spend the republican majority has borrowed and spent this countrg almost all the way into bank ruptcy our national debt just went to 8 trillion the republicans have controlled this house since 1994 they have had the white house since 2000 and the senate on and off but it had control of the senate for the past few years they have been able to implement their agenda and they keep saying that we want to raise taxes we do not want to raise taxes we want to reduce spending here as the rhetoric came from the other side but we do not want to do it on the backs of the middle class we want to reduce corporate welfare to the tune of 16 billion in the two energy bills sixteen billion dollars we voted to subsidize oil companies and they are coming out with the highest profits that they have had in a long long time record profits just in the last quarter we want to end corporate welfare to the pharmaceutical companies 700 billion in spending on a medicare prescription drug bill that does nothing to reduce the cost of prescription drugs democrats wanted reimportation from canada to help reduce the cost democrats wanted to give the secretary of health and human services the ability to negotiate down drug prices by basically going on behalf of all of the medicare recipients to merck and pfizer and all of these big drug companies and basically say if you want a contract let us talk price if we took 10 or 20 percent of the savings of that bill 700 billion over the next 10 years if we saved 10 percent that is 70 billion which would pay for hurricane katrina but we could save closer to 20 or 30 percent which would be 140 billion of the taxpayers money that we could save we do not want to raise taxes now do we think that we should be giving tax cuts to bill gates and warren buffett and at the same time cut medicaid which is a health care program for poor kids and poor families meanwhile middleclass americas health care is going up 1520 percent my god we cannot do anything to help average people because we have to take care of the big corporations and keep the corporate welfare going let me say this before we get back to our message this is very simple to connect the dots this body taxes the american people the american people send their money down here the republican congress gives that money to the tune of 16 billion in the last few months to the energy companies can you imagine your tax dollars going to subsidize oil companies american tax dollars coming down here and the republican majority takes it and gives it to the pharmaceutical companies to buy prescription drugs for seniors great idea but is it a good policy not to do anything about controlling the costs what the republican majority does is then they go to the shakedown

majority that we are here to play we mean business we are very serious about having the opportunity to give this country what it deserves and that means representation representation for them and not the special interests i speak all of the time abotlt i do not have a picture of the special interests in my office saying i really dislike the special interests i really dislike individuals that are paid lobbyists i really dislike them no no it is not them it is the individuals that allow the raw needs of those special interests to make it into statutory language it is those individuals that appropriate in those areas where it gets into the appropriations act and into the budget just the way they wrote it without saying you know i know you have a concern i know you have an issue and you have needs but we have to make sure that the american people are represented in this budget we have to make sure that the american people are represented in this bill we have to make sure that the future of this country as it relates to innovation plays a major role in what we do here and that is where we are lacking so you know mr ryan as we go on and many members will return back to their districts and speak to individuals that live there we challenge those americans to challenge your member of congress it is almost too late for us to wait until election day for you to speak the way you want to speak but you have the opportunity i tell you give the republican majority the benefit of the doubt that they are going to take a paradigm shift but i am going to let you know right now the evidence does not speak to a paradigm shift or a change in thinking or their ways so i say mr ryan that yes we do have a couple of friends over here on this side of the aisle that believe what we believe and it will be those individuals those very few that will join in with a democratic leadership if the american people see fit to have it so that will allow us to move in a bipartisan way and it will not be like it is now and it will not be business as usual and it will not be well i dont care if you do not like it"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "i plan to yield to several of my colleagues mr scott from virginia is also going to speak and as soon as mr spratt the ranking member on the house budget committee comes out of an important hearing on the dubai ports issue he will be able to join us as well the 2007 budget takes america down a wrong and unsustainable path the decisions the president made in this budget favor the wealthy over the working class these decisions reward those who live off what th6 irs considers to be unearned income while making those who have to work long hours every day to support themselves and their families pay far more in taxes in fact i think you would have found bipartisan agreement if we could have worked out tax cuts that were more in the interest of the working class and those hardworking families but in fact when you combine the focug of the tax cuts on those who live primarily off unearned income and the spending cuts that purportedly are necessary to offset the cost of these tax cuts the majority of young people in this country will find it harder to go to college it will be harder for lowincome elderly to get the nutrition and health care they need and it will be much harder for our grandchildren to pay for the future needs that their generation will face the decisions made in the presidents 2007 budget like his budgets since 2002 define a nation a community if you will that is not the america that we know in fact his priorities are just the opposite of what makes america great we heard from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle they call it a socalled republican truth squad it boggles your mind but the fact is that the bush administration has raised spending while they have cut taxes you cant fight two wars on four tax cuts ladies and gentlemen the gentlewoman from north carolina suggested that the government never invests it only spends well what does she think is the purpose of the interstate highway system that enabled our economy to fulfill its potential during the eisenhower administration and subsequent administrations or the money that we have put into the public schools systems to empower our working class and that is what we are talking about investment that will give us sustainable benefits versus tax cuts that are immediately lost most of which seem to be invested overseas and cuts in the real safety net that can make america achieve its greatness the conscious choices made in this budget reflect the flawed policies of an administration that has taken this country down a terribly wrong path one that consists of waging an unnecessary and extraordinarily costly war delivering huge tax cuts to the very wealthiest of this nation and taking the federal debt to depths never before experienced while reducing services to working americans first the 2007 budget is heavily impacted by the consequences of a reckless foreign venture namely the war in iraq the presidents 2007 budget sets aside another 120 billion supplemental to cover the cost of waging this war in fiscal 2007 of course this is on top of a regular defense budget of over 450 billion and in fact we have now allotted over 400 billion when you look through fiscal 2007 primarily for this war in iraq and very little for the war in afghanistan that was referred to by our colleague from maryland the money that is requested in these iraq war supplementals is 40 billion more than we request for transportation 33 billion more than we request for education and training more than 40 billion more than we request for the care of our military veterans inbre than 90 billion more than we will set aside to protect our environment and natural resources and more than 80 billion for what is considered diplomacy but is spent on dealing with the aids crisis on dealing with the ethnic cleansing the genocide in sudan and throughout the world places where we could have such a constructive positive effect the arhount of money that is being requested in fiscal 2007 for this war iii iraq will bring the total amount requested by the bush administration to 490 billion an enormous sum the american people have to ask has this been worth it given the results to date but we know the results are more than 2 300 americans who have lost their lives in iraq more than 16 700 who have been wounded tens if not hundreds of thousands of iraqi casualties andyet osama bin laden is still on the run iraq now appears to be descending into an allout civil war and al qaeda recruitment levels are reportedly stronger than ever but while our men and women are risking their lives overseas at the instruction of this administration and of course we have great regard for their courage and sacrifice we are not being asked to sacrifice at home and in fact the people who have been the most rewarded by this great economythat was built on the investments that have been made in prior generationsthey are being asked to sacrifice the least in fact they are actually being rewarded the same time that these men and women are going to war we are continuing trillions of dollars of tax cuts that primarily benefit the very wealthiest in our society and yet these tax proposals are going to cost the american people about 3 trillion 3 trillion over the next decade the benefits from these tax cuts are heavily skewed toward the wealthy if they were to fix the alternative minimum tax for the middle class that would be one thing if they were to help workingclass families deal with the vulnerabilities they face in providing for their families that would be one thing but that is not where most of it goes more than half of these benefits go to the 4 percent of americans who make over 200 000 annually four years from now in 2010 taxpayers with incomes of more than 1 million a year will receive average tax cuts worth 155 000 100 times the tax cut that the average taxpayer will receive is that fair is that smart i dont think it is appropriate and i dont think it reflects americas priorities and they come at a huge cost to the fiscal security of this nation causing massive amounts of annual federal deficits over the last 4 years we have seen the largest deficits in the history of our nation mr scott is going to show you what has happened over the last 5 years on a chart i hope you will pay close attention it is unbelievable the current fiscal year 2006 is expected to produce the largest deficit ever in the history of our country at 423 billion and this doesnt even take into account the supplemental spending requests that the president will send up to the hill any day now which will increase the 2006 deficit to well over half a trillion dollars and fiscal 2007 will be another year of historic deficits predicted to be 354 billion in fact since president bush took office we have had the largest annual deficits in the history of this country and those numbers are net numbers after you take the social security surplus and offset it against general fund deficits so you can add another 200 billion annually to each of those numbers so we are creating debt of over 500 billion a year these deficits and the 8 trillion in debt we now have as a result of prior deficits will place on our children anti grandchildren an unprecedented level of debt burden because of these policies every child born today automatically inherits 28 000 as their share of the federal debt and under the presidents budget proposals a child born just 5 years from now will inherit a much larger share in fact they will be paying taxes for nearly the first 5 months of every year just to pay the interest on the debt that their parents generation incurred the presidents massive budget deficits also require us to borrow from foreign governments foreign investors now hold half of the countrys publicly held debt china alone holds 250 billion of the public debt which is more than 300 percent the amount that chinaheld only 5 years ago they have a fiscal guillotine over our necks if they chose to use it we are so dependent upon chinas being willing to borrow all this debt that we generate year after year let me just show you a chart in fact of this foreign debt mr kahn our very able staff director on the house budget committee has put this together this is the aggregate unitedstates national debt held by foreign countries now the debt was climbing during the reagan years in the 1980s continued to climb during the bush years during the beginning of the clinton years it started to top oft and then with president clinton having adopted the payasyougo policy of the first president bush having to pay for tax cuts as well as additional spending we got the budget under control we had an estimated 5 6 trillion surplus predicted for the succeeding decade go foreign debt would have gone down just like this and as our foreign debt went down our national security would have gone up but this administration decided they did not want to adopt the policies of the father they did not want any payasyougo they just wanted to cut taxes the heck with paying it we will send a credit card to the next generation they can pay off our debt that is their problem not ours we are going to live high off the hog we are going to reward our contributors and the fact is that that is exactly what has happened and we have driven this nation into debt but even more seriously look at what has happened to foreign debt foreign debt has gone up like this to here we are now at 1 5 trillion here we are at 1 175 trillion and here we are over 2 trillion in 2005 a substantial share being purchased by china as i just said a 300 percent increase in chinas share of the foreign debt but imagine what has happened to foreign debt since 2001 when this president took office talk about endangering national security now who pays for all of this well what happens is that the american people obviously pay our children will pay most of it but even today the sick and the elderly who need care that cannot be provided by their families will pay we will have our college students pay in reductions in student loans and basically the dignity and the upward mobility of the american working class is going to suffer for these policies this is a situation that is not sustainable that has to be reversed now everyone is entitled to their own ideological opinions i do not think they ought to be entitled to their own set of facts this is factual information you can check in any of these budget documents put out by the government you can find that the amount of debt has skyrocketed the amount of debt held by foreign nations has skyrocketed to an even greater degree we are dependent on countries like china to keep us afloat and in fact the working class has suffered our children are going to pay the bill and we are involved in a war that we are only paying for by borrowing from the future we have not paid one dime of the cost of the iraq war nor have we paid for the tax cuts that we have so blithely passed with this i would like to yield to mr scott who has been on the budget committee for several years and he is going to show you some shocking charts as well"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "i rise this evening to talk about the federal debt now president bush was going to be a fiscal conservative and we were going to have smaller government we actually have larger government he has in his 5 short years in office in concert with the republican congress raised the entire debt of the united states of america by 45 percent in 5 short years that is some accomplishment that figures out to 27 730 per person in the united states but that is not enough because actually with a debt limit of about 8 3 trillion we bumped up against it yet again because of the profligate borrowing by this president and the republican congress so secretary snow has requested a fourth increase in 5 years in the national debt limit by another 781 million which he says will tide us over for about a year now what is extraordinary is that right now the government of the united states is teetering on the edge of default in fact the government has cashed in the retirement fund the 401 k of federal employees the g fund in order to not exceed the debt limit set by congress because the leadership here doesnt want to admit to their profligacy they will not allow a vote an upordown vote here in the house on raising the debt limit so they are waiting for the senate to sneak it into a really big bill on the senate side and then they can bring it back over here and pretend that they had nothing to do with it i mean who could have known the debt has gone up 45 percent in 5 years well it is time that they fessed up to what they are doing here the fastest growing part of the federal budget is not the entitlements which we hear so much about we hear about those darned student loans that we cut last month so we could finance tax cuts for rich people and those darned poor people who need health care that we cut last month to help finance tax cuts for rich people actually the fastest part of the federal deficit and budget is interest on the debt that is true interest on the debt which will be 247 billion next year one quarter of 1 trillion now that interest on the debt will not feed a single child it will not help one young person get an education it will not help one senior get a medicare prescription drug benefit it will not give one soldier help with needed equipment in the field no that 250 billion a quarter of 1 trillion will be paid out for profligacy and waste and debt what is even worse is guess what a lot of that money is not even flowing to investors here in the united states of america this president has yet another record he has in 5 short years created more foreign debt than the 42 presidents that preceded him in office now that is something that is really something one president george bush has created more foreign debt than the 42 presidents in more than 200 years that preceded him in office this fiscal conservative this smallgovernment guy how has he do done it well he has done it with a combination of increases in spending a lot of corporate welfare and tax cuts for rich people and major corporations and subsidies to big corporations like in the energy bill because there is not enough incentive at 60 a barrel to drill for oil we have to borrow money the taxpayers do give it to the oil companies and ask them to go out and look for oil that was sort of the core of the bush energy bill 48 percent of our public debt is now held overseas japan holds 687 billion china is second and coming up fast at 300 billion and on down the list this is something that plits the future of our country in jeopardy huge amounts of our debt washing around overseas in countries that might or might not have our best interests in mind long term and might or might not want to continue to lend us money to help finance this profligacy so now the president is saying that he is really serious this time around he is really serious about it he says we are going to address this we are going to cut the debt in half in the next 4 years what he does not tell people is that most of that socalled reduction of the debt is by borrowing all of the surplus that is supposed to flow into the social security trust fund and spending it and not counting it as part of the debt so as the social security surplus grows he says that he is moving us toward a balanced budget of course someday we are going to have to honor those bonds to pay future social security benefits it is time for fiscal sanity here in washington d c we need a change in the congress and the white house to get it e0 1645"]], "top_incorrect": [[1.0, 1.0, 0, "while i sympathize with the original objective of s 397 the protection of lawful commerce in arms act i am forced to oppose this legislation primarily because of unconstitutional gun control amendments added tothe bill in the senate as a firm believer in the second amendment to the united states constitution and an opponent of all federal gun laws i cannot support a bill that imposes new unconstitutional gun controls on americans i believe that the second amendment is one of the foundations of our constitutional liberties in fact i have introduced legislation the second amendment protection act which repeals misguided federal gun control laws such as the brady bill senate amendments added two sections to s 397 that impose unconstitutional controls on american gun owners and sellers first a section was added to the bill to outlaw any licensed gun importer manufacturer or dealer from selling delivering or transferring a handgun without a secure gun storage or safety device each and any violation of this requirement can result in a person being fined up to 2 500 or having his license revoked this gun lock requirement amounts to the imposition of a new federal tax on each handgun sale because gun buyers will be forced to pay the cost of the secure gunstorage or safety device that is required with a handgun irrespective of if that device is desired further the severe penalties for non compliancewhether intentional or accidentaladd yet more weight to the crippling regulations that hang over gun transactions in the united states second a section was added to the bill to create draconian penalties for people who possess armor piercing bullets just like the democratic congress before it that passed the assault weapons ban the republican congress is poised to give in to antigun rights scare tactics by selectively banning bullets instead of each gun owner being able to decide what ammunition he uses in his gun federal bureaucrats will make that decision to recognize the threat such regulation places on gun owners just consider that a gun without ammunition is nothing more than an expensive club regulating ammunition is the back door path to gun regulation the armor piercing bullets restriction imposes a 15 years mandatory minimum sentence for just carrying or possessing such bullets even without a gun during or in relation to a crime of violence or drug trafficking given the wide scope of criminal laws and the fact that people are on occasion accused of crimes they did not commit this provision promises to discourage many nonviolent lawabiding individuals from possessing ammunition protected under the second amendment further it does not take much imagination to see how such a provision could be used by an antigun prosecutor in the prosecution of an individual who used a gun in self defense especially considering that use of such bullets to murder can result in a death sentence in such instances a defendant who exercised self defense may well accept a guilty plea bargain to avoid the severe enhanced penalties imposed under s 397 i am particularly disturbed that the house of representatives leadership has taken the unusual step of bringing s 397 to the floor for a vote without house members at least having an opportunity to vote on removing the gun control amendments instead of voting on a bill that contains the new gun control provisions we should be considering h r 800 the house version of s 397 prior to its perversion by gun control amendments notably gun owners of america has written to house members to request that they oppose s 397 and instead support h r 800 last month i wrote to house speaker dennis hastert majority leader tom delay and committee on the judiciary chairman james sensenbrenner of my opposition to these antigun rights provisions in s 397 while i am concemed about some of the federalism implications of h r 800 it is a far superior bill because it neither requires gun locks nor restricts gun owners ammunition choices with 258 sponsors and cosponsors h r 800 would easily pass the house the house voting for h r 800 would allow the differences between h r 800 and s 397 to be reconciled in conference committee in conference

a cleanburning gas and that there would be little to no risk to expanding that drilling well when one is a representative from the state of florida and we have 77 million people who visited our state just last year alone and 56 5 billion in taxable sales is generated by tourism most of which is the result of our beautiful beaches and our pristine coastline one can clearly see why most floridians would have a significant problem with the possibility of there being oil rigs off our beaches within the eyesight of tourists or our residents and mr peterson of pennsylvania has continually represented that natural gas is a potential alternative energy source well just off the florida coastline the minerals management service which is a government agency under the department of the interior has documented that there is only about a 70day supply of natural gas off the coastline of florida in the gulf under current consumption rates in the united states that to me does not appear to take us into the rest of the century in terms of dealing with our energy needs what we should be doing is uniting as members of congress representing this country and dealing with our longterm energy crisis by exploring alternative energy sources not going to the same old energy sources and trying to drill our way out of this problem drilling is not the solution there is far too much environmental risk to drilling whether we are drilling for natural gas or drilling for oil and the proposal that we will be considering that is attached to the budget reconciliation bill the budgetcut document that we will be considering at the earliest next week includes a terrible proposal that would expand drilling off the coastline of florida and bring drilling within 125 miles of floridas coast on the gulf that is a totally inappropriate proposal it makes absolutely no sense it would jeopardize our environment and i am hopeful that my colleagues from florida and other colleagues who represent coastal communities which will also be in jeopardy if this provision passes will join us in opposing this budget reconciliation bill not the least of which because there are many other reasons why it should be opposed because of the dire cuts that are in the budget that are going to rain terror down on americans across this country but to add insult to injury it also has a terrible provision in it that would allow drilling off the coastline around our entire country so with that having been said i want to talk a little bit about what we talked about in the previous hour and turn the conversation back to the budget reconciliation bill there are a number of significant problems with the budget cuts that the republican leadership is proposing but one of the things that i wanted to turn to is what democrats think we should be doing in terms of the budget democrats want to bring the budget back into balance what we proposed in the budget committee today included a proposal that would bring the budget back into balance by 2012 the democratic budget also has a smaller deficit than the republican budget every year and would accumulate less debt and waste fewer resources on interest payments that are needed to service the national debt we would include budget enforcement measures to protect social security we would do more for education the democratic proposal provides 4 5 billion more for appropriated education and training programs than the republican budget for 2006 and 41 billion more over the next 5 years we also reject the 21 billion in cuts that the republican budget requires the education and workforce committee to make over the next 5 years those are cuts that could fall on students loans and school lunches these are not the same old tired complaints it is insulting to suggest that cutting school lunches and financial aid are tired complaints if one is struggling to be able to give their children breakfast and lunch on a daily basis and make sure that they are provided with nutrition and they do not financially have the ability to ensure that they can do it themselves staring down budget cuts that take that opportunity away from them is nothing short of cowardly this is a cowardly budget reconciliation bill it does not show any guts at all and it abandons the american people let us talk about housing in the previous hour we talked a little bit about the housing cuts that this budgetcut bill would hand down and i am joined by my good and close friend whom i had an opportunity to serve with in now three different chambers the gentlemanfrom florida his district and my district were hit badly by a category 3 storm last week hurricane wilma and we were talking in the last hour about housing and the issues related to affordable housing that our constituents were already facing i want to just point out this picture here over the weekend i had an opportunity to go door to door in my district because there are so many senior citizens trapped in their homes without power we still have half a million people who do not have power in south florida and unfortunately whether it is because of hurricane fatigue or just the fact that there was so much damage in the gulf coast region that it may be difficult to feel the pain that we are going through in south florida and understand it but there is not nearly as much attention as we need focused on what happened in south florida when i was going to door to door in my district to try to help some of the folks who have trouble getting out of their houses and i am talking about people who are in their 80s and 90s one of the apartments that the building captain in the condominium brought me into included this kind of damage this is the result of hurricane wilma and this is just one example there are hundreds and hundreds of condominium units and apartment buildings and homes and mobile homes that look just like this there is a perception whether it was created by the media or created by the lack of attention by the national media on what happened with hurricane wilma that everything is fine in south florida everything is not fine in south florida this is the third floor apartment and that is the ceiling of the apartment and as we can see we can look right through the ceiling at the sky this is this womans master bedroom and literally during the storm 1 minute after she walked out of that master bedroom the roof caved in on her bed a minute earlier and it would have caved in on her when we talk about the affordable housing problem that we already had now we have thousands of people in south florida whose homes have been condemned who are faced with nowhere to go because the average price of a house just in broward is 348 000 a year the rental units the monthly rent is sky high and fema has literally only 300 inspectors in our state going through these homes to determine whether these people are goingto qualify for assistance i yield

support of h con res 357 which supports the goals and ideals of national cystic fibrosis awareness month beginning in may every year in the united states about 1 000 children are born with cystic fibrosis or cf a lifeshortening genetic disease according to the cystic fibrosis foundation those children face a median life expectancy of 36 years an average that fortunately has continued to increase as science and research have developed better treatment and drugs and while a median life expectancy of 36 is unacceptably low that figure is cause for hope for those living with the disease and of course their families they know that in 1955 the year parents of children suffering from this disease formed the cystic fibrosis foundation children born with cf usually did not live to attend preschool as the life expectancy increases those suffering with this disease and their families continue to work for a cure or a lifeextending treatment while a cure for cystic fibrosis remains illusive the symptoms and effects of the disease are fairly simple cf is one of the most common lifethreatening genetic diseases in the united states more than 30 000 people in the united states have cf and over half of them are children in addition over 10 million americans are unknowing symptomfree carriers of the cystic fibrosis gene cystic fibrosis affects the lungs and digestive system e 1500 the defective gene that causes cf triggers the production of abnormally thick mucus in the lungs that leads to restricted breathing recurring lung infections and in many cases digestive problems the infections deteriorate the lungs and their capacity to deliver oxygen to the body a condition that worsens over time and in many cases even leads to death or the need for a lung transplant one of the goals of h con res 357 is to promote the need for early diagnosis and the importance of newborn screening so that treatment of children with cf can begin as soon as possible to improve their health and longevity the five decades that have passed since the founding of the cystic fibrosis foundation have brought not only hope but years to the lives of those suffering from cf the cystic fibrosis foundation continues to be at the forefront of making more with less in the area of drug discovery and development the therapeutics development program tdp created and launched by the cf foundation has pioneered new ways to conduct cuttingedge lifesaving research in a costeffective and efficient manner this program now includes 18 major research institutions across the country in an established clinical trials network the tdp provides innovative companies with funding raised through private donations to the cf foundation to undertake research and development on promising new drug candidates and supports an extensive pipeline of potential new therapies in fact the cf foundation currently has more than 30 drugs and therapies in various stages of clinical trials any one of which could dramatically improve the life of someone suffering from cf i believe that the innovative programs like the therapeutics development program are part of the blueprint for more efficient and costeffective health care and should be supported so as you can see cf foundationsponsored research is adding precious years to the lives of those living with the disease so that they might live long enough to benefit once a cure is found today there is more potential research on new drugs and therapies than funds to finance that lifesaving work this is a problem created by a wealth of scientific riches and one that i hope can be bridged by more publicprivate partnerships which leverage our worldclass biotech and pharmaceutical companies with the capabilities of institutions like the national institutes of health to ensure that the discovery phase of identifying new drugs and compounds to treat cystic fibrosis continues to that end the resolution before us today advocates strong partnerships between government resources like the nih and nonprofits like the cystic fibrosis foundation as a key means to improve care for those with orphan diseases like cf in closing i would like to commend my friend and colleague mr markey from massachusetts for itis leadership and work supporting this resolution and for our partnership cochairing a new congressional cystic fibrosis caucus the congressional cystic fibrosis caucus like this resolution is intended to provide members and the american public a better understanding of cystic fibrosis and the need to support the incredible

support h r 4973 the flood insurance reform and modernization act before us today the national flood insurance program is a valuable tool in addressing the losses incurred throughout this country due to floods it assures that businesses and families have access to affordable flood insurance that would not be availableon the open market prior to the passage of the national flood insurance act in 1968 insurance companies generally did not offer coverage for flood disaster because of the high risk involved today more than 20 000 communities participate in the national flood insurance program more than 90 insurance companies sell and service flood service insurance there are more than four million policies covering the total of 800 billion the national flood insurance program provides federal flood insurance for properties located in floodprone areas where the community has voluntarily agreed to institute floodplain management and land use control measures that minimize the risk of flooding and mitigate potential flood damage the program is intended to provide a more costefficient alternative to costly federal disaster assistance by encouraging communities to take preventive measures to reduce flood losses and providing affordable flood insurance that would not otherwise be commercially available last years hurricane season resulted in significant strains on the nfip the claims resulting from the losses from these catastrophic hurricanes is unprecedented in the history of the program since the nfips inception in 1968 the program paid out 15 billion in claims in contrast claims for hurricanes katrina and rita alone are expected to exceed 25 billion this far surpasses claims paid by the entire history of the nfip in the past when losses exceeded premiums the nfip had been allowed to borrow from the unitedstates treasury to repay claims such loans have traditionally been paid back rather quickly with interest the bill before us today increases the amount that fema may borrow from the unitedstates treasury to 25 billion to cover the expenses incurred by the national flood insurance program nfip during the last years hurricane season as cbo has stated the funds borrowed from treasury so far exceed the programs income from premiums and fees they will likely never be repaid as such this bill proposes a number of reforms to the program to ensure that it is actuarially sound in the future when we debated this in committee some individuals made proposals and for the best of reasons they said we should look at a 100year traditional floodplain and anybody within a 100year traditional floodplain should be required to pay for insurance the problem that unany of us have who represent districts who have mitigated 100year floodplains is that all of our people who are not at risk would be required to basically boost the program by increased premiums by them participating in it also and when federal dollars state and local have been spent to mitigate 100year floodplains many of us thought that that was unreasonable in fact the 100year floodplain would have impacted a large portion of l a county that i represent anything near the l a river would have been included and most of orange county would also because the prado dam mitigates that there was another proposal made with the best of heart and the best of concern for the people of this country that said lets look at a historical 500year floodplain the problem we had with that is there is no evidence available and then there is no information available either that we can dictate and determine how much a 500year floodplain might be if we had taken a 500year historical floodplain it would have included all of l a most of l a county and most of orange county and any other city in this country that is next to a river or near the coast i offered an amendment and it was supported by the committee that said lets do a gao study to determine if we need to expand the program how it should be done how it should be implemented i think it is a reasonable approach rather than us just making a kneejerk reaction to a severe problem and it is a problem we have to address i am not saying we dont but to tax people who are not impacted or not at risk of flood to boost the program i think is unreasonable it would have impacted many of our districts that dont live in areas of high risk and i do understand the need that we need to protect those who are within thb program we need to make the program actuarially sound and i am pleased with the language in this bill that is

ruins shakespeare was performed on alternate nights in english and french since 1976 syria has occupied lebanon with brutal force our resolution appropriately demands that the occupation end now yesterday the people of lebanon tore down gigantic billboards in lebanon that portrayed the former and current syrian dictators mr assad and his father just imagine having in the united states huge billboards of joe stalin or the ayatollahs of tehran how we would feel about this well that is how the lebanese people felt about having these gigantic billboards pay tribute to a country which occupies their land as we speak there is no syrian embassy in lebanon what could speak more eloquently of the colonial outlook that the syrian regime has towards lebanon in colonial times the colonial power did not have an embassy in its colony because it did not recognize it as an independent sovereign nation that is precisely the attitude of syria towards lebanon today all of us have been inspired by what the lebanese call their independence uprising by passing our resolution the congress will express its solidarity with the brave antisyrian occupation freedomloving demonstrators in martyrs square in beirut bashar assad syrias ruler continues to play games with the international community as his speech earlier this month showed he still believes he can ignore the international communitys demand that syria withdraw immediately and totally from lebanon let us not be fooled by his promises of gradual withdrawal delinked from time tables if you can tell a man by his friends all you need to know about assad is that his only friend in lebanon is the terrorist gang hezbollah syria has not only persecuted the lebanese people arresting abducting torturing and killing opponents most recently the prime minister of lebanon it has also destroyed lebanons lively institutions rendering them little more than outposts of syrian control these crimeshave taken place on the soil of what was once the arab worlds lone democracy that is why it is vital that the lebanese people succeed in throwing off syrian rule and that the lebanese be allowed to conduct free and fair
