body parts of little babies they have so repeatedly proven themselves blind to the dignity of humanity they have always been at the forefront of the greatest human genocide in human history and planned parenthood is the number one advocate of killing more than 3 000 little unborn american babies every day these recent revelations are just one more heartbreaking reminder that the nations largest abortion provider has always had a legendary disregard for the sanctity of innocent human life it beggars incredulity that this congress continues to give hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer moneyagainst the taxpayers wishes mr speakerto a heartless organization like planned parenthood that goes to such grotesque lengths to promote the killing of innocent unborn babies through abortion on demand at any time throughout the 9 months of pregnancy for any reason or for no reason this body recently passed the paincapable unborn child protection act that would except in rare circumstances protect both mothers and their little paincapable unborn babies entering their sixth month of gestation from the unspeakable cruelty of planned parenthood and evil monsters like kermit gosnell if the paincapable unborn child protection act had already been law it would have saved the lives of thousands of lateterm paincapable babies every year and it would have made it much harder for planned parenthood to harvest and sell the organs and body parts of unborn children since they simply would not have had as many of the more mature organs and body parts of the older babies to choose from there is no question whatsoever that planned parenthood brazenly and repeatedly violated the law in the selling of these little body parts it is an unspeakable disgrace that the obama justice department will likely never launch a criminal investigation to look into these unconscionable acts but if this congress and the american people now also look the other way and ignore this kind of insidious evil we do so at our moral peril if the conscience of this nation is to survive it is now vital for the paincapable unborn child protection act to become law the house has already passed this critically important and timely legislation it is now time for the senate to do the same we must not let the continuous and repeated manifestations of this unspeakable evil of killing lateterm paincapable babies and selling their body parts go unanswered supporters of abortion on demand have tried for decades to deny that unborn babies ever feel paineven those they say at the beginning of the sixth month of pregnancyas if somehow the ability to feel pain magically develops the very second the child is born almost every other civilized nation on this earth protects paincapable babies at this stage and at this age and every credible poll of the american people shows that they are overwhelmingly in favor of protecting these children yet we have given these little babies less legal protection from unnecessary pain and cruelty than the protection we have given farm animals under the federal humane slaughter act it is a tragedy that beggars expression the voices who have long hailed the merciless killing of these little ones as freedom of choice especially the ones who profit from it will be very shrill and loud but when we hear those voices we should all remember the words of president abraham lincoln when he said those who deny freedom to others deserve not for themselves and under a just god can not long retain it for the sake of all of those who founded and built this nation and dreamed of what america could someday be and for the sake of all those who since then have died in darkness so americans can walk in the light of freedom it is so very important that those of us who are privileged to be members of this congress pause from time to time and remind ourselves of why we are really all here do we still hold these truths to be selfevident mr lincoln called upon all of us to remember that magnificent declaration of independence by americas founding fathers and their enlightened belief that nothing stamped with the divine image and likeness was sent into the world to be trodden on and degraded and imbruted by its fellows he reminded those he called posteritythat is us mr speakerthat when in some distant future some man some factions some interest should set up the doctrine that some were not entitled to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that their posterity that is us might look up again to the declaration of independence and take courage to renew the battle which their fathers began thomas jefferson whose words marked the beginning of this nation said the care of human life and its happiness and not its destruction is the chief and only object of good government the phrase in the fifth amendment capsulizes our entire constitution it says no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law the 14th amendment says no state shall deny any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws protecting the lives of all americans and their constitutional rights especially those who cannot protect themselves is why we are really all here not long ago i heard barack obama speak very noble and poignant words that whether he realizes it or not apply so profoundly to this subject let me quote excerpted portions of his comments he said this is our first task caring for our children it is our first job if we dont get that right we dont get anything right that is how as a society we will be judged president obama asked are we really prepared to say that we are powerless in the face of such carnage that the politics are too hard are we prepared to say that such violence visited on our children year after year after year is somehow the price of freedom the president also said our journey is not complete until all our children are cared for and cherished and always safe from harm that is our generations task he said to make these words these rights these values of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness real for every american never have i so deeply agreed with any words ever spoken by president barack obama as those i have just quoted how i wish mr obama and the rest of us could somehow open our hearts and our ears to his incontrovertible words and ask ourselves in the core of our souls why these words that should apply to all children cannot include the most helpless and vulnerable of all children are there any children more vulnerable than little paincapable babies before they are even born it seems that somehow we are never quite so eloquent as when we decry the crimes of past generations but oh how we often become so staggeringly blind when it comes to facing and rejecting the worst of atrocities in our own time as americans in the land of the free and the home of brave we now live in a day when monsters like kermit gosnell snip the spinal cords of born babies and planned parenthood that for financial gain uses partialbirth abortions to deliberately harvest intact body parts of innocent babies whom they have deprived of the chance to even be born what we are doing to these little children the least of these our little brothers and sisters is real the president knows that and all of us here know that in our hearts medical science regarding the development of unborn babies beginning at the sixth month of pregnancy now demonstrates irrefutably that they do in fact experience pain many of them cry and scream as they are killed but because it is amniotic fluid going over the vocal cords instead of air we cant hear them it is the greatest human rights atrocity in the united states today and for us to now stand by and allow it all to continue unabated while planned parenthood sells the body parts of these little murdered children is to desecrate everything that america was meant to be and for those noble americans who died to make it come to be abraham lincoln gave his contemporaries such wise counsel and it so desperately applies to all of us in this moment he said fellow citizens we cannot escape history we of this congress and this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves no personal significance or insignificance can spare one or another of us the fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the last generation these are indeed days that will be considered in the annals of history and i believe in the councils of eternity itself this bloody shadow has loomed over america for too long it is time for the senate to pass the paincapable unborn child protection act because in spite of all the political noise protecting little paincapable unborn children and their mothers is not a republican issue it is not a democrat issue it is a test of our basic humanity and who we are as a human family it is time to open our eyes and allow our consciences to catch up with our technology it is time for members of the united states congress to open our eyes and our souls and remember that protecting those who cannot protect themselves is why we are really all here it is time for all americans to open our eyes and our hearts to the humanity of these little unborn children of god and the inhumanity of

for what the president has done prosecutorial discretion is a longestablished practice in every area of the law both civil and criminal when a law enforcement agency has only enough resources to go after a fraction of the individuals who it suspects of violating the relevant law it has to make choices there is no alternative in the case of immigration not only do we recognize this congress has specifically directed the head of the department to set priorities enforcement priorities for removal now in addition to that the supreme court has recognized in many cases the needand really the authority of the executiveto make these decisions in the arizona case it said federal officials as an initial matter must decide whether it makes sense to pursue removal at all our own congressional research service has found that no court appears to have invalidated a policy of nonenforcement founded upon prosecutorial discretion on the grounds that the policy violated the take care clause deferred action is nothing more than a tentative revocable signal to a noncitizen that the government does not intend to initiate removal proceedings at this time not only is that tentative but the statute at unitedstatesc 1182 a 9 b ii authorizes the period of stay by the department in such cases congress has expressly recognized deferred action by name repeatedly in addition to the statute the formal regulations of the justice department and homeland security have also expressly recognized deferred action in the reno v americanarab antidiscrimination case justice scalia said at each stage the executive has discretion to abandon the endeavor referring to the removal process and at the time iiria was enacted the ins had been engaging in a regular practice which has come to be known as deferred action of exercising that discretion for humanitarian reasons or simply for its own convenience the arguments that somehow this is unlawful are so far wrong because nothing in the recent

ahead of another illadvised vote to approve the keystone pipeline the same myths are being spread pitting environmental protection against job creation winston churchill once said the truth is incontrovertible malice may attack it ignorance may deride it but in the end there it is let us separate myths from reality it is time to decide truth or scare approval of the keystone pipeline will have very little impact in the way of job creation but a detrimental impact on the environment and hinder our promise of a clean energy future that is the truth my question is why are we ignoring these facts and voting once again to approve the keystone pipeline which would carry one of the dirtiest energy sources on the planet perhaps it has something to do with the many myths associated with this project pipeline proponents are quick to point to the creation of jobs as the primary reason for the projects approval however the facts dont match up according to the only independent analysis by cornell universitys global labor institute these claims are not accurate transcanadas job claims are complete fabrications the cornell report concludes that keystone will not be a major source of jobs nor will it play any substantial role at all in putting americans back to work the state department says keystone would only create 35 permanent jobs and 1 950 construction jobs for 2 years most of those jobs created by this project will be nonlocal and temporary in reality we can and should be creating jobs by improving our existing infrastructure and investing in clean energy education and research in fact keystone would make it much harder for the united states to invest in clean energy jobs and address global climate change our best bet at a clean energy economy lies far far away from tar sands that is the truth proponents of the pipeline claim that keystone will bring down gas prices for americans but in reality prices at midwestern pumps could actually increase according to its own documents transcanada expects the pipeline to increase gas prices in the midwest up to 15 cents per gallon currently a surplus of gas in the region means that our prices stay stable if the pipeline is built oil companies will be able to send their product to the gulf coast for export which will reduce the surplus and drive up costs for midwestern consumers that is the truth on top of all this lets not forget transcanada is the same company that operates the existing keystone pipeline which spilled a dozen times in the first year of operation the twelfth spill released 21 000 gallons of oil in north dakota contaminating the soil and water across the country about 3 2 million gallons of oil spill from pipelines every year these spills pose a great threat to american drinking water especially when you consider the proposed project route would cross 1 073 surface water bodies and affect 383 acres of wetlands most americans understand that oil spills in the past

as a schoolboy growing up in east texas later attending texas a m and especially in my time my 4 years in the united states army as we discussed and looked at world war ii things that had occurred theni was a history major and was with the army for 4 years and majored in history it was just always amazing how could people who said they were civilized kill 6 million of any race gender national origin how could that happen but it did happen on learning that eisenhower required people from the surrounding villages to be brought in to help clean up concentration camps death campsas i understood the reasonwas so no one could ever deny that the death camps occurred i thought that seemed ridiculous how could anybody deny the holocaust there arent all that many survivors but there are enough and the evidence is there and it clearly happened but just as hitler showed if any lie is told often enough people begin to believe it especially if it is even printed here is something that was in print yesterday from a man named martin greenfield from foxnews com and these are martin greenfields words mr greenfield said seventy years ago i was in a nazi concentration camp since then i have seen tyrants and dictators enter and exit the global stage yet as the world prepares to mark the 70th anniversary of the auschwitz liberation it is perhaps well and right that we reflect on how the holocaust shocked the moral imagination on a scale the world could scarcely fathom why ponder such things because for far too many the holocaust remains a mystery a major poll taken last year of 53 000 people found that just 54 percent had ever heard of the holocaust knowledge of auschwitz is likely even more limited particularly among young people past surveys have shown that nearly half of britons had never heard of auschwitz some schoolchildren even thought auschwitz was a type of beer here at home in america a debate erupted last year when a teenager posted a smiling selfie at auschwitz whatever your opinion on the appropriateness of her actions i was at least pleased to be reminded that some young americans still visit the nazi concentration camp to learn history up close i too visited auschwitz as a teenager in 1944 my family and i stood in line before dr josef mengele the nazi physician known as the angel of death as my mother grandparents two sisters and baby brother were all sent to the left to be burned in hitlers ovens my father and i were sent to the right the first night inside auschwitz my father said we must separate because together we would suffer double he quoted his father on your own you will survive his father told him you are young and strong and i know you will survive if you survive by yourself you must honor us by living by not feeling sorry for us this is what you must do that was the last time i ever saw my father i am grateful for my fathers words of grace and guidance they echo in my heart even still it is a cruel thing feeling guilty for surviving but my father erased any future guilt and replaced it with purpose it was a gift only a fathers wisdom could give it gave me a reason to go forward a reason to be it does still part of heeding my fathers words involved replacing the horrors of my holocaust past with a life spent creating beauty in the form of handtailored suits for unitedstates presidents hollywood films and the worlds most influential men in fact my first sewing lesson took place in the auschwitz concentration camp laundry when i accidentally ripped the collar of a nazi soldiers shirt a guard beat me before a kind older inmate taught me how to sew a simple stitch to repair the torn shirt it was hardly the ideal tailoring apprenticeship but it was my first lesson in the skill that became my livelihood but at 86 another part of honoring my fathers wishes requires being a voice for the voiceless indeed as parents educators and citizens we must all do our part to help ensure that never forget remains much more than a threadbare catchphrase that gathers dust and loses meaning with each passing year for example many people are surprised to learn that auschwitz was actually a complex comprised of three main camps and dozens of satellites the united states holocaust memorial museums statistics estimate that between 1940 and 1945 at least 1 1 million jews and 200 000 of hitlers undesirables were sent to the auschwitz complex of those 1 1 million were murdered as i have noted elsewhere that number would have been far greater were it not for the courage of the american soldiers sailors airmen and marines who traveled around the world to defeat a moral darkness that consumed at least 6 million jewish souls that is a lesson worthy of remembrance the 70th anniversary of the liberation marks that moment when freedom conquered barbarism through sureness of virtue and strength of will sadly as recent events reveal that remains a lesson humanity must learn and relearn from generation to generation the word holocaust means sacrifice by fire may the memory of the millions who were engulfed in the flames like my family never be forgotten that is martin greenfield 70

making a second visit to auschwitz for the commemoration ceremonies at nearly 12 ronen saw auschwitz for the first time as a prisoner after soldiers forced all the jews in his hungarian town into a ghetto and 2 weeks later shipped them in cattle cars to the camp dr josef mengele the nazis angel of death sent ronens mother and two sisters to the gas chambers on arrival young ronen made a lifesaving decision when he held on to his fathers hand and joined the line of men he spent about 2 weeks at auschwitz where he witnessed soldiers using an infant for target practice and slept on piles of corpses to avoid selection for the gas chamber he and his father were moved to a nearby labor camp where the brutality continued one day his father told ronen he could no longer get up to work for the cement brigade ronen last saw his father as soldiers took him away it is the only day he remembers crying and the day he decided to survive ronen was liberated from a third camp gunskirchen and remembers walking to a nearby town knocking on a residents door and asking if he could take a shower ronen who prefers to be called a victorer rather than a survivor first returned to auschwitz in 1999 when he guided thenprime minister jean chretien around the grounds it is important to ronen to show the world he is alive and to share the history of the holocaust maybe the world will realize what we went through and it will be the end and we are going to have peace and quiet in the world he explains unfortunately it is not the end of horrors tragically christians now are

diminishing by people around the world as polling indicates around the world but still to be seen as the great superpoweras antijewish hatred grows and we do precious little about it and even at times stoke those flames even in our universities who are so proud of accepting massive amounts of money from people who are part of organizations that hate jews and fund such courses or seminars on things like islamophobia not a liberated mental process of recognizing antisemitism recognizing jewish hatredno stoking those flames against the jewish people it is unbelievable that it is happening here in america as well and it is even more unbelievable that it is happening among what some would refer to as the intelligentsia those who are supposed to be more enlightened than the rest of a nation who see things as they truly are and yet in america some of those supposed enlightened intelligentsia are growing to be some of the most antisemitic people in the country how did all this happen money for one thing political power for another but it has to stop money and initially power in nazi germany stoked the flames of antijewish hatred but there is antichristian hatred growing as well radical islam has proliferated around the world violent radical islam has grown they arent junior varsities these are literal cutthroats who have to be stopped it is not enough for the united states administration to beg radical islamists jew and christianhating leaders to sit at the table or offer to let their murderers go free if they will just sit down and visit with us reminiscent of what jimmy carter wanted to do after an act of war was committed against our embassy and in the 36 years that have followed what appeared to radical islamists as a weak paper tiger toothless america did nothing but beg to sit down and talk and try to encourage iran to let our prisoners go it was not until ronald reagan took office they were released they never wanted to fight the united states superpower that has been changed over the years since 79 when they committed an act of war attacked our embassy around the world people have been shown oh you can do that against the united states and get away with it the good thing is they may end up leaving your country and then they may offer to give you money they may offer to release murderers from prison so they can come back and help kill more americans you know they are not very smart over there in the united states that has been going on since 1979 it is tragic when we encourage radical islamist holocausts which is what they would like to do they said they were going to do by letting the murderers go how could this administration for months now think that yemen was a great example of moderate islam working out i have known since a constituent months ago was in jeopardy and we were able to get special ops people to help get them out according to them the embassy was attacked many months ago back at the time embassy personnel officially said no it was a nearby attack but it wasnt us when the iranianbacked houthis the radical islamists in yemen were taking over the capital and taking over the countryand instead of standing up firmly against them and protecting our american interests we were releasing murderers radical islamic murdererswe were talking about how wonderful things were in yemen that is exactly how the kind of antijewish antichristian sentiment could grow to the point of having a holocaust it is literally breathtaking for an administration not to understand that while it is trying to placate radical islamic leaders in iran and telling them we just want to talk as long as you will keep talking to us we will keep israel from protecting themselves to their own detriment just keep talking to us and you keep those centrifuges spinning that is fine with us now we know we have been informed that the administration has taken complete dismantlement of the centrifuges and their equipment to help them create nuclear weapons off the table it is not even something they are demanding anymore in other words the word is out that this administration is apparently okay with iran getting nukes but just would prefer that it wait until after this president leaves office it doesnt matter when a president leaves office if an administration gives bloodthirsty zealots the ability to create a holocaust history does not forgive them simply because they had already left office when the holocaust actually started nigeria doesnt need us to send troops to stop the radical islamists there but they need help boko haram continues to kill rape torture there it is about going after christians the smallscale holocausts that boko haram is creating dont get so much as a whimper these days from this administration they may say a few words but they are hollow and they do not affect boko haram as they continue to be emboldened just like when the irs was caught redhanded being weaponized and used as a democratic political tool which appears to have violated criminal lawyes we have had hearings but we havent held them accountable and therefore it seems to have encouraged even more impropriety by people within the irs when people get caught in impropriety and dont pay a cost then you see what we are seeing in nigeria you see what we are seeing in afghanistan in pakistan in syria in iran in iraq and in libya oh i know the president his administration bragged about the arab spring and about taking out qadhafi who had become an ally after he gave up any efforts for nuclear weapons completely opened his defenses to the united states this administration and the prior administration had agreements with qadhafi but this administration never lets agreements get in the way of helping radical islamists because this administration did help radical islam turn libya into a smoking country where people die where our own people were not protected because of the fantasy of those who thought that somehow the name the united states would be adequate to keep chris stevens and the other americans safe in benghazi we didnt need to give them added security like they asked for we didnt even need to respond when chris stevens called and said they were under attacknever said anything about a video because it was not but that smokescreen worked the president got reelected he didnt have to account for that before the election still hasnt had to account for where he was and why help was not forthcoming i mean even after 20 hours this administration that had planeswe know for sure within 31 2 hoursafter 20 hours they get a private plane there that is it david ubben with most of his leg right leg blown off no painkillers no morphine they dont have a c130 that they land to take him up in on a gurney they get a private plane from somebody who wasnt even american and they have to knock david up against the door turning the gurney every which way trying to get him in without painkillers causing more pain more suffering because this administration apparently they were thinking that if they sent more help than just a private plane like that a military plane if that were sent it might look like libya were not the wonderful country that this administration helped create by bombing qadhafi out of existence and yes it was not it is true it was not a unitedstates bomb that took qadhafi out but our bombs put him on the run our bombs stopped his caravan our president wouldnt respond for 3 days after qadhafi offered to leave in exile and avoid any bloodshed before it all started this administration didnt respond obviously they were okay with having bloodshed and qadhafi being wiped out so they got what they were hoping for obviously but what do we have now we have a country in libya that is in absolute turmoil by the way because libya is in turmoil due to this administration they are helping turn egypt into as much turmoil as they can thank god for president elsisi in having met with him on more than one occasion i was impressed by the man before he was president he asked that we bring back a message to this administration since this administrationthis presidentfroze the helicopters that were being sent the apaches the question was does this administrationdoes this presidentnot understand that we use the apache helicopters to keep the suez canal open although there were some that bought morsis lies that he was deweaponizing the sinaisupposedly to diminish the threat to israel from the sinaiand after morsi was removed for his unconstitutional actions not in a coup but in an uprising which was a peaceful revolution by reportedly over 30 million of their 90 million people they found that the sinai had been dramatically weaponized and had been contributing weapons equipment to gaza to help threaten and cause terror to israel once again whether it is the sinai gaza northern israel that was given to lebanon it seems going back to the very inception of israelback when israel was first brought according to the bible into the promised landwe know of canaan the canaanites no longer exist so other people claim it who are not canaanites actually the israelis had claim to it after the canaanites others who occupied the land back over 3 000 years ago dont exist this land according to the bible was given to the children of israel it seems to be true that there has never been a time when israel gave away land when trying to buy peace that that land that they gave away was not used as a staging area from which to attack it gaza what a noble thing to do by the israelis they took an area that was prosperous selfsustaining with greenhouses growing vegetables that would feed the people who lived there an amazing place was the gaza strip then some noble israeli leaders thought do you know what it is not required we are getting absolutely nothing in return but we are going to do the unilateral act that will be so noble that will be so full of grace that the world even those who dont like us will go wow those israelis they are okay they are nice folks look they didnt get anything in return yet they still gave away the gaza strip what a wonderful group of people i mean that just doesnt happen the united states never gave back its land to england or to spain or to france or to other countries that initially had claims here other countries dont do that but israel did they gave away the gaza strip previous to that they had given away what northern israel now calls southern lebanon southern lebanon people will recall has been the site of attacks on israeliswar so how was this grace this beneficence of israels giving the gaza strip to the palestinians rewarded it has been rewarded by their giving back to israel thousands upon thousands upon thousands of rockets some kill all terrorize all cost money to israel the most important problem they have created is the threat to life the threat to their existence and we still have people in this country who say well if you just keep giving away land eventually they will be satisfied when the very materials that are being promoted by the people this administration supports among the islamiststhey made very clear the reason we name holidays streets areas parks after suicide bombers who kill innocent children women men is that we ultimately are going to destroy israel and wipe it off the map we hate jews that much and this administration thinks somehow they will bring radical islam around to really being this group of peace now there is a document that was an exhibit in the united states v the holy land foundation in which there were many individuals and groups named as coconspirators they were not indicted but they were named as coconspirators it includes the council on americanislamic relations cair which has a nice office building just up the street here and the islamic society of north america isna the leader of which is imam magid who goes to the white house who goes to the state department who advises the president and lets him know when somebody is criticizing islam so the administration steps in and goes after him in this exhibit from the holy land foundation trialit was the biggest funding of terrorism case ever in unitedstates history and people who were involved originally had indicated the goal was to convict these first five to name all of these coconspirators and if we get convictions of those first five like we think we should then we proceed and go after the remainder they were convicted in late 2008 president obama took office a month or two later and this administration would under no circumstances go after these people who had been alleged in the documents of funding radical islamic terrorism even after the unitedstates district court in dallas and the unitedstates fifth circuit court of appeals in new orleans confirmed that there was plenty of evidence to support that someone like isna or cair was a legitimate coconspirator named in the indictment and that their names would not be removed i have asked for years now of the justice department to make available the documents that were provided to the convicted terroriststhose funding terrorism or terroristsand this administration now for years has drug their feet and has refused to provide all of the documents that were provided to the terrorists on one occasion the attorney gen eral basically said there are issues here of privilege and my point wasand isyou gave them to the terrorists surely you can give them to members of congress but the answer is no they cant they are going to keep obfuscating they dont want us to see all of the documents that they had in their possession that they gave to the terrorists i have a feeling if we saw all of the documents it would be very very clear in the purging that this administration has done of our training materials of the fbis of the intelligence agencys of the state departments and the justice departments that if there is anything that might bother a radical islamist who wants to kill us then it has to be removed they removed it in the document from a 1991 meeting in what is called an explanatory memorandum it spells out their goals it was written in 1991 by a member of the board of directors of the muslim brotherhood in north america and by a senior hamas leader named mohamed akram it had been approved by the muslim brotherhoods shura council and organizational conference and it was meant for internal review by the muslim brotherhood leadership in egypt it was not intended for public consumption these are the words from the introduction that is part of this document from the center for security policy i want to quote from the document itself prepared by the muslim brotherhood in 1991 setting their goals for america one the memorandum is derived from one the general strategic goal of the group in america which was approved by the shura council and the organizational conference for the year 1987 is enablement of islam in north america meaning establishing an effective and stable islamic movement led by the muslim brotherhood which adopts muslims causes domestically and globally and which works to expand the observant muslim base aims at unifying and directing muslims efforts presents islam as a civilization alternative and supports the global islamic state if that name sounds familiar wherever it is two the priority that is approved by the shura council for the work of the group in its current and former session which is settlement skipping down to two an introduction to the explanatory memorandum it says the question we are facing is how do you like to see the islam movement in north america in 10 years or taking along the following sentence when planning and working islamic work in north america in the year 2000 a strategic vision it goes on also we must summon and take along elements of the general strategic goal of the group in north america for those large numbers of people in college who may not realize north america is where we live the document says i will intentionally repeat them in numbers they are one establishing an effective and stable islamic movement led by the muslim brotherhood two adopting muslims causes domestically and globally three expanding the observant muslim base four unifying and directing muslim efforts five presenting islam as a civilization alternative six supporting the establishment of the global islamic state wherever it is the document says it must be stressed that it has become clear and emphatically known that all is in agreement that we must settle or enable islam and its movement in this part of the world three the concept of settlement the term was mentioned in the groups dictionary and documents with various meanings in spite of the fact that everyone meant one thing with it we believe that the understanding of the essence is the same and we will attempt here to give the word and its meanings a practical explanation with a practical movement tone and not a philosophical linguistic explanation while stressing that this explanation of ours is not complete until our explanation of the process of settlement itself is understood which is mentioned in the following paragraph we briefly say the following settlement that islam and its movement become a part of the homeland it lives in establishment that islam turns into firmly rooted organizations on whose bases civilization structure and testimony are built further down it goes on that islam is stable in the land rooting that islam is resident and not a passing thing or rooted entrenched in the soil of the spot where it moves and not a strange plant to it four the process of settlement in order for islam and its movement to become a part of the homeland in which it lives talking about north america stable in its land rooted in the spirits and minds of its people enabled in the life of its society and has firmly established organizations on which the islamic structure is built and with which the testimony of civilization is achieved the movement must plan and struggle to obtain the keys and the tools of this process in carrying out this grand mission as a civilization jihadist responsibility which lies on the shoulders of muslims and on top of them the muslim brotherhood in this country talking about here in the united states north america among these keys and tools are the following it goes on to talk about the settlement concept and the fundamental shift toward settlement of this country number four understanding the role of the muslim brother in north america the process of settlement is a civilization jihadist process with all the word means anyway it goes on another place here it says there is a conviction with which this memorandum disagreesthat our focus in attempting to settle islam in this country will lead to negligence in our duty towards the global islamic movement in supporting its project to establish the state we believe that the reply is in two segments one the success of the movement in america talking about the united states of america one the success of the movement in america in establishing an observant islamic base with power and effectiveness will be the best support and aid to the global movement project and the second is the global movement has not succeeded yet in distributing roles to its branches stating what is the needed from them as one of the participants or contributors to the project to establish the global islamic state the day this happens the children of the american ikhwani branch will have farreaching impact and positions that make the ancestors proud it is a great document goal for taking over the united states which brings another story to the surface it is from bob price from breitbart com islamic tribunal confirmed in texas attorney claims its voluntary and it talks about the new islamic tribunal in texas that has been confirmed now by breitbart texas the tribunal is operating as a nonprofit organization in dallas because when you understand the goals if there is a major defeat or a major success muslim brotherhood requires a mosque be built there and a presence there naturally they would want one at ground zero in new york further they would want a mosque and a strong presence in dallas which was they believe the place of their big defeat when the holy land foundation principals were convicted and sent to prison i did want to point out as we finish up here today that the president was giving an excellent speech in india about the importance of stopping the global war on women he didnt call it that he only calls it that for republicans but there is a war on women and it is not by republicans it is radical islam and even some moderate islamists he is giving this talk about the importance of recognizing the importance and the equality of womenor some of us might say they are more equal than we arebut as he was doing that this picture was on saudi television we have our united states president depicted here and this is the first lady of the united states of america being blurred out by this countrys allies because she wasnt covered michelle obama should never need to be covered if she doesnt want to be yet at the very time our president is talking about equality of women he fails to notice that people that he considers allies are treating his own wife like this it is critical that we stand up against radical islam or any islam that wants a settlement civilization jihad in america anything and anybody who disagrees with the united states constitution and wants to destroy it tear it down is an enemy to the united states and needs to be recognized as such and not welcomed with open arms at the state department and the white house with that i yield back the balance of my

left a state a community that was united in grieving united in mourning united in its resolve to do something about it i arrived at an institution as divided as ever it is not constructive to shout shame to your colleagues it is not constructive to suggest that one side of the aisle is complicit in mass attacks on our nation simply because some of us have had grave concerns about a proposal that for 2 years has been offered that we believe is flawed in recognizing constitutional protections but it is also not acceptable to embrace inaction and that is true on my side of the aisle as well i have voted against the democratic proposal in committee for a couple of years here is whyand this is important for the american people to understand if you are on a watch list you should not be able to buy a gun but if you are wrongfully on that list and if you are a lawabiding american citizen your constitutional protections should be provided for you see when an individual today is not allowed to purchase a firearmthe seven eight nine classes of individualsthey are all post adjudication they have received a due process hearing and have been either convicted of a violent felony have been adjudicated through a court of mental incompetence or have been dishonorably discharged in each case there has been due process post adjudication is when the ban has been implemented the proposal on

week i circulated a proposal i didnt introduce it last week i circulated it i said to all of my colleagues help me make this better so last night with some changes based on input from my colleagues i introduced h r 5544 it makes changes it accepts the proposal of no fly no buy it is common sense if you are on a watch list you shouldnt be able to purchase a firearm but under my legislation if you are denied you must be notified not at the point of sale but within 10 days by the government that you were denied because you are on a watch list you are then entitled to a due process hearing within 30 days by a judge not by a political appointee within the department of justice the government must then demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidencea 5149 burdenwhy you should be prohibited if

by manipulated intelligence would charge a fee to speak at a fundraiser for wounded veterans abc also reported that in addition to charging 100 000 to speak at the charity the former president was also provided with a private jet to travel to houston at a cost of 20 000 further abc news reported one of the wounded vets who served on the charity board told abc news he was outraged that his former commander in chief would charge any fee to speak on behalf of men and women he ordered into harms way for him to be paid to raise money for veterans that were wounded in combat under his orders i dont think thats right said former marine eddie wright eddie wright lost both hands in a rocket attack in fallujah in iraq in the year 2004 this is so disappointing and outrageous these veterans have been severely wounded and the president that led us into an unjustified war charges 100 000 to be in their presence that is wrong that is really really wrong many of these wounded veterans from iraq and afghanistan live in the third district in north carolina which i have the privilege to represent for years i have felt deep regret over my vote to go into iraq and to atone for that i have

publicly apologized to the families for the unnecessary war they began i think my friend colonel lawrence wilkerson who was chief of staff to former secretary of state colin powell was right about the iraq war on msnbc a couple of months ago colonel wilkerson stated the intelligence was fixed and everyone should know that by now it was a failure of the intelligence agencies but it was also a failure of the political people who manipulated the intelligence failure to their own benefit he further stated it destroyed the balance of power in the gulf and produced what we have today the chaos

the office of management and budget to take another look at what is now 20yearold data about how used oil is managed in the united states and to develop comprehensive strategies to increase recycling used oil as part of a national strategy to save energy and reduce pollution right now there are options for disposal of motor oil commonly used in trucks and cars the worst option is for that oil to be simply discarded leading to contaminants polluting our air and water if properly collected the oil can be burned once for use as lowcost fuel however the best option uses modern technology which now exists to collect and sustainably recycle used oil these refining techniques can now produce a product that is the quality equivalent to fresh virgin base oils so this option also maximizes the benefits by conserving most of the energy needed to make oil while cutting emissions of carbon and other harmful pollutants rerefining can turn what used to be a waste product into an infinitely renewable resource and not only does this rerefined oil meet government and industry specifications but it is also costcompetitive reduces waste and reduces emissions earlier studies done by doe as well as our national labs show that used motor oil is a valuable and reusable energy resource as the motor sports capital of the worldindianapolis that isit is no surprise that indiana has traditionally been a leader in recycling and rerefining oil we have two major used oil refineries in indiana employing almost 1 000 people and our state has a proud tradition of utilizing this product and promoting its technology rerefined oil is already being actively used by dod and other federal agencies public and commercial fleets and average consumers with great success however far too little of our used oil is recycled in this way so my amendment is intended to increase conservation and sustainable reuse the last major federal study was called for in the energy policy act of 2005 that study was issued in 2006 but relied on data that was then 10 years old now that data is 20 years old my amendment will require the doe to update that data so that we know how much oil is available and how much is actually being reused and rerefined data from 20 years ago showed that the united states was well behind other developed and even some developing countries in terms of sustainable reuse
