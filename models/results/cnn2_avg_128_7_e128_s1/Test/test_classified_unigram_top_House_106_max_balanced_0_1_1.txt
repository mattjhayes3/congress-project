rise in strong support of eliminating the marriage tax penalty i rise in strong support of the house and senate going to conference and sending to the president this week legislation that wipes out what i consider to be the most unfair tax of all we have often asked from the well of the house a pretty simple basic question that is is it right is it fair that under our tax code 25 million married working couples pay higher taxes just because they are married is it right is it fair that 25 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 in higher taxes just because they are married and today the only way to avoid that marriage tax penalty when both the man and the women that are in the workforce is either not get married or get divorced it is wrong that under our tax code one pays higher taxes just because they are married i was so proud of this house just this past week when we passed and sent to the senate legislation which wiped out the american tax penalty for 25 million couples this afternoon the senate by a vote of 61 to 38 an overwhelming vote including democrats joining with republicans voted to eliminate the marriage tax penalty of course the bills are a little bit different we have to work out the differences the bottom line is we want to eliminate the marriage tax penalty let me give an example of a couple from the district that i represent in the south side of chicago in the south suburbs who suffer the marriage tax penalty this is michelle and shad hallihan they are two public school teachers they live just outside joliet illinois shad teaches at joliet high school michelle teaches at manhattan junior high they suffer about 1 000 in marriage tax penalty their combined income is about 62 000 they are homeowners and i would point out that since we introduced the bill to eliminate the marriage tax penalty a year and a half ago shad and michelle have since had a little baby if the democrats have their way this child will probably be out of college before we eliminate the marriage tax penalty because there is always an excuse not to do it today the bottom line is for michelle and shad hallihan and for their new little baby ben 1 400 the average marriage tax penalty is real money in the joliet area 1 400 is 3 months of day care at a local child care center for little ben 1 400 is 3 000 diapers for little ben 1 400 is one years tuition at a community college called joliet junior college in joliet illinois it is a washer and dryer for their home our legislation that passed the house of representatives will help people like michelle and shad hallihan the democrats talk about their alternative it would leave michelle and shad hallihan out they would still be stuck with the marriage tax penalty under our legislation which passed the house of representatives with the vote of every republican and also 48 democrats who broke with their leadership to support the elimination of the marriage tax penalty we helped couples two public school teachers like shad and michelle hallihan as i pointed out earlier shad and michelle are homeowners they also have a baby and of course they give money to church and charity so that means they itemize their taxes under our proposal we double the standard deduction to twice that for single people under our proposal that helps those who do not itemize but if we are going to help people like michelle and shad hallihan we have to help itemizers that means we need to widen the tax bracket so in the 15 percent bracket two joint filers a couple with two incomes have to be able to earn twice as much as what a single person can earn in that tax bracket under our proposal in the 15 percent tax bracket we widen it so that twoearner households can earn twice as much that will help shad and michelle hallihan i would point out that the proposal that the gentleman from massachusetts talked about would not help those who itemize and think about it most middleclass families who itemize their taxes itemize because they own a home or they give money to church and charity we as members of congress can all think of our neighbors back home middleclass working families who pursue the american dream they buy a home and because of their mortgage interest costs and because of their property taxes they itemize their taxes the democrats say if one itemizes their taxes they are rich so they should continue to suffer the marriage tax penalty now michelle and shad make 62 000 a year back in the south suburbs of chicago that is kind of a middleclass working family under the democrat definition of rich they are rich making 62 000 a year our goal is to make the tax code more fair when i am in the south side of chicago at a steel workers hall in the tenth ward or a legion post in joliet or at a local iron workers hall in la salle or a chamber of commerce function or coffee shop people tell me theirs taxes are too high but they also point out that the tax code is unfair that is why we should help people like michelle and shad hallihan let us eliminate the marriage tax penalty let us go to conference"], [2.0922727092531623e-11, 2.0922727092531623e-11, 0, "this is a great opportunity this evening to talk about an issue that many of us haye raised in this congress over the last several years that is an issue that really is a fundamental issue of fairness an issue of fairness that the american people have been asking some pretty basic questions about over the last several years i represent the south side of chicago the south suburbs in cook and will counties as well as bedroom communities and farm communities in illinois and i found whether i was in the steel workers union hall in hegwish or a neighborhood in chicago or at the local legion post in joliet or the local grain elevator in tonica people often ask a basic question is it right is it fair that under our tax code that the average married working couple pays higher taxes just because they are married they say why do the folks in washington allow a tax code to be in place that tells us that if we choose to get married and work we are going to pay more in taxes they are stunned when they learn that 28 million married working couples pay an average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married clearly the marriage tax penalty suffered by working married people is fundamentally wrong and something we should change i am so pleased that the leadership of this house the speaker of the house the gentleman from illinois has made reduction and elimination of the marriage tax penalty the first priority this year first out of the box and on a fast track as a taxrelated initiative to help middleclass families the marriage tax penalty has been in place for almost 30 years and no one has gone back to fix it i am pleased this republican congress has made a decision to bring fairness to the tax code by working to eliminate the marriage tax penalty the marriage tax penalty is something that affects real people i have a photo here of a young couple from joliet illinois shad and michelle hallihan two school teachers they teach in the local public schools in joliet shad and michelle suffer a marriage tax penalty of almost a thousand dollars because they are married they recently had a child a baby and as michelle hallihan pointed out to me she said that 1 000 the marriage tax penalty that they suffer that is 3 000 diapers that they can buy for their child that goes to uncle sam instead of taking care of their child it is real money 1 400 in joliet illinois where shad and michelle live is one years tuition at joliet community college and it is 3 months of day care at a local day care center let me explain how it came about our tax code has grown more complicated and since the late 1960s married working couples moms and dads husbands and wives with two incomes have paid higher taxes just because they are married of course we have made this a priority and i would like to announce of course this wednesday the committee on ways and means is going to be marking up committee action will occur on legislation essentially to wipe out the marriage tax penalty for almost 28 million married work couples a real change that is going to help people this is how the marriage tax penalty works take a machinist and a school teacher in the south suburbs of chicago they have identical incomes this machinist is making 31 500 as a single person under our tax code he is going to be taxed at 15 percent rate so he meets a school teacher a gal with an identical income of 31 500 and they choose to get married and at the point they choose to get married they begin filing their taxes jointly when we file our taxes jointly we combine our two incomes in this case this machinist and school teacher who previously were taxed at 15 percent because they chose to get married their combined income pushes their combined income to 63 000 they pay almost 1 400 more in higher taxes because they are pushed under our tax code into the 28 percent tax bracket the higher tax bracket that is wrong but today that is the current situation for working married couples so really the incentives is in the wrong place marriage is one of the most basic institutions in our society and our tax code punishes marriage i would point out that had this machinist and school teacher chose to live together outside of marriage they would not suffer that extra tax only when they choose to get married do they pay that higher tax and i think we all agree that is wrong that we impose higher taxes on married working people i am proud to say that the house republican leadership under the leadership of speaker hastert has made elimination of the marriage tax penalty our first initiative in an effort to bring fairness to the tax code and lower the tax burden on working families this afternoon the gentleman from texas unveiled the legislation that will provide tax relief for 28 million married working couples it is similar almost identical in many ways to the marriage tax elimination act h r 6 legislation that we introduced earlier this year which now has 230 cosponsors and overwhelming majority of republicans and i am pleased that 12 democrats have joined with us in an effort to make this a bipartisan proposal let me briefly share what the proposal that we will be working on in the committee on ways and means on wednesday will do it is the goal of the house to act and approve and send to the senate by february 14 valentines day our effort to wipe out the marriage tax penalty think about it what better valentines day gift to give 28 million married working people than elimination of the marriage tax penalty this legislation will essentially wipe out the marriage tax penalty for almost everybody who suffers it that will be a big change in our tax code the legislation that we will be acting on and voting out of the house in the next couple of weeks will help 28 million married working couples for those who do not itemize their taxes they will see immediately 230 dollars in marriage tax relief for those who itemize because they own a home they will see 1 400 marriage tax relief under this legislation i would point out that this makes a big difference under our plan we provide immediate marriage tax relief in 2001 next year helping millions of couples and because we double the standard deduction for those who do not itemize for joint filers to twice that of singles 3 million married working couples will see their tax code simplified because they will no longer need to itemize and fill out extra forms so we make filing for taxes easier and for those who do itemize primarily homeowners they will see marriage tax relief as well twentyeight million married work couples will see up to 1 400 in marriage tax relief as a result of what the committee on ways and means will approve on wednesday and i expect that an overwhelming majority of this house will see it approved before valentines day what a great valentines day gift that we can give 28 million married working couples elimination of the marriage tax penalty i am joined by a number of my colleagues today who have been real leaders in the effort to eliminate the marriage tax penalty as i pointed out earlier of the 435 members of this house we need 217 to pass a bill so an overwhelming majority of the house have joined in cosponsoring this bill i am joined today by a number of cosponsors of this legislation who have stepped forward and fought hard to eliminate the marriage tax penalty at this time i would like to yield to the gentlewoman from illinois i appreciate her participating in todays special order"], [4.879715728711709e-11, 4.879715728711709e-11, 0, "tonight i want to spend this special order hour talking about two primary topics one closely related to the second that first topic is trying to eliminate waste fraud and abuse in the federal government and in federal spending i want to start out by alerting members to a brief history lesson on where congressional overspending has gone over the last 30 years in fact going back to 1970 members can see the line below the baseline here is the amount of money that the congress has spent money that it did not have this is deficit quantity spending back in 1970 we began a dangerous habit and trend going down here in 1976 here we were at almost 100 billion in deficits we continued to drop and drop spending more and more without regard to the cash that was on hand for the federal government we can see here in 1982 and 1986 the height of democrat control of congress was when we were on a virtually spending spree here in washington then when deficits got at about their worst down in this area that is about the point in time that the american people changed their mind this is when the republican revolution took place americans were fed up with a congress that year after year after year from 1970 right on up to the 19921993 fiscal years had spent more money than it had on hand in fact borrowing from my children and the children of every other american in order to appease the spending appetite and habits of washington that ended at about this point here we can see the line beginning to go up when a new idea a new party was put in charge with majority status in congress members can see when we took over that the deficit spending began to ease that we began to start moving toward a goal of spending the dollars that we actually had on hand to run the legitimate purposes of the federal government back there in 1994 when republicans took over the congress they promised in a great contract with america that we would balance the budget by the year 2002 well we underpromised and overdelivered because right here in 1998 was the first year in 30 years that the expenditures came above the line here of our baseline spending in other words we began to start saving money this little purple section here represents a cash surplus that we began to accumulate here in washington d c it is this surplus that has allowed us to do a number of things one it has allowed us to stop borrowing the money i would remind my colleagues when we start borrowing money spending more money than the congress actually has to spend we borrow it from somewhere and the fund of preference for many many years has been the social security system in fact this congress and the white house has raided the social security trust fund the social security system to the tune of about 638 billion over a little bit shorter of a time frame this goes back to 1984 once again we can take a look at where we were when we came here and president clinton continued and this was the year of the tax increase and the year that the congress spent quite a lot of money at the presidents insistence again in 1998 this congress got serious about stopping the raid on social security members can see the dramatic decrease this is not the final column of the graph here this is an actual decrease in the propensity of congress to borrow from the social security system this is an effort to stop the raid on social security members can see that that does end right here this year in 1999 the first year we stopped raiding the social security system in order to pay for government that is a trend we want to see continue in fact we want to see this line continue to go down further and build greater surpluses including the social security fund in order to accomplish that we have to exercise some fiscal discipline right now this year in congress that is the debate that is taking place presently between the white house and the congress here is one of the suggestions we came up with as a republican majority to avoid raiding social security as the president has proposed to do we have proposed that of the increase in spending that we have budgeted for this year that we just tighten our belt a little bit for every dollar in federal spending we are asking the federal government to come up the federal bureaucrats and the federal agencies to come up with one cent in savings in efficiency savings in order to help rescue the social security fund and to stop borrowing from the social security system we want to stop that raid we think that out of every dollar that is spent in washington we can find that one cent in savings and continue to run the legitimate programs and the legitimate services that are needed and necessary under our federal system and do it in a way that allows us to save social security at the same time that is what that one penny on the dollar represents when we suggested this idea folks over at the white house almost had a heart attack they said one penny on the dollar we cannot possibly come up with one penny on the dollar in savings because that would cripple the federal government finding this one cent in savings therein lies the difference between the republican majority in washington and the liberal democrat leadership that we find down at the white house we believe that the government can do what every american family does every day work a little harder to find that one cent savings to just simply start realizing that we can be more efficient and more effective with a whole assortment of federal programs to find that one cent again it was a little frustrating but not surprising here in washington to hear the various cabinet secretaries say we cannot find that one penny on the dollar all of the federal departments are so efficient so lean so effective so accountable with their dollars that we cannot possibly find the savings necessary to save social security so we as members of congress decided that we would take it upon ourselves to help that is the point of todays special order i appreciate members going through that brief history with me about how it is we came to the position we are in it is a very relevant and important position to consider because at this very moment the impasse in passing a budget hinges on the difference of opinion between this congress and that white house to find that one penny and do it in a way that honors and respects not only the taxpayers of america but the children of america who rely on a sound and credibly run government and certainly the seniors the current retirees who rely on social security there are a number of great examples one of our colleagues who i have been told was planning on joining us here issued a report out of his committee and that report lists assuming i can put my fingers on it lists just agency by agency the savings that can be found here are some good examples here is the gentleman from california who has arrived in his report he e2319 suggested that we could find savings in the department of agriculture he cited examples in the department of defense the department of defense spent nearly 40 billion on programs for 15 overseas telecommunications systems that cannot be fully used because the department failed to obtain proper certifications and approvals from the host nations that is according to a 1999 inspector general report we found savings in the department of education 3 3 in loan guarantees for defaulted student loans according to one general accounting office audit there is more we will talk about more of that today he found savings in the energy department in the health and human services department administration and so on and so forth it is not hard to find savings to find that one penny if you are devoted to rolling up your sleeves and doing the hard work of finding the money it is an important proposition i suggest for this congress and for the white house rather than fighting over the relative merit of saving one penny out of a dollar to save social security we ought to be joining in partnership and rolling up our sleeves together and getting down in the trenches at the department of education in the department of defense over at the department of energy over in health and human services and working together cooperatively to find all the efficiencies and savings that we possibly can to build a credible government for the future security of our children and for our nation i yield to the gentleman from california who has led the house through this investigation of where these funds may be found and pointed not only me but other colleagues in the direction that we ought to look in order to find some of these savings"],

important action in this house of representatives which affect 28 million married working couples who because of their heart pay higher taxes the american people have often told me that they are frustrated they think it is unfair that 21 million married working couples on average pay 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married that really is a fundamental question is it right is it fair that under our tax code 25 million married working couples on average pay 1 400 more now i represent the south side of chicago and the south suburbs in illinois and folks back home they tell me that 1 400 is a years tuition for a nursing student at a community college in illinois it is a washer and a dryer it is several months worth of car payments it is 3 months of day care but it is higher taxes money that is taken from married couples just because they are married that is wrong of course valentines day is today and today is the day that we can celebrate the fact that the house passed h r 6 legislation wiping out the marriage tax penalty for 25 million married working couples let me explain how the marriage tax penalty works if one is single of course they file as a single person but when they get married they file jointly they combine their incomes the way our tax code works is if a couple is a machinist and a schoolteacher with identical incomes say a machinist makes 31 000 if he stays single he pays in the 15 percent tax bracket but if he meets and marries a public school teacher with an identical income of 31 000 their 62 000 combined income pushes them into the 28 percent tax bracket they pay the average tax penalty of almost 1 400 just because they got married right now the tax code discourages marriage by punishing it with financial penalties that is wrong this past week the house passed h r 6 and i want to commend the leadership of the house speaker dennis hastert for moving a standalone clean marriage tax elimination legislation there is no other extraneous provisions there are no excuses like the president used last year when he vetoed our effort to wipe out the marriage tax penalty we deal with one issue that is wiping out the marriage tax penalty for 25 million married working couples i would point out that h r 6 helps married couples in a number of ways if one looks at who pays the marriage tax penalty one half of married couples h346 cop itemize their taxes because they own a home or give money to church or synagogue or charity or have education expenses the other half do not so we help both in the legislation that we passed we double the standard deduction for those who do not itemize for joint filers to twice that of singles and for those who do itemize and of course most middleclass families own their home so they are required to itemize their taxes so we help them by widening the 15 percent bracket so that joint filers can earn twice as much in the 15 percent bracket as a single filer it is fair that way we also help i would point out the working poor with addressing the marriage penalty that is in the eligibility for joint filers for married couples for the earned income credit to help the working poor so we double the standard deduction we widen the 15 percent bracket we address the earned income credit marriage penalty and we help 25 million married working couples by being fair it is time that we make the tax code fair it is time that we make the tax code marriage neutral so that one is not punished when they get married of course i am proud our proposal does not raise taxes on anyone else in order to wipe out the marriage tax penalty so two single people two married people no one pays more taxes than the other it is the fair way to do it and i am proud that 268 members of this house every republican and fortunately 48 democrats broke from their leadership and supported our effort to wipe out the marriage tax penalty that is progress tremendous momentum an overwhelming majority of the house supported our effort to wipe out the marriage tax penalty an issue of fairness for 25 million married working couples i am concerned though i have been told that there are some in the senate who want to load up the marriage tax elimination effort they want to put poison pills and they want to put other extraneous provisions on this bill my hope is we can avoid that my hope is that we can convince the senate to keep it a standalone clean marriage tax elimination bill that is the best approach that way it is fair there are no excuses for the president to veto it this time he said during the state of the union that he thought we should address the marriage tax penalty we want the president to keep his word we want to give the president the opportunity to do that by sending him a standalone bill there is no need for partisan politics we had a bipartisan vote when this legislation passed the house this past week and what better gift to give 25 million married working couples on this valentines day then enactment into law the marriage tax penalty act"], [7.899533249755564e-10, 7.899533249755564e-10, 0, "i thank the gentleman for yielding time to me i rise in strong support of

and had the privilege of serving here for the last 42 years have been asked in town meetings and senior citizens centers union halls vfws and other public forums when is washington going to stop dipping into when is washington going to stop raiding the social security trust fund to spend social security on other things other than social security today we are going to pass legislation that will do that that will stop the raid on social security let us review the history here for over 30 years now washington has been dipping into the s6cial security fund regardless of the rhetoric on the other side where they say it has not it has gone on back when president johnson and the democratcontrolled congress 30 years ago began raiding the social security trust fund they have run up quite a bill according to the social security trustees appointed by president clinton the social security trust fund has been raided by more than 730 billion over the last 30 years i have a check here written on the social security trust fund it is a blank check washington for the last 30 years has used the social security trust fund as a slush fund and as a blank check to pay for other programs this walls off the social security trust fund and puts a stop for those who want to raid it we set aside those funds for social security and for medicare i believe that is an important first step setting aside 100 percent of social security and locking it away before we consider any other reforms or changes to social security let us lock it away first that is an important first step we can use those funds to strengthen medicare and social security this legislation accomplishes this goal i would like to point out of course that not only is the social security and medicare safe deposit box a centerpiece of this years balanced budget but there is a big difference between the clintongore democratic budget and the republican budget the republican budget sets aside 100 percent of social security for social security the 137 billion social security surplus this year will go to social security if we compare that with the clintongore democrat budget that only uses 62 percent of social security for social security and the clintongore democrat budget spends 52 billion of social security money on other things all good programs education defense things like that but the clintongore democrat budget raids the social security trust fund this lockbox will prevent the clintongore raid on social security i would also point out that the social security and medicare safe deposit box sets aside 1 8 trillion the president talks about 62 percent sixtytwo percent is 1 3 billion over the next 10 years clintongore will raid the social security trust fund by 12 billion let us put a stop to it"],

that is the folks back home want us to come here republicans and democrats and work together to find solutions to the challenges that we face that is why i am so proud that over the last 5 years we have done so many things we were told we could not do we balanced the budget for the first time in 28 years we gave a middleclass tax cut for the first time in 16 years we reformed our welfare system for the first time in a generation and a great accomplishment just this past year was we stopped the raid on social security for the first time in 30 years that is progress on our agenda and we are continuing to move forward to find better ways to help find solutions our agenda is pretty simple paying down the public national debt saving social security and medicare helping our local schools and we also want to bring fairness to the tax code that is one of the issues i want to talk about today because i believe that as we work to bring fairness to the tax code particularly to middleclass working families that we should focus first on the most unfair consequence of our current complicated tax code and that is the marriage tax penalty which is suffered by almost 21 million married working couples let me explain what the marriage tax penalty is under our current tax code if they are married both husband and wife are working they pay more in taxes than they do if they stay single let me give this example a marriage tax penalty example a machinist and a schoolteacher middleclass working folks in joliet illinois with a combined income of 63 000 paymore and here is how they do it if they have a machinist making 31 500 he is in the 15 percent tax bracket if he marries a schoolteacher with an identical income of 31 500 under our tax code they file jointly their combined income of 63 000 pushes them into the 28 percent tax bracket and for this machinist and schoolteacher they pay the average marriage tax penalty of almost 1 400 more just because they are married under our tax code now if they chose to live together instead of getting married they would have saved that 1 400 our tax code punishes them if they choose to get married that is just wrong it is a pretty fair question is it right is it fair that under our tax code this machinist and schoolteacher in joliet illinois pay more in higher taxes let me give my colleagues another example here of two schoolteachers also of joliet illinois michelle and shad hallihan they were just married in the last couple of years a wonderful young couple i have had a chance to sit down and talk with them and of course i have a nice wedding photo the point is that shad has taught a little longer than michelle and he makes 38 000 a year his wife michelle makes 23 500 because they chose to get married to live together in holy matrimony they suffer the marriage tax penalty because their combined income when they file jointly pushes them into the 28 percent tax bracket for them for michelle and shad hallihan in joliet illinois two schoolteachers they pay almost a thousand dollars more michelle has pointed out to me since they have just had a baby that is almost 3 000 diapers that 1 000 of marriage tax penalty would pay for in that family if they were allowed to keep it now the republicans in this congress believe that eliminating the marriage tax penalty should be a priority and we believe that in this era of budget surpluses when the federal government is taking in more than we have been spending that we should give some of it back we want to focus that on bringing fairness to the tax code this past year we sent to the president legislation that would have wiped out the marriage tax penalty for people like michelle and shad hallihan unfortunately the president and vice president gore chose to veto that legislation because they wanted to spend the money on new government programs my colleagues should it not be a priority to help people like michelle and shad hallihan married

to discuss eliminating the marriage tax penalty that is good news because it is time to make it a bipartisan effort and while the president and vice president gore vetoed the legislation last year he

they do in the courtroom and that is a taxpayer is innocent until proven guilty those are real accomplishments but we continue to face challenges in this congress and because this congress held the presidents feet to the fire we balanced the budget and now we are collecting more in taxes than we are spending and the question is today what do we do with that extra tax money what do wedo with that 2 3 trillion surplus of extra tax revenue i believe its pretty clear what the first priority is and i think we all agree we want to save social security we want to save social security first and i want to point out that last fall this house of representatives passed the 9010 plan which would have set aside 90 percent of the budget surplus the extra tax revenue to save social security two weeks ago in this very room the president said we now only need 62 percent well we agree we want to make the first priority and we certainly agree that at least 62 percent of the surplus tax revenue should be reserved for saving social security the question is what do we do with the rest some say particularly bill clinton we should save social security and spend the rest on new big government programs now i disagree i believe we should save social security and give the rest back in tax relief the question is it is simple whose money is it in the first place if my colleagues go to a restaurant and they pay too much they overpay their bill the restaurant refunds their money they do not keep it and spend it on something else well clearly in this case the government is collecting too much well let us give it back the question is do we want to save social security and create newgovernment programs and spend the rest of the surplus or do we want to give it back by saving social security and eliminating the marriage tax penalty and rewarding retirement savings tax foundation says today that the tax burden is pretty high in fact for the average family in illinois 40 percent of the average familys income in illinois now goes to washington and springfield and local taxing bodies at every level in fact since bill clinton was elected in 1992 the total amount of tax revenue collected has gone up 63 percent since 1992 clearly taxes are too high we can help working taxpayers we can help working taxpayers we can help working families let us save social security and cut taxes let us save social security and eliminate the marriage tax penalty let us save social security and reward savings for retirement some say we cannot but i believe we can just as we balanced the budget for the first time in 28 years it is because we also cut taxes for the first time in 16 years reformed welfare for the first time in a generation and tamed the irs for the first time ever we can also save social security and lower taxes for working families and bring that tax burden down for the first time in a long time let us save social security let us cut taxes let us eliminate the marriage tax

it is true that we did not make this deadline this year however it is also true that keeping our fiscal house in order does take a little longer than the freewheeling bigspending days of the past because we must ensure that all funding is spent efficiently and where it is needed the most the conference report before us this afternoon not only holds the line on the presidents additional spending requests but also responsibly funds areas important to every american citizen and protects the american people from waste fraud and abuse across the entire federal government earlier this year the republican congress made a commitment to end the 30year raid on social security and according to the congressional budget office we have now completed that task the president began the budget negotiations by taking a large step toward our position on the social security issue and joined us in locking away every penny of social security we worked with him in a bipartisan fashion to protect retirement security we were determined to protect american seniors and this congress and its leadership denied any piece of legislation on the house floor that spent one penny of it to achieve our goal of protecting american seniors and responsibly funding important programs we are including in this bill a plan to direct every federal agency to reduce spending by less than onehalf of one percent 38 percent of 1 percent by routing out waste fraud and abuse surely the government can save less than about half a penny out of every dollar this republican congress is simply asking those who run federal agencies to make fiscally responsible budgeting decisions with the money taxed out of our paychecks we all know the agency directors and executives know where the waste is and i am relatively certain they will be able to weed out at least that much in savings with this sensible plan in addition to meeting the fiscally responsible objectives this conference report also ensures that our principles of quality and flexibility in the funding for teachers have been met in the laborhhs section of the bill this congress ensures that funding may no longer be used to hire unqualified teachers provides that schools will have more flexibility in using their funding for improving the qualityof uncertified teachers and increases the amount of funding that may used for professional training for teachers the administration pushed for a onesizefitsall mandate in which washington controlled the 100 000 new teachers program not every district needs new teachers some need bettertrained teachers other districts need books hightech equipment and updated math and reading programs i think it is foolish for the washington bureaucracy to tell every school district in america that washington knows best how to spend tax dollars to educate our children the debate in washington is not only about money it is also about how that money should be spent this bill moves us closer to the right balance of education funding by providing additional funds for americas students through programs like pell grants and special education while lowering the bureaucratic burden imposed by washington through programs like goals 2000 the commerce justice state section of the conference report maintains our commitment to enhancing local law enforcement without involving washington bureaucrats we also provide funding for 1 000 new border patrol agents funds for increased criminal and illegal alien detention and the resources necessary to end the severe naturalization backlog at the ins the district of columbia continues to receive the high level of funding provided in each round of this process the conference report paves the way for dramatic improvement in the education of washingtons children the safety of our streets and the management of our nations capital h r 3194 also brokers a responsible compromise on the environment in the interior appropriations section of this conference report republicans rejected attempts to impose the restrictions of the kyoto global warming regime on americans without senate consideration of the treaty nevertheless the bill maintains our high environmental standards and ensures our air and water will be cleaned into the next millennium while i will permit the chairman of the committee on appropriations to describe fully all the contents of the appropriations bill i did want to note the inclusion of the satellite copyright legislation about which many of our constituents have expressed concerns during the past

on a tuesday night to talk about an issue that i talk about as often as possible and that is the problem that we have in our country and also in dealing in congress with the issue of illegal narcotics and the tremendous impact that illegal narcotics are having on our young people tonight i am going to focus a little bit on some of the issues that relate to the question of the district of columbias appropriation and some specific measures that are in the appropriations bill that deal with the district of columbia i also intend to talk a bit about the general war on drugs and review a little bit how we got ourselves into that situation time permitting i also hope to talk some about colombia and the administrations potential request which certainly will dramatically affect our spending as soon as we finish with the problems we have now in funding the fiscal year 19992000 requirements we are expecting a rather substantial request to come in by the administration and we will talk about that and colombia and how we got ourselves into that particular dilemma and i will also talk a bit about the situation in panama that whole region that has been such an active area as far as illegal narcotics trafficking and disruption in general for the entire hemisphere so those are a few subjects and then time permitting i will get into some of the updates that i usually try to do on problems relating to illegal narcotics and how they affect all our communities across the land the first thing that i want to talk about tonight is something that i hear repeatedly over and over that the war on drugs has failed that indeed we have lost the war on drugs i have some very good friends even on the conservative side and i noticed one of the columnists who is very conservative in his opinion this past week came out and said why not legalize narcotics that the war on drugs is a failure i always try to relate my topic of discussion to the facts and deal with the facts and statistics information that we have had presented to us in the subcommittee which i chair which is the subcommittee on criminal justice drug policy and human resources of the committee on government reform we have had many many hearings since i have taken that subcommittee h10852 cc over the beginning of the year dealing with illegal narcotics and we have looked at the question of whether or not the war on drugs is indeed a failure we have looked at the question of legalization in fact we probably conducted the first hearing the only hearing to date on the question of legalization and decriminalization of drug penalties we have talked in our subcommittee and held hearings on the problems wvith mexico with colombia with some of our treatment programs and most recently the education program that this congress has funded to the tune of a billion dollars over the next 5 years getting an update on that first years progress in that program additionally the southwest border and the billions of dollars we spent in federal resources at that border in trying to contain not only illegal narcotics but illegal immigration and trafficking illegal commerce across our borders so we have covered the gamut of this topic we have heard from gao dea department of justice department of defense department of state many many agencies of federal government and rely on their facts and support and statistics in our reports basically i came to the conclusion and i think my colleagues would too if they spent time in those hearings as we have done we came to the conclusion that in fact the war on drugs did not fail what happened was we had an end of the war on drugs in 1993 with the clinz ton administration which took over not only the executive branch of government which executes the law but also had very substantial majorities in both the house of representatives and also the other body the united states senate they controlled and dominated the agenda the legislative agenda and the executive and administrative operations of this government for over 2 years from 1993 through 1995 i have had these charts out before and i will refer to them once again foremost in our responsibility as a federal government are our programs to stop illegal narcotics at their squrce outside the country now state and local governments law enforcement folks cannot do that but it certainly must be done and whether we legalize what are now illegal narcotics or not we would still have a fundamental responsibility in keeping what would be an illegal commodity coming into the united states in this case it happens to be primarily heroin cocaine and methamphetamines the first thing that the clinton administration did after completely decimating the drug czars office and that was the beginning of the ending of the war on drugs they took the drug czars office down from a staffing level of over 120 to some less than 2 dozen personnel that was the first cut slash burn that ended the war on drugs"],

instructions when the republican party became the majority party in 1995 congress began enacting a series of commonsense reforms these reforms have changed the way the federal government operates and have saved billions of taxpayer dollars one of the first things congress did was apply all laws that it passes to itself previously congress would pass burdensome regulations on the private sector but exclude itself from compliance to these laws in 1995 congress passed the paperwork reduction act to identify and reduce burdensome federal paperwork requirements on the private sector especially small businesses continuing toward a goal of creating a 21st century government in 1996 congress passed the federal acquisition reform act to reduce bureaucratic requirements within the federal procurement system we have all heard examples of inflated prices like the 187 screw sets purchased by the government for 75 60 each more often than not such fleecing of taxpayer dollars is due to the cumbersome federal procurement system not fraud the federal acquisition reform act has streamlined the process of doing business with the federal government by significantly reducing such waste in 1997 congress passed the travel and transportation reform act legislation to remedy poor management of the federal governments massive travel expenditures this bill is now law and has led to a concerted effort by federal managers to improve the federal travel efficiency and cost effectiveness the congressional budget office estimates savings of 80 million per year with the passage last year of the presidential and executive office financial accountability act congress created a chief financial officer for the white house this nonpartisan cfo position in the executive office of the president will facilitate prevention and early detection of waste fraud and abuse accordingly the bill promotes efficiency and cost reductions within the white house today congress takes another step toward increasing efficiency and saving taxpayer dollars with consideration of the government waste corrections act in private industry companies routinely audit themselves to determine if they have overpaid vendors and suppliers overpayments are a fact of life for businesses government entities and even our own households overpayments become more likely with larger volumes of payments overpayments occur for a variety of reasons including duplicate payments pricing errors and missed discounts or rebates on average private industry recovers 1 million for each 1 billion that is audited overpayments at the federal level are an especially serious problem when considering the size and complexity of federal operations as well as the widespread financial management weaknesses of the federal government recovery auditing and activity already occurs in limited areas of the federal government recovery audits of the department of defense alone have identified errors averaging 4 percent of federal payments audited or 4 million out of every 1 billion recovery efforts throughout the entire federal government could save billions of dollars more with this in mind the government waste corrections act requires federal agencies to perform audits if their direct purchases for goods and services total 500 million or more per fiscal year agencies that must undertake recovery auditing would also be required to institute a management improvement program to address underlying problems of their payment systems the government waste corrections act is a commonsense government reform that incorporates

diabetes the epidemic of our time the impact diabetes has on the health of our population on the national budget is staggering every year diabetes causes about 24 000 more people to lose their sight 28 000 more people to undergo dialysis or transplantation for kidney failure and 77 000 more people to lose their lives from heart disease these diabetesrelated side effects in combination shorten life expectancy by an estimated 15 years in the year 1999 approximately 800 000 people will be diagnosed with diabetes and the disease will contribute to almost 200 000 deaths in the united states the number of americans with diabetes has increased nearly 700 percent in the last 40 years again a primary reason that the cdc has called it the epidemic of our time the public and private costs of diabetes are enormous an estimated 105 billion annually including over 40 billion a year in federal dollars more then 1 out of every 10 health care dollars in the unitedstates and about 1 out of 4 medicare dollars is spent on diabetes care in new york state almost 600 000 people and 10 of our seniors have been diagnosed with diabetes at an annual public and private cost of about 8 billion diabetes kills one american every 3 minutes and a new case of diabetes is diagnosed in the united states every 40 seconds and unfortunately an estimated 52 million americans have diabetes right now and do not even know it but new research is filled with promise the diabetes research working group created by congress in 1997 has developed a comprehensive plan for future research that would cost 827 million next year congress mandated this study congress has received its mandated report and yet last year we gave 448 million about half of what is called for only 3 percent of the total nih budget for diabetes that is simply 28 per patient that is not enough yet every day research and new technologies are improving diabetes diagnosis and treatment for example current diagnostic methods cannot always detect adult onset diabetes at the earliest stage of the disease but a new technology has been developed that will diagnose adult onset diabetes as much as 5 years earlier than any current method by scanning the eye retina with low intensity florescent light an early diagnosis can significantly reduce the risk of serious complications we need to increase research for diagnosis blood testing is also becoming less obtrusive a continuous glucose monitoring system recently approved by the fda continuously and automatically monitors glucose levels underneath the skin future generations of this device may permit the patient to monitor blood levels and connect to an insulin pump for seamless care a glucowatch a device worn like a wristwatch will test blood levels easily and painlessly this device which is pending fda approval is as successful at blood testing as conventional methods that require pricking the finger multiple times every day and causes only a slight tingling sensation we need to increase research for blood monitoring we also must increase research for treatment for example we are at the brink of developing an ability to inhale insulin rather than inject it into the body multiple times per day another burden for people with diabetes is the need to inject themselves with insulin several new drugs taken orally may reduce the need to take insulin injections one class of drugs called insulin sensitizers helps to lower blood glucose primarily by reducing insulin resistance in muscles other groups of drugs work by suppressing glucose production from the liver increasing insulin production by the pancreas or decreasing sugar absorption from the intestine for those who will still need insulin a power is being developed that can be inhaled so that injections might not be necessary we need to increase research for treatment in juvenile diabetes type 1 insulinroducing cells called islets are destroyed making daily insulin injections necessary the juvenile diabetes foundation jdf has established three centers for islet transportation which will attempt to transplant healthy islets to cure juvenile diabetes and find new ways to prevent transplant rejection and other dangerous sideeffects the nih and the jdf are also developing new ways to manipulate the immune system by inhibiting harmful immune responses while keeping protective ones intact we need to increase research for cures ultimately genetics may hold the key to a cure the american diabetes association has initiated the genetics of noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus gennid study in order to maximize the rapid identification of the gene or genes involved in adultonset diabetes this study has established a national database and cellbank to store information and specimens from families with long histories of the disease the human genome project which is currently mapping the entire human genetic structure may also provide significant clues to the nature of diabetes again we need to increase research for treatment but the fight goes on we must increase support and research for diabetes for diagnosis for monitoring for treatment and

american people while the republican congress was blamed for the shutdowns i believe we were all responsible for this disgraceful exhibition of failed governance the house the senate republicans democrats and the president before us today is a message to the american people an affirmation if you will in the h3134 co form of an amendment which states that we the congress will not forsake the american peoples tust to deliver essential government services and allow for another shameful govemnment shutdown in this fiscal cycle we will achieve this by voting for my amendment to provide 100 percent of a fiscal years spending levels to continue through the end of the next fiscal year in the absence of a regularly passed appropriations bill or a continuing resolution since my election to

we are now finishing i am very proud of the fact that the city of houston as my colleague says the fourth largest city in the country just does not do things like everybody else does we are a major city and a great city in this country because we do not just do it the same way we are the city that built the astrodome we are the city that has a port that is off the shores of texas and the second largest port in the nation we are a city that does not say that they are not a great city unless they have rail and the reason is and i might point out to my colleagues if they had been involved in all the rail systems as i have and the chairman has for over 15 years they would understand why l a is getting out of the rail business because it is a boondoggle and a black hole for a city that is spread out like l a i might say that houston has stepped outside of the box and developed a regional bus plan that is the model for major cities in america this bill has over 20 million in it finishing the last part of 500 million in building one of the best bus systems in the world because we did not grab ahold of the notion that in order to be a great city they have to have a rail system every line that the gentleman from texas talked about every one of those lines loses huge amounts of money and takes money away from mobility systems for those cities but they do get to take a picture of a nice train and put it in their brochures and it makes everybody feel good the problem here in this particular dispute is that the houston metro following the design of many other cities and the gentleman says no elections were held in those other cities it is because the other cities did not pay attention to the voters in those cities and developed the same strategy that is going on here in houston they developed the strategy of starting a little starter line and when it does not make money and becomes a huge hole for transit funds they go to the people and say we made this great investment but it does not work only because we do not have this other line and when that does not work they say well we are just going to build another line and then they wake up and develop what dallas now has dallas now has a rail line but now has surpassed houston in congestion because dallas is more concentrated on rail than they are for the mobility in dallas i do not want to see that happen in houston it is my responsibility as a member of this committee to make sure that the full funding grant by the fta the 500 million is finished what houston metro wanted to do is take money from the regional bus plan from our regional mobility plan and move it to a rail line that makes no sense whatsoever transportationwise my good colleague and friend the gentlewoman from texas says no criticism there is all kinds of criticism including houston metros own study that says this does not help mobility this does not help transportation and this does not help the environment this is an economic development project to build a signature main street in houston texas a very worthwhile project but this is not a transit system this will not carry anybody this will not get anybody off our freeways this will not get bubba i say to the gentleman from texas out of his pickup and put him on a rail system this is an economic development project my position is if they are going to build a huge rail system in the houston region then the people of the houston region ought to vote on it and decide whether they want a rail system or not instead of doing the back doorway that was done in dallas that was done in portland that was done in miami that was done in many other cities that i described there is no transit benefit here major transportation decisions like the proposal to build this system in houston should be decided by the whole community as things stand today houstonians cannot make an informed decision because metro does not have a comprehensive light rail system to take

not support intolerance as my colleagues know a charter is an honorary title congress awards to organizations that serve a charitable patriotic or educational purpose but to me there is nothing charitable or patriotic about intolerance and it is not a value we want our children to learn revoking the charter sends a clear message that congress does not support this value this value of intolerance the supporters of my bill are not saying that the boy scouts are bad we are saying that intolerance is bad i was a girl scout one of my sons was a boy scout and i know the values of scouting and that is why i believe it should be available to all boys the decision handed down by the supreme court last month shocked me but most of all it saddened me yes the boy scouts fought hard

scouts antigay policy is right we believe that choosing to do nothing in response to the courts decision would only compound the injury and would reaffirm the boy scouts message that intolerance is okay as i said the boy scouts fought hard to win their right to discriminate while they may have won this right we strongly feel the government should not be a participant in any policy that promotes discrimination or intolerance i truly believe that when brave people step up and say intolerance is wrong we will and can make a difference one of those brave people is stephen cozza a teenager from my hometown of petaluma california who founded boy scouts for all which is a national campaign to change the boy scouts antigay policy to date stephen cozza and his father scot cozza have gotten more than 51 000 signatures on a nationwide petition supporting the change in the boy scout policy and making scouting inclusive for all boys as members of congress we also have a part to play we have an opportunity an opportunity to let the boy scouts of america know that we do not accept their exclusionary and intolerant policy i dread the implication and the repercussions should congress choose not to act if both the court and congress convey the message that discrimination is okay i fear we encourage other organizations to discriminate as well we are halfway through the first year of the new millennium and we are still debating the pros and cons of discrimination did we not learn anything from the last century all of our children need a tolerant environment in which to grow and learn

had been sent to marylands maximum security prison he was released because the he was not receiving individualized counseling washington post sept 16 1999 b7 according to the article the judges view is that the purpose of the juvenile justice system is to rehabilitate rather than punish young offenders the teenager in questionwhose identity has been protected by the waywas one of six teenagers who in march of last year lured a 15yearold girl from a bus stop to a vacant apartment where they took turns raping sodomizing and beating her for three hours three teenagers who participated in the

proud of and it honors the contributions of those very brave space explorers the apollo astronauts who helped humanity to achieve the dream of finally setting foot on the moon it is hard to believe that more than 3 decades have passed since neil armstrong and buzz aldrin first stepped out onto the lunar surface while mike collins orbited overhead their accomplishments and those of the apollo astronauts who followed them made all of us proud to be americans and so it is fitting that we honor them with this award it is also fitting that we honor the brave astronauts who preceded them in the missions that helped prepare for that first moon landing in that process we especially need to remember the three heroes virgil gus grissom edward white and roger chaffee who lost their lives in the tragic apollo 1 fire back in 1967 they made the ultimate sacrifice to help push back the frontier and i am glad that this bill recognizes their contributions some day in the nottoodistant future i
