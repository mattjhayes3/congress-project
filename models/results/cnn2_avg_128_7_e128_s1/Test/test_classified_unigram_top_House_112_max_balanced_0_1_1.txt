build strategy thats what americans want from congress they want us to invest in education invest in research and invest in innovation so that america can remain a leader in the global economy they want us to invest in infrastructure build bridges highways clean energy and cut our dependence on foreign oil because when we make it in america thats when america will make it americans can make it cut yes what we ought to cut are the republican giveaways to the big oil companies to the wall street barons to the hedge fund managers who enjoy massive tax breaks thats where the cuts ought to be they ought to be cut out and what of this legislation thats before us we ought to vote no cut what doesnt create jobs for middle class families like republican giveaways to big oil companies and save what actually works like innovation to jumpstart new industries and education to help middle class people get good jobs i therefore rise in strong opposition to h r 2560 the cut cap and balance act this bill is an extreme version of the republican budget plan that would make permanent the dangerous budgetary and constitutional measures that would destroy medicare and medicaid and reduce social security benefits for those who need them the most the bill would also handicap the governments ability to respond to economic downturns and create jobs and it fails to address some of the real drivers our debttax breaks for corporations and the rich and runaway pentagon spending including our misadventures in iraq and afghanistan this legislation is an affront to the very principles of this nation in 1961 president john f kennedy in his inaugural address said if a free society cannot help the many who are poor it cannot save the few who are rich unfortunately it seems that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have no regard for this fundamental american value as the bill they have brought to the floor today attempts to balance the budget on the backs of those with less for the benefit of those with more it attempts to balance the budget on the backs of seniors by taking away their medicare benefits it attempts to balance the budget on the backs of the disabled by taking away their social security benefits it attempts to balance the budget on the backs of lowincome americans by taking away their medicaid and who stands to gain from taking away medicare medicaid and social security benefits special interests and the rich in addition to taking away medicare medicaid and social security benefits h r 2560 would also subvert the federal governments ability to respond to downturns in the economy or special needs including a possible national security crisis during inevitable cyclical downturns it will be necessary to raise the debt limit to stimulate growth by cutting taxes and providing unemployment benefits to help people get back on their feet if theyre laid off among several proven effective measures furthermore in the event of a security threat we have an obligation to act this bill including the proposed balanced budget constitutional amendment would make it nearly impossible to respond to any economic or security crisis at the root of all of this is a system of misguided priorities my republican colleagues have determined that in order to balance the budget we should prioritize cutting medicare medicaid and social security benefits instead of addressing what got us into this current deficita porous lopsided tax code designed to make the rich richer and two unnecessary wars one of which we continue to wage this bill does nothing to end the tax breaks we currently provide for millionaires and billionaires hedge fund managers and oil companies nor does it address runaway pentagon spending based on cbos most conservative estimates the dod alone is projected to spend nearly 300 billion on the afghan and iraqi wars from 2012 through 2015 and estimates by harvard researchers which take into account longterm costs like caring for our veterans put the total cost of these wars in the trillions rather than ending tax breaks for corporations and millionaires and billionaires and bringing our troops home from afghanistan my friends on the other side of aisle want to cut medicare medicaid and social security benefits for those americans who need them i urge my colleagues to see this charade for what it isan attempt to balance the

immediate response to the ongoing crisis of poverty in our nation the census numbers released yesterday underscore the urgent need to act boldly and to create jobs in this country to protect our safety net and to target resources where they are neededbasically to communities of color lowincome communities those communities rural areas who were hit hardest by the economic downturn its really beyond shameful that over 45 million americans including over 16 million children are living in poverty in the wealthiest nation in the world the data also shows a wide racial disparity with the poverty rates for whites standing at 9 8 percent while the rates for african americans and hispanics remain unacceptably high at 27 6 percent and 25 3 percent respectively in 2005 i founded the congressional out of poverty caucus because of the rising tide of poverty some of us saw this unfortunate day coming that was beginning under the failed policies of the previous administration of course we also know the terrible economic impact of the massive financial crisis that they left us on their way out of office with the swift efforts of president obama and congressional democrats we are finally beginning to dig ourselves out of the hole that was left by the bush administration and slowly moving the poverty rate in the right direction we must do more and we can do more one of the most critical responsibilities we have as a government is to promote and enact policies that keep our middle class strong and provide opportunities and a safety net for those striving and fighting to become middle class and to get into the ranks of the middle class to enhance their quality of life but far too many americans are continuing to suffer joblessness and have dropped out of the middle class and into poverty because of this republican donothing congress republicans in congress have continually blocked efforts to extend and expand vital safety net programs which safeguard millions of american families and children who face stark realities of unemployment hunger and homelessness further their continued blocking of critical federal support to our states and localities has caused widespread layoffs of dedicated public servants like teachers police officers and firefighters in communities all across the country this attack on our countrys public servants has had a particularly hard impact on communities of color and on women across the country i just have to tell you african americans and women have long found job opportunities in the public sector in public employment african americans in particular often found work with the city or the state because of racial bias and barriers and obstacles in the private sector the american people know that you cant have it both ways government spending cannot kill jobs on one hand when spent on hiring teachers and police officers and create jobs on the other hand and those services are desperately needed throughout our country we need more police officers on the street my colleagues on the other side of the aisle must begin to accept the reality of history federal investments in our nations infrastructure in our schools and in programs that help struggling families are critical to boosting our economy and spurring our economic recovery tax cuts for millionaires dont pay for themselves they create massive deficits and weaken our country markets dont regulate themselves deregulation allows rampant fraud and creates massive bubbles that inevitably burst and threaten our entire economy we need a balanced approach that ensures that every american pays their fair share and is invested in a united and prosperous future for all americans of every background we need a balanced approach that ensures that millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share so that we can reignite the american dream for all how this nation treats the least of these is not just a measure of our nations moral priorities but it will directly impact whether the american dream survives and thrives for all let us not forget that our greatest strength is the freedom and opportunity that our democracy created to allow us to work together to build the largest and most prosperous middle class the world has ever known but this means that we must reduce and we must eliminate poverty and i hope in the few days that were left that this congress will come together and figure out a way to pass the presidents american jobs act because in that legislation we have critical investment to rehire our police officers teachers

today to continue talking about the crisis of rising poverty devastating families in every single congressional district all across our country i also rise today to recognize linda lee and geraldine matthew these two extraordinary women are among a group of farmworkers who spent their lives working in the swampy fields bordering lake apopka in florida their backbreaking work helped to provide the bulk of the winter season produce on the eastern seaboard in the early 1990s a settlement was negotiated with the large farming corporations where 20 000 acres of land were sold for roughly 100 million a negligible amount of 200 000 was allocated for the 2 500 farmworkers and most were simply given pink slips despite decades of service on the farm for years these workers were exposed to a chemical mixture of carcinogens and other contaminants as planes cropdusted the fields now these workers are suffering from an array of diseases that have been linked to longterm pesticide exposure their children suffer from defects cause by prenatal exposure to harmful contaminants these women have worked for over a decade to bring attention to their cause while many of their former colleagues unfortunately have passed away although these women are desperately seeking some relief and good health what they ask for more than anything else is their dignity dignity is the contribution of their community to feeding this nation and the sacrifices they made in doing so i would therefore offer my profound and earnest gratitude to these incredible women to their community and to farmworkers across the country for theirs truly are the hands that feed us now more than ever we need to redouble our efforts to reward hard work we must work to be sure that americans who work all of their lives have something to show for it this does not just affect linda lee or geraldine matthew we cannot ignore the fact that millions of americans have seen their retirement savings decimated their pensions shortchanged and their wages stagnant or falling even in the face of a rising tide of poverty and an economy with high unemployment the tea partyled republicans continue their efforts to slash programs which protect the health and wellbeing of millions of lowincome and working poor families in the coming weeks and months we will begin to see the impact of the quite frankly immoral cuts to vital unemployment benefit extensions as thousands of people thousands of people across our country who are struggling to find a job will be thrown off of unemployment benefits thrown off kicked off the rolls some of them may be lucky enough to find work but far too many will be suddenly cut off with nearly nothing nothing to keep them from falling behind into poverty they will have been left out and left behind we may disagree on how to help families in need and workers who are struggling find work access needed health services or feed their children but we can all agree that leaving struggling families completely cut off of unemployment insurance with nowhere to turn for help is not the american way when republican politicians protect tax cuts for millionaires we must be very adamant about protecting the working poor when tea party republicans fight to protect tax writeoffs for corporations and big oil we must fight to protect hardworking americans when republican tea party members continued to expend their energy protecting the dividend gains on investments we must fight to protect linda lee and geraldine matthew women who have worked their entire lives and are left with nothing to show for it unfortunately there are some who continue to support policies for the 1 percent where profits rather than people matter we need a jobs bill for those who are desperately in need of a job and we need to help with their support for themselves and their families so we do need a strong safety net to act as a bridge over these troubled economic times its critical to reaffirm that the needs and the aspirations of the poor and the working poor are really important and critical for us to address where they too are aspiring to be part of the middle class

great number of hours today in this chamber there has been a great debate on whether or not to repeal the affordable care act when we know fully that the chances are slim to move forward and the measure would not be signed into law is it political posturing i believe it is of a grand style theres a pattern being established here theres been an attackoutright attackon social security attempts to privatize the system its been under attack for the last 76 years its been the underpinning that provides stability for working families across this great nation it has been a security piece that has enabled many to have at least assurances that there would be some support in family budgets as they move month to month we know that that measure social security has been dealing with its enemies for a long timesince before it was made a law likewise medicare which came to us in the midsixties enabled our senior community to have its health care needs met provided predictability and stability for retired households enabled people to enjoy a quality of life a better quality of health care we know that before medicare many of those who had retired expected to see their economic security dip south because of the expected cost of providing health care when they perhaps could not get that coverage in an insurance context so medicare as we know it today would be undone by the republican majority in this house they would prefer to privatize social security allow us to reach to the financial sector to perhaps see a repeat of what happened to so many individuals and families out there with this past recession where they saw their lifetime savings wiped away trillions lost in the american economy pain and suffering endured by families across this land theyd rather see a voucher system for medicare handing it over to the insurance companies to leave seniors digging deeper into their pockets so the pattern has been established here and now a repeal of the affordable care act before its full implementation before given a chance as we arrive as the last industrialized nation in the world to provide a universal health care coverage program unacceptable progress is struck a decision is rendered by the highest court in the land a conservativeleaning court before the ink is dry on that decision a move to repeal the court spoke it has spoken to america and said the litmus test for constitutionality was debated and a decision rendered that said yes in fact it meets the constitutionality test and so this evening on the eve of the attempts to repeal the affordable care act as it stands is a very telling moment it is one that suggests to us that there is this outright attempt to undo programs that serve our middle class so very well and without a thriving middle class our nation is not prosperous without that thriving middle class theres not purchasing power strong enough to provide the recovery of our economy without a strengthening of our middle class there is not a confidence in the economy a confidence that is needed so as to grow more customers for our business base and so the affordable care act is offering promise and hope to millions tens of millions of americans across this land whether youre insured underinsured uninsured all categories will see strengthening because of this measure think of it i represent a large proportion of senior citizens who are concerned about their pharmaceutical costs many dealing with that doughnut hole have reached that threshold that requires them to dig into their pockets we close that doughnut hole we make more affordable the prescriptions that are required for people to stay well and in some cases to have the medications that keep them alive we deny that opportunity to our nations seniors we deny the respect that we offer we deny the dignity in the equation that speaks to affordable outcomes for the pharmaceuticals that our senior community requires that doughnut hole would have been closed by 2020 further at the other end of the age spectrum many young adults finding it difficult in this recessionand now the recovery periodto gain a job as they perhaps leave high school or college are given the opportunity with the affordable care act to remain on their familys policy until the age of 26 therein lies a strong benefit for some 6 6 million young adults denied with the repeal measure denying access and affordability to health care situations how many cases of young adults impacted by catastrophic illness or accidents will it require to turn the hearts and the minds in a positive direction that would not forego this opportunity for our nations young adults a strong benefit associated with this package what about those who have a preexisting condition some 17 million children in that category and thats not to account for the many adults who would be denied because of preexisting conditions asthma in children diabetes in our senior community being a woman utilized as a preexisting condition an opportunity to deny coverage and the basic core need that we should consider to be truly american another benefit lost to the greedy notion of repealing success that was achieved in this house and the united states senate and signed into law by this president what about the efforts to deny lifetime benefits as a threshold cutting people off of an insurance coverage at perhaps a very demanding time in their lives games played with people and their lives and their recovery hope pulled from working families across this nation because of an insensitivity of this congress a deplorable situation assistance to our small business community now if we profess our small business community to be the economic engine that is part and parcel of our economic comeback our economic springboard then would we not want to provide assistance in that basic core need area would we not want to allow tax credits to come the way of our small business community many a majority of those businesses will remind all of us as representatives that they want to provide for their employees they want a productive workforce that means a strong and well workforce and so they see it as a strong investment one however that they could not afford in recent years because of the escalating costs 18 percent larger bill than industry and perhaps weaker coverage they wanted that turned around they wanted a smart approach a businesslike approach a sensitive response they got it with the affordable care act progress denied the small business engine weakened by this sort of neglect that could be advanced in this cited pattern of undoing social security privatizing social security changing medicare as we know it forever now repealing the affordable care act we see the pattern we see the gross neglect the disrespect for americas middle class her working families so we go forward and we understand that with the opportunities of an exchange small employers our small business community understands that if theyre unable to enter into an exchange where all the private sector participants agree to play by the rules to sharpen their pencils roll up their sleeves provide the service live within the parameters and allow for the many to enter into a common exchange to provide corresponding benefits think of it if 1 of 10 in that employee firm of 20 were to be impacted with catastrophic illness its devastating an actuarial impact that hits that small business owner hard in the pocketbook because of the premium increase for that 1 person of the 10 you employ if those same 10 employees were allowed to enter the exchange a better outcome a different outcome a stronger outcome for the economic recovery of this nation because the gross majority of jobs being produced in this comeback are being done by our small business community and so you know the formula is quite obvious we want a comeback we want that strongest response here from washington for that kick that we endured from a recession that drained us of 8 2 million jobs the best way to do it first of three principles small business provide for the strengthening of small business which the affordable care act does because that small business community has forever been the pulse of american enterprise secondly invest in that entrepreneur the dreamer the mover the shaker it always stretched us since our days of pioneer spirit with the industrial revolution and the westward movement very familiar to the district i represent which is the donor area to the erie canal in upstate new york in the capital region mohawk valley that pioneer spirit exists in our fabric today its our dna invest in the entrepreneur to be the ideas economy kingpin we rely on these wizards to build us sustain us stretch us empower us and then finally invest in a thriving middle class which the affordable care act does it enables us as a middle class community to be bolstered by the confidence the security the stability that has come with this success story in guaranteeing access and affordability to quality health care that will underscore the value of wellness and not just deal with illness that will put together efforts to cost contain that will bring people into a structured program so that we can monitor their activities and connect them to a system you know youll hear from some on the floor we dont want to pay for this its going to cost us too much were paying today for the neglect for the consequences of a notsoperfect system status quo will not cut it and so we need to go forward with progressive policies with the soundness of reform with the boldness of transition with the confidence we can instill with the progressiveness of policies that we can draft and so it is a sad note here echoed in this chamber that would attempt to unravel dilute destroy deny the promise we can make to america as i look at this effort for a comeback the containment of health care costs is just one of those areas that we need to help control create that better environment in which to grow jobs cultivate a prosperity its important its important for us to understand that it is part of an economic recovery equation but theres also the wisdom of investing in education in higher education again under attack by a system that does not always profess the strength of research and education and patents and discovery we understand that we are in the midst of a global race on innovation clean energy and ideas and high tech to be outstanding competitors to arrive at that race ready to conquer we will need to be strong and fit in order to be the winning agent on that global scene we saw that order of passion we saw that order of investment in the global race on space just decades ago this nation impacted by a sputnik moment dusted off its backside and said never again never again and what was the result together a nation grew in its commitment to winning the global race on space we are going to be that agent that nation that proud people that would stake the american flag on the moon and we won that race because of a commitment because of investment in the soundness of the people of this great country and her business community we embraced research we embraced science we believed in our strength as a people and the confidence exuded was the elixir that brought us to the victory where is that like passion today where is that leadership a rather youthful president that led us in the sixties and challenged us in almost replication today finds us interestingly to be challenged by a rather youthful president asking us to enter into the global sweepstakes committing with passion to the cause and so we need that investment in education in higher education and research just today in schenectady new york in the 21st congressional district of new york that im proud to represent we announced formally the creation of the advanced battery manufacturing center at that facility of ge ceo jeff immelt traveled for the celebration came to town to announce this wonderful wonderful addition that is america at work with her genius activity thats america determined to win the global race on ideas advanced battery manufacturing the battery the linchpin to so much potential out there to grow domestic supplies of energy to grow jobs as we grow our energy future to reduce the gluttonous dependency on fossilbased fuels oftentimes imported from some of the most unfriendly nations to the united states sending hundreds of billions of dollars annually to those foreign treasuries that are then used to train troops to fight against our own daughters and sons on the battlefield unacceptable there is a better way and this congress knows it we invest in jobs we invest in health care we invest in education we invest in research we do it in a way that promises our best attempt as a nation to generations yet unborn someone was there for us and we need to be there for future generations of americans to provide the sort of cuttingedge opportunity that will spell america at her best i look at that opportunity for not only battery manufacturing but nanotechnology and semiconductor signs chip manufacturing the newly designed 20th congressional district in new york that comprises a good portion of the now existing 21st district that i represent is probably one of the most technology investedin congressional districts in the country it is happening because there is this belief in the worker a belief in the entrepreneur a belief in the small business community a belief in the industrial context of the district and knowing full well that americas needsbe they for the environment or energys sake or business creation job creation business opportunityare inspiring this remarkable progress it requires our moving forward with a plan it requires our moving forward academically with the soundness of policy and with the corresponding resource advocacy that will yield lucrative dividends i see it all the time i see it in energyefficiency programs that produce jobs that enable us to capture waste heat that is part of the energy process enabling us to be much more efficient efforts that enable us to create more and more patents in a world that has grown much more competitive much more sophisticated we can ill afford to weaken in our attempts to be the kingmakers of the international economy the old american spirit the history of this nation replete with those rags to riches scenarios that became the reason and the inspiration for the compilation of journeys made by our ancestors to these shores because the opportunity called the american dream became the prize for which they searched i see it in my own roots the proudest label i carry in life is as the grandson of immigrants their journey gave me great opportunity and it gave my family great opportunity those journeys chased after the american dream we need beginning in this house chamber to reignite the american dream to go back to the core essence of who we are as a people to reach into that american heart and soul that has forever relied on its passion that we can achieve because we have opportunity and that we will not deny that opportunity that we will strengthen the boldness of those dreams and enable us to respond to the needs of the moments and the future and to write our legacy as a generation of americans let us not fail in that attempt let us continue to reach deep into that american spirit at a time when we were challenged and our economy was brought to its knees by failed policies that did not manage well that did not provide for the stewardship of our resources and when we tripped and fell let it be known that in the recovery we were stronger than ever before because of that belief that our best days lay ahead of us the belief that those best days were in the future we moved forward and we dug deep into that american spirit to respond with the respect for americas middle class our middle classall of us in that middle classhave always understood if you play hard if you abide by the rules if you roll up your sleeves and do your best you could rightfully anticipate the taste of success that is america in her most shining moments and that is an economy that we can produce it begins with the soundness of a strong and productive workforce that went through training and retraining that got to taste the potential for success by that self discovery that comes with education and to then understand our gifts so that we could share them in the most profound way and then to provide for the wellness of that workforce so it could be most productive so that the conditioning that came with that sort of commitment and that order of respect and that potion of dignity could then allow for us to speak to a nation that was humbled by its own beginnings where the rightful stories of so many who made it their journey were written by a nation that believed in her people so tonight on this eve of an attempt to repeal the affordable care act let us understand that our budget here in washington our actions with legislation our responsiveness to the needs of the american people are an establishment of our prioritiesa prescription of what we see our future to bea reaching into the heart to say that we are a truly caring lot thats what separates us from other nations it is the uniqueness of america and her greatness the affordable care act is a measurement of not only sound policy it is a statement of a compassionate society that understands its not about oneself that its about neighbors that its about community that its about the great society it has been the history through the decades through the vintages of time that has enabled us to reach to the greatness of our government to reach to the soundness of ideas and innovation to respond to the challenges that have enabled us to build upon those who preceded us always anticipating that the next generation would be made stronger we owe it to our children and grandchildren and generations yet unborn let them look at this moment in history american history knowing that america was challenged that she stepped up to the plate and said yes to her people and truly made a difference and allowed people to understand full well that the best days of this great nation

seniors but this week house republicans are proposing to strip seniors of this guaranteed benefit the republican budget proposal dismantles medicare as we know it telling seniors they are going to be on their own to find insurance no matter what the cost or how sick they are and it slashes medicaid coverage for seniors who need longterm care threatening our sickest most frail elderly in nursing homes with no care at all this is absolutely the wrong approach to solving our nations budget problems every day 48 million elderly and disabled americans across this country count on medicare for their lifesaving medications doctor visits and hospital care sixtynine percent of people over the age of 65 and they are both democrats and republicans oppose medicare becoming a voucher program seniors know that changing medicare to a voucher program means that they will no longer have access to a guaranteed set of health benefits that the value of a limited voucher wont keep up with rising health care costs that the voucher would become insufficient over time and the care they need could become unaffordable that too many taxpayer dollars will be spent on advertising campaigns and administrative costs instead of actual medical expenses and seniors know that privatizing medicare means limits on benefits obstacles to care uncertain reimbursements copayments for primary care or specialty care exclusions for certain services discrimination based on income illness or age and more uncertainty if a serious illness or need for longterm care occurs seniors know that privatizing or voucherizing medicare will mean that they pay more in premiums or do without and it doesnt end there in addition to medicare cuts republicans also want to take away medicaid for the nearly 6 million seniors who depend on it for nursing home or longterm care they say proudly that they will cut funding to states by 1 trillion this means that disabled and frail elderly americans will be placed on waiting lists for services or have no access to care at all in pennsylvania my home state nearly 40 percent of funds spent on longterm care would be at risk this includes 62 percent of nursing home residents and 25 000 pennsylvanian seniors who receive home health services and yet when republicans had the opportunity to reduce costs while maintaining and strengthening care for our seniors they demonized the plan voting time and again to stop important improvements in medicare and they still want to repeal the law that eliminates copayments for preventive care services that makes prescription drug benefits more affordable and improves coordination of care and health outcomes reduces errors and reduces costs for seniors they want to repeal the law that curbs the growth in medicare spending saves taxpayers almost 500 billion by ending overpayments to insurance companies and extends the life of the medicare trust fund for 12 years instead the republicans here in washington want to end medicare as we know it and put health care for american seniors at great risk as a senior member of the budget committee i know how important it is to find solutions to reducing the deficit to do this right the solution must include spending cuts tax policy reform and economic growth we should not fix our budget problems by failing to meet our obligations to our seniors every day we hear how determined republicans are to slash billions of dollars from the central programs because we simply cant afford it they say we cant afford to make investments in the future we cant afford to educate our children or fix our roads or fuel innovation or cover health care costs for seniors yet in the same proposal to slash medicare and medicaid for millions of seniors republicans make permanent tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of americans in the very same budget proposal where republicans take away guaranteed benefits for seniors they protect billions of tax subsidies to

default crisis is it because of a natural disaster that has devastated our nation is it because of a catastrophic national security threat is it because of another meltdown of our financial system like the one we saw in 2008 no the default crisis is for none of these reasons instead it is a crisis wholly manufactured by my republican colleagues who are holding our economy hostage to pursue a radical agenda this is an agenda that seeks to continue the bush policies of wars and tax cuts paid for by undoing the new deal shrinking the social safety net and pulling the rug out from under millions of americans who are still struggling to recover from a financial crisis that was created by wall street the debt ceiling is being used as political leverage to pursue this agenda remember the debt ceiling was raised 18 times under president reagan and seven times under president george bush instead of this phony crisis we should be debating the real crisis facing this nation the crisis that is consistently named as the number one concern of american taxpayers that is the jobs crisis today about 14 million people are unemployed wages are declining and home values are still plummeting the unsurprising result is consumers arent buying businesses dont need to hire as many workers and the cycle continues in minority communities these problems are even worse with over 16 percent of african americans and 11 percent of hispanics out of work in fact just yesterday the pew research center reported that while all households lost wealth during the recession minority families experienced disproportionate losses and the wealth gap between minority and white households is actually growing the median wealth of unitedstates households in 2009 was 13 000 compared to just over 6

these debt ceiling hostage negotiations my republican colleagues are pushing to cut medicare social security medicaid and jobcreating domestic programs no matter the cost now is the time to invest in

list of ways to create jobs we can create a new civilian conservation corps we can close tax loopholes and bring jobs back from overseas we can encourage investments in the new green economy and we can provide incentives for businesses to train and hire the longterm unemployed and guess what we can do this while balancing the budget in fact the peoples budget offered by the congressional progressive caucus can balance our books at least 10 years before the ryan budget i encourage my colleagues to stand opposed to republican efforts to perpetuate this default crisis and balance our

colleagues to support the democratic plan lifesaving legislation and vote against the republican repeal of health care it is wrong for america i urge a no vote i rise in strong opposition to this harmful illconceived bill when the republican majority said it was going to make the deficit their defining issue this congress most of us did not realize it was to make the deficit bigger but according to the congressional budget office their first act to repeal health care would do just thatadd 230 billion to the deficit while making americans pay more for health care instead of focusing on job creation republicans are running up our deficit jeopardizing the health of millions of americans and threatening the creation of new jobs under the republican repeal effort insurance companies will once again be able to drop people when they get sickexactly when coverage is needed most children with preexisting conditions will be denied coverage while insurance companies would again impose devastating annual and lifetime caps young people will not be able to stay on their parents plans until age 26 pregnant women and breast cancer survivors can be denied coverage seniors will face an increase in their prescription drug costsmillions thrown back into the medicare part d donut hole repeal would deny seniors a 50 percent discount on prescription drugs recreating the devastating coverage gap each of these things will disappear if republicans are able to repeal the historic health reform law in my home state of new york repealing the affordable care act would be devastating new york residents providers small businesses and other employers would be denied critical new benefits of the law from protections against insurance industry abuses to new coverage options and millions of dollars in support so states like new york can deliver quality affordable health care options to all of its residents without the affordable care act new york will suffer 77 800 young adults would lose their insurance coverage through their parents health plans sometimes just after they finish school and as they are looking for a job families across new york would lose the peace of mind the affordable care act provides by making sure that young adults can stay on their parents plan to age 26 if they do not have coverage of their own more than 10 million residents of new york with private insurance coverage would suddenly find themselves vulnerable again to having lifetime limits placed on how much insurance companies will spend on their health care insurance companies would once again be allowed to cut off someones coverage unexpectedly when they are in an accident or become sick because of a simple mistake on an application this would leave 734 000 people in new york at risk of losing their insurance at the moment they need it most as one of the worst abuses of the insurance industry would become legal again new insurance plans would no longer be required to cover recommended preventive services like mammograms and flu shots without cost sharing nor would they have to guarantee enrollees the right to choose any available primary care provider in the network or see an obgyn without a referral nearly 2 9 million seniors in new york who have medicare coverage would be forced to pay a copay to receive important preventive services like mammograms and colonoscopies medicare would no longer pay for an annual checkup visit so nearly 2 9 million seniors in new york who have medicare coverage would have to pay extra if they want to stay healthy by getting checkups regularly 192 596 on medicare would see significantly higher prescription drug costs in new york 192 596 medicare beneficiaries received a onetime taxfree 250 rebate to help pay for prescription drugs in the donut hole coverage gap in 2010 medicare beneficiaries who fall into the donut hole in 2011 will be eligible for 50 percent discounts on covered brand name prescription drugs without the law the burden of high prescription drug costs would hurt millions of medicare beneficiaries across the country for the sake of argument if we remove the moral obligation of providing health care to 32 million americans who would lose coverage with this repeal we are still left with a compelling fiscal reason for opposing the repeal of this law repeal adds 230 billion to the deficit over the first 10 years and more than 1 2 trillion in the second decade around onehalf percent of gdp americans purchasing health insurance on their own will see their costs rise americans will get fewer health benefits for their money i urge my colleagues to oppose this bill that will balloon the deficit burden our children and grandchildren halt the creation of jobs and compromise the

thousands of american transportation jobsjobs lost in every stateand will severely jeopardize our nations economic competitiveness this budget slashes investments in our peoplefrom ending medicare as we know it to destroying the familywage jobs of highway constructionall the while providing a doubledigit percentage tax break for millionaires that most of them will not even notice it makes big oil smile from ear to ear knowing that they can exploit 40 billion in tax loopholes yet the budget completely neglects millions of american potholes as the ranking member on the committee on transportation and infrastructure and given that congress faces major surface transportation reauthorization legislation this year let me focus for a moment on what this budget does to highway and transit infrastructure investment consider this for a moment today china spends nine percent of its gdp per year on infrastructure india spends five percent of its gdp per year on infrastructure yet the united states of america only spends 1 9 percent of its gdp per year on infrastructure woefully inadequate as it stands yet the republican budget cuts highway highway safety and transit investment by about onethird onethird less bridge repair onethird less safety improvement and onethird less bus service is where this budget leads usdestroying familywage highway and transit construction jobs all along the way and placing us in an even less competitive position than we already are against countries like china and india incredible simply incredible over the next six years the current budget baseline investment level for highway highway safety and public transit investments is 331 billion including 316 billion of contract authority from the highway trust fund and 15 billion from the general fund based on the assumptions included in the republican budget the nonpartisan congressional budget office estimates that the republican budget provides only 219 billion of highway trust fund funding over the next six years in effect the republican budget slashes surface transportation investment by more than 100 billion over the next six years let me repeat that because i want my colleagues to be very aware of what this budget proposes to do in this area today is the 100th day that the republicans have been in control of the house and today they are proposing to cut more than 100 billion from investments in americas future investments that keep our economy moving and help to ensure that america remains a good place to do business one hundred days in control of the house and they want to slash 100 billion from transportation investments they havent brought a single jobs bill to the floor of this house and yet today to mark their 100th day anniversary here we are debating a budget that will destroy half a million highway jobs amazing according to a cbo analysis of the republican budget assumptions this budget will slash current year highway funding from 41 1 billion to approximately 27 billion in fiscal year 2012 a 34 percent cut in year one of the reauthorization bill will destroy more than 490 000 jobs over the coming years west virginia cannot afford a 143 million cut in highway investment next year this investment and its 5 000 goodpaying jobs are critical to our mountain economy and ensuring that rural america shares in the great opportunities provided by our country put simply middle class americans cannot afford the republican road to ruin budget finally the republican budget destroys any pretext that republicans will restore the highway and transit budget firewalls that they wiped away on the first day of their new majority in the 112th congress when congress enacted those firewalls in 1998 to restore the trust to the highway trust fund and keep faith with the traveling public i stood shouldertoshoulder with former republican committee chairman bud shuster we lost that battle on the budget at 3 00 in may 1997 but one year later won the war with enactment of the transportation equity act for the 21st century establishing the budget firewalls which have served the traveling public for the past 14 years as their very first act in the majority republicans broke the trust of the highway trust fund there was a time when republicans were proud of their heritage in leading the way on infrastructure investment they were the party

yesterday the out of poverty caucus held a press conference with organizations working on the front lines with lowincome and poor people we heard stories of more homelessness long lines at food pantries and the desperation felt by so many our nations unemployment rate remains at an unacceptably high 9 2 percent millions of americans who have lost their jobs are finding it harder and harder to find a new one these new ranks of the longterm unemployed and their families are facing the stark reality of life in poverty for the first time the ongoing impact of the recession on struggling

his plan targets the programs aimed at americas most vulnerableour seniors our children and our lowincome familiesfor more draconian cuts trying to balance the budget on the backs of the poor is morally wrong we need a balanced approach that balances targeted cuts with the revenue that we need we must make sure that we can pay the benefits that we owe to our seniors protect medicare medicaid and social security and safeguard our most vulnerable communities while the nations unemployment level remains unacceptably high for some minority communities it was double digits even before the

create this default instead of supporting the vital human needs programs that will protect our most vulnerable republicans are trying to balance the budget on the backs of the poor while maintaining these tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires and big oil there is no more time for these republican games the american people expect us to put partisanship aside to protect our economy and create

is left unserved this cantoradams bill offers us a false choice between weakening and undermining protections in the violence against women act or maintaining the status quo the american people understand that a vote for the cantoradams bill is a vote to roll back protections for all domestic and sexual violence victims and puts the safety of our most vulnerable domestic violence victims at risk immigrants native americans lesbian gay and bisexual victims all have historically faced many barriers to reporting sexual violence but instead of removing those barriers this bill under this closed rule creates new ones lesbian and gay survivors face particular obstacles in accessing the criminal justice system lesbian and gay survivors are often reluctant to report abuse and when they do finally seek assistance they frequently dont receive the support they need across lifesaving services and resources studies tell us that gay and lesbian couples experience domestic violence at roughly the same rates as the general population it is no surprise that less than one in five gay and lesbian victims of intimate partner violence receives help through a service provider this bill fails to provide the same vital protections for gay and lesbian families that have been overwhelmingly approved in the senate bill during the judiciary markup i offered an amendment to restore these protections but unfortunately it was voted down this closed process prevents the ability of members of the house to even consider or vote on adding these protections back in had the house republicans allowed amendments on the floor today i would have offered two amendments that i offeredalong with my colleagues representative jackson lee representative lofgren representatives deutch and chu all

ultimately lead to her own deportation all women deserve to be protected from domestic violenceeven women who have committed crimes even women who have had civil violations like violating our immigration laws even women who are lesbians all women deserve to be protected by the violence against women act and that is what this bill is about the senate bill which passed on a bipartisan basis and included a report from well over a dozen republican senators included these provisions abuse is abuse whether it occurs against immigrants whether it occurs against gay and lesbian americans or whether it occurs against native americans yet under this bill before us a native american woman who is living on a reservation and who is raped and abused by a nontribal member lacks protection and remains at risk of serious sexual and physical violence by her abuser under this underlying bill gay and lesbian survivors and victims will struggle to get protective orders or will be turned away

senate have both been understandably and properly concerned with one issue that has perhaps eclipsed every other issue that has come before us in this halfyear period of time that related to our national debt and the anticipated expiration of our debt limit which will hit in just a couple weeks many americans are understandably concerned and have articulated the concern that if we pass the debt limit deadline of august 2 without raising the debt limit there could be catastrophic financial consequences in light of that i along with a number of my republican colleagues both in the senate and in the house have introduced legislation called the cut cap and balance act to address the debt limit to address it head on it says we will raise the debt limit if three conditions are met first that we make significant cuts to domestic discretionary spending for the fiscal year 2012 budget second we need statutory spending caps to put us on a smooth but steady glidepath toward balancing our budget sometime within the next decade third we need a balanced budget amendment passed out of congress and submitted to the states for ratification we think all three of these steps are necessarily required before we take the significant additional step of raising the debt limit because of the fact that it took us a long time to get to this point the point where by the end of the year we will have accumulated 15 trillion in debtabout 50 000 for every man woman and child in america between 120 000 and 150 000 for every wage earner in america this is a lot of moneybefore we extend that debt limit again by an additional 2 4 trillion we have to solve the problem we have to address the problem that led to its creation in a real lasting binding fundamental way that is why the most critical part of this legislation while each part is important happens to be found in that which rests upon the idea of a balanced budget amendment to the constitution we as members of congress could decide right now that over the next 10 years or 15 years it might be a good idea to cut spending by 2 trillion 3 trillion 4 trillion 5 trillion 6 trillion perhaps morebut if we made that promise today as a downpayment to the american people in exchange for the permission of the people to raise the debt limit it is a promise we cannot make good on because we cannot bind a future congress this congress was sworn in in january of 2011 elections will be held in november of 2012 and a new congress will be sworn in based on those elections in january 2013 the same thing will happen again in january 2015 and every 2 years after that for the duration of our republic the decisions we make right here right now can affect the here and now and can be binding for the here and now but we cannot reasonably expect and we cannot ask the american people when making a decision so longlasting and precedentsetting as this one to simply trust us that future congresses will see things the same way we do the only way we can bind a future congress is by amending our law of laws that 224yearold document painstakingly ironed out by some of the brightest men of the last several centuries in philadelphia 224 years ago when we amend the constitution we make it possible to bind a future congress that is what we need to do we have had some interesting debate and discussion surrounding this proposal last friday i listened with surprise and dismay as our president said we dont need to amend the constitution to require a balanced budget but we do need to balance our budget in the opinion of the president congress just needs to do its job not amend the constitution i think i understand his point i think he is suggesting that for congress to do its job it needs to balance its budget but i have to ask the question how has that worked out for us have past congresses balanced their budgets has the current congress balanced its budget overwhelmingly the answer is no it happens every now and then some would describe those instances where it has balanced in the last two or three decades as an accident others a momentary blip still others would suggest it was the product of accounting gimmickry rather than an actual act of budget balancing when that occurred regardless we know that balanced federal budgets are newsworthy indeed because they are very rare i look forward to the day when they are no longer newsworthy when they are customary and the only way to make them customary based on our experience as americans throughout most of our nations history is by amending the constitution to require it to make this a binding and permanent law i was shocked and dismayed again to learn that our senate majority leader senator reid from nevada stated just a few hours ago that he does not like this legislation he made some very disparaging comments about it notwithstanding the fact and completely ignoring the fact that this is not just the best legislation to address the debt limit issue right now it is the only legislation it is the only legislation that addresses this issue that is moving through congress and that has been reduced to legislative language it is certainly the only one that has been passed by one body of congress and is now moving over to the senate he is criticizing something when he himself has not offered anything this is the only show in town given how close we now are to the august 2 deadline and in part because we punted this so long and in part because we have not been having the debate and discussion in congress we should have been having for months this is it this is the only proposal if senator reid has suggestions on how we might change this proposal i am all ears i would love to hear what they are if he has his own proposal i would love to see what that is but simply to stand from that desk over there and disparage this legislation is inexcusable absolutely inexcusable given the fact that he has offered nothing let me read some of his words he said the american people should understand that this this meaning the cut cap and balance act is a bad piece of legislation perhaps some of the worst legislation in the history of this country i dont know what he is referring to he didnt give specifics nor has he given any specifics on what he would like to see in its place or how it could be improved my suggestion to our senate majority leader is if he has ideas please put them on the table because as we approach this debt limit deadline we are running out of time the clock has been ticking for 6 months we have known this was going to happen this is not news to us why then has there been so little debate and discussion in this body why is it that we spent weeks and weeks and weeks often dealing with legislation that paled in comparison to the importance of this issue the clock kept ticking and we kept debating and discussing other legislation far less important this in my opinion was a gross dereliction of duty but we still have a few weeks we can still deal with it we can still address it i suggest strongly that we address it by starting with that legislation that has actually been proposed and that we have full debate and discussion but no we are told even after the house of representatives earlier this week passed the cut cap and balance act passed it with bipartisan support by the wayno fewer than five members of the democratic caucus in the house of representatives voted to support this that was passed tuesday night we were told later we would be having a vote on saturday or perhaps monday then just a little while ago we were informed by the senate majority leader that the vote would be tomorrow giving us little or no time for actual debate and discussion on the floor of what is still to this moment the only legislation moving through to address this issue this is not an appropriate moment for demagoguery demagoguery on an issue this important can result in a lot of unnecessary pain no one disputes that there could be significant negative economic consequences associated with not raising the debt limit i do not dispute that not for a moment that is exactly why i put my neck on the line in order to file this legislation because nothing else was moving forward i didnt want to do it but when i was sworn in as a senator just a few months ago i understood it was my obligation to do what i could to make things better to make our constitutional system work so i filed it it is an insult not only to me and to my colleagues but to all americans when addressing an issue this important to have so little debate and discussion over this issue i find it appalling i find it reprehensible i demand an explanation and i demand an alternative solution if the senate majority leader is going to pick this apart and say he will not do it moreover i will remind the senate majority leader that just a few short years ago in 2006 when we had a different president belonging to a different party and this body was in control of another party if my memory serves me correctly not only did thensenator barack obama vote against raising the debt limit calling the need to do so the product of a failure of leadership that he was not willing to condone and perpetuate but every single one of his democratic colleagues joined him in that vote not one of them voted to raise the debt limit here we are again approaching the debt limit here we are again with only republicans stepping to the plate and offering a solution only this time the solution is a permanent one unfortunately in 2006 and prior and in subsequent debt limit extension votes there was no serious debate attached to it as to a permanent solution we have to amend the governing document the law of laws the only kind of law that can bind future congresses in order to solve this problem we have to do it now this is part of what it means to be an american we as americans crave liberty and we eschew tyranny to any degree every single time we authorize deficit spending we fuel the unfettered expansion of the federal government and all its power we commit ourselves and our posterity to a future that will include working more and more hours and days and weeks and even months just to pay their federal tax bills every single year that is time they will not get back that is time we will not get back that erodes our individual liberty it also erodes our liberty when the same regulatory structure that exists today grows bigger and bigger every year because we are borrowing now more than 1 5 trillion every single yearnot because of some aberrational condition some unusual development that requires an unusual expenditure of borrowed money but just to cover our basic daytoday operations this is what fuels the perpetual expansion of government and when government expands perpetually our individual liberty is diminished unfortunately and to a corresponding degree this is unacceptable but there is a way home the way home is found in limiting the role of government we can limit the role of government most effectively at this point in time i believe by limiting the pool of money to which congress has access the only way to do that is through a constitutional amendment i wish to close by addressing one final argument that sometimes has been used in response to and against the cut cap and balance act many of its detractors are making the claim that i find extraordinary a claim that says why are you even supporting this because it cant pass it is a little bit akin to saying why do we even play the super bowl when it is expected that one team is going to beat the other team we have to play but this one is not a game this one is for real when we vote after debating and discussing members of this body can and will be held accountable to our constituents so it will be up to me and each of my colleagues in this body to decide how to vote on this issue for those who make the unfortunate decision to vote against this notwithstanding the fact that 75 percent of the american people strongly support the idea of a balanced budget amendment notwithstanding the fact that 66 percent of americansboth of these figures according to a cnn poll todaysupport the principles underlying cut cap and balance notwithstanding the fact that this is the only permanent way of solving our debt problem if members of congress and members of this body choose to vote against this legislation they will do so i believe at their own peril they will have to face their constituents and explain why a handful of them were unwilling to raise the debt limit unwilling to address this problem unwilling to fix the perpetual deficit spending habit of congress simply because they did not want a balanced budget amendment to the constitution i think that is a tall order i think that is difficult to explain i think those who try to make that explanation to their constituents will do so at their own political peril but more importantly the vote they cast will be at the peril of the people of the united states of america of their liberty of their economic stability and of their ability to prosper now and in the future we can turn this ship around but in order do it we need robust debate and discussion and our constituents deserve more the american people deserve more than to have the kind of sleightofhand scheduling and the kind of dismissive cavalier attitude toward what is being characterized correctly by many as the fight of an entire generation we need to pass the cut cap and balance act it is not only the best solution it is the only solution the time is running out and i urge each of my colleagues to support this thank you mr president i yield the

we are recognizing today we are highlighting the third anniversary of president obamas failed stimulus package the president promised 3 years ago that the stimulus would create what he characterized as millions of jobs but today unfortunately devastatingly there are nearly 13 million people in america who are still unemployed and many millions more have even given up on looking for jobs three years ago the white house said that because of the stimulus package unemployment would not exceed 8 percent that has not happened in fact the unemployment rate has topped 8 percent for 36 straight months nowthe longest stretch of high unemployment since the great depression the congressional budget office predicts it is going to go even longer we will not see sub8 percent unemployment according to the cbo until 2014 the president sold his stimulus package to the american people by claiming he would make immediate investments in what he characterized as shovelready jobs but last june the president acknowledged that shovelready was not as shovelready as we expected nevertheless a lot of money has been spent as we have been waiting for these jobs to materializejobs that never quite came about in fact some of it was spent in ways that have nothing to do with stimulating the economy for example consider some of the ways in which this stimulus money has been spent mr president 760 000 was spent on interactive dance software 1 2 million was spent on a train museum 2 million was spent to study ant behavior 762 000 was spent to study improvised musici am not sure what that is but i am sure it is lovely not necessarily deserving of scarce federal resources 300 000 to track weather on other planetsgreat if one lives on another planet not so great if one lives on earth in a country that has accumulated an unprecedented debt exceeding 15 trillion 153 000 for an indoor water park and 712 000 to develop a machinegenerated humor systemin other words a joke machine this big joke is on the american taxpayer unfortunately it is no laughing matter in the last 3 years we have added more than 4 trillion to the national debt we have recorded the three largest annual deficits in our nations history and we are on pace for a fourth straight deficit exceeding 1 trillion this week the president submitted a budget that calls for adding 11 trillion in new debt over the next decade his own treasury secretary calls the level of spending unsustainable and it is despite the overwhelming evidence that his stimulus package has failed the president has called for additional increases in spending i know the president is a good man i also know he faced a difficult economy when he took office but the president is unwilling to tell the truth to the american people about what lies ahead about some of the challenges we face i think he needs to do so and he needs to acknowledge the fact that this stimulus package has failed so we can avoid making similar mistakes in the future today we cannot celebrate the anniversary of the presidents stimulus rather we must lament a tremendous lost opportunity by this administration to put this country back on the right track over these last 3 years for the sake of future generations i hope it is not too late to change course i suggest the absence of a quorum"], [0.9961478728801012, 0.003852127119898796, 1, "on that i demand the yeas and

on ethics and as the chairman of the investigative subcommittee or isc in this matter i do rise in support of the resolution which calls for the adoption of this committees report and will serve as a reprimand of representative laura richardson for her conduct and will impose upon her a 10 000 fine i do not relish speaking under these circumstances this is indeed a solemn momentwhen the house must consider punishing one of its own members as the chairman stated over the last 9 months as members of the investigative subcommittee my colleagues mr yarmuth from kentucky mr bishop of utah mr lujan of new mexico and i conducted an extensive investigation into the allegations regarding representative laura richardson the subcommittee met on over 20 occasions in total the isc and staff conducted 12 interviews during this phase of the inquiry and reviewed the transcripts of the 17 interviews conducted during the committees earlier phase of its inquiry the subcommittee also reviewed thousands of pages of documents i appreciate the hard work of each of the subcommittee members especially of the ranking member mr yarmuth of kentucky he is a pleasure to work with i would also like to thank the nonpartisan professional staff of the ethics committee who conducted the investigation with dignity and professionalism at all timesdeborah mayer cliff stoddard sheria clarke chris tate and brittany bohren at the conclusion of a thorough investigation the subcommittee unanimously concluded that there was substantial reason to believe that representative richardson had violated the code of official conduct and other laws rules or standards of conduct the chairman outlined the seven counts in the statement of alleged violation which was unanimously adopted by the investigative subcommittee here is a summary of the findings of the report and why the committee recommends that representative richardson be reprimanded by the house for her conduct as discussed fully in the investigative subcommittee report fundamentally representative richardson failed to acknowledge the boundaries between the official and political realms on page 59 of the isc report it reads in part this case is about boundaries the house entrusts members with a great deal of discretion over a large amount of taxpayer resources this constructive trust requires members to delineate between the official the political and the personal in ways that are at times quite tidy and at others tangled representative richardson did not acknowledge these boundaries she acted to consume the resources endowed to her as a member for whatever purpose suited her whims at the moment be they official acts her reelection or her personal needs the isc discovered significant evidence suggesting that her wrongdoing continued even after learning that the committee was investigating her if the committee fails to exact a steep price for such conduct the message is one of a set of rules with a toothless enforcement mechanism representative richardsons misconduct included that first she improperly compelled or coerced members of her staff to do campaign work representative richardson required the staff of her district office in long beach california to perform campaign work each weeknight from approximately 6 30 through 9 during at least the 2 months prior to the 2010 primary and general elections this practice alone accounted for hundreds of hours of conscripted campaign work by public servants who did not wish to perform it and may not be forced to do so she also required her district staff to perform additional campaign work on the weekends representative richardson applied the same philosophy to her capitol hill staff this demonstrates a blatant disregard for the boundaries between official events and campaign events second representative richardson used official resources of the house for campaign and nonofficial purposes while the report has a detailed exposition of many of the resources used by representative richardson some of the more significant improper uses of resources included the use of staff time during the official work day to conduct campaign activities repeated use of the house email system to conduct campaign business use of the mra to lease a car which she parked at her house and used as her only mode of transportation in the district regardless as to whether her destination was official campaign or personal in nature third representative richardson paid her deputy district director as a fulltime house employee but for months before the 2010 elections she directed this employee to conduct campaign work for a significant portion of each day additionally in 2011 nearly a year after representative richardson received notice of the committees investigation into misuse of house resources representative richardson hired a new district director who with representative richardsons knowledge and approval spent much of his time performing campaign work taken together a theme emerges representative richardson used her staff as she saw fit the evidence does not demonstrate isolated incidents of compelled campaign work if that were in fact the case we would not likely be here today it demonstrates a constant effort by representative richardson to direct and pressure her official employees to perform as much campaign work as possible regardless of whether or not they wanted to volunteer the environment representative richardson cultivated in her office was so poor that one of her employees a detailee from the wounded warriors program wrote in her letter of resignation as a serviceconnected disabled veteran it is sad to say that i would rather be at war in afghanistan than work under people that are morally corrupt just as concerning as the substantive violations if not more so was the significant evidence that representative richardson obstructed and attempted to obstruct the investigation to fulfill our constitutional duty the house must take action against any member who improperly attempts to frustrate a committee investigation the investigative subcommittee concluded that representative richardson obstructed and attempted to obstruct the investigation into these allegations specifically representative richardson directed her staff to testify that their campaign work had been voluntary even in cases where staff had not volunteered she also attempted to obstruct the committees investigation by altering or destroying evidence finally representative richardson obstructed the investigation by failing to provide materials responsive to a subpoena issued by the investigative subcommittee the investigative subcommittee served representative richardson with that subpoena only after months had passed with representative richardson ignoring numerous requests from the isc that she provide responsive documents even then the investigative subcommittee discovered documents that representative richardson had in her possession custody or control and nevertheless failed to produce based on these conclusions the investigative subcommittee found that representative richardson committed seven different violations of the code of official conduct or other laws rules or standards of conduct throughout this process representative richardson has been afforded every opportunity to defend herself ultimately she initiated a negotiated resolution and admitted to the seven counts in the statement of alleged violation she received a copy of the investigative subcommittee report 5 days prior to its adoption and was given an opportunity to provide her views to be considered by the committee through her misconduct representative laura richardson has violated the public trust while no member wants to sit in judgment of a colleague it is our duty to protect the integrity of the house accordingly on behalf of the committee i recommend that the house adopt the committees unanimous report and that the report serve as a reprimand of representative laura richardson for her misconduct"], [0.994185698684305, 0.005814301315695047, 1, "who has been very very helpful in this process already i look forward to an open amendment process and lively debate over the next several months i also vowed that we would cut spending wherever possible to help balance our budgets the appropriations committee is dedicated to the careful stewardship of taxpayer dollars and you will see that in each of the 12 bills we put out this year that will be a hallmark careful stewardship of money we have had to make the most of our very limited resources in all areas of government and that includes the department of homeland security we began this year with the homeland security appropriations bill because we can all agree that our national security is a number one priority every day our citizens worry about constant terrorist threats the security of our air and seaports and the defense of our borders but we also face the very real dangers of uncontrolled spending and skyrocketing debt americans deserve to live and work in a country that will protect not only their physical safety but also their economic livelihood this bill maintains the crucial measures that keep our citizens safe while also reining in outofcontrol dangerous deficit spending providing 40 6 billion in total emergency spending for the various programs within dhs this is a decrease of 1 1 billion below last years level it funds the critical frontline personnel operations and programs needed to uphold the highest levels of national security within this bill we have bolstered our immigration and border security efforts funded the maritime and security activities of the coast guard and boosted security efforts to address air cargo threats the bill also addresses the presidents overtly inadequate request for known disaster relief costs it can be nearly impossible in fact it is impossible to plan for acts of god but over the past few weeks mother nature has wreaked havoc across our midwest and south and other parts of the country demonstrating the need for sufficient disaster relief funding im proud that we have added a billion dollars to the disaster relief fund while completely offsetting this increase by taking unused funding from the department of energy weve significantly reduced or eliminated ineffective and wasteful programs while requiring reforms in underperforming programs through heightened oversight to get the most out of each and every tax dollar this includes long overdue reform on the state and local grant program under the federal emergency management agency which has been plagued by inefficiency these grants often remain in federal coffers for years to come right now as youve heard there is a backlog of more than 13 billion in unspent grant funds why should we pack a clogged pipe as chairman aderholt has said at a time when we are

eliminate funding for the presidio trust the presidio was in continuous use as a military post from 1776 until 1994 an army installation the post was closed in 1994 as part of the brac process and transferred to the national park service in 1996 congress established the presidio trust to govern this unique national park site and to ensure its preservation by making it financially selfsustaining and thats exactly what has happened over the past 12 years appropriations as a percentage of the overall trust budget have been reduced from over 95 percent federal funding in fiscal year 1998 to less than 20 percent in fiscal year 2010 the current ratio of private investment in the presidio to federal appropriations is already greater than 4 1 appropriations though are authorized through fiscal year 2012 that was the deal after 2012 the trust itself by itself alone is responsible for longterm operations and maintenance of the presidio since it took over management of the presidio in 1998 the trust has rehabilitated and leased 97 percent of the presidios housing units and rehabilitated 75 percent of the presidios 433 very historic buildings ive been there ive seen it its phenomenal what the trust has accomplished eliminating funds just 1 year short of its goal violates the spirit of the 1996 law and it undermines the trusts ability to achieve selfsufficiency this would result in higher future obligations as the federal government might have to assume full responsibility to maintain the historic properties it also sends a terrible signal to communities across the country that may also have innovative solutions in partnering with the federal government they are timecontrolled in other words its not forever but they say for a certain period of time if youll partner with us well take this responsibility off your hands the 23 million appropriated for the trust in fiscal year 2010 has created 860 jobs federal appropriations in this current fiscal year will help expedite rehabilitation of historic buildings and take advantage of favorable construction costs that exist today at a recent oversight hearing the members of our appropriations subcommittee received assurances that the trust will accomplish its financial stewardship and public use goals that was the deal they said well meet our part of the deal assuming that the federal government will meet its obligation as one of the nations oldest and most important military posts the trust has had some unique extraordinary challenges since the defense department closed out its installation but the trust is well on its way toward meeting its legislative objectives it should not be undermined by this amendment this has worked well its an example for the rest of the country let it serve as an example one more year to go and then it will be off our books the trust will take over responsibility and we will point out that this is the way to do it in partnership where we will not be perpetually
