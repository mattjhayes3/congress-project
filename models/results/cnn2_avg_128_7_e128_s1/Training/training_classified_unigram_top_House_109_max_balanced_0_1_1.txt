hurricane that the federal government would do everything it could to help those displaced in the gulf and to finally address the issue of poverty six weeks later the house republican majority is already forgetting about americas most vulnerable this week republicans had planned to cut medicaid higher education food stamps and possibly the earned income tax credit in order to achieve budget reconciliation we heard today that the budget reconciliation has been postponed we are not going to vote on it tomorrow and that is certainly good news i think it is a strong indication that this budget plan was a bad plan for america and that it was in fact going to be used as a method of basically hurting the poor and might have had a direct impact on those hurricane victims but it does not mean that therepublican leadership is not going to try to bring it up again next week when we come back and the problem is that it just is not fair it really is not fair it is inamerican in my opinion to say that we are going to try to pass this budget reconciliation by making cuts in the very programs that impact the people who suffered during the hurricane the republicans are claiming that their budget reconciliation bill is fiscally responsible and will cut the deficit but obviously we could tell from the last special order that is simply not true the budget actually raises the deficit gives more tax breaks to the wealthiest and makes matters worse obviously for thevictims of katrina essentially this is a way of trying to build in if you will the republican tax breaks that primarily go to the wealthy to the special interests to corporate interests that the republicans would try to pass further down the road this year and it is amazing to me that it only took republicans 6 weeks to forget the images of hurricane katrina they are once again putting the priorities of the wealthiest few ahead of the workingclass americans it is now clear that the republicans learned absolutely nothing from hurricane katrina i could go on myself but i have to say that my ideas and my concerns with this budget bill were very much set forth in a washington postarticle or op ed that appeared today by harold meyerson called gunning for the poor and i am not going to read the whole thing or put it in the record but i wanted to highlight some of the things that harold meyerson said because it basically says in probably better language what i just indicated and how i feel and harold meyerson said in this op ed today in the washington post congress is back in session and its gunning for the american poor a revolt of house conservatives has persuaded that bodys republican leadership to offset the increased federal spending going to rebuild the hurricane katrinadevastated gulf coast by h8972 reductions in medicaid food stamps and other programs for the indigent if things go according to plan this week the house will begin to cut 50 billion from those efforts the emerging republican response to katrina apparently is to comfort the drenched poor and afflict the dry for a moment last week it looked as though the republicans were going to enact acrosstheboard spending cuts that however would have meant less money for defense contractors and the highway industry and other contributors to congressional republicans campaigns gop committee chairmen made that point so forcefully that the idea was scrapped the beauty of taking the cuts out of medicaid and student loan programs by happy contrast is that it does not reduce the flow of funds to the republican campaign committees by a single dime even before the rightwing house leadership capitulated to the even further rightwing house rank and file the governments response to katrina already appeared to be driven more by laissezfaire ideology than by need or common sense the administration has opposed efforts by senate finance committee chairman charles grassley to extend medicaid coverage to those katrina survivors who lost their jobs and health insurance in the flood and by suspending the requirements of the davisbacon act that construction workers on federally funded reconstruction efforts be paid the prevailing wage president bush has ensured that much of that work will be done by illegal immigrants as one new york times report on the mexican workers rebuilding gulfport mississippi made abundantly clear the article goes on but the bottom line is and this is what meyerson says at the end the same republican zealots who demand fiscal responsibility by cutting 50 billion for the indigent sick are now also demanding a new 70 billion in tax cuts including the permanent repeal of the estate tax that would chiefly benefit the rich so meyerson basically explains and i think it is abundantly clear the republicans are not trying to make these cuts in programs for the indigent that would essentially help the hurricane victims because they want to balance the budget because mo the defitit is still going to be huge they are basically doing it because they want to build into the budget the opportunity to come back with permanent tax cuts for the wealthy for the corporate interests and this is their way of cutting programs that essentially are crucial for the hurricane victims in order to accomplish that and the amazing thing to me is that we heard president bush just a few days or a week or so after the hurricane struck say that the hurricane showed that there were a lot of poor people a lot of people that were unemployed a lot of people that did not have basic necessities and rather than trying to help them in some way by extending medicaid benefits to them so that if they lost their health insur ance they will still have some health insurance or rather than giving them an opportunity to have a job so that they can help rebuild new orleans or the various towns along the gulf that were impacted by hurricane katrina this administration and this republican congress are just cutting the legs out of any kind of help that those hurricane victims would receive and basically saying we do not care about them all we care about is giving tax cuts to the very wealthy i think it is scandalous frankly and it is another reason why we need an independent investigation of what happened with hurricane katrina a number of my colleagues and i have been coming down here for the last few nights as well as before the congressional break that we had last week and have been saying and so have the media been saying that a bipartisan katrina investigation is needed because the washington republicans the ones who have set up their own committee or investigation on a partisan basis are the same people who are responsible for the problems that we faced in the aftermath of hurricane katrina in other words the bush administration botched what happened in the aftermath of the hurricane and they continue to do things that are primarily for special interests for the people who contribute to their campaign coffers without worrying about the people the victims that are suffering in new orleans and other cities along the gulf so why in the world would we let these washington republicans who control the white house control the senate control the house investigate themselves it makes no sense the only way that we are going to get a true analysis of what is really happening in the aftermath of katrina including what was disqussed today in terms of the unwillingness of the republicans to help the victims in the aftermath of the hurricane is by having a bipartisan commission so that democrats and republicans are both involved in the investigation both can look at what is happening and not have this fake katrina inquiry that would just essentially be a whitewash if you will for what happened in the aftermath of the hurricane i notice that i am being joined now bi some of my colleagues who have been here every night making this point but we are particularly upset with the fact that in addition to not having this bipartisan investigation this bipartisan commission we now face a situation where the republicans want to bring up a budget plan that actually is going to cut the very programs that these hurricane victims need i would like to point out the other night i read a part of an editorial in the new york times which i think says it all about this fake katrina inquiry and i am not going to read the whole thing but i just wanted to read the very beginning and the very end this was in the new york times on september 26 it is called faking the katrina inquiry and it says as the nation reels from ritas devastation along the gulf coast any hope for a thorough investigation of governments gross mismanagement of katrina is quietly ebbing away behind the political levees of washington the white house and the republicancontrolled congress resisting popular support for an independent nonpartisan commission remain determined to run selfserving bogus investigations there is no way to whitewash a hurricane the government dominated by one party should be disqualified from investigating itself just as president bush repeatedly fought the creation of the 9 11 commission till public pressure forced him to yield so should the public now demand that the administration and congress get real about katrina i feel even more strongly about this in the light of this budget reconciliation bill that we understand now has been postponed because the republicans do not have the votes thank god they do not have the votes and hopefully they will never have the vote for this scandal i would yield now to my colleague the gentleman from florida who has been here practically every night making this point"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "a few weeks ago i gave a speech about the importance of apologizing for doing something wrong one of the first lessons that we are taught as children actually our capacity for saying i am sorry is part of what makes us a functioning and civilized society here in washington every time a democrat uses strong rhetoric to condemn the politics or the policies of the bush administration there is a relentless pressure from the republicans for an apology and it continues it continues as a repeated pattern that is repeating itself right now with the karl rove affair democrats are right to be incensed that the presidents chief adviser is alleged to have revealed valerie plame as a cia operative purportedly publicizing this information to get back at plames husband joe wilson for disagreeing with the bush administrations assessment that saddam hussein was to quote vice president cheneys flawed analysis reconstituting his nuclear weapons program maybe my memory is failing me but i do not recall any republicans calling on karl rove to apologize for coldheartedly revealing the identity of a cia operative as part of a political vendetta to get back at her husband nor has the vice president apologized for his mistake about iraqs nonexistent nuclear weapons program which led us into war the personally destructive behavior that republicans have engaged in to protect karl rove and another high ranking bush administration official vice president cheneys chief of staff scooter libby actually might be their way to change the subject to avoid any question about the merits of the iraq war and how it has been so poorly managed why do they want to avoid that discussion because the american people have completely lost confidence in the administrations iraq policy where for example is the apology for the deaths of more than 1 700 americans not only is there no apology secretary rumsfeld could not be bothered to personally sign condolence letters to their families where is the apology for sending young men and women to war without the proper protective armor on their bodies and on theirvehicles where is the apology for pinching pennies on veterans health benefits when these brave soldiers return home where is the apology for the immoral doctrine of this preenptive war and where is the apology for the gross deceptions used to justify it for the missing weapons of mass destruction for the cooked intelligence for the phony al qaedasaddam link where is the apology for wasting more than 200 billion for taxpayer money on this mistake and for the poor leadership that led to torture of prisoners and prisoner abuse at abu ghraib in guantanamo where is the apology for committing our troops and our nation to this mission without a postwar plan to secure the eace where is the apology for the arrogance that squandered americas international goodwill and damaged our relationships with our closest allies and finally where is the apology for revealing the identity of a good mans wife just because he disagreed with the administration on policy grounds there is something wrong with our moral compass if we have to apologize for speaking bluntly while our leaders can commit the biggest foreign policy blunder since vietnam and get away without apology or accountability to tell the truth an apology would not be enough for everything they have done an apology after all is just more words it is time for action it is time for accountability and it is time for karl roves security clearance to be revoked it is time for a tangible admission that the iraq war was immorally conceived and has been incompetently managed it is time for an end of the politics of personal destruction and an end of destructive national policies if the president wants to earn back the nations trust he needs to end this shameful shameful chapter in our nations history and without apology he needs to bring our troops home"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "a track record a pattern of those who have made youthful indiscretions in their lives need it be on credit need it be some sort of criminal activity you can no longer have access you used to have the capital if you do not have a good credit record am i right let me just tell you something right now as it relates to the united states i am looking at japan you can put japan in the state of florida and the state of florida will swallow geographically japan but better yet look what they are holding of the unitedstates apple pie the bottom line is this is about the incompetence cronyism and in some cases corruption of these individuals being able to get access into this institution and into the executive branch to be able to get what they want i want to drive the point on here i want to make sure this is crystal clear it has to be crystal the bottom line is the only way that we will be able to have a paradigm shift not only in thinking but in policy and action on behalf of the american people and unless the american people like you say the majority they do not have to be the majority the american people can make that change they can say that we are willing to allow the democrats to lead so that we can hopefully start taking care of some of these issues that we have to take care of here at home with our troops in iraq and afghanistan and throughout the world so that we can get the respect of not only the world but our country our own country veterans they signed up for all the right reasons allowing us to salute one flag as we see it now are being asked to do more financially meanwhile 1 5 trillion in tax cuts for the wealthy while we have individuals while we are having veterans affairs centers closing in rural america and in urban america they are closing some of them are only open on wednesday now but meanwhile we have individuals we have the president every time he gets a chance he is talking about let us make the tax cuts permanent for people who are not even asking for it so this is very simple this speech on what the majority republicans say well trust us we know what we are doing we showed the letter from secretary snow i think we already know this we did not write this letter the guy has said the fifth time the secretary is saying we will not be able to operate the government that is one letter here is the other one here fortytwo presidents this president and republican majority has borrowed 1 05 trillion but better yet saying let us make a bad idea permanent let us drive this number up let us put a two here instead of a one it does not make sense only the american

never blame the special interests for what happens here but i am going to tell you right now they have a tax shelter right now where 100 billion in unitedstates taxpayer dollars are not going into the coffers because they have an offshore deal with this administration and with this majority meanwhile we are sitting around here trying to figure out how our veterans are going to get health care meanwhile we are trying to figure how small businesses will be able to afford health care for everyday americans to be able to buy into and meanwhile we have troops still without body armor and the things they need to be able to fight on behalf of this country so we ask everyday americans to go out there and suck it up meanwhile the majority the republican majority based on incompetence some may say corruption in some cases as it relates to the white house i mean every day i am sorry every day we turn on the television what is new what is going on at the white house what is being held back from the american people what is being held back from the congress who came to the hill today and conflicted a story that they told just months ago about the fiscal outlook on the country meanwhile

for every man woman and child in america how did we dig ourselves into such a deep hole the truth is the republican leadership has created a credit card coagress that is recklessly selling out the future of america our children and our grandchildren and president bush is the most fiscally irresponsible president in the history o4 america on his watch we have run up record deficits and added nearly 2 5 trillion to our national debt in just 5 years in office president bush has borrowed more money from foreign sources than all 42 previous presidents combined put together the first 42 american presidents borrowed a total of 1 01 trillion from other countries president bush has now borrowed 1 05 trillion from overseas and he still has 3 years to go i know that my republican colleagues are as ashamed as i am that the united states is forced to borrow over 1 trillion from foreign nations to pay for our national priorities like reconstruction of the gulf coast and the war in iraq we owe it to the american people and future generations to roll up our sleeves and dig out of this mess now so far the republican leadership has refused to reach across theaisleto fix this fiseal mess the republican reconciliation plan is a shamt it does nothing to fix thebroken budget in fact it will make matters worse by all accounts the current proposal would add billions to the deficit in order to finance more reckless tax cuts for the most privileged americans who in their right mind i ask you could look at an 8 trillion debt and put forward a plan to make it bigger it is time for a real strategy for fiscal responsibility the budget process is broken anyone can see that the blue dog coalition has asked the president to convene an emergency bipartisan summit to address americas fiscal crisis we have put forward a comprehensive 12step plan to put america back on the path to fiscal responsibility the blue dog 12step plan is the only serious proposal on the table that would fix our nations budget woes and return america to fiscal solvency our plan is based on common sense not party ideology the blue dog 12step plan includes both democratic and republican ideas when it comes to fixing the budget the american people deserve cooperation and not partisanship our proposal includes commonsense reforms such as reinstating the payasyougo rules that we had here a few years ago and implementing discretionary spending caps we have also urged for the establishment of a rainy day fund to cushion the financial blow of future national emergencies like we saw in the gulf coast recently you just heard from my blue dog coleigue mr john tanner from tennesse a leader in the fight for fiscal respohnsibiiity in washington he outlined for us all how bad the situation is i

here nicholas john ryan born 3 weeks ago to my brother and his wire carrie he owes 27 000 just like that now that is no way to run a country and when the democrats are talking about balancing the budget and we talk about making some tough decisions and maybe having to go ask a millionaire to maybe pay their fair share in order to reduce the debt and to reduce the annual deficits that we are running we cannot find anyone with any courage on the other side but when they have the opportunity to cut medicaid to cut the free and reduced lunches to cut the budget for child support enforcement agencies in our local communities who go out and try to get money from deadbeat dads that is where they want to get the money from now we are not saying that government does not need reform that we do not need to streamline it but does it not start with a lot of these contractors in iraq we are spending a 1 5 billion a week in iraq a week we are building dams in iraq roads in iraq schools in iraq training people in iraq training health care workers in iraq and teachers in iraq and the outfit on the other side is cutting free and reduced lunches in the united states of america they do not have the courage to go and ask a millionaire to maybe give up just a few thousand dollars of his tax cut this is about leadership we are at a critical point in the history of the united states of america

the tune of 32 000 per after giving them over 100 000 over the course of the last few years are these good decisions long term for the united states of america because again we do not have surplus money to give back to millionaires in the form of tax cuts we are running deficits and what countries do when they have a deficit is the same thing a family does when they have an annual deficit you have to borrow the money or you have to get out the credit card and that is what this country is doing right now we are putting the future of the united states of america on a credit card and we are asking the next generation the same generation that we are asking to pay double the tuition that they paid 4 or 5 years ago increasing the fees for student loans increasing the burden of taxes on the middle class we are going to also ask that generation to pay the national debt off and to try to somehow close this gap by borrowing the money from the chinese and making sure that they pay back our

was going to share that chart there because i think these visual aids are needed at this particular time because we haye some members that dont necessarily i mean i just dont want the american people to be hoodwinked some may say bamboozled we say here in washington d c you know to get the potomac 2step on folks saying they didnt quite understanding what they were doing while they were making history here in the united states of america of allowing these countries to own own a part of the american apple pie i am just once again going to mention japan we stopped there but i think we could move across the country okay i think we can 692 8 billion japan has bought our debt again this republican congress is saying we want to make tax cuts permanent to billionaires and we want to give subsidies to companies that come in number one in profits this year and that is one industry which is the oil industry china 249 8 billion they bought up our debt that means that they have given us money to spend in a way as though we are spending our own money we owe them this money america will be forever changed but if you want to do away with allowing these countries to cover our states because of the debt that we owe them then you can elect a democratic congress i am going to slide this over a little bit the uk united kingdom 223 2 billion that they own of our debt now you have got to remember this is a 4year deal this is the bush policies and the congress the republican majority that have voted time after time to back the president up on this they have even lost the former speaker of the house newt gingrich and we need to read his quote to the knight ridder newspapers that cover this nation caribbean nations many of you will be spending time there vacation time there it is important it is important that people understand that they own 115 3 billion of our debt taiwan you go in your room unfortunately many of the toys there that your kids and grandkids may have may have taiwan on it we owe them 71 33 billion that they have bought of our debt canada just north of us we owe them 53 8 billion of our debt we will take them off there korea 66 5 billion we owe korea

are going to use to vacation on everyone is happy jumping up and down but guess what the bill is coming in in 30 days and soon folks are going to start calling the house and they are not going to call

getting sand in their teeth for us to have the right to salute one flag and i will be doggone if we stand here like it is just regular business here in congress and allow this republican majority to go without anyone checking them on this but it is not just us we have even got republicans coming out folks over there are talking about spending that we are responsible that we are good spenders yes you are great spenders and borrowers at the same time and so when iyou come to the floor majority and start talking about fiscal resp6nsibility just because you say it doesnot necessarily mean it is happening i want you to come to this floor grab these charts here that are sitting tight over here in the corner and explain what is good about them because these are your policies so mr ryan what you were mentioning earlier i just want to drive this point home because when folks start talking about we want to make sure the american people keep their money well we want to make sure the american people keep their money but who are the people is it the 10 million annual salary individual is it the individual sitting over there at some company that is getting a bonus at the same time they are

reputation in the world the president of the united states says stay the course stay the course i dont think so mr president it is time to face the facts on every important aspect in the iraq war president bush and his advisors have been wrong wrong on the reason to go to war wrong on the reception our troops would receive wrong on the rapidity with which the iraqi economy would be able to pay for the war and reconstruction and wrong on the willingness of the international community to join in efforts to stabilize iraq but dont take my word for it this gross incompetence has driven some of our fighting generals to level devastating public criticism mg john batiste who led the 1st infantry division in iraq has said my own decision to speak out goes back to watching firsthand the arrogant and contemptuous attitude of rumsfeld as he ignored the advice of military experts during preparations for war and then living with the impact of those strategic blunders as a division commander in iraq secretary rumsfeld and his team turned what should have been a deliberate victory in iraq into a prolonged challenge that is why over 2 years ago i asked for the resignation of secretary rumsfeld and i do so again today no one has been held accountable for all of these mistakes in iraq the incompetence comes at a great cost the bush administration is so obsessed with the effort to paint an optimistic picture of the situation in iraq that it refuses to face the facts the facts are these more than 2 500 american troops have been killed again more than 18 000 have been injured half of them permanently and as the war costs have grown to over 400 billion key construction projects remain unfinished as defense and intelligence expert anthony cordesman recently wrote the unitedstates aid

billion in iraq funds in an attempt to secure and develop iraqs economy this is outrageous where is the accountability in fact mr cordesman concludes that the unitedstates managed iraq reconstruction efforts have been as failed as the unitedstates response to hurricane katrina the bush iraq policy has diverted resources and attention from what should be the focus of our effort against terrorism in places like afghanistan the lack of stability and the deteriorating security situation in afghanistan is a casualty of the war in iraq the war has not made our country safer it has not made our military stronger it has caused great damage to our reputation in the world and it has hindered the fight against terrorism in face of all of this incompetence and the cost of the war i repeat the president urges us to stay the course stay the course mr president is not a strategy it is a slogan i will vote against this resolution because it is an affirmation of the presidents failed policy in iraq and in doing so i will be pleased to join mr murtha and mr skelton and i would like to at this moment salute them for their patriotism and their dedication to our country they are second to none

strains on our military this war is putting on them and in deterring our ability to respond to other threats i salute them for their leadership and in fact their courage because here we have the republicans putting on the floor a vacuous resolution a challenge that if you say that you support the troops you have to vote for this that day is over that day is over the credentials on real security for our country be it homeland security be it willing to project military might to protect americas interests at home and abroad we all share a that so dont put something on the table that says you either vote for this if you support the troops or you dont this resolution is one thing and one thing only it is an affirmation of president bushs failed iraq policy the american people know the policy has failed the american people know that hopefully it will dawn on the president and he instead of stay the course will change the course he will stop digging the hole he is digging in iraq and come out and see the light of day as to what is the right direction across the country americans have had free and open debate about this war but when the time came to debate iraq in this congress republicans shut down debate with a closed rule this is not only an affront to the democrats it is an affront to the american people closed rule limited debate twice as many people on our side of the aisle would like to have spoken but there wasnt enough time there wasnt enough time to give members of congress the opportunity to give voice to the concerns of their constituents about a matter as important as sending and keeping our troops at war what a sad commentary on our democracy we supposedly are going to iraq to promote democracy yet we dont even have it on the floor of the house of representatives what is sad about that is that we owe so much better so much more to the american people particularly to the brave men and women we lave sent to fight in iraq democrats are calling for a new direction in iraq our new direction would say to the iraqi people that we will not be in your country indefinitely we will not construct permanent bases and we will not control the flow of your oil we will work with you and your neighbors diplomatically to ensure that the reconstruction of iraq is successful we will do as mr murtha advocates we will redeploy and be ready republicans in congress continue to try to mislead the american people by suggesting a link between the war in iraq and the war on terror they are distinct as mr skelton has repeatedly and eloquently stated they are distinct and efforts to portray one as part of the other are a disservice to the truth and to the men and women sent to fight in baghdad kirkuk and ramadi the huge cost of the iraq war in lost lives lifealtering wounds sustained and billions of dollars spent demand better of us the defense authorization bill as was quoted again by mr skelton enacted last year declares 2006 to be a year of significant transition to full iraqi sovereignty creating the conditions of the phased redeployment of united states forces from iraq that is in the 2006 dod authorization bill the phased redeployment of united states forces from iraq that is the law of the land you all voted to support it we are halfway through 2006 significant transition has not occurred and the only redeployment has been of unitedstates forces into iraq not out the war in iraq has been a mistake i say a grotesque mistake it must be our resolve to end the war as soon as possible and to resolve to not make similar mistakes in the future we owe it to the american people we owe it to the young men and women that we send in to fight the fight again democrats take our responsibility to provide for the common defense very seriously we are proud to have leaders like mr murtha and mr skelton to lead that charge for us"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "before i begin i just want to join my colleagues tonight the gentlewoman from

human rights of any any people in our country and throughout the world so thank you mr honda and ms matsui for once again allowing us to participate and reminding us of this great atrocity i want to also add tonight my voice to those of my colleagues in the congressional black caucus in honoring an organization whose fight against the oppression and discrimination that all of us have felt in this country whether we were directly victimized by it or not it affected all of us which gave birth to the modernday civil rights movement and that is the naacp today this body unanimously passed h con res 355 which was a bipartisan resolution honoring the national association for the advancement of colored people on their 97th anniversary this is the largest and the oldest civil rights organization in our country late last night we concluded black history month by commemorating this month with activities led by the congressional black caucus chair our great leader chairman mel watt on the floor but it was very late last night and i hope people had an opportunity to listen to the few members who were here to talk about the glorious history of african americans in america today in keeping with the ideals of black history month and the tradition of our ancestors we must recommit ourselves to a plan of action for generations the naacp has provided the blueprint for organizing the african american community and other communities communities of color throughout our country to build these coalitions for success in december the house unanimously adopted my resolution recognizing the 140th anniversary of the 13th amendment the abolition of slavery in 1865 should have been should have been a new day for african americans yet 40 years later african americans continued to fight the repression and discrimination it was this continued frustration and pain that led to the birth of the modern civil rights movement in ontario canada in 1905 a group of african american leaders developed an action plan and launched the niagara movement emerging from the niagara movement the call was issued and diverse progressives formed the national negro committee which soon developed into the naacp for almost 100 years since that historic meeting the national association for the advancement of colored people has been the cornerstone of the social justice movement of minority communities last year mr hilary shelton the director of the naacps washington bureau delivered a black history month speech to the federal aviation administration the following excerpt of which outlines the development of the naacp from 1905 through 1910 an organization of african american intellectuals led by w e b du bois and calling for full political civil and social and civil rights for african americans this stance stood in clear contrast to the accommodation philosophy proposed by booker t washington in the atlanta coin promise of 1895 you see the niagara movement was the forerunner of the naacp in the summer of 1905 29 prominent african americans including du bois met secretly at niagara falls ontario and drew up a manifesto calling for full civil liberties abolition of racial discrimination and recognition of human brotherhood a forerunner to the united nations u n declaration of human rights subsequent annual meetings were held in such symbolic locations as harpers ferry w va and bostons faneuil hall despite the establishment of 30 branches and the achievement of a few scattered civilrights victories at the local level the group suffered from organizational weakness and lack of funds as well as a permanent headquarters or staff and it never was able to attract mass support after the springfield ill race riot of 1908 however white liberals joined with the nucleus of niagara militants and founded the naacp the following year the niagara movement disbanded in 1910 with the leadership of du bois forming the main continuity between the two organizations dubois and the many other brave men and women of the niagara movement to the reigns of the challenges of there day to lead the niagara movement and now the naacp we too must rise up to take on the challenges of our generation foiinded on february 12 1909 the naacps diverse founders ida wellsbarnett w e b dubois henry moscowitz mary white ovington oswald garrison villiard and william

the floor night after night and talked about what the republicans would do if they were able to take control of the house he talked about all of the things that you know he was talking about that just good government all right ow what is newt gingrich saying they talking about the republican majority are seen by the country as being in charge of a government that cannot function they not my republican colleagues not my good friends in congress they here is a major republican that served as speaker the first speaker in a number of years to serve as the speaker of this house calling his former colleagues and the people that he worked with and his office is right down the hall they because if newt gingrich is saying that this republican congress cannot function cannot run the country like it is supposed to be run cannot oversee the finances cannot make sure that americans have health care and small businesses are able to provide health care cannot give guidance and oversight to the department of defense and secretary rumsfeld cannot make sure that we let oil companies know that we are here to represent the american people and not their special interests not their profits and not their ceos that will retire to a pension making 150 000 a day not because they are that great it is because we have taken the taxpayers money and we have given it to them and now we have republican leaders saying well maybe we need to take the tax cuts back you just gave them and then you read something else no we should not take that tax cuts back because guess what the oil companies have representation in the republican majority period as i said last night a black man with a conspiracy theory but mr ryan i believe and i know and it is documented that the vide president and others sat down vith these oil companies and put this in motion long ago so members walking around here were having press conferences talking down this i do not know what happened i do not i did not see it coming what do you mean you cannot enforce prices it is just insane mr ryan for us to be the country that we are and for the federal trade commission to say well you know we think we have power we do not have the teeth that we need to really find out what is going on with those oil companies but i will tell you this i believe that these oil companiles have been a part of writing this legislation in the way to where that is hard to prosecute them and it is hard to get to the bottom line of who is doing what and guess what when there are no penalties it is h1most like having a house full of kids saying there is no time out there is no discipline whatsoever do as you may and everything in the house will be broken and every picture will be ripped off the wall that is what these oil companies are doing now i do not fault them i fault the republican majbrity and like i said last night mr ryan i am not going to ask them to lead anymore if they want to work in a bipartisan way we are ready to go we have been ready to go and if the american people see fit for us to be the majority party in the 110th congress and they will see an opportunity we will be able to work in a bipartisan way there will be a number of republicans that i do know some of my friends mr ryan and we do know them a very small number on the other side of the aisle see things the way we see it and the way the american people see it i know the reason why the poll numbers are what they are right now the president is not running again but the congress and this house every 2 years we go before the voters like i said last night mr ryan i do not care if it is a local republican committee chairman he or she has to have a problem with the borrowing that has been going on in this republican majority congress he or she must have a problem with the fact that no one can answer the questions on intelligence and the outing of cia agents he or she must have a problem if there are republican committee persons at the local level and on the state level with the fact that the k street project was allowed to operate under this dome by individuals that wore congressional pins that say yes we do have a k street project and yes if you are not on this list you dont get access to this government guess what that was okay we talked about it mr ryan the good thing is it is almost like showing up somewhere at the scene of an accident and saying time and time again we went to the police department we went to the city hall and said we needed a stop light here now look at this fatality i used to be a state trooper i can see it all the time report after report we didnt get the traffic light out there in time and people died because of it well guess what the people were beat down by this republican majority as it relates to good government because not what i am seeing and not what you are seeing mr ryan here is what members on the republican side of this house have said yes we have a k street project then we have a gentleman who admitted you dont have to call the jury you do not even have to assign a courtroom i am guilty i did it that is what this republican lobbyist said not only did i do it but i am going to help you go after some members of congress that were part of it i am going to help you identify other lobbyists that were a part of this great operation the k street project then the republican majority after he said what he said and the federal prosecutors did what they did said we denounce no longer k street project we dont know what you are talking about we will no longer condone it the k street project well mr ryan it sounds like when the president says well i dont know quite what we can do about gas prices but i do know that americans are addicted to oil come on the president and the vice president were part of putting this thing into motion the republican congress rubberstamped mr ryan everything that this administration said they wanted mr president you want tax cuts that you cannot afford so that we can put ourselves in debt and allow foreign countries to own more of america fine mr president the intelligence on iraq is kind of shaky but we hava to do what you want aid anyone who goes against you or says anything against you is unpatriotic and we will have congressional hearings to humiliate those individuals mr president payasyougo i know the democrats are there talking about maybe we need to pay as we go right now since we are in so much debt you want to continue to borrow and spend we got your back mr president because we are the republican congress and we are going to allow you to continue to drive this country in the way that special interests want to drive it because you know something when all the resources are gone and when all the opportunities are gone and when it is american taxpayers that are in debt where will the special interests be that is the question will they help bail this country out of the debt that this republican congress has delivered to them no that is the reason why that members if they are in their offices or they are walking around this building and if they are at home right now they need to sit up in bed and say you know something i need to go to work tomorrow with a new attitude i need to make sure that i fight on behalf of my constituents i need to have the same kind of drive that i had the night that i was elected doing all of those things i said i would do all of those things all of those plans everything i talked about in the campaign about representing whatever district they may be running from in my case the 17th congressional district they call that being born again mr ryan and a baptist term being born again to public service i am excited by the fact that the american people they are not getting it they got it they got it then wewill continue to get it because time after time mr ryan this republican congress has proven that they are their allegiance and i do not

it is called having some guts to do what is necessary but the first thing you did was get rid of the discipline and payasyougo so now you are stuck but more importantly the nation is stuck and so we see this little plea on the morning that we are going to give away almost 1 trillion to the richest people in the nation you have a plea here that maybe the president will stop the bridge to nowhere how about congress stopping the bridge to nowhere how about doing what you were elected to do you dont need a line item veto this isnt about statutes this isnt about vetoes this is about what the congress is to do you walked in here fresh newly elected and you got handed 5 trillion and now you cant stop yourself you cant stop yourself you can stop yourself from giving the people an increase in the minimum wage that hasnt increased since 1997 you cant give those people 70 cents more an hour but you give it away to the richest estates and then you can plead that but for the line item veto we would somehow get to a balanced budget every dollar you are going to spend today tomorrow and every dollar you spent yesterday and the day before came out of the social security trust fund i am sure that america while you are putting away a rainy day fund on borrowed money i am sure america is delighted that you are putting away the estate tax on their social security earnings on their trust fund you are taking their trust fund that belongs to all americans called the social security trust fund and you are raiding it for the trust fund of the heirs of the richest estates in america what a wonderful example today what a wonderful example for young people to learn about our obligations to future generations this is a theater of the absurd you have run the country into the ditch financially you got a 1 trillion war going that you cant figure out how to stop you have stolen most of the money from social security trust fund every year we have a deficit we have a 8 trillion debt and you want to talk about the line item veto you know the government is spending money like a drunken sailor andronald reagan said well at least the sailor was spending his own money you are spending the publics money at a rapid illegal unconscionable immoral rate and you ought to stop but the line item veto wont do it lots of things have changed since 1997 but the value of the minimum wage isnt one of them because of congress failure to act on behalf of the lowest paid workers in america the minimum wage is still just 5 15 per hour 5 15 per hour think about that at 5 15 per hour you would have to work 11 day just to fill a tank of gas at todays gas prices at 5 15 per hour you would have to work for at least 30 minutes just to afford a single gallon of milk democrats have a simple and reasonable proposal we want to raise the minimum wage to 7 25 per hour over the next two years doing so would directly benefit 6 6 million american workers the vast majority of those workers are adults hundreds of thousands of them are parents with children under the age of 18 we have all heard the wellworn economic arguments against raising the minimum wage and we all know they simply arent true the truth is that raising the minimum wage wont hurt the economy and can even help it but forget about economics thats not what this issue is about this issue is about doing whats right and it is just wrong that in the wealthiest and most advanced country in the history of the world millions of adults work fulltime all year and yet still earn an income that leaves them deep in poverty it is just wrong for the republican leaders of this congress to refuse to allow even a vote on raising the minimum wage but what makes all of this far worse is that today once again as it has done so many times during the past several years the leaders of this house are going to push tax breaks for the wealthiest people in this country you know starting in 2009 only the largest and wealthiest 7 500 estates nationwide will pay the estate tax the republican plan to gut the tax on these 7 500 estates will add three quarters of a trillion dollars to the federal budget deficit over the next decade thats trillion with a t lee raymond the former ceo of exxon mobil stands to save as much as 160 million if this estate tax repeal goes through this is the same lee raymond who left his job with a 400 million retirement package why is the republican leadership so worred about people like lee raymond why is the republican leadership constantly looking for new ways to help the absolute richest people in the country when is the leadership of this house going to do something for the lowestpaid families in america if you are born with a silver spoon in your mouth and you stand to inherit millions or

day then you should not have to live in poverty it is well past time for this congress to treat americas working families with the respect and dignity they have earned the choice to provide hundreds
