{"top_correct": [[0.0, 1.0, 1, "a few days ago on september 22 1081 the house passed house joint resolution 220 which called for the conferring of honorary citizenship upon raoul wallcnberg i was absent from the house on official business at the time but if i had been present i would have opposed the resolution and would have voted against it my position on that subject is clearly stated in my separate and dissenting views which accompanied the committee report on the resolution in which i was joined by the gentleman from illinois those viewvs are as followvs sepaate and dissenting virws of hon geonge e danielson and hon henny j hydez i do not agree with the action of thc judiciary committee in reporting the bill flouse joint resolution 220 favorably to the house of representatives i regret that it is necessary to stand in opposition to legislation which is emotionally and politically charged and which appeals to the humanitarian instincts and principles which we all share this opposition can easily be misunderstood or misconstrue to reflect a lack of appreciation for the heroic acts of a fine person under the most difficult of circumstances my opposition is based on other most fundamental considerations i perceive and i cherish american citizenship as the highest honor that our country can confer upon a person who is a citizen of another land the granting of that citizenship is the admission and welcoming of thati person into our national family it mnust not be lightly bestowed and the granting of it certainly should never be used as an acknowledgement of appreciation for in doing so we would be diminishing and demeaning the citizenship of those of us who have bfeen born to this land and to the millions before us who have supported the principles we stand for and have fought and died to fireserve for our country our founding fathers considered citizenship important enough to provide in our constitution that no person except a natural born citizen or a citizen of the united states at tlie time of the adoption of this constitution shall be eligible to the office of presidvrnt as members of the congress we all have had cases brought to our attention of persons who have come here as immigrants aind sought to become naturalized citizens but who because of some past transgression or technicality have been unable to qualify and many of us have used our efforts through private legislation and otherwise to assist those people who have done everything within their power to become american citizens as i have reviewed this legislation i have experienced a feeling of pride in mr wallenbergs fine work he was a swedish citizen all of my ancestors were swedish and i suppose that that ethnic kinship should evoke in me some special feeling of affinity with him it does but not enough to dhminish by one whit the importance of anerican citizenship as i perceive it and i am not alone in perceiving ani rican citizenship as something not to be treated lightly that feeling has been shared by millions of americans our capitol building of which we are so proud was decorated in large part by a naturalized american citizen an italian immigrant named constantino brumidi those who know and love the capitol know and cherish the memory of brumidi brumidi spent most of his life painting the senate wing of the capitol the capitol dome and some other areas the most cherished thing in his life was his american citizenship one of his paintings is the feature of the members private dining room and is signed c brumidi artist citizen of the unitedstates lbrumidi regarded his american citizenship with the greatest of pride and with him i agree our history is replete with instances of fine people who did a great deal for our country yet to them we have not extended american citizenship the marquis de lafayette helped us achieve our independence 200 years ago in his case as in that of our founding fathers he pledged to america his life his fortune and his sacred honor yet we did not grant him american citizenship and then there was casimir pulaski who was also prominent in the american revolution did we extend him american citizenship how about those who have been awarded the congressional medal of honor the highest tangible award that our country can give which is awarded only for bravery above and heyond the call of duty i have been informed that not all of the more than 3 400 who received this medal were american citizens have we conveyed american citizenship upon them i experienced a feeling of pride that mr wallenberg devised a safe conduct passport to make it possible for those whom he helped to escape from hitlers terror it was a remarkable procedure though not without precedent history remembers that during the years immediately after world war i thirty yearsbefore wallenberg another scandinavian the great fridtjof nansen of norway devised a similar passport known historically as the nansen passport to enable many victims of the turkish genocide of the armenian people to escape from the middle east and emigrate to other areas including the united states where many of them today are american citizens some of the cider refugees from that first holocaust have shown me with pride their nansen passports to america we have not made fridtjof nansen an american citizen in the argument favoring the granting of citizenship in this case it was recalled that the united states once granted honorary american citizenship to winston churchill that in fact was the one and only situation in which an honorary american citizenship has ever been granted the importance and intensity of mr churchills relationship to the united states during the period of world war 11 is common kiiowledge and if anyone ever earned honorary citizenship it would have been churchill also churchilli mother was an american citizen which is a significant added factor and in addition he had consented to receiving the honor despite those facts if i had been here in the congress at that time i would not have voted for his honorary citizenship the history of world war ii and its aftermath is filled with the stories of heroic actions by people guided by humanitarian principles we should commend them we should revere them we should remember them and their deeds and we should try to emulate them but that does not mean that we must give away american citizenship to those people i am sure that mr wallenberg was proud of his swedish citizenship as all of us are proud of our american citizenship and i also believe that mr wallenberg did not have need of an additional honorary citizenship to make himself whole any more than any of us feel the need for an honorary citizenship in some foreign land that is true of patriotic people everywhere i do not take away in any respect from raoul wallenberg for the fine and courageous work be did in enabling many to escape from the death camps of adolph hitler his courage his heroic actions are beyond dispute his career and his qualifications are not the issue here the question is whether american citizenship should be granted in recognition so far as we know mr wallenberg has never been in the united states he has never done anything specifically for the united states he has never asked for american citizenship we do not know whether he would want this honor we do not even know if he is alive i cannot believe that we should convey the highest honor that america can convey upon a person under those circumstances finally i feel that there are some things in life which are beyond giving atway it is my view that there are some things which we in the congress simply have nio right to give away and one of those is american citizenship american citizenship is a status which belongs to american citizens everywhere it is not our property to be given away for reasons of emotional and political gratification it is unique the patrimony of the american people and something for us to hold in trust my conscience tells me that i must not and cannot vote for this bill and for that reason i will not vote for it there are some items of conscience which we must not transgress this is one of them"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "during the summer i mailed my 1982 questionnaire to the constituents of the 23d congressional district i represent in

memory to recall his vision for america and to remind my colleagues that it is not only possible for our country to rise to greatness it is necessary to do so lyndon johnson never believed in a diminishing future he believed in growth in dynamism in progress he never believed that this country must live by some sort of economic fatalism he believed that we could control our own destiny he never believed that this nation could or should abide the waste of unemployment the scourge of poverty the numbing blight of ignorance nor the casual inhumanity of injustice lyndon johnson had a vision for his country he believed we could conquer our problems that we could alleviate poverty and indeed his programs did open whole new worlds of opportunity through the vision and unparalleled political skills he commanded president johnson brought decent medical care to the old and the poor he demanded that we no longer tolerate hunger among the people of this the greatest food producing nation in the world he established vast new programs to improve the nations schools to insure that every child got a sound education and to make available a university education to all who could benefit from it he insisted that the poor even the longterm unemployed could be placed into useful jobs through all these and many other efforts he was responsible for a vast reduction in the incidence of poverty in our country where there was no hope he opened hope and where there was hope he insisted that there be genuine opportunity compare that to the experience of today under our present leadership we have not progress but retreat there are millions of newly unemployed there are millions of newly poor no longer do we seek to insure that the poor are decently housed and fed far from it our leadership demands that the hungry should go more hungry our leadership is not one with a vision of what our country could be but one that sees a diminishing futurea world with shrinking hopes not one of growing possibilities lyndon johnson was excoriated as a free spender but the leadership of today the current administration will incur deficits that are 60 times as great as any that johnson would even dream of he was called a radical ex perimenter but he never abandoned the basic principle of sticking with programs that were practical that were proven whose results could be measured compare that to the pie in the sky claims that we heard for supplyside economics nonsense that we are paying dearly for today the present administration likes to say that there is no need to produce new housing for the poor or for anybody else because the marketplace will take care of everything but lyndon johnson knew that this was not so and could not be so if there are millions of people who cannot even get into the marketplace the market serves only people who bnve the means it does not serve those who have no means johnson would have wanted to know how many were without housing what could be done to get them into housing and how to get it done compare that to the breezy callousness of todays antihousing administration there is no way for me or for anyone else to describe the whole complex dazzling being who was lyndon johnson it might be said that he never believed that there was a problem that could not be licked whatever it was he would argue threaten worry demand plead work and pester anyone and anything in his considerable reach until he was satisfied that the matter had been disposed of it might be civil rights it might be interest rates which today are treated as given from godly writbut which he knew were made and broken by men just like him it might be education or any one of a thousand things whatever it was he believed the problem could be solved and he intended to do it compare that to the casual callousness of today when human needs and human miseries are ignored and when not only is no positive action taken every effort is taken to destroy what little help people have available he would never understand would be terribly grieved to see the sorry spectacle that we have today in which misery is compounded in which inequity is heaped upon unfairness in which shameless dishonor is dismissed as practical politics he would be horrified by policies that are nothing more than warmed over 19th century darwinism nothing less than callous disregard of even so basic a thing as providing for economic growthfar from it policies that destroy even that possibility lyndon johnson reached farther than he could grasp but he drove this country to its greatest heights his programs were the most comprehensive humane and effective domestic efforts ever attempted they were also the most effective there is no way to describe the kind of new dreams that were not only made possible but that were achieved thanks to president johnsons efforts he could not understand and would not tolerate a government that was indifferent it is a mercy that he never lived to see the inlifference the outright emptiness that characterizes the present occupant of the white house a man who was a doer could never understand one whose sole mission seems to be to undo do nothing do deliberate and calculated harm i salute the memory and legacy of lyndon johnson no man ever cared so much dared so much or did so much for his country may his spirit endure

sufferer this level of effort contrasts sharply with the economic cost of arthritis current estimates indicate that arthritis now costs the nation as much as 25 billion every year a study in one state found that fully half of all workers compensation claims are arthritis related the cost of workers compensation to insurance carriersand thus to employersresulting from arthritis and other musculoskeletal conditions is over 200 million in california alone musculoskeletal conditions rank first among all disease groups in cost attributable to lost earnings and services from nonfatal illness and they rank second only to circulatory diseases in total economic cost the level of lost earnings and medical expenses resulting from musculoskeletal disorders now exceeds 30 billion annually such conditions account for 20 percent of medicare hospitalization costs in excess of 1 billion each year more than 100 different diseases of the joints and related structures have been indentified as rheumatic diseases other diseases and conditions which are not by definition rheumatic but which affect bones are addressed by researchers under the rubric of musculoskeletal disorders these vary widely in nature and effect their severity ranges from discomfort to severe pain and disability some are life threatening osteoarthritis a disease characterized by progessive joint degeneration affects millions of older americans osteoporosis loss of bone mass occurs in varying degrees in most elderly women nearly 90 percent of women 75 years of age and older have xray evidence of the disease since musculoskeletal conditions are most common in elderly persons and since the aging population is expected to increase substantially over the next several decades the frequency of occurrence and the impact of such conditions will likewise increase unless efforts are focused on means of reducing the incidence of these pervasive health problems millions of our citizens are victims of rheumatoid arthritis a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by fatigue immobility and deformity the disease runs an erratic and frustrating course with periods of both exacerbation and remission it is often chronic and progressive and its cause is not yet known the general public normally views arthritis as a condition affecting older persons but some 250 000 children suffer from one or more forms of this painful and debilitating disease it may affect a variety of organsheart lungs and eyesas well as joints lupus is a serious potentially fatal disease which attacks many tissue and organ systems including joints skin kidneys and heart other forms of rheumatic disease and musculoskeletal disorders include lyme arthritis which is transmitted by ticks scleroderma a serious treatmentresistant disease characterized by hardening of the skin inherited connective tissue diseases such as osteogenesis imperfecta and marfans syndrome rheumatic fever gout and pseudogout the national institute of arthritis diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases the nih research institute which houses the arthritis and musetiloskeletal research programs is a patchwork body that is expected to address a constellation of unrelated research needs from digestive diseases to hematology to dermatology there is no rhyme or reason to the conglomeration of these programs and arthritis and musculoskeletal researcht has suffered as a result the potential economic benefit to the nation and the widespread alleviation of pain and suffering that would result from an increased focus on research in arthritis and musculoskeletal disorders is enormous even a tenfold increase in these efforts could be repaid many times over through lower job absenteeism reduction in the need for attendant care home health care institutionalization medical expenses and reduced workers compensation payments among others the tendency of some arthritis sufferers to turn to quack remedies would be drastically reduced if we were able to imh 8 127 prove treatments cure forms of rlieumatic disease and prevent such diseases people with arthritis often become frustrated to the point of desperation seeking to lessen the pain of their disease nearly 1 billion a year is expended by arthritics on unproven remedies consider the potential for discovery that even a tenth of that amount could mean to millions of americans even with the meager research dollars that currently are expended research investigators have brought us a variety of exciting developments that have increased exponentially the level of our scientific knowledge about many of the 100 forms of arthritis over the past decade genetic markers have been found for several rheumatic diseases including the discovery of h1lab327 in ankylosing spondylitis a spinal arthritis that primarily strikes young men hladrw4 in rheumatoid arthritis which affects all ages and sexes but is most common in women hladrw2 and hladrw3 in systemic lupus erythematosus sle or lupus which often attacks young black women along with whites of childbearing age and hladrw5 in a form of childhood arthritis which affcts the eyes it is now possible to identify populations with a high risk of contracting these rheumatic diseases as a consequence researchers are striving to identify infectious agents or other environmental factors which trigger disease in those people who are susceptible to it but little epidemiological research has been conducted to aid in this search because funds simply are notr available for the same reasonlack of moneyprecious little research has been undertaken to unlock the mysteries of juvenile arthritis similarly there has been a paucity of attention given to osteoarthritis many resca~ch scientists believe they are very close to identifying the causes of various forms of arthritis with accelerated effort prevention improved treatments and cures now are in the realm of the possible some of the areas under active exploration include abnormalities of the bodys immune system and the role of particular viruses and collagens the interrelationship between sex hormone activity and immunologic and genetic factors tissue and bone transplantations lymphapheresis or blood purification and many others in the field of orthopedic and other musculoskelctal research studies of biochemical hormonal and nutritional factors in bone metabolism and mineralization may bring effective treatment and prevention of osteoporosis advances in recent years have made widespread the application of surgical joint implantations currently some 120 000 hip replacements and 40 000 knee joint replacements are performed annually although highly successful in the short term the prognosis for longterm or permanent success of these procedures is not assured researchers are giving attention to corrosion of replacement materials load failures infections and allergic reactions it is imperative that a vigorous attack be launched against rheumatic diseases and other musculoskeletal disorders in my view the instrument for this attack should be the creation of a national institute on arthritis and musculoskeletal diseases my bill would create such an institute within the national institutes of health it is patterned on the statutory authority of other nih research institutes it is based upon and f ollows an evolutionary thread of existing law beginning with the national arthritis act a 1975 measure which established a national commission on arthritis that commission was charged with the development of a long range arthritis plan with specific recommendations for the use and organization of national resources to combat arthritis the commission put together a document that is at once massive in size and comprehensive in scope a plan that reflects the thinking of thp best researchers physicians and other professionals in the field of rheumatology as well as persons with arthritis and parents of children who have arthritis unfortunately neither the national arthritis act nor the plan the law mandated has come close to being implemented because of this and because the need is so great a sharp new focus on arthritis research is imperative that is the reason for this bill which adds to title iv of the public health service act a new part j and establishes a nqtional institute on arthritis and musculoskeletal diseases the institute is directed to undertake research and demonstrations relating to the cause prevention and treatment of arthritis and musculoskeletal diseases to promote coordination of research programs in the public and private sector to make grants for research to establish an information clearinghouse and to conduct research training the director of the new institute is charged with developing a plan for a national program to expand intensify and coordinate activities of the institute and to carry out the plan the national program is exnected to encompass research in epidemiology etiology and prevention of arthritis and musculoskeletal diseases development trial and evaluation of drugs and devices refinement development ard evaluation of implants and prosthetic devices and set up monitoring of the causes of athletic in juries and seek ways to prevent such injuries sportsrelated disorders also are a focus of the new institute the billauthorizes support for new and existing multipurpose arthritis and niusculoskeletal disease research centers and provides a specific funding authorization it also establishes an interagency coordinating committee chaired by the director of the institute the mission of which is to improve coordination of all research and service programs relating to arthritis and musculoskeletal diseases i am absolutely convinced that the creation of a national institute on arthritis and musculoskeletal diseases will result in major advances in the prevention treatment and cure of the most widespread of diseases afflicting americans the current level of funding or only a modest increase for research on rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases along with the increased visibility a separate institute would provide offer the potential for great human and economic benefitto the nation finally it is appropriate and fitting to pay tribute in connection with the development of this legislation to a legendary patroness of the health sciences mary lasker who believes strongly in the need to strengthen the national attack on arthritis as in so many areas of our mutual concern over the years her deep commitment and enthusiasm in this matter have bolstered my own i welcome cosponsors of this legislation and urge my colleagues to add their support to this important proposal henry waxman who so ably chairs the subcommittee on health and the environment which has jurisdiction over the national institutes of health has expressed interest in reexamining the adequacy of funding and visibility of research in the area of arthritis it is anticipated that the bill will be considered in the spring when other aspects of the work of the nih will be before the subcommittee i include the text of the bill at this point in the record h r 5000 a bill to amend the public health service act to establish a national institute on arthritis and musculoskeletai diseases be it enacted by the senate and house of rep resent atives of the united states of america in congress assembled"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "i appreciate the kind words of my good friend mr annunzio and i would like to take this opportunity to thank him for all of his assistance in bringing this legislation to the floor there is no question that without his able advice and counsel we would not be here today and the george washington half would be but a dream we are all aware of george washington and of the many things that he did to shape our republic in its early days however we tend to view him more as a marble statue to be honored than for what he was a very human person who did his best in trying circumstances and created a republic that is still the hope for freedom of much of the world today it is my hope that the issuance of a commemorative coin for his 250th birthday will cause people to think about his life as that of a man who lived rather than just as a historical subject h r 3484 provides for the striking of a special silver dollar by the mint to honor this important anniversary the coins when issued next year will have a composition of 90 percent silver and 10 percent copper identical to the silver coins struck in this country before 1965 they will be available for 2 years 1982 and 1983 and will be legal tender for half a dollar although they will be sold for more than that h r 3484 provides that a maximum of 10 million of these coins will be struck with the actual number issued being limited to those ordered during 1982 the number 10 million is admittedly arbitrary but was chosen as the number most likely to approximate the actual demand for the coin at its maximum demand for the eisenhower silver dollar ran at close to 7 million and while i believe that the washington half will attract more interest i believe that 10 million is a fair estimate in addition i felt that the mint should have some way to plan its production and that a ceiling would probably heighten the interest in the coin and encourage early orders my legislation provides that the price will cover all costs associated with the coin plus a profit of up to 20 percent the sales will be handled according to regulations issued by the secretary of the treasury and all profits will go into the treasury general fund briefly there are three reasons why h r 3484 should be approved first a commemorative half dollar is a fitting way to honor the 250th birthday of george washington second there is a market for the coin and it will provide an american alternative for the millions of collectors and investors who invest in silver coins yearly and are now limited to foreign coins as sqch it will help our balance of trade to some extent third the sales of these coins will provide a profit to the treasury that will help to reduce the deficit in fiscal year 1982 of these three reasons the first the desire to commemorate george washington on his 250th birthday is the most important in honor of this anniversary a silver coin is particularly appropriate as washington took a special interest in the establishment of our nations first mint and was responsible for our first silver coinage personally the establishment of a mint was one of washingtons main priorities when he became president in 1789 but circumstances delayed it for over 2 years in a speech to congress on september 25 1791 he again urged the establishment of a mint to remove the scarcity of small change a scarcity which is so peculiarly distressing to the poorer classes the congress responded to this plea and not only established a mint but also provided for a national coinage system washington took a personal interest in the establishment of this coinage system and intervened when the senate bill provided for the pieture of the current president on the coins instead he successfully urged that a representation of liberty be placed on the coins the next year 1792 he used 100 of his personal silver plate for the minting of the first unitedstates coins silver 5cent pieces according to old mint documents he had not forgotten his concern about the need of the poor for coins and the coins were promptly released into circulation as shown by the heavy wear that most of them exhibit today the coin that you are considering today will not be the first time that congress has decided that a coin is an appropriate way to commemorate an anniversary of george washingtons birth fifty years ago for the 200th anniversary in 1932 a special commemorative quarter was issued supposedly for 1 year only however it proved to be so popular that it remains in circulation today the second reason for passing this legislation is that not only is there a market for the coin domestically but it will also be the first and only american entry in the worldwide silver commemorative coin market although silver coins have not been struck for circulation in recent years many nations sell them at a premium to collectors and investors and make a profit on them one excellent example is the royal canadian mint which this year will offer a commemorative silver dollar honoring the construction of a transcontinental railroad across canada this coin is part of a regular series that canada issues yearly for sale to collectors with a new design each year the coin will be offered to americans in two finishes for either 18 or 14 depending on which is chosen their efforts to attract large numbers of american buyers are shown by the many ads for the coins that have appeared in major american papers including the new york times and the wall street journal the canadians are not the only ones taking advantage of the market the april 29 issue of coin world a major hobby paper lists new silver issues aimed at collectors and investors from austria egypt gibraltar israel poland sudan switzerland and venezuela in addition it displays a prominent ad from the soviet bank for foreign trade offering that nations silver and gold medals for sale silver coins are issued internationally for a variety of reasons the silver institute states in its april newsletter that many nations issued coins for the international year of the child in 1980 and that up to 24 nations will issue them this year to commemorate the international year of the disabled person modern silver coins are sold in the millions each year many of them to american collectors and investors the profits from their sale then goes abroad to the issuing government and helps their balance of trade while at the same time hurting ours american competition would not drive the others out of the market but it would have a wide appeal with the millions of american collectors and investors in addition it would attract some foreign business and would give all the option of buying an american coin nor is the tradition of commemorative coins foreign to this country beginning in 1892 this country issued commemorative silver halfs on 48 separate occasions gold commemoratives on 6 occasions and silver dollars and quarters once each in addition there was a 40percent silver set of coins commemorating the bicentennial the profits that this coin will provide to the treasury are the third reason to support h r 3133 as written the bill directs the treasury to price the coin so that all costs associated with the production and sale of the coin are covered along with a profit to the government of up to 20 percent of the total the exact percentage was left to the treasury so that the coin could be priced at the nearest quarter dollar or so as i mentioned earlier the profits will go to the general fund of the treasury and will help to reduce the deficit for fiscal year 1982 i cannot closely estimate how large these profits will be but if silver stays at about 11 an ounce it could equal up to 15 million if the entire issue is sold while the details of the sale are left to the secretary i would hope that the coin will be promoted through the media and through other outlets such as the mint mailing list in addition if possible i would like to see volume discounts similar to those offered at one time on bicentennial sets given to financial institutions and others to encourage them to offer the coin to their customers at the original issue price if these steps or similar ones are taken i believe that the entire issue would be sold out in conclusion i believe that this coin will provide a fitting memorial to our first president while at the same time offering an american alternative to those who choose to buy silver coins this is no susan b anthony dollar but rather a profitable venture into a proven market utilizing the mints almost 200 years of expertise ameri can coins are traditionally known for their technical excellence and enjoy a wide popularity in the world now an american silver half dollar will meet the same acceptance this will be a popular coin and will be accepted by the american people as a collectors item that honors a great american h r 3434 has the support of the administration and was unanimously approved by the banking committee i would ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "i have but one plea let us do what we do today with our eyes open this republican substitute is no ordinary tax bill it is historic retrogression combined with what we have already done it does redistribute wealth upward from the bottom to the top it amounts to a long leap into the past it is not a new beginning the policies of mr stockman mr reagan and mr volcker are not new policies these are the threadbare remnants of the twenties warmed over they are the trickledown policies invoked by coolidge and mellon and hoover scarcely distiguishable it is said that the president admires more than any of his predecessors former president calvin coolidge because of the tax cuts for the wealthy that were enacted during the coolidge administration and because of the 5 years of bubble prosperity over which mr coolidge presided before the bubble burst those were years of the rich getting richer at least on paper they were years in which worker productivity increased by 43 percent but wages increased by only 8 percent can anybody seriously doubt the reason for the ultimate collapse people simply were not able to buy those things that business was turning out for their consumption hence the glut of goods on the market frantic lastminute price fluctuations nobody able to get out of debt panic on wall street and a final capitulation of the economic structure that was the blind samson of dogma that strained against the pillars of the philistine temples of the twenties and those that it slew in its death were more than it slew in its life that is the dogma of david stockman you can call it supply side if you want to its real name is trickle down it is the belief of george gilder that regressive taxes help the poor and that only the rich have sense enough to invest in things that are good for america that is what is behind kemproth that is not the basic american doctrine it is not consistent with our economic history it is not even sound conservative doctrine respectable conservative economists have denounced it george bush called it voodoo economics it did not work for coolidge and hooever it is not working for margaret thatcher what makes us think it will work for us already with grammlatta ii we have repealed a lot of the carefully constructed work of the new deal the fair deal the new frontier and the great society much of that which we have put in place during the last 50 years to help people now at mr stockmans and mr reagans insistance we have cut social security we have cut job training we have cut meals on wheels we have cut medicare school lunches will cost more bus fares will be higher student loans will be harder to get and harder to repay day care centers and nursing homes will be harder to find home loans if not impossible to get are impossible to pay even the clean water program has been reduced to a trickle i say to my friends that this is not an economic recovery program it is an economic retrenchment program let us be sure that we understand its effect in connection with this proposed tax cut the kemproth cut is not across the board equally it is not an equal percentage cut in taxes paid and nobody can say it is it is a percentage cut in tax rates think what a profound difference that makes coupled with indexing the clear effect is to reduce taxes paid by the wealthy not by 25 percent but probably by more like 40 percent and then to immunize them forever from increases so any future increase in defense needs or education will have to come from payroll taxes or sales taxesin other words from the pockets of the middleincome and the working poor that is what we are sealing into place if we pass this substitute the republican plan could easily wind up with a deficit by 1984 of 70 billion but of course the president has recommended that we cut social security payments over the next 5 years by 70 billion is that how we are to make things come out even must we take 70 billion from social security recipients just so the wealthiest 5 p ircent of our people can have that much more in tax relief do you think that is what those who called you on the phone would really want and if so is that fair to those who did not call you on the phone those 90 percent of your people who have nobody but you to represent them for the past 50 years we have beer building ladders of upward mobility for the humblest people in our society shall we burn those ladders for kindling we have be en building shock absorbers to cushion the blows of economic recession if we take them away the elderly and the disadvantaged who fall through the gaping holes in the socalled safety net will fall on bare concrete let us cut expenses yes let us cut taxes yes but let us

operations the loss of skilled workers who operate these factories is critical when these workers join the ranks of the unemployed or are siphoned off into other occupations america loses a vital resourcethe experience and knowledge built up over many generations of industrial labor we need to enact h r 5540 the defense industrial base revitalization act to help make american industry more competitive if we would find ourselves in a crisis it will be too ate to remedy the decline in industrial plants and their cadre of skilled workers this is why it is imperative that we enact h r 5540 so we can begin the job of restoring the productive capacity needed to sustain our defense posture this bill has several related thrusts it offers financial assistance to modernize aging and industrial plants and equipment it offers training and retraining programs to provide workers with necessary skills it offers means to reduce unitedstates dependence on other nations for strategic materials it provides assistance to institutions of higher learning for obtaining or modernizing equipment needed to train professional and technical personnel and it calls for the development of a national infrastructure strategy so the nations highways rails bridges waterways and other public facilities can speed production and transport defense materiel promptly to our armed forces financial assistance to small and medium size businesses may be in the form of loan guarantees direct loans purchase agreements or price guarantees aid would go to firms defined as critical to the defense effortcurrent or futureby the secretary of defense this is conceived as a 5year program and would be funded at 1 35 billion a year states would share the costs of the skills training programs starting at 10 percent the first year and up to 50 percent in the fifth year h r 5540 emerged from hearings of the economic stabilization subcommittee of the house committee on banking finance and urban affairs these hearings held in washington and many areas of the country including pittsburgh revealed the depressed state of the industrial economy and the dangers this posed to our national security as a representative of a heavily industrialized area i must tell you that small and mediumsize firms are in particularly serious trouble they are struggling to keep from going under without properly targeted help their situation will remain bleak some are saying we should do nothing about this now because the recession is about to bottom out we have heard these same rosy forecasts for well over a year and should view them with suspicion eager as we all are for an economic turnaround we should face up to facts that dramatize the need for the remedies in this bill the findings of a recent survey of over 300 small manufacturers in the pittsburgh area were made available to me by leo r mcdonough executive vice president of the smaller manufacturers council of western pennsylvania the implications about interest rates profits backlog orders and employment struck me as pertinent to this legislation about interest rates i think many people forget that the prime rate is only part of the story at the time of this survey the prime was 16 percent of 224 firms responding about their current debts 38 of them are borrowing at interest rates between 16 and 17 percent 66 are borrowing at 17 to 18 percent 73 are borrowing at 18 to 19 percent 21 are borrowing at 19 to 20 percent 8 are borrowing at 20 to 21 percent and 5 are borrowing at over 21 percent interest i do not have to tell you that these are crippling interest rates to complete the picture 17 firms reported interest rates of 15 percent or lower these morefavorable rates are not really available in the financial market i am told they represent cases where families and friends came to the rescue of small companies that could not afford to raise capital at those typical rates i just cited here is what the survey shows about profits of firms queried 31 percent showed profits up this year 13 percent showed no change and 36 percent showed a drop from last year those who reported gains showed modest increases while those who registered losses showed steep declines moreover if the majority of the 20 percent who did not respond were in the loss column the situation is even worse than these data indicate statistics on backlog orders are particularly significant because they foreshadow the future with a fair degree of certainty the future based on this reading does not look favorable of the firms responding 67 percent report backlog orders down from a year ago only 32 percent report their orders are up i noted earlier that small manufacturers are fighting hard to stay alive the survey bears this out when you look at layoffs and hirings these companies had to lay off 1 444 workers during the past year yet they managed to hire back a good proportion or 1 024 workers a point to emphasize here is that small business is responsible for the employment of over 80 percent of the workers in this country this is not to downgrade the importance of the large industries in fact many of the small firms are subcontractors of large firms however if this measure beefs up the small and mediumsize industries as i believe it will the impact on employment should be substantial throughout the northeastern industrial belt of this country these twin problems of joblessness and declining small businesses is especially severe surveys cannot show everything from talking to the owners and managers of the plants in my area i can report that they are trying valiantly to modernize to keep in the forefront of their technology to remain competitive in home and world markets but they feel the cards are stacked against them these small business leaders constantly remind me that the recently enacted tax incentives do not help them overcome the horrendous costs of borrowing so that they can make a profit and thus enjoy the tax benefits that is why the loans loan guarantees and purchase agreements or price guarantees provided in the bill are needed as the author of a section of this bill that deals with infrastructure i should conclude with a word about that my district like many other urban areas of the nation has not been able to keep pace with the maintenance of its bridges highways streets locks and dams and other public facilities many of these are joint city county state and federal responsibilities i am not trying to point a finger of blame at anybody the evident fact is that deteriorating public facilities are impeding our economy heavy trucks have to circumvent many bridges that are now unsafe in times of national emergency this loss of time could be critical for defense purposes transportation no less than manufacturing is essential for getting material to the right places in the fastest possible tine for these reasons we have called for an inventory of the nations infrastructure needs as a first step in developing a comprehensive and orderly strategy for bringing them up to par an immediate result of launching infrastructure upgrading will be to stimulate employment and the construction sectors of the economy in conclusion this bill is needed for our defense posture and it should have the important side effects of reviving our economy and putting

soviet unions 3 million oppressed jews this year gathering in new york will have special significance for in this past year the soviet union has stepped up their campaign of harassment and

unanimously approved an identical resolution last week second the reagan administration is taking a nononsense approach in dealing with the soviet union a position which has received overwhelming support from the american people passage of this resolution would be a compliment to the administrations efforts it would sent a clear message to moscow that we do care about human rights we do remember names like shcharansky sakarov brallovsky and kislik just last week the galleries of this distinguished body were graced by a visit from famed soviet dissident losif mendelevich i joined a number of my colleagues in paying a richly deserved tribute to mr mendelevich who had been imprisoned for over 10 years in the soviet for his desperate attempts to seek freedom during that time he was forced to endure especially harsh treatment for his strict jewish beliefs the intent of this resolution is to help insure that such grave injustice is halted now and forever in conclusion the treatment of jews in the soviet union is a disgrace that this nation will never accept passage of my resolution will show this in a concrete way at this point i wish to insert the list of cosponsors

somewhat a rewrite of the constitution that i studied in the seventh grade that somehow we have lost our perspective on what we are doing here before we went home for that long recess this body mustered its courage and sustained a veto of a very popular measure 3 billion that was aimed at helping the most depressed industry in america that was a courageous vote and i would like to address my remarks very simply to the people who voted then to sustain the presidents veto i would like members to look at what they are doing if they voted to sustain the presidents veto when it had 3 billion to help the most depressed industry in america and if they in turn vote to override the presidents veto now what members would be saying is i was willing to take 3 billion away from the homebuilding industry the most depressed industry in america free enterprise in practice because the economy required it because we cannot go on bailing out every sector of the american econumy at some point we have to deal with the big problem of government borrowing 50 cents out of every dollar that is being borrowed in the american capital market today what members would be saying by overriding the veto here is that while they were willing to sustain a veto to knock down a housing subsidy they are now willing to override a veto to protect win ceta the postal service and hud i do not think that represents the relative priorities of this house i think most members of this house are willing to hold the line on nonemergency spending i think most members of this body believe that we can hold the line on win and ceta and the postal service and hud without doing any real damage to the social structure of our society i would like simply to conclude by saying that i believe that if we are not willing to hold the line on spending on programs like ceta and win that we are not serious about trying to deal with the deficit problem we are not talking about spending which is going to occur after october 1 during fiscal year 1983 we are talking about spending that is going to start immediately in this fiscal year and i believe that sustaining this veto is one of the most important votes that we are going to cast in the remainder of this session i urge my colleagues to vote no on the motion to override to sustain the presidents veto and to apply to win and ceta and the postal service the same kind of fiscal restraint that we applied to the home building industry that vote was tough this vote ought to be easy"], [0.9804287403821945, 0.01957125961780548, 1, "yesterday members of this house and the senate greeted the 52 american heroes whose captivity in iran ended on january 20 after 444 excruciatingly long days i consider it most appropriate that we commemorate this special occasion by calling up under unanimous consent this resolution welcoming the former hostages and commending those responsible for securing their freedom as the author of this resolution i am proud to note that it is cosponsored by 144 of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle the resolution is offered in a bipartisan spirit it pays an appropriate tribute to our former president jimmy carter former secretary of state edmund muskie and former deputy secretary of state warren christopher for their efforts throughout the crisis but most especially during the final few critical days which proved to be the turning point the resolution offers our gratitude to the algerian negotiators who played such a vitally important role as an intermediary during the last days of the crisis and salutes president reagan for his generous gesture of sending former president carter to meet the freed hostages in west germanya gesture which symbolizes the unity of the american people my resolution also pays a special tribute to the supreme sacrifice made by the eight american servicemen who were killed in the illfated april 1980 rescue mission i consider it absolutely critical that this nation never forget what these patriotic americans did to try and save their fellow citizens from an illegal and immoral captivity at this point in the record i wish to insert their names s sgt dewey l

generaland washingtonians in particulartoday are bask ing in a sense of patriotic euphoria created by the freedom granted to the hostages we know that nothing happens by itself and my resolution seeks to bestow the proper thanks of this house for those who contributed so much to this cause our nation owes thanks to other individuals and countries not mentioned specifically in the resolution but who aided us in this unprecedented crisis the countries of west germany canada and all our western allies who united against iran are to be acknowledged and commended for their actions a special word of praise is reserved for italy which was the first nation to call for the release of our hostages and which fought hard on the diplomatic front on our behalf this nation can be proud of the solidarity which we exhibited throughout this ordeal the fate of the hostages never left our minds and prayers our national resolve was never stronger and most importantly it has been rewarded with this in mind

floor last year and discussed our ability to manage this federal government and to effectively provide competent personnel for our defense establishment last week we passed a budget of approximately 232 billion for defense because we believed that the defense of this country was very important this amendment will directly relate to the ability of our government to hire and retain the kind of people with the kind of ability and quality that is necessary to effectively administer that kind of responsibility and to manage each and every program that this congress has established when we hear of the sanitation director of los angeles and his deputy making more than any of us or our own federal managers and of the mental health director in arizona making 93 000 when we hear of general motors hiring at similar levels we must realize that it is our responsibility to provide salaries whiih are competitive and fair and that wvill allow us to retain and recruit the best people that our

benefits based either upon increases in the cost of living or increases in average wages and salaries whichever were the lesser those who have come to this conclusion that it will save 8 billion quite
