the ongoing crisis of poverty in america and today i also want to draw particular attention to the impact of poverty on our national fight to stop hiv and aids december 1 is world aids day and this year marks 30 years after the first discovery of aids cases the united states and the hiv aids community globally have made tremendous progress in our collective response to this domestic and global crisis we have reduced the stigma surrounding the disease and strengthened education and outreach activities which continue to prevent millions of new cases of hiv worldwide the scientific community has improved the treatment of hiv and aids with antiretrovirals and combination therapies and recent breakthroughs have revolutionized the way we think about aids we have come a long way in our battle against aids contracting hiv no longer has to be a death sentence but we have much more work to do not everyone who is hiv positive has access to these lifesaving therapies for the one in three americans who are poor or near poor hiv can still be the same death sentence that it was during the reagan presidency today nearly one in five americans with hiv do not even know their status and only about half of americans who do know their status are receiving the treatment that they need for the 100 million americans either in poverty or living on the edge of poverty much more must be done access to the drug cocktails highquality health care housing and healthy foods that are all critical for people living with hiv are out of reach for far too many 30 years later we continue to shortchange hiv efforts in povertystricken communities we fail to fully include women in outreach education and treatment and we lack the resources for communities of color this is just simply unconscionable women of color and young gay and bisexual men still receive the most severe burden of hiv in the united states african americans represent approximately 14 percent of the united states population but accounted for an estimated 44 percent of new infections in 2009 and we know the numbers are on the rise in latino communities and asian pacific american communities as well these disproportionate rates of infection are not something that have happened in isolation people of color continue to face higher rates of unemployment incarceration poverty and near poverty than their white counterparts we can and we must do much better than this we must do more for those who are disproportionately impacted by hiv and aids both here in america and around the world we must provide the sciencebased comprehensive sex education that is proven to reduce the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and we must grow past old fears and engage all community stakeholders to truly end the stigma surrounding the testing and treatment of this disease we must repeal laws that legalize and promote discrimination and hate we must support and expand programs which provide critical support for people living with hiv and aids and immediatelymind you immediatelyextend treatment to the thousands of americans on the waiting list for lifesaving drugs and of course we must fully implement the national hiv aids strategy and support medicaid expansion under the affordable care act these policies are the critical next steps in our fight to stop this terrible disease and we must protect the fraction of one percent the federal budget directed to our global aids programs through pepfar and the global fund unitedstates efforts are dramatically reducing the burden of hiv and aids in developing countries and failing to support these programs would have dramatic national security and diplomatic implications for the united statesnot to mention the humanitarian disaster that would occur that is why last week i was very proud to be joined by over 100 members of congress in seeking appropriations of at least 5 25 billion for the pepfar program and 1 5 billion for the global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria and i will enter this letter into the record finally i was proud to have played a role in overturning the unjust and ineffective hiv travel ban in 2008 and now for the very first time in 20 years the international aids conference will be held in washington d c in july of 2012 so let me encourage every member and their staff to engage with the leading

offshore in the arctic ocean an earmark for a few sheep farmers subsidized by unitedstates taxpayers on unitedstates land so they can evade environmental laws that protect bighorn sheep a special

the budget on the backs of the poor our seniors and struggling families across america the republican budget the ryan budget seeks to do just that actually the republican budget really is not serious about balancing the budget at all their budget guts mind you guts food stamps for our families in a time of such desperate need it cripples medicaid and ends medicare as we know it today their budgets

congress will have on this bill we heard from families from maine to florida from rhode island to missouri real people real stories freedom was a common thread in their stories because of health care reform these families are free from worrying about being denied coverage because of a preexisting condition and free from worrying about escalating medical debt because of lifetime caps on their insurance plans these families now have a sense of security and peace of mind for over 37 years thanks to hawaiis landmark prepaid health care act our families have largely been protected from some of

she can now add her 21yearold son and 24yearold daughter to her worksponsored insurance plan this mom used to pay 900 a month for just her daughters health insurance and prescription drugs now she pays 300 a month to cover both of her children under her companys plan this family used to spend 10 800 a year for health care for one child now they spend 3 600 a year for health care for the entire

cover the stem cell transplants and other cancer treatments because of health care reform stacie doesnt have to worry about the twins being denied coverage because of a preexisting condition this

same fate listen to dr odette cohen from willingboro new jersey a small business owner the small business tax credits in the health care reform law not only lower the cost for her to provide good health insurance for her employees but they also give her the flexibility to hire another nurse practitioner shell be seeing more patients and growing her business and helping the economy according to

and defended americas seniors students working families and the fragile economic recovery federal funding for planned parenthood and implementation of the affordable care act both under constant attack from republicans were prevented from being eliminated to the benefit of americans in need of access to health care the republican tea party crusade to eliminate 100 billion in 2011 from domestic discretionary spending and their threats to shutdown the federal government failed at the end of the day this compromise cuts 38 5 billion from the budget yet will yield only 352 million in reduced federal outlays in 2011 according to the congressional budget office cbo this is because much of the funding eliminated in h r 1473 was excess program funds that were never going to be spent anyway h r 1473 is a compromise between democrats and republicans many onerous destructive cuts proposed by the tea party republican house majority in h r 1 were eliminated from this compromise investments in job creation health care reform implementation voluntary family planning services public broadcasting international development assistance and services for homeless veterans are all included in this bill despite republican efforts to gut services for the unemployed the sick women and the poorest of the poor around the world many harmful cuts were avoided in this final bill still there are budget cuts and policy riders in this bill which i strongly disagree with and have a long record of opposing the cuts to the environmental protection agency epa of 1 6 billion or 16 percent will diminish the ability of this agency to protect human health pursue polluters and address the grave challenges presented by global climate change these cuts to epa are wrongheaded and reflect a perspective that corporate profits are more important than regulating pollution and protecting human health i find this objectionable and i will work to continue to fund epas vital regulatory role in

children and pregnant postpartum and breastfeeding womenis a direct republican attack on our societys most vulnerable these are two examples of senseless meanspirited cuts that target lowincome americans funding school vouchers in the district of columbia is a policy i strongly oppose because it undermines public schools and diverts scarce resources away from public 4 education another rider which i strongly opposed prohibits the district of columbia from using its own local tax revenue to provide legal health care services to women this intrusion into the affairs of local government is an example of republican hypocrisy as they impose their ideological agenda on struggling citizens there is no doubt that the federal government is facing a fiscal threat that must be addressed deficit reduction is a priority for the american people for the financial markets and for congress the house republicans hard line on spending masks their policies of increasing the deficit by hundreds of billions by cutting taxes for millionaires and billionaires protecting the defense contractors from cuts to eliminate waste and abuse and heaping generous tax breaks on oil companies and other special interests by focusing all spending cuts on domestic discretionary programs which makes up only 12 percent of the federal budget the republicans advance an ideological agenda but do nothing to repair our nations fiscal situation or strengthen the economy i will not celebrate the passage of this bill but the process that lead us to this point should be instructive to the many sectors of our

likely job losses that will occur as a result of this continuing resolution an independent analysis by the nonpartisan economic policy institute indicates that this bill will result in the direct loss mind you of 800 000 private and public sector jobs instead of doing everything we can do to halt the loss of jobs and put people back to work this bill takes the wrong approach putting our economy and our country back on the path to recession for every job opening in this country we have 4 7 unemployed people who are looking for work why would we want to add to their numbers so be it cannot and should not be our response to this economic crisis not with a 9 percent unemployment rate and over 15 percent in communities of color and record layoffs and furloughs at the state level and especially not when republicans have the temerity to demand tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires paid for through borrowed money this is just wrong and its immoral as a member of the house appropriations subcommittee on labor health and human services and education i am in strong opposition to these cruel cuts budgets are moral documents and they are a reflection of who we are and what we value this spending bill makes it clear that the poor the young women the elderly teachers firefighters cops and the communities that they protect and serve are not valued make no mistake this bill will harm the most vulnerable among us and it represents a wrongheaded approach to reducing the deficit or expanding job growth in our country i am especially concerned about the proposed cuts to education and training programs among the range of cuts include workforce investment act programs which last year helped over 8 4 million job seekers find jobs they got additional education and job training support this is being cut all told when counting rescissions of prior funding elimination of the requested fy11 funding and the advanced funding needed to run these employment and training programs they will experience nearly a 5 billion cut republican cuts in job training will only prolong the recession keep unemployment high and keep more americans collecting unemployment instead of training and getting ready for our 21st century job opportunities how can we justify cutting job training programs in the middle of an economic crisis how will my republican colleagues respond to the unemployed in their communities who come to them and ask them for help will they just say so be it pell grants pell grants provide vital funds for students who wish to attend 2 and 4year colleges but who need help to pay their expenses in my district alone there are 16 institutions that provide pell grants to over 18 000 recipients this proposal would cut pell grants by 845 making college less affordable and accessible for lowand moderateincome students more than 8 million students benefit from pell grants and many would be hurt by this cut especially as schools are raising tuition fees to meet rising costs and to deal with tighter budgets the bill also entirely eliminates federal funding for supplemental educational opportunity grants which colleges and universities use to assist undergraduates who have the greatest financial need that program assisted 1 3 million college students last year head start under this proposal is cut by nearly 1 1 billion this will effectively knock out 200 000 children mind you in republican and democratic districts from participating in this critical early education program this helps provide health nutrition and supportive services to prepare our children for school the job corps program this program is cut by 891 million which will result in 21 384 jobs lost in communities in every state the majority of which are in the private sector there will be 1 7 billion lost in economic activity as a result of this and 36 000 atrisk young people will be turned away from job corps costing the government and the economy as much as 17 billion over the course of their lifetimes additionally the cuts will guarantee the closure mind you of 75 job corps centers across the nation in your districts and in our districts slashing one of the most effective accountable and marketdriven solutions for millions of youth who leave our schools unprepared is really the wrong move at the wrong time the majority has stated that they want to cut the deficit but

today to sound the alarm because make no mistake about it the fundamental right to vote which is at the heart of our democracy it is under attack republican legislators and governors are proposing partisan laws that require voters to show governmentapproved photo ids before voting now i came to this floor years ago after the stolen presidential elections in florida and in ohio to protest the results of those two elections that were filled with voter suppression it worked for the republicans before and so legislators in 42 states on this map of shame have doubled down on these strategies to make it harder for certain communities to vote these proposals would disenfranchise 21 million americans thats over 1 in 10 eligible voters in america who do not have adequate identification now how in the world for example would my 100yearold aunt get her birth certificate to prove who she is to get a government id to vote she wouldnt know where to start nor how to pay for it and its no coincidence that a disproportionate number of these disaffected voters come from communities of color as well as the poor the elderly and students fully one in four otherwise qualified african americans would be unable to vote under these voterid laws around one in five asian americans latinos and young adults between the ages of 18 to 24 would be blocked in my home state of california a voterid bill was introduced to suppress voter participation it would cost 26 just to get the required documents to qualify for a governmentissued id now having been born and raised in texas this certainly looks like a poll tax to me which those of us remember as a way to prevent african americans from voting these voterid laws have a partisan agenda seeking to disenfranchise and deny specific populations of voters before they have the opportunity to elect their representatives in government these partisan laws are shameful and theyre a disgrace to our country if these republican lawmakers were truly concerned with fighting voter fraud they would take on actual documented problems such as distributing fliers with false information meant to trick voters improperly purging voters or tampering with election equipment and forms instead they are pushing laws designed to change election outcomes by reducing voting repressing turnout and turning the clock back to the days of jim crow this is the exact opposite of where our country needs to go with almost 40 percent of eligible voters regularly staying away from voting booths we need to be expanding participation in our democracy making the ballot more accessible not less we cannot and we must not allow democracy to be undermined especially while were promoting democracy abroad we must unmask these shameful attempts to disenfranchise voters lets stop this partisan effort that strikes at the very core of our country lets win this war against voters we should be about dismantling and reducing barriers so that we can

that ensures that america retains its superiority in education innovation and research we must cut waste and close the huge tax loopholes written by lobbyists like the ones for oil companies but congressional republicans do not do this instead of tackling the debt and deficit in a smart and strategic way the congressional republicans scheme will result in job losses and it will make economic recovery more difficult for american families and businesses and here are some stark examples from the community i represent back in florida in the tampa bay area first on education and the pell grant i represent an education community with a large public research university a private college and many community colleges when the republicans propose cutting the pell grant and support to students this harms our ability to maintain our superiority in education when we are competing with countries all across the globe you know over 9 million students and families rely on the pell grant every year in america and we have worked very hard through the economic recovery to help those students maintain that same level of pell grants so dont take us backwards you shouldnt be taking us backwards do you know what its like for a hardworking family to pay tuition right now is tuition going down is tuition being cut are books being cut no so lets not turn our backs on our students and families at

toddlers on the early start list the republican cuts again take us backwards i hear from back home that 452 families will be told that there is no room for their child they will also lay off 123 teachers just in my home county alone because in the state of florida they predict that they will have to lay off almost 2 000 teachers under your cuts schools and students the republicans again are off base in cutting my local schools particularly the title i schools that serve kids that need a little extra attention we estimate that republicans will be eliminating 20 to 30 jobs in my home district that serve students that need that achievement gap boost you are harming the high poverty middle and high school students also in the county across the bay that recently was able to expand beyond elementary school madam chairman rather than close the tax loophole for the oil companies that are making multibillion dollar profits the republicans instead cut my local police and sheriffs

have received national awards from the attorney general and it would be a real shame if we had to turn these back also in my home county we rely on some very robust ports in the tampa bay area as our economic engine you are going to cut that support for that economic engine to dredge the canals and ports so the ships can come in and we rely on those for jobs you also are going to cut the national oceanic and atmospheric administration now after the gulf of mexico suffered the economic hit under the bp oil blowout our coastal communities were hurt badly the tourism industry the seafood industry and our wildlife habitat suffered significant damage so coming from florida when you all say that you are going to turn your backs on our ability to monitor our oceans that is very harmful because clean oceans and clean beaches mean a healthy economy certainly closing the oil company tax loophole would be a wiser course of action we all know how harsh it has been under the great recession with foreclosures it has hit us especially hard so hard that a local expert told me yesterday that the republican budget cuts to the magnitude being considered would greatly and immediately increase

heartbreaking experiences that i have had as a member of congress is to watch this congress attempt to balance the deficit and the budget on the backs of infants on the backs of children who need their educational opportunity and on the backs of seniors we have seen gargantuan efforts to cut medicare the main program to prevent poverty for our seniors medicaid the women infants and children program nutrition programs for children efforts to decimate educational opportunities for young people while we refuse to end tax breaks for big oil the big five companies made nearly a trillion dollars 1 trillionin profits in the last decade and yet we continue to insist on providing tax breaks for these profitable companies every year we provide subsidies to oil companies that they pocket in addition to that we are cutting food from babies i saw numerous numerous amendments to cut moneys for lactating moms pregnant women and newborn babies while we refuse to end the tax breaks for millionaires we cannot afford another 800 billion in tax cuts for the top 2 percent in our country this is backwards this is unamerican i join my democratic colleagues from the house budget committee to expressin no uncertain termsthe basic principles we are fighting for in this budget agreement i also want to state my support for my colleagues from the house of representatives who are working hard to negotiate an agreement that demonstrates both decency and fairness i have had the honor of serving on the budget committee for twoandahalf years and i have learned a thing or two through my service i also brought my own budgetary expertise to the tableas a former legislator for the state of wisconsin as a former community leader and as a former and current head of household i knowand all of us here know though we are not all admitting itthe fundamental truth that any budget agreement must take a balanced reasonable approach towards deficit reduction we cannot simply slash spending while preserving every nickel and dime of tax breaks for giant corporations and multimillionaires as we stand here today the leaders from both parties and their staff are working roundtheclock to chart our path forward the american people have expressed their concern about our national debt and deficit and the congress has responded we are on the brink of making new and historic policy changes that will be very difficult to undo we have the unique opportunity to make the right choice to end a wide array of gratuitous tax loopholes that will save billions upon billions of dollarsand in the end will help us to preserve the priorities that are so crucial for wisconsins fourth district and for people all across this country we have the opportunity to choose to trim down the debt by cutting tax subsidies for oil companiesinstead of cutting nutrition programs for women infants and children wic we have the opportunity to choose to reduce the deficit by cutting ethanol subsidiesinstead of cutting medicare this is nothing short of an historic moment in time we cannot turn our backs on these opportunities my democratic colleagues at the budget negotiation table have assured us many times that revenueraisers must be part of the solution unfortunately their republican counterparts have not offered us similar reassurance were already in desperate need of a just and decent tax code that actually requires our nations most successful wealthy people to pay their fair share we recently learned that one of the largest unitedstates corporations general electric paid no federal taxes in 2010 ge claimed a 3 2 billion tax benefit on reported worldwide profits of 14 2 billion including 5 1 billion from its operations in the united states and thats just one example other corporations are able to pick from a long menu of tax breaks that allow them to reap profits while shipping jobs overseas we just celebrated the 10year anniversary of the bush tax cutsso we have timely concrete data showing us what happens when you slash income tax rates thenpresident bush promised that his tax cuts would starve the beast reducing revenues and thus forcing members of congress to reduce the size of the federal government he claimed that low taxes would stimulate the economy and increase the prosperity of our nation he vowed that tax breaks would create jobs and generate wealth for all well we now know the truth most of the benefits accrued to the rich the tax cuts didnt spur job growth during the 2001 to 2007 business cycle americas economy enjoyed the slowest rate of jobs growth on record since world war ila rate that was just onefifth the pace of what we saw in the 1990s highwage earners income increased but inequality just got worse government didnt get smaller in fact we saw massive expansion in the form of new programs like medicare part d and two new wars in addition to the cautionary tale of the bush yearswhat weve seen over the past 30 years is that lower marginal tax rates have not led to particularly impressive economic growth labor markets or revenues growth was actually more impressive back when marginal tax rates were higher the verdict is in we need to reform our tax code now for the sake of fairness and for the sake of our economy we cannot continue to fight tooth and nail for special interests for the sake of justifying unprecedented cuts to everything from education to health care to infrastructure to public safety we cannot protect the wealthy few at the expense of tens of millions of lowincome and workingclass families there is no excuse for this we can and we must do better we all know well have to make hard choices to come to an agreement but my democratic colleagues also know that we must do all we can to preserve our economic progress create jobs and preserve programs that serve struggling families we must reduce the deficitbut we must do it while adhering to basic principles of fairness and morality"]], "top_incorrect":

black caucus budget came up i think mr mulvaney came up with a budget proposal they put the presidentsa very very watered down and inaccurate version of the presidents budget up there and weve been talking budget when we talk about the budget what were talking about is the values and priorities of america its important to keep this in mind what shows up in your budget is what you care about what does not show up in your budget is what you dont care about now i always caution people not to just take their family budget and the united states budget and assume theyre basically the same thing one just is bigger than the other thats not exactly accurate there are important differences and we shouldnt mix up the two but in this way they are similar in that they reflect what it is that people value if you have a family and their budget you can look at their budget they spend a lot of money on entertainment you can pretty much figure they value that if they put a lot of money into food you can figure they definitely think that is a priority for them you can go through the family budget and see what people spend their money on see what people dont have in their budget and then you can pretty much figure well maybe thats not a priority for them of course they may not be able to afford it at this time but if you talk about reasonably middle class people their budget reflects what they care about what matters and what doesnt and for our nation that certainly is true if our nation puts more money into warfare than it does into social uplift jobs and the economy and infrastructure that says something about who we are if our national budget puts more money into infrastructure and jobs and putting people back to work then that says something about who we are the various budgets that have come up reflect what the various caucuses think is important and project a vision for our country i want to talk about that today i want to start by talking about paul ryans budget paul ryan is the republican budget committee chair hes a nice guy i dont have anything bad to say about him personally because he is actually a nice person but the fact is we disagree in a significant way about what the priorities of america should be for example the republican budget 20 children will lose access to head start to pay for one millionaires tax cut thats their budget just if you want to understand what their tax cuts represent it means 20 kids dont get to go to head start so that a millionaire can get a tax cut150 000 equals 20 times 7 500 so if you look at this tax cut a millionaires tax cut which will amount to about 150 000 these little guys dont get to go to head start now what is head start head start is a great program for lowincome kids to make sure that they have a chance at getting a quality education and dont fall behind in school and so this is a great program it has great results these head start kids 20 of them going to head start versus what a millionaires tax cut would be which is 150 000 now this is the choice were making we should not act like were not making choices we are making choices we are deciding my friends on the republican side of the aisle like to say oh we shouldnt pick winners and losers were always doing it they just pick the rich people and weipick the kids in head start also if you just want to get a sense of what the republican budget what it does and what the tax cuts that its calling for mean republican budget 150 college students will have their pell grants cut by 1 000 to pay for one millionaires tax cut so one millionaires tax cut 150 000 but 150 times 1 000 all these kids these college kids trying to make something of themselves their pell grant is going to get whacked by 1 000 bucks so again choices do we want to make sure the country club set is doing even better or do we want to make sure that these aspiring engineers these aspiring doctors and teachers these aspiring police officers these aspiring workers of tomorrow will have a shot at an affordable college education this is what were talking about these are the choices that were making and i think its very important that americans know it its critical that we know it now lets just not stop there lets talk about other critical choices being made because i think it is so critical that as were talking budget week and all the budget decisions that we are making that we make it real clear to the american people what it is were choosing republican budget 216 pregnant or postpartum women infants and children would lose access to wicthats the women infants and children program and it provides food for poor women and their kidsto pay for one millionaires tax cut so 150 000 tax cut for a millionaireagain this is the country club setequals about 216 pregnant women or postpartum women and the amount of money that americans give them so that they can have good nutrition for their kids these are poor women these are women who are struggling economically but just because theyre struggling economically we dont want their kids to go without good nutritious food so as americans we have the wic program well theyre going to get slashed out of the program because a millionaire needs a tax cut thats the choice that were making i want to talk about why were making that choice in a minute but i want to give one more example republican budget 25 seniors paying 6 000 or more for medicare to pay for one millionaires tax cut so if youre a millionaire and you get a tax cut under what the republicans want to give youyoure already doing good but they want you to even do betterthat will mean that youve got about 25 seniors who have to pay 6 000 a piece more for their medicare so mom dadif youre my age mom and dad are senior citizens if youre younger theyre not but if your parents or grandparents are on medicare and theyre doing all they can on their fixed income to make it theyre going to need a little extra help because weve got to make sure that that millionaire gets his 150 000 tax cut these are the choices that were making now my friends in the republican caucusgod bless themits not like they dont like poor people many of them are very charitable they give in their different walks of life maybe their faith community or whatever they just dont think government should do it this is what they say they think that government needs to get out of that and let churches mosques synagogues and other folks do it of course that would mean that it wouldnt get done because even though churches mosques and synagogues do great work they can never possibly come up to meet the need thats out there what theyre really believing isthis is what they really believe they believe in something called trickledown economics they believe that if you give this millionaire 150 000 more dollars than he already has he will maybe hopefully perhaps invest it in plant and equipment and maybe somebody will get a job because of it or maybe not or maybe he will invest in china hell improve jobs but just not in america nobody knows what they will do with this tax cut but this is what the republicans believe they think that if you give rich people more money they will invest in plant and equipment create more economic activity and it will trickle down to the rest of us the only problem is that it has never worked it doesnt stop them from saying it but its never worked in fact the gop budget will destroy more than 4 million american jobs in the next 2 years according to the economic policy institute the economic policy institute estimates that the shock to aggregate demand from nearterm spending cuts would result in roughly 1 3 million jobs lost in 2013 and 2 8 million jobs lost in 2014 or 4 1 million jobs through so a little bit more than 4 million jobs over the next 2 years now people might think well keith is that right well yeah its right and ill tell you why its right its right because when republicans say we need to cut government waste we need to cut government cut government cut government they act as if theres just some big government thing over there like its a big giant piece of styrofoam and they can just cut it and it doesnt change anything what theyre talking about cutting are federal workers theyre talking about laying off federal workers and theyre very derisive about government jobs and act like people who work for the government dont do anything of valueof course this is not true at all but if you look on this chart right here it says i earn less than 45 000 a year explain to me gop how cutting my pay creates jobs this particular person is named paul and he is an army depot worker i think we need army depot workers teresa is a nurseand this is her right here she lives in my district and she says twelve percent of the salary i earn caring for veterans goes to my retirement explain to me gop how cutting my retirement puts people to work well one of the things that they do in the ryan budget is cut into federal workers retirement they act like oh the government no the government is people the government is nurses the government is army depot workers and what about federal prisons that keep dangerous criminals behind bars i pay more than 9 000 a year for my familys health insurance explain to me gop how cutting my takehome pay lowers unemployment this guy is a corrections officer and thank goodness for correction officers or the streets that we live on wouldnt be so nice the bottom line is when republicans say oh were going to shrink the size of government what they mean is theyre going to lay off and cut the pay and cut the employment benefits of federal workers people who work in prisons at risk to themselves nurses who care for our veterans people who are army depot workers and people who work in our parks and people who fix our roads and a whole lot of other people heres a chart for you if you look at the ryan budget if you look at the gop proposal if you look at it and it could do what they want it to do it could cause a loss of up to 7 million jobs by 2016 because it would cut federal workers and then they wouldnt be able to have the money to spend in the neighborhoods they live in anymore that would then have a ripple effect in their neighborhoods because theyre buying less for example if that young nurse at the va in minnesota if she doesnt have the same pay as she had before then she cant buy as much as she bought before then the company she shops at doesnt sell her as much as they have before you do that enough multiply it times enough people and that company then needs to start laying off people so its a ripple effect what the republicans are asking for but if you look at what they wantedand im talking about going all the way back to h r 1 which is their proposalyou would see repealing health care reform that would cut about 2 million the gop budget that would cut about 3 million cuts to the federal workforce that would cut about 285 000 the socalled jobs act that would cut a lot the fair tax that would cut and they would just cut on down the line what theyre basically proposing is by shrinking government and by doing all that stuff theyre getting rid of people now i just want to be on the record because your words do get twisted if there is a federal program that is not justifiable and its so poorly run that its of no value to anyone im okay with cutting it i just want to say that on the record on the house floor im all right with cutting programs that dont work but when youre talking about va nurses and youre talking about corrections workers in federal prisons we need these people they do good stuff and i believe that we should stand by them as they stand by us the gop budgetnow going back to the budget we addressed todaywill shift costs to seniors for the medicare guarantee according to the aarp and whats aarp thats the leading organization representing retired persons and the cbowhats the cbo that is the congressional budget office and for folks who like to watch cspan id just say you need to know what cbo is because this is very important congressional budget office theyre the nonpartisan group that says whats really going on with the numbers at the same time it is raising the seniors cost this gop budget gives those making more than a million a year an average tax cut of about 394 000 so i put 150 up there a moment ago that was the generic millionaire the actual number is about 394 for the average millionaire per year on the average tax cut and also the tax breaks for big oil companies you know they get about 4 billion a year im talking about if you look at conoco exxonmobil and all the big oil companies they get about 4 billion a year now how much did you pay for gasoline im not saying that theyre not good people im not saying that they dont run a good business and supply an important product im just asking you this does exxonmobil really need your money through a tax subsidy do they i think that they dont need your money i think their 4 a gallon is taking care of them just fine and i think its outrageous that the republican budget that we dealt with does not eliminate that tax break in short the big oil companies who are gouging americans at the pump and the wealthiest americans win while middle class and working class families get the short end of the stick last year oil profitsand this is an exact number or close to it last year big oil profits totaled about 137 billion but you dont need to remember 137 billion all you need to remember is big oil profits were the biggest ever that the oil industry ever had and yet were forking it over to them through our tax money not through the pumps some people might think well of course were paying them keith through the pump they give us gas weve got to get to work so we need to buy the gas im not talking about that im saying they getthey can apply for grants and subsidies and it all adds up to about 4 billion a year with soaring gasoline prices big oils 2012 profits will even be bigger yet republicans want to give big oil more money in our tax dollars and it just doesnt make any sense now of course you shouldnt expect the big oil companies like exxonmobil to say we dont want the money of course they want the money who doesnt want money everybody does including them but the people who have a public responsibility to look out for the american people should be willing to say no to public subsidies for the exxonmobils of this world and again if you work for exxonmobil im not running you down im just saying that youre doing well enough and you dont need the help of the american people you can do fine on your own now those kids on head start need help they need help those college kids need help but not exxonmobil executives the major consequence for medicare and medicaid the ryan budget the republican budget has big consequences for medicaid and medicare many seniors will be forced to pay sharply higher premiums to stay in traditional medicare and keep their current choice of doctors new medicare beneficiaries would pay more than 1 200 more by 2030 and more than 6 000 by 2050 before more seniors would gradually shift to private health insurance plans over time increasing privatization of medicare more than 47 million americans would lose health care insurance over 10 years because they would get rid of obamacare now my friends in the republican aisle when they say obamacare they dont mean it in a nice way its an insult but you know what obama does care so i dont mind them saying obamacare i hope they keep saying it because theyre just reminding americans that obama cares about them and that the people the republicans want to look out for apparently do not states under the republican plan would be forced to slash medicaid eligibility benefits and payments to health care providers their budget shreds the medicaid safety net and shifts health care costs to states and beneficiaries blocking medicaid this shifts all risks including future recessions health care cost increases and disasters to states and beneficiaries so heres the thing this ryan budget this republican ryan budget it helps and takes care of the rich it ignores everyone else and it hurts the middle class the republican budget would weaken the middle class in important ways first and foremost their plan ends the medicare guarantee of decent health insurance in retirement it also slashes critical middle class investments such as education and infrastructure by 45 percent and 24 percent respectivelyeducation by 45 percent infrastructure by 24 percent now look the american society of civil engineers has told us that we have crumbling infrastructure in this country to the tune of about 2 2 to 3 trillion a lot of money and if you are living in any city across this country you can drive over 75yearold bridges you can drive over potholes our sewage systems need upgrade i am from minneapolis minnesota a city i love so much but back a few years ago we had a bridge fall into the mississippi river because the gusset plates which are those plates that hold up the bridge gave way because the adequate maintenance just wasnt maintained over time now it happened to us but it could happen anywhere there are many structurally deficient bridges across this nation literally thousands we could put people back to work if we put the money into taking care of them and not only would we have people working wed have to save bridges to go over but the republican majority to use their phrase kicks the can down the road and doesnt deal with this looming infrastructure crisis so let me just say this ive talked a little bit about the socalled ryan republican budget i dont want to spend all my time talking about it but i do think its important for americans to know that this is a budget for the 1 percent this is a budget for people whove got it well who are doing fine now let me just tell you i swear i am a big fan of welltodo people i wish i were one of them but my point is that you dont need to help people who already have a lot of help on their own but you do need to help schoolkids head start kids pregnant moms pregnant lowincome moms seniors these people we should help people who are doing fine they dont need our help they should do the helping in my opinion and yet the ryan budget says were just going to help the country club set and i think thats not any way to have a budget im going to talk about the progressive caucus budget but i just want you to know first that the ryan republican budget is no good budget for america in fact its premised on the theory that rich people dont have enough money and poor people have too much really thats the animating organizing feature of their budget that if we gave rich people more money then they might invest it in plant and equipment and then itll trickle down to the rest of us and poor people have too much stuff we cant afford it we cant afford head start cant afford wic cant afford home heating oil for seniors cant afford medicare cant afford medicaid the poor folks are just theyre getting treated too well and thats basically what the theory is of the republican budget and so thats fine and i respect them for being real honest about what they believe in because a budget is a reflection of our values so now that weve talked about what theyre talking about lets talk about a real budget not for the 1 percent but a budget for all the progressive caucus budget has a name the name of the progressive caucus budget is the budget for all thats the name of the progressive caucus budget because unlike the republicans budget which is a budget for the 1 percent this is a budget for all let me tell you what it does it creates 3 3 million jobs in the first 2 years it cuts the deficit by nearly 7 trillion 6 8 trillion no benefit cuts to medicare medicaid and social security the budget for all makes the american dream a reality again for the vast majority of americans by putting americans back to work the budget for all enhances our economic competitiveness by rebuilding the middle class and investing in innovation and education our budget protects medicare and medicaid social security invests in americas future and asks those who have benefited the most from our economy to pay their fair share now as i said you cant have a budgetyou can have a budget that cuts taxes for rich people if you then cut services for poor people and you can have a budget that pays for infrastructure and education but the money has to come from somewhere and we ask people who already have lots of it to do a little more for their fellow americans were not hiding that fact yes we would raise taxes on the wealthiest americans not to punish them because we dont think taxes are punishment but because its necessary to meet the needs of the nation and any selfrespecting patriot would do so if they could in fact there is a group out thereand i would urge you to check them out mr speakercalled patriotic millionaires who understand that they may need to pay higher taxes if you already are making a million dollars a year would you pay a little extra just to make sure that lowincome pregnant women got some food for their kids if you are already making a million or more a year would you pay a little extra to make sure that little kids had head start to go to if youre already making a million dollars a year would you pay a little extra just to make sure that the federal workers dont have their pensions cut to pay for your tax cut thats just my thinking i dont want anybody to think the republicans are mean they do charitable work in their individual lives and thats a fact and i think people ought to know that but they dont think government has any role in helping people i disagree with that and call on americans to look carefully at the choices that they offer the budget for all is not a budget for the 1 percent its not a budget for the 99 percent but a budget for all because we care about the 1 percent too we want even the 1 percent to live in a good nation with fairness with economic opportunity with economic mobility with good roads good bridges good education clean water clean air we want this for everyone the budget for all attacks americas persistently high unemployment levels with more than 2 4 trillion over 10 years in jobcreating investment this plan utilizes every tool at the governments disposal to get our economy moving again including directhire programs that create school improvement corps park improvement corps student jobs corps and others targeted tax incentives that spur clean energy manufacturing cuttingedge technological investment in the private sector widespread domestic investment including an infrastructure bank a 556 billion surface transportation unlike this thing that they tried to pass today which is a 3month extension by the way can you believe it the republican caucus is always going on and on about uncertainty what did they do they created uncertainty by passing some 3month transportation bill my goodness it boggles the mind actually back to the budget for all there is approximately 1 7 trillion in widespread domestic investment unlike the republican budget the budget for all substantially reduces the deficit and does so in a way that does not devastate what americans value we achieve these notable benchmarks by focusing on the true drivers of our deficit unsustainable tax policy wars overseas and the policies that helped cause the recent recession rather than putting the middle class and the social safety net on the chopping block the budget creates a fairer america it ends tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of americans on schedule at the years end extends tax relief for middle class households and the vast majority of americans creates new tax brackets for millionaires and billionaires in line with the buffett rule principle eliminates tax code preferential treatment for capital gains and dividends abolishes corporate welfare for oil gas and coal companies eliminates loopholes that allow businesses to dodge their true tax liability creates a publicly funded federal election system that gets corporate money out of politics for good it responsibly and expeditiously ends our military presence in afghanistan leaving america more secure at home and abroad it also adapts our military to address 21st century threats through modernization the department of defense will spend less and stop contributing to the deficit but they will have what they need to keep america strong which is very important to all of us it provides a makingworkpay tax credit for families struggling with high gas and food costs extends an earned income tax credit and child dependent care credit invests in programs to stave off further foreclosure invests in childrens education by increasing education training and social services the budget for all is a budget for all i know that sounds repetitive but its important to note that the name of our budget reflects the reality of our budget and the reality of our budget is that we want to see rich poor and everybody in the middle do well in america that means a budget for all as i begin to wind down i just want to say that it is an honor to come before you to talk about the budget for all but its also an honor to talk about the ryan republican budget because the ryan republican budget offers a very different vision of america than the budget for all the ryan vision says that if we just could get rich people more money they might create some plants and equipment that will hire the rest of us the budget for all says no were in this together and were going to ask the wealthiest to pay more to invest in health education transportation and infrastructure so that we can have a stronger better greater america two visions of a nation one says austerity for the middle and working class and the poor and one says investment one says if you are out of luck youre on your own and one says as americans were all in this together i want to thank you for allowing me to be here and offer these contrasts these choices for americans as we close out what i call budget week i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.9966930150985718, 0.9966930150985718, 0, "every day and every week you speak on this floor about the afghanistan war and previously about the iraq war and you carry a message that is extremely important one that i agree with and one that i would hope that our colleagues here in congress would take up this issue in a very strong and determined way to bring this afghanistan war to an end i thank the president for bringing the iraq war to an end and now theres yet another task for all of us to do and that is to end this continued use and abuse of the american soldiers they endure much and its time for us to bring them home we thank them for their service we see them as they return some of my colleagues and i are working on a major effort to try to deal with more than 365 000 of those men and women that have returned that are suffering from posttraumatic stress syndrome dealing with everything from suicides to depression and other issues as they return home and many of them still in the military dealing with those issues we also have the traumatic brain issues and so theres much to be done and there will be much more to be done for those that are currently suffering and the longer this war in afghanistan continues the more men and women will be suffering from all sorts of medical physical and mental issues so walter thank you so very much for what youre doing here on the floor day in and day out and reminding us that its time for us to end this war what i want to spend some time on today is really talking about americas middle class the middle class in america has suffered for the last 25 years the american middle classs circumstances have stagnated and in the last 5 yearsactually 6 yearshave seriously declined weve seen this in the statistics weve seen them in the economic statistics the only way the american middle class has been able to sustain its economic position has been for both husband and wife or children to join in providing the income for the family its no longer a singleperson income sustaining the american middle class it is about our policies here on the floor of congress and the senate that has led to the decline of the american middle class specific policies have been enacted over the last two decades that have hollowed out the opportunities that the american middle class has counted on specifically manufacturing in america once 20 million americans and their families were in the manufacturing sector they enjoyed a good salary a good hourly wage was available to them such that one individual in that family working in the manufacturing sector was able to support the family own a home take a vacation buy a boat provide for the college education that is not the case today only 11 million and a few thousand beyond that are actually engaged in manufacturing in america today so what happened to the 9 million they lost their jobs those jobs disappeared not from the earth but disappeared from america they went overseas they were outsourced american jobs were outsourced why well theyd like to say its simply the nature of the free market system and indeed thats part of it but thats not all of it a major part of it had to do with specific tax policies and other manufacturing industrial policies that were enacted by congress and remained on the books for some 20 years or more we need to address that issue because if in fact it is the policies of this congress and previous congresses that have led to the great outsourcing and decline of the american manufacturing sector and along with it the american middle class then theres something that we can do about it we make laws we establish policies and if we find that there are policies that are contrary to the good ability of the american economy to prosper and the middle class to prosper along with it then we ought to change those policies thats what the make it in america agenda is all about the make it in america agenda is specifically designed to rebuild the american manufacturing sector this is an issue thats been taken up by the democratic caucus led by our minority whip mr hoyer and carried on by my colleagues and i so were going to talk a little bit about that i notice that my colleague from new york has joined us mr tonko we were going to start out on health care but we kind of morphed into the issue of the american manufacturing industry and the role of the middle class now the middle class i went off on manufacturing and the need to rebuild that and the make it in america agenda but also a key part of the inability of the american middle class to sustain itself is health care and the affordable health care act which the supreme court recently confirmed was constitutional is constitutional is a major effort on the part of the democratic congress and president obama to provide not only health care but to lift up the american middle class so

on the other side of the capitol by expanding the scope of the law in a very controversial manner and by making an issue of whether a nonindian can be prosecuted in a tribal court which brings up huge constitutional issues because the bill of rights does not apply in tribal courts i dont think it is the authors of this bill and particularly the gentlewoman from florida who have anything to do with making this a partisan bill it is the people on the other side of the aisle on both sides of the capitol who have decided to use this as a political issue and there was one member of the other body

standing up for the rights of african americans the first black members of congress served during reconstruction and they were all republicans they won their seats despite fierce threats of violence against black voters by groups like the ku klux klan and were successful only as a result of the firm support they received from the republican party one of these members was josiah t walls a slave who earned his freedom through service to the union in the civil war he settled in alachua county in our sunny state of florida and was repeatedly elected to congress atlarge in some ways i carry the torch of josiah walls you see in 1876 the democrats contested his election and had him replaced midterm with one of their own no black republican would again be elected from florida to this house until november 2 2010 when the voters of that state entrusted me to be their representative on my desk in my office there is a book called capitol men and it is a biography of those first black members of congress i stand where josiah walls and the other early black republican members of congress once stoodhiram revels of mississippi benjamin turner of alabama jefferson long of georgia robert delarge robert brown elliott and joseph rainey all of south carolina they were the ones who carried that first torch for my colleague tim scott they would have stood here urging support for policies of equal opportunity for all i stand here this evening to recognize their legacy the republican party has always been the party of freedom today we understand that our principles are best served when we act as stalwart advocates of free markets but historically republicans understood that the value of every human life is diminished when any human life is made to work against its will free markets are characterized by the free exchange of goods and servicesand by the free exchange of labor for compensation you see without free people there can be no free markets where men are not free freedom does not reign and so the republicans have always been the party of free men of individual freedom it was president abraham lincoln the father of the grand old party who signed the emancipation proclamation and brought about the freeing of the slaves for many this is the beginning and the end of the republican partys role in advancing equal rights but that understanding misses the myriad ways our party went on to better the lives of black americans and cheapens the many contributions that later generations of republicans made to the cause of freedom it was in fact republicans of their day who worked to pass the 13th the 14th and the 15th amendments securing for african americans deliverance from slavery equal protection under the law and the right to vote each of these accomplishments did its part to cement the fundamental freedoms all americans enjoy today none of them could have gotten off the ground without gop support take the 13th amendment for example at abraham lincolns request the republican national committee chairman edwin morgan made abolishing slavery an official part of the partys platform in 1864 at that years national convention he opened with a statement on the topic he said the party of which you gentlemen are the delegated and honored representatives will fall far short of accomplishing its great mission unless among its other resolves it shall declare for such an amendment of the constitution as will positively prohibit african slavery in the united states the 14th amendment was no different a little known fact about that law that granted black americans citizenship with all the rights and privileges thereof is that every vote in favor was cast by a republican and every vote against was cast by a democrat in 1968 when the democratcontrolled legislature of new jersey voted to rescind its ratification of the 14th amendment it was the states republican governor who vetoed that attempt it was the republicancontrolled 39th congress that established the buffalo soldiers a fighting force of six regiments of black american troops they would soon become known for exhibiting the courage of a cornered buffalo in battle while posted to the frontier in peacetime they gained renown for being the finest horsemen the army had to offer and in 1907 the 10th cavalry regiment of buffalo soldiers was sent to the united states military academy at west point to teach the cadets riding skills and mounted drill think about that for a second the commanders of their day were so confident in the ability of the buffalo soldiers that they entrusted them with the training of the next generation of army leaders and it was the republicans who made that happen it was the republicans who passed the 15th amendment as well for once the story is true that not every republican supported it a few abstained saying the measure did not go far enough it was the democrats who voted against the 15th amendment and when it passed anyway it was the democrats who resorted to the use of poll taxes literacy tests intimidation and other pernicious practices in an effort to keep black americans from exercising their right to vote this was something that my grandparents and my parents experienced growing up in south georgia it was a republican by the name of senator charles sumner who got the equal rights movement on its feet a fierce abolitionist and leader of the radical republicans sounds very familiar when they start talking about tea party republicanssenator sumner wrote and shepherded the first ever civil rights bill through congress it was a republican president the great general ulysses s grant who signed it into law the same day that it passed and that comprehensive bill the civil rights act of 1875 would become the blueprint for every subsequent piece of civil rights legislation to come before congress despite the fact that it was struck down by a backwardlooking court it was the republicans who first called for racial justice in the armed forces not only allowing black americans to serve their country but welcoming them to serve their country alongside their white brothers it was a republican judge named elbert tuttle who time and again ruled in favor of civil rights and who went on to order the university of mississippi to admit its first ever black college student it was a republican supreme court justice who authored the decision in brown v board of education that recognized racial segregation for what it was a violation of the united states constitution and when a school district in arkansas refused to integrate it was a republican president dwight david eisenhower who sent in the 101st airborne division to escort the little rock nine to class however it was a democrat governor in orval faubus you may recall who had tried to use his national guardsmen to prevent them from enrolling republicans were unfazed by the many democrats including john f kennedy and lyndon johnson who criticized president eisenhowers decision meanwhile it was the democrats in the senate who filibustered the first civil rights act of the 20th century and the republicans who managed to pass it nonetheless the law established a civil rights division within the justice department and authorized the attorney general to request injunctions against anyone attempting to deny a persons right to vote it was written at the behest of president eisenhower after a long drought of civil rights bills under presidents franklin delano roosevelt and president harry truman it was a senate minority leader everett dirksen a republican who helped write the first civil rights act of 1964 widely regarded as the most influential of them all and in recent years its been the republican party that has fought to prevent african americans from being trapped in a permanent underclass through dependence on government handouts in the 1990s it was the republicancontrolled 104th congress that passed the personal responsibility and work opportunity act thendemocrat president bill clinton signed it only after reluctantly having vetoed it twice this reform changed the face of welfare ensuring that recipients who were able to work would be required to seek employment no longer would government checks be seen as an entitlement no longer would states have a financial incentive to add as many names to their welfare rolls as possible finally there was an alternative to the cycle of poverty caused by years of misguided democrat policy and its been republicans who have continued to fight for the underprivileged communities even as were painted as the party of the white upper class in 2004 another republicancontrolled congress under the leadership of republican president george w bush signed an omnibus bill that included a voucher program for school children right here in the district of columbia instead of being shackled to the failed public school system thousands of students were able to use the first federal government vouchers to escape highperforming private schools what republicans have long understood is that poor communities are best served when theyre empowered to care for themselves the more they come to rely on government checks the less they learn to rely on their own ability and ingenuity our party firmly believes in the safety net we reject the idea of the safety net becoming a hammock for this reason the republican value of minimizing government dependence is particularly beneficial to the poorest among us conversely the democratic appetite for everincreasing redistributionary handouts is in fact the most insidious form of slavery remaining in the world today and does not promote economic freedom time after time the gop has stood strong as leaders on issues of conscience even when the positions weve taken have been unpopular weve held the line and ultimately brought about liberty and justice for all from eliminating slavery to securing full citizenship and voting rights for african americans to calling for desegregation even in the most hostile bastions of the deep south to implementing school choice in poor communities to helping black families break out of the cycle of welfare dependence republicans have been on the front lines of the fight for equal rights and individual manifest destiny since our partys founding under lincoln so too has the party led on issues like reducing the size of government streamlining the federal bureaucracy and returning power to the states these positions didnt always garner the most popular support at the time its easier to convince a person that a government should be doing something for them it currently isnt than to convince a person the government shouldnt be doing something for them it currently is but real visionary leaders dont retreat from fights it is said that one evening as george washington sat at his table after dinner the fire behind him flared up leading him to move his chair away so as not to end up getting burned when someone called george washington out saying a general ought to be able to stand the fire he responded that no general should ever be taking fire from behind that is the essence of integrity and convictionthe willingness to stand for what you believe at all times alone if need be without the option of retreat no matter how tough the slog ahead may be and to do so with the faith that eventually it is possible to transform a losing fight into a winning one for inspiration we need only to look to the former slave and republican frederick douglass having found his way to freedom through education and hard work he could have been forgiven for retiring from the public eye but he didnt back down from the work still to be done instead he made himself one of the most stalwart champions of not just the antislavery movement but the womens rights movement as well he wasnt content to lend his political capital to causes that would benefit him he knew what we know that injustice anywhere is an affront to the human spirit to free african americans from the bonds of slavery was only the first step for frederick douglass and he would not be satisfied until he helped liberate women from the bonds of misogyny as well in those days douglass could count on the republican party to be his ally in the fight today we remain no less dedicated to the cause of freedom so therefore with a core belief in the supremacy and the sovereignty of the individual and the unconditional dignity of every human life the republican party is always has been and forever shall be the party of equality of opportunity happy black history month i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.9916980266571045, 0.9916980266571045, 0, "says that his children are old

have a job you say they dont have insurance because they dont have a job it may be news to you but there are many many many working americans who do not have health insurance but they will under the affordable care act if this amendment were to pass if it were to become law immediately all of those children who can now be on their parents policy if their parents are willing would lose their health insurance with a job or without a job these young people coming out of school are idealistic and ambitious they want to follow their passions and their pursuits that is what our founders told them they could dolife liberty and pursuit of happiness these young people want a healthier life to pursue their happiness to choose a job not based on the health benefits it may or may not provide but to choose an occupation which addresses their aspirationsnot ours theirs so i just want to repeat back to our colleagues something i heard them say over and over again they said we didnt read the bill well we did but clearly you did not and i urge you to read the bill because if you did you would see that the bill puts medical decisions in the hands of patients and doctors not your favorite insurance company you would see that it brings down the cost of prescription drugs for seniors you would see that it ends the days of discrimination based on preexisting conditions and lifetime caps on the care of children and families you would see that under this bill no longer would being a woman be a preexisting medical condition as it is now as women are discriminated against in terms of price and access to insurance you would see that it offers tax credits to millions of small businesses who choose to do right by their employees and offer insurance benefits it was for all of these americans that we acted it is for them that we stand here today to oppose this amendment and if you read the bill you will see contrarycontrary to misrepresentations that were set forth by those who do the bidding of the health insurance industry in our country you would see what the bill does you would see that it is about innovation its about prevention its about a healthier america not just health care in america its about using the technologies of the future its about bringing health care closer to people where they live to lower the cost to improve the quality and to expand the access you would see that it is a bill about the future instead of the misrepresentations about this that and the other thing which i dont even want to repeat here you would see that this is transformative for our country because it gives people the liberty again to pursue their lives so i would like to know how many of you read the bill we read it over and over again to each other drilling down on different parts of it so we know of what we speak when we come to this floor and maybe if you knew more about it you wouldnt be so quick to saywe do not want to allow children to stay on their parents policies we do not want to end discrimination on the basis of preexisting conditions for our children we do not want to begin to close the doughnut hole we do not want to have preventive medicines without cost and copay for our seniors and the list goes on and on so thats whats happening here today this is again yet again another example of our friends standing up for the insurance companies at the expense of the american people standing up for the insurance companies at the expense of the health and wellbeing of our country it is again an example of washington d c holding on to the special interest status quo it is again this congress saying to the american people we are here for the special interest we are not here for the peoples interest to stacie we are not here for your two daughters for vernal we are not here for women and having being a woman being a preexisting condition to claudette and richard to say to them too bad about your mortgage if you cant pay your mortgage

support the reason for this broad support is simple under republican and democratic leadership alike we have recognized that support for our nations men and women in uniform should remain above the partisan fray unencumbered by controversial policy debates that are only tangentially related to the mission of our armed forces throughout my service in congress i have almost always supported this annual measure which authorizes funding for a wide range of programs upon which our military depends from salaries and benefits to military health care to critical equipment and readiness accounts i thus find it deeply unfortunate that the house republican leadership chose to use this years bill as a vehicle for advancing illadvised policies that seek to tie the presidents hands in the war on terror and expand the militarys role in the detention and disposition of terror suspects at the expense of our civilian justice system and our civil liberties to be sure the original house version of this bill which i opposed was much worse it would not only have indefinitely extended the authorization for the use of military force that was enacted in the wake of september 11 but would also have required suspects detained pursuant to that authorization to be prosecuted in military tribunals my republican colleagues inexplicable insistence on forcing terror trials into military commissions instead of civilian courts flies in the face of the facts our court system has a strong record of trying and convicting terrorism suspects while the record of military commissions has been spotty at best it is no wonder that the obama administration threatened to veto this billas any administration democrat or republican would almost certainly have done to their credit our democratic conferees succeeded in averting the worst aspects of the house bill in the conference report before us today but they didnt go far enough the measure would still require all foreign suspects detained in the war on terror to be kept in military custody potentially disrupting critical antiterrorism operations and muddying the waters of a process that should be crystal clear as fbi director robert mueller reiterated today this provision would unnecessarily complicate interrogation and intelligence collectionthe very capabilities that the provisions supporters claim they are trying to enhance the conference report would also needlessly reaffirm our ability to detain terror suspects indefinitely upholding an ambiguity in current law that should be resolved by the courts and it would impose new consultation requirements that further restrain the discretion of the attorney general to determine how to prosecute terror cases for these reasons i intend to oppose the measure before us today
