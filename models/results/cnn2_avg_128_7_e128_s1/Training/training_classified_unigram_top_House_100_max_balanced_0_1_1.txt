contains 10 206 billion in new discretionary budget authority and 9 128 billion in new discretionary outlays these figures are under the budget authority and outlay targets that were set pursuant to the economic summit agreement unfortunately in the process of making the economic summit budget reductions we have had to reduce transportation programs by approximately 3 percent more than i believe was required to meet our targets the coijferees had agreed to add language mandating the sale of railroad redeemable preference share equity instruments held by the federal governmentwhich will yield an outlay savings of 240 million unfortunately while the omb and cbo ruled this to be a legitimate savings they would not credit these savings to the transportation bill this scorekeeping gamesmanship will have important real life consequences for our important transportation programs i find it unfortunate that the economic summit agreement participants chose to leave the final decislonmaking authority to such an improtant task to the unelected officials at omb an cbo i hope we do not make that same mistake in the future i am submitting for the record at this point a table summarizing the

e a wayne wasingtonm united states attorneys in miami are preparing to indict a senior haitian military figure on drug trafficking charges according to unitedstates and haitian exile sources col jeanclaude paul commander of the powerful dessaline battalion in haitis capital has been under suspicion of drug smuggling since 1986 sources say but only recently have investigators compiled enough evidence to proceed with grandjury activity and possible indictment ile would apparently be charged with aiding the flow of colombian cocaine to the unitedstates and of arms from the unitedstates to colombia sources say some sources say an indictment is imminent but given secrecy of the process others are unsure if colonel paul is indicted the case will severely challenge haitian president leslie manigat who has pledged a crackdown on drug smugglers though unitedstates officials were unwilling to discuss the judicial investigation they said an indictment could call into question the arrangements by which mr manigat came to power if he tries to fire paul unitedstates congressional sources say that will view this as a serious litmus test of civilian control in haiti and of how the unitedstates should deal with the new regime pauls unit is viewed as the most important in the country and his troops are fiercely loyal to him unitedstates officials say this makes it very difficult for haitis president or pauls nominal military superiors to move against him wellinformed haitians say paul has warned that he will not go down alone if others try to remove him paul allegedly played a major role in directing violence that upset the november elections in haiti because of close ties to the tonton macoutes the secret police created during the duvalier dictatorship the violence and killing paved the way for manigats election last month paul is seen as very close to the gen william regala who was no 2 man in haitis transitional junta and may be named defense minister he is the muscle and regala is the brain says a haitian opposition source but paul has an independent power base since becoming commander of the dessaline barracks in early 1986 he has assiduously wooed his troopsdining with them wearing fatigues like theirs supplementing their pay with bonuses allegedly funded from drug trafficking washington sources say they will kill at his command a haitian opposition source says paul has also reportedly incorporated several thousand tonton macoutes into his unit making it even more formidable us officials say hes got all the guns one us specialist says washington first raised reports of pauls activities in the transitional haitian government in 1986 but received no satisfactory reply officials say after the initial us complaints an internal haitian military investigation was launched haitian exile sources say the final report reportedly confirmed the charges and included aerial photos of pauls farm with a private landing strip but after the army chief of staff presented it to gen henri namphy the thenacting head of government the investigating officers were reportedly transferred and accused of plotting a coup the army chief of staff and the colonel in charge of the investigation were subsequently forced to retire us officials could not confirm the haltians charges while stressing their lack of knowledge of the us judicial investigation they say earlier us intelligence indicates paul is alleged to have taken over parts of the drugtrafficking ring once reportedly run by the fatherinlaw of mr duvalier pauls brother alexander former haitian consul in miami is reported to have been in that earlier operation and the current one they say colombian cocaine and marijuana were reportedly the staples of this trade informed haitians here say that paul is well tied into the tonton macoutes in part because his father was in the personal entourage of franqois duvalier who founded the group to keep the military and opponents in line pauls reported ill deeds go beyond drugs a reuter dispatch from haiti reports that he and his two brothers arranged to receive the 4 000 tons of waste from the city of philadelphia dumped on the haitian coast line near the port of gonaives in january haiti opposition sources have provided the monitcr with what appears to be an import authorization from haitis minister of commerce for the paul brothers to import 20 million kilograms of usorigin ash free of inspection unloading of the ash stopped after local residents vigorously complained news reports from haiti indicate the waste may contain high levels of dioxin press reports say the paul brothers reportedly received 200 a ton to accept the ash washington will be watching carefully how the haitian government reacts if the indictments are issued the us has cut off all but humanitarian aid and antidrug cooperation with haiti until democratic elections are held senior us officials have made clear that they will judge the new government by its acts us officials believe manigat was elected after striking a deal with the military reports from haiti sources say indicate general namphy who headed the transitional government will be named chief of staff and general regala who was namphys no 2 will become defense minister martial celestine an associate of manigat was named prime minister tuesday us officials an congressional activists doubt that manig can move against paul alone they also wonder if namphy and regaia have the will or courage to act against their powerful colleague but if the haitian government does move against paul the ball will be back in washingtons court and it will be hard to avoid expressing thanks in some way an official says from the washington times feb 17 1988"],

gentleman from pennsylvania offered an amendment which would have blocked travel to communist nicaragua and as amended by the gentleman from new hampshire it specifically blocked travel for those people who wanted to go to nicaragua to help the communist dictatorship militarily in other words under this amendment which passed by 213 to 201 it is not appropriate for americans to go to nicaragua to help the communist dictatorship militarily a number of my colleagues asked why this mattered and i want to take just a moment or two to talk about this amendment first of all i would recommend to every american looking at a book called the real secret war sandinistas political warfare and its effects on congress by francis bouchey michael waller and steve baldwin that book indicates clearly that there is a systematic soviet cuban and nicaraguan communist effort to influence the american congress to influence american politics and to frame the debate second i would say to my friends we are engaged in a long struggle with the soviet empire the soviet empire is the active enemy of freedom and the active enemy of america sometimes we engaged in that struggle openly as we were in the korean war and in vietnam sometimes we are engaged in that struggle covertly as we are to some extent in afghanistan probably the most open covert war in modem history sometimes it helps our side to have an american embassy in the country as it does in nicaragua and other times it is better to break diplomatic relations there is a systematic thorough soviet kgb cuban nicaraguan communist effort to establish soviet communist colonies in central america in the real secret war by bouchey et al they indicate clearly for example the degree to which the soviet union directs the cuban secret police in other documents which we have captured we know for example that cuban and nicaraguan diplomats in the united nations systematically try to manipulate american politics and the american news media all that we were saying in todays vote was that the united states should establish a policy that like lafayette whose picture is in this chamber we help freedom we help the forces of freedom we are opposed to communism we oppose the forces of communism in particular as a first step in this long march toward a free world we are not willing to allow wellmeaning but misguided americans on the left to go to a country to put on a uniform to carry a weapon that it should be against the law for americans to get a passport to go to help a communist dictatorship tragically two of the potential presidential candidates voted against that amendment two of them democrats who are running for president one announced one exploring decided to vote to allow americans to go to nicaragua to fight for a communist dictatorship on the side of communism i would suggest that is not an issue of freedom of speech it is not an issue of right of travel it is a fundamental question of whether should some day american troops go into nicaragua as they went into grenada as they might have gone into iran when our hostages were held what would happen then to that young american who foolishly had put on a nicaraguan uniform what would the relationship be then of those young wellmeaning americans who had been blinded into being procommunist who were standing there with a soviet ak47 and then what would this congress say whose side would this congress be on the young american in an american uniform doing what an american president asked him or the young american in a communist uniform carrying soviet weapons it is madness for us engaged in a longterm war with the soviet empire for us trying to preserve freedom across the planet for us trying to slowly and systematically help people be free it is madness for us to allow some of our children to be convinced they should carry soviet weapons work with soviet advisers create soviet dominated dictatorships and this is a first step today by a narrow margin of 213 to 201 saying once again what john f kennedy knew what harry truman knew what hubert humphrey knew that a healthy america knows who the friends of freedom are and who the communists are

be made available in order to give the house and senate select committees time to complete their investigations of the iranian arms scandal this is not the first time i have stood on this floor to talk about legality and fiscal accountability in the contra aid program last march i stood here because we did not know where 27 million in contra aid had gone we were reading stories in the newspaper every day about money that may have been lost or diverted to honduras or used to buy weapons instead of food and medicine at that time i introduced a resolution of inquiry to get to the bottom of the matter as a result of my resolution and the investigations which followed we learned that onehalf of the 27 million appropriation is missing we may never know where that money went we may never know whether money the congress appropriated for humanitarian aid was used to buy weapons and ammunition lastfall i stood here again when we were debating whether we should give another 100 million to the contras but i did not think we should spend another dime for the contras until weknew where the previous appropiation had gone so i introduced an amendment to prohibit any aid for the contras until we knew where the 27 million had gone my amendment lost and the house sent the unfortunate message that legality and fiscal accountability did not matter in the contra aid program one month later we learned that the united states had secretly sold weapons to iran and then diverted the profits from those arms sales to the contras and we found out that these diversions were made at a time when congress had specifically prohibited aid to the contras i had written to attorney general meese just 1 day before these disclosures were made to request the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate the arms shipments to iran and united states involvement with the contras at that time my concerns were based on news reports linking the administration to the hasenfus affair and on continuing evidence that the united states had been providing aid to the contras the very next day we learned how deeply involved the united states may actually have been with the contras according to attorney general meese between 10 million and 30 million in profits from these sales had been diverted to bank accounts held by the contras these diver sions had been made at a time when the boland amendment specifically prohibited aid to the contras in any form so i am standing here again and the questions are the same how much money was given to the contras where did the money come from was it done in violation of the law what was the money used for these are important questions and they demand answers but before we even have a chance to learn the answers the house may again face the issue of providing aid to the contras under the provisions of the aid law congress passed last year the 100 million appropriation for the contras was split into three installments a first installment of 40 million a second installment of 20 million and a final 40 million installment the first in stallment was released immediately but the second and third were delayed under the aid law the second installment is now available anytime the president wants to make use of it the third installment which is subject to a congressional resolution of disapproval is available after february 15less than 1 month from now the administration has not announced its intention to make use of the second installment and the third is not available until the middle of next month that means that 60 million in contra aid is waiting to be spent next month if the president decides he wants to apply the last installment of contra aid congress may pass a resolution of disapproval and try to prevent him from applying the aid but i do not think that we will have any clearer picture of the diversion issue in 3 weeks than we have right now we need more time and the american people need more time to learn the facts for this reason i am introducing legislation to push back the date on which the third installment becomes available from february 15 to november 15 the house investigating committee is expected to issue its final report on october 30 which would give the house 2 weeks to consider the results of that investigation before considering the release of funds for the contras in addition my legislation would place the second installment in escrow until november 15 as well my legislation allows for the changeover in fiscal years so that the money would still be earmarked for aid to the contras but it would not become available until we know more about the diversion issue after november 15 the president could report to congress on his intention to apply the remaining 60 million in appropriated funds for aid to the contras congress could still as under the original aid law pass a resolution of disapproval but instead of voting to disapprove of the third installment only the congress could vote to disapprove of the second installment as well let me make clear that my legislation would not alter the purpose of the original aid law if after november 15 the president wanted to use the 60 million for the contras and if there were no evidence at that time that a diversion might have taken place then the aid could be applied just as under the original aid law congress would however reserve the right to disapprove of the release of funds the main goal of my legislation is to give us more time to make what will be a very important decision all my legislation does is give 2 the reference in that section to on the congress and the american people the and after february 15 1987 shall be time they need to know the facts before deemed to read after november 15 1987 facing this issue once again and 3 section 206 c of the act shall be i voted against the 100 mil deemed to read as follows lion aid appropriation but it was the will of c funds transferred under subsection the unitedstates congress that the aid be approved i a shall remain available until may 31 do not question that decision although i do 1988 not agree with it but when the congress sec 3 description of act referred to made that decision last year we did not know as used in this act the term the act all the facts we did not kow that the united means the act making appropriations for states may have been violating laws by pro military construction for the department of viding aid to the contras at a time when the defense for the fiscal year ending septemcongress had prohibited that aid and we did ber 30 1987 and for other purposes as connot know that officials of the unitedstates government tained in section 101 k of the joint resolumay have been pursuing their own foreign tion making continuing appropriations for policy agendas in direct opposition to the will the fiscal year 1987 and for other purposes house joint resolution 738 public law 99of the unitedstates congress 500 as supplemented by public law 99now we have reason to suspect that this 591 may have happened if we knew then what we suspect now would the congress have approved aid to the contras maybe yes but

haiti he has shown a great deal of interest in and concern for the people of haiti and i think he speaks quite sensibly about what we ought to be doing but i want to talk tonight about the presidential campaign some of the members across the aisle have decided that this is an appropriate forum in which to do campaigning i will have to concede that i have not done the research that some of my colleagues on the side have done and i do not have a lot of quotations to offer it always seems to me that if people want to read those things they can read them on their own i want to talk about some aspects of the campaign that are distressing to me and i know that my friend the gentleman from new york and some others want to join in one of the things that struck me is the extent to which vice president bush feels compelled on important issues to be obedient to the rightwing in this country it is interesting that george bush when he ran for president in 1080 and was defeated by ronald reagan was seen as a more moderate candidate than than ronald reagan and interestingly as we look at the reagan candidacy and look at the bush candidacy we see in the case of george bush in my view much more of a willingness to toe the line than the rightwing sets ronald reagan himself felt rooted in that conservative movement and as one who was confident of his own place in that conservative movement he felt much freer to disagree with people in the conservative movement when he thought common sense required him to do so for instance we had the case of the inf treaty when the great majority of the conservative movement as they call themselves in this country reacted quite angrily to the inp treaty ronald reagan had the selfconfidence to say that they were acting in an even more bizarre fashion than some of them usually do and he went ahead with it george bush unlike ronald reagan is unsure of himself with that rightwing which has become such an important element in the republican party and therefore when the rightwing growls on its key issues george bush unlike ronald reagan is paralyzed and will not disagree we have had example after example this year of george bush being held to a standard by the rightwing which is in my judgment damaging to the country we begin with the choice of his vice president no one outside of his immediate family thinks that dan quayle is qualified to be the vice president of the united states i do not know how his immediate would vote on a secret ballot george bush picked him because he was given a very short list by the far right when ronald reagan had to pick a vice presij nt he did not feel he owed the far right a veto over his choice because he picked a man george bush who did not at that time look that attractive to him george bush of course has spent the intervening 8 years trying very hard to kowtow to the far right so they would no longer be vetoing him people might remember the famous trek george bush made a couple of years ago to speak at a dinner in honor of the late william loeb publisher of the manchester unionleader an extraordinarily virulent unfair rightwing newspaper publisher who had denounced george bush but bush was so eager to win back the rightwing and to release that rightwing opposition to him that he humbled himself before the unionleaders people well george bush had to pick a vice president and unlike ronald reagan george bush felt he could not do anything the rightwing would have objected to so he picked for vice president probably the least qualified nominee for national office on a major party ticket in a very very long time i confess i am not fully cognizant of all the more obscure vicepresidential nominees earlier in this century but of those i can think of in the last 50 years the current vicepresdential nominee dan quayle is clearly the least qualified but that is not even controversial why was he picked because the rightwing gave george bush a short list it had on it a couple of people like our colleague the gentleman from new york george bush did not want to pick him he thought he might be overshadowed so he picked someone the rightwing would accept someone who would not overshadow him so that is how he picked quayle george bush suggested about a month ago that we should not go full speed ahead with the installation of the star wars antimissile device because it is going to cost hundreds and hundred of millions of dollars in violation of the antiballistic missile treaty that was richard nixons accomplishment and it could be destabalizing to our efforts to get a substantial nuclear arms reduction agreement with the russians george bush suggested that and then the rightwing growled then george bush unsuggested it on issue after issue after issue of central importance picking a vice president american defense george bush makes moves that are calculated to please the rightwing and i think that is terribly dangerous it is why we have george bush among other things talking about the relationship between the united states and the soviet union in terms far to the right of ronald reagan ronald reagan has achieved with general secretary gorbachev some real gains one of our great hopes is that we will be able to build on that not out of any love for or trust of the soviet union but out of a recognition that we have mutual interests that we are trying to deal with both the strategic and economic impact of an allout arms race george bush has been forced by his fear of the rightwing to back off on that we had another example in fact this has been a good week for george bush i should give credit where credit is due he has not had to fire one antisemi ie from his campaign this whole week i think that is about the first time in a long time that he has not had to do that no one thinks george bush is himself antisemitic no one thinks that george bush was happy with some of the virulent antisemites who were on his ethnic outreach council why were they there because the rightwing gave him a list and because george bush does not have the political courage or toughness to challenge the rightwing he is a man who is politically paralyzed by fear of the rightwing on a few issues where they do not care they give him a little freedom he can go off on the minimum wage and that is ok he can take a little bit of freedom in another area but on the picking of the vicepresidential candidate the most important decision one can make when hie is about to become a presidential candidate on the question of star wars on relationships with the soviet union on his ethnic outreach council when the rightwing insists george bush is there that i believe is terribly dangerous when you have on the right people like pat robertson and others who have i think moved beyond the plausible in their advocacy when you have this blind unwillingness to recognize that there is a chance to reach based on mutual agreement and mutual interests an arms reduction pact with the russians i think that becomes very frightening so one of the central parts of the campaign that has emerged so far is the extent to which george bush unlike ronald reagan will not deviate in any significant area from the agenda of the far right and unfortunately that is a party that has taken up faction that has taken over more and more of the republican party we have the most extremely rightwing platform coming out of the republican party this year again to the right of where the reagan platforms were in 1980 and 1984 because ronald reagan as a genuine conservative with a sense of his own place was prepared to differ with the right george bush out of his own lack of rootedness politically and out of his own political timidity will not take on the far right they have defeated him too often george bush was for too many times in his career frustrated by the far right and he has decided that since he could not beat them that he will make obeyances to them and he has done that at every critical point in this year and in the last critical years at this point i am pleased to yield to the gentleman from new york my friend who i know has things he wants to add on this general subject"], [3.582510180422105e-05, 3.582510180422105e-05, 0, "the issue presented by my amendment is fairly straightforward the issue is whether or not we should end taxpayer support of u n based antiamerican propaganda misinformation and espionage specifically my amendment eliminates 51 404 300 that is currently being appropriated for international organizations and conferences there are three specific areas that i would like to address that i think the american taxpayer would like to see redressed the first has to do with the united nations department of public information better known as dpi two years ago i offered an amendment that passed this body that deleted united states funding for dpi in large part because of this bodys agreement with a gao study that demonstrated that the dpi was used primarily as a propaganda arm by the soviet union specifically it has consistently put out information funded at least onequarter of it with united states taxpayer money to propagate marxismleninism to basically denigrate the united states of america and further to actually in many cases propagandize against the united states of america and many of our allies like the nation of israel the senate intelligence committee concluded in 1985 that the department of public information is a focal point for propaganda and intelligence efforts these activities are important to the kgb and central committee for recruitment and for supporting their front organizations the department is a high priority for future soviet placements because it manages the u n information offices worldwide maintains contacts with journalists and the media and publishes much of the u n promotional literature rather than go into all that detail because it is the subject matter of a gao report i would simply remind my colleagues that we did in the past vote to eliminate that funding in hopes that the department itself would take those types of steps that would eliminate the misuse of american taxpayer dollars regrettably that has not occurred we find instead that the u n committee on information has now made recommendations that continue the dpi approach of antiamerican propaganda a dpi working group just last month recommended that reforms within dpi be suspended until an indepth study is made of a restructing plan on dpis programs activities and staff this raises serious questions about dpis commitment to reform itself that being the case i think that we are really without any choice but to now in this bill eliminate that same funding in order that we can once again send a message that we will not be a party to promote much less participate financially and subsidize any arm of the united nations that chooses very deliberately to bash the united states of america through propaganda that is distributed throughout the world the next aspect i would like to focus on is that aspect that has to do with the u n s department of conference services dcs is the largest entity within the u n secretariat its services include document editing stenography interpreting publishing and reporting the soviet union has used dcs as a cover for farranging espionage disinformation and propaganda activities at u n expense the fbi has identified dcs as a clearinghouse for soviet activities at the u n united states intelligence authorities estimate that between onehalf and onequarter of the soviets at the u n secretariat are kgb or gru officers the senate intelligence committee estimates that dcs contains the largest contingency of soviets in new york a high proportion of kgb or gru officers serve in this department soviet and eastbloc officials hold virtually every major executive position within dcs while americans hold none and yet the united states is the largest contributor to the dcs budget paying 25 percent of the dcs annual budget of 166 million while the soviets pay only 11 percent some of the soviet abuses at dcs include using the u n s library as a base for kgb intelligence collection of sensitive united states scientific and technological publications and travel throughout the united states to meet people urith access to vast collections of technical literature since 1964 soviet nationals have occupied the position of the librarys director with additional soviets occupying subordinate positions that is according to a january 1988 fbi study the second point that i would like to make is that kgb officers are sent and other u n employees are coopted to attend u n library conferences worldwide at u n expense where the kgb recruits potential intelligence sources for future assignments additionally the dcs slants conference papers controls the flow of news to u n staff and delegations and manipulates the release of u n documents giving soviet bloc diplomats early notice of impending u n actions and thus maximizing propaganda value in closing i would simply ask that my colleagues pass this amendment in order that we might eliminate that portion of the funding for the u n department of public information the u n department of conference services and the u n council for namibia all of which are blatantly opposed to american interests"], [4.094741598237306e-05, 4.094741598237306e-05, 0, "that is correct cardinal obando y bravo who is the main opposition to the communist sandinista government it is important to remember he was criticized strongly by somoza he said the mass for the sandinista government when they took over he was the one who negotiated commandante ortegas release from prison and here is an individual who was supportive as many in this body and many on our side of the aisle originally were supportive of the original revolution since that time it has become a communist dicatatorship now how does this fit in what point and the gentleman and the gentleman from connecticut and the gentleman from california have covered the other points it leads me to the major point that i want to make in 1938 there was a gentleman in this country named whittaker chambers who was a communist he was a member of the communist party here in the united states whittaker chambers became repelled by what he saw in the communist party the executions that took place in soviet russia and many other things he left the communist party in 1937 in 1948 he testified in many congressional hearings which resulted in the conviction of alger hiss who later went to prison in 1952 this is a man who was a communist whittaker chambers wrote a book the book is called witness now i would encourage all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to read this book it is a very profound book and tells a story for today let me read the first page from whittaker chambers book witness he said in 1937 like lazarus lazarus from the bible who came back from the dead i began like lazarus the impossible return i began to break away from communism and to climb from deepwithin its underground where for 6 years i had been been buried back into the world of free men when we dead awaken i used to sometimes say in those days to my wife who though never a communist had shared my revolutionary hopes and was now to share my ordeals when we dead awaken for this title of an ibsen play i have never read somehow caught and summed up for me feelings that i could not find any other words to expressfears uncertalnities selfdoubts cowardices flinchings of the willnature to any man who undertakes to reverse in midcourse the journey of his life at the same time he said when he left communism i felt a surging release and a sense of freedom like a man who bursts at last gasp out of a drowning sea this elation was not caused and this is the frightening thing of the book this elation was not caused by any comparison of the world i was leaving and the world i was returning to whittaker chambers went on to say by any hardheaded estimate the world i was leaving that is the communist world looked like the world of life and of the future the world i was returning to that is freedom and democracy the world i was returning to seemed by contrast a graveyard it was in fact the same world i had abandoned as hopeless when i joined the communist party in 1925 only now its crisis which few men could diagnose 13 years before had reached the visible brink of catastrophe and still that stricken world did not know the nature of the catastrophe it still did not know or even want to know two facts that it must know to survive the meaning of communism and the meaning of the new breed of man the communist whittaker chambers went on to say i wanted my wife to realize clearly one longterm penalty for herself and for the children of the step i was taking i said you know we are leaving the winning world for the losing world i meant that in the revolutionary conflict of the 20th century i knowingly chose the side of probable defeat almost nothing that i have observed or that has happened to me since has made me think that i was wrong about that forecast but nothing has changed my determination to act as if i were wrongif only because in the last instance men must act on what they believe right not on what they believe probable since whittaker chambers wrote those words in 1952 19 countries have turned communist cambodia laos vietnam mozambique ethiopia angola cuba now nicaragua and i do not believe and i think we should do everything to see that it is the case i do not believe that whittaker chambers was right i think this body republicans and democrats and americans should do everything they can in their power to prove that when whittaker chambers says that when he was leaving communism he was leaving the winning side and joining the losing side as the father of five children who are going to have to live in this world long after i depart this troubles me deeply now to be opposed to contra aid and i would reprimand myself and the h 1174 co other members for using the word contra because contra means against it is a negative word i think a more appropriate word is to call the people in nicaragua who are called contras call them the democratic resistance or freedom fighters or something like that but to oppose aid to the freedom fighters in nicaragua is not a policy it is an abrogation it is just saying i dont know what to do but im not going to do anything now i happen to think that president arias of costa rica has come out with a very good plan a good idea i think this country the united states should support president arias in what he is trying but in order to support president arias and make these negotiations to be successful it is necessary to put pressure on the communist sandinista government in nicaragua because if we do not have pressure on that government they will never abide by negotiations and met with arias and duarte and the other members i just want to urge my colleagues here you may want to cut off aid later on in the semester or later on in the year perhaps but to do it now would basically doom president arias negotiations a vote to cut off aid to the freedom fighters or contras or democratic resistance would i think spell doom to president arias peace plan which we all want to succeed think in terms of that"], [4.520006405073218e-05,

the gentleman who preceded me and i would like to point out a few parts of the picture that were left a little blank in the discussion first of all the gentleman from michigan indicated that these people in nicaragua are alleged to be communists the fact of the matter is they are marxistleninists they are marxistleninists by their actions and by their words as well as by their deeds there is just no question about that when we were in managua about 6 or 7 weeks ago and the gentleman from california congressman dornan and i went over there to see lino hernandez who is a human rights activist who was jailed because he appeared at a demonstration he did not participate he just appeared at a demonstration and they threw him in jail without benefit of any kind of a trial we went over to see him and while we were waiting in the police chiefs office congressman dornan pointed out to me over my left shoulder a large picture of lenin and over my right shoulder was a large picture of karl marx those were not hanging there just for aesthetic reasons they were there because that police chief as well as all those in leadership down there are avowed marxistleninists daniel ortega just got back from moscow where he participated in celebrating the 70th anniversary of the bolshevik revolution with gorbachev with fidel castro and others there is no question they are a communist organization they are a communist government there is no question that they plan to export revolution into the surrounding countries and that they have been doing that in el salvador i was in chalatenango province i saw captured communist weapons i talked to captured communist guerrillas who told me they were trained in nicaragua that their weapons came through nicaragua no question about that in addition to that during the attack by the m1 guerrillas in colombia last year when they killed members of the supreme court down there there were found among the dead members of the sandinista military participating with the m1 guerrillas and trying to undermine the government in columbia no question it is a communist regime now what happens if the peace process fails and the contras dry up and blow away because we do not give them funding we all want peace to work in central america we all want to give peace a chance but if it does not work there should be a viable alternative to the communist sandinista government now my friends on the other side of the aisle would have it that the contras would no longer get funding they would become members of the united states of america flee to the united states or stay and go to honduras and live in refugee camps or go back and under the state of amnesty become part of the sandinista government or part of the sandinista citizenry many of them no doubt will be taken to task imprisoned or killed down the road but the fact of the matter is that they would have it that there would be no viable opposition to the sandinistas if the peace process fails because they do not want any further contra aid my feeling is that the peace process although it should be given a chance is likely to fail if you talk to the other central american leaders they are filled with apprehension as well congressman dornan and i met with president azcona in his presidential residence and he told us that he had told senator chris dodd that if the peace process failedand he had great apprehension about itthat he was going to request 50 000 americantroops be stationed in his country he was also going to request up to 250 million in military assistance so he has apprehension about it president duarte of el salvador is very apprehensive about it when we talked to them privately about whether or not contras should be funded so that they could remain a viable force in case the peace process fails they say yes they should at the very least get humanitarian aid so that they will be able to survive and there will be some alternative to the sandinistas if the peace process does not work my friends on the other side of the aisle would have it that the contras no longer be a viable force and if the peace process fails there would be no way to do anything about the communists sandinistas and their expansionist policies throughout central america they have been exporting revolution in the past as congressman dornan of california said a while ago the thing that got them back to the conference table esquipulas ii was the gains that had been made by the freedom fighters the contras on the field of battle this year the pressure had been increased on them and tomas borge and others have said privately that they are a threat to the sandinista government and therefore they went to the conference table now after having gone to the conference table and signing it they are trying to buy time they are not complying with all facets of the peace agreement there is no question about that they released 1 000 political prisoners or promised to release them there are 5 000 to 6 000 political prisoners in those jails down there congressman dornan and i talked to mothers and wives and daughters of these political prisoners and with tears flowing down their cheeks they talked about the torture and the repression that their husbands and sons and brothers were feeling in those prisons real torture 0l 2140 and there are over 5 000 of them so they are going to release 1 000 and say they are complying with the peace agreement not on your life in addition to that they said they were going to allow la prensa to print well that was a step in the right direction and we all applauded that they said they were going to let radio catolica broadcast again radio catolica did not have the power that was necessary and one member of our body here went down there with radio equipment and helped fix that radio station so it could broadcast not only in managua but all the way down to costa rica and all the way up to guatemala the signal is now very strong lino hernandez went on that radio station to give a news report on the human rights violations that were taking place at the hand of the sandinistas and they immediately once again imposed censorship on news broadcasts on radio catolica they cannot broadcast news today so once again they are not complying with the peace agreement as i said before i think president ortega in nicaragua is trying to buy time and what are they doing with the young people down there i did not bring all of my information over tonight because i did not intend to get into this lengthy discussion on this subject but they are teaching young children to add and subtract using military equipment instead of apples and oranges so two ak47s plus two machineguns plus two machineguns are six machineguns and three hand grenades plus three hand grenades are six hand grenades and as the children get older the indoctrination gets more severe so that they will have a solid corps of young people to throw into the field of battle at some point in the future they are building their army toward a 250 000man active army and militia they have reached their goal of 139 000 right now which is far greater than pny of the other central american countries in fact probably greater than all those countries combined and yet they continue to build because they felt pressure on the battlefield they have decided to sign the peace agreement to buy time we all hope it works but if it does not work there should be a viable alternative to the communist sandinistas and their objectives down in central america my colleagues on the other side of the aisle said that oscar arias received the nobel peace prize and that jim wright should be a corecipient because of his participation in the peace proposal well if the peace proposal does not work i hope mr wright our speaker is equally willing to accept the responsibility for the failed plan of course we hope it works but if it does not if you accept the accolades and there is failure you should go with the blame as well"], [5.2678944484796375e-05, 5.2678944484796375e-05, 0, "i want to talk this evening on the concept of reasonable rules and have a special order entitled reasonable rules i think it is important to recognize that we are a nation in transition in terms of how we apply certain rules and what we mean by those rules that those changes apply to our culture at large the changes apply to our political system the changes apply to our government and the changes apply to the congress and that the rules which seemed reasonable over the last 20 years seem less reasonable today things which we would have tolerated or gotten used to accepted as business as usual now no longer seem quite so acceptable maybe this is most obvious in the area of drugs and the problem of crime in the overt sense but i would say that there is a general shift partly caused by the fact that the baby boom is growing older and as it looks at its own children it may have looked at things which it may have experimented with or might have done that it has concluded were dangerous or even bad i think we are seeing the establishment of principles of good and bad that there are some things that are just unacceptable maybe the most obvious example of this is the whole debate which is emerging over the question of furlough programs for firstdegree murderers serving life sentences without parole an argument which has been going on now for several months involving governor dukakis and the whole question in the 1970s and the 1960s both among republicans and democrats particularly in the liberal wing of both parties there was an attitude that one always had to understand the criminal that somehow the criminal always was somebody that we could find an excuse for they had a bad upbringing they lived in a bad neighborhood something had gone wrong in their life but it was never quite the criminals fault so there was an enormous bias in favor of finding an excuse to allow the criminal to have one more chance two more chances 10 more chances ultimately in its most bizarre form that bias in favor of always understanding the criminal led to the massachusetts furlough program first enacted in 1972 which made massachusetts the only state which permitted furloughs for firstdegree murderers serving life sentences without parole let me make a distinction there are a number of states which permit furloughs there are even some states which permit furloughs for firstdegree murderers but in those states the furloughs are granted only after the inmate is decided eligible for parole not before that is if they have somebody who earlier in their life may have done something but they have been a very good prisoner they have learned and grown and changed and the parole board has decided that ultimately they might be able to live in civilized society without hurting people then in other states there is some opportunity for those criminals to be allowed out a little bit at a time to test them out in society to give them weekend furloughs to give them a chance for example in new york state if one serves 80 percent of their sentence they have a chance to get out on furlough to begin the process of rehabilitation in massachusetts the figure was 20 percent so they only had to serve onefourth as much of their sentence in massachusetts as they had to serve in new york state there is a further difference the massachusetts program that governor dukakis defended established the principle that firstdegree murderers who were serving life sentence without parole and that is a very specialized kind of sentence were allowed to be furloughed as richard cohen of the washington post pointed out a life sentence for firstdegree murderers without parole is the kind of sentence that a liberal state gives in order not to have the death penalty life sentence without parole is designed to say here is a person so bad that in other states such as california or florida they might have gone to the death penalty but in massachusetts a much more liberal state we will not execute them but we promise to the citizens of massachusetts that they will never again be allowed to walk the streets that is why the term firstdegree murderers serving life sentences without parole is a very important term the fact is that sometimes prisoners on furlough do not come back and that if you let a murderer out on friday afternoon for the weekend he may decide not to return presently there are 80 prisoners who are missing from prerelease centers furloughs and workrelease programs sixtytwo of those eighty prisoners escaped under governor dukakis those escapees include 59 violent criminals including 10 murderers 9 rapists and 25 armed robbers and 12 criminals were serving sentences for drugrelated crimes including 9 for distribution or attempt to alstribute taese are not just threats to the citizens of massachusetts governor dukakis support for the murderers furlough program had impact across state lines the most famous example willie horton who escaped from a murderers furlough program was given life sentence without parole for stabbing a 19yearold boy 17 times and dumping him in a 50gallon drum to die while robbing a gas station when willie horton was furloughed he ran away went to maryland terrorized a couple in their home stabbed the man repeatedly raped the woman several times however not until march 22 1988 a year after willie horton had engaged in that kind of terrorist activity did governor dukakis reluctantly agree to sign a bill prohibiting furloughs for firstdegree murderers and governor dukakis defended his system all through 1987 he said look we are running a very tough strong welldefined furlough program in this state which by and large has been very successful that is a quote in the lawrence eagle tribune of january 31 1988 and that is defending a program he made this quote after he knew of the willie horton case in which the convicted murderer had while on furlough left the state and as i said tortured the husband and raped the wife in fact at the time dukakis finally agreed to sign the bill changing the furlough program for murderers sentenced to life without parole he was faced with both a hostile legislature and a potential referendum on furloughs on the november ballot which was not something he wanted to see the public have to vote on let me give the members some examples some of the case histories as reported in the lawrence ma eagle tribune on january 10 1988 of some of the escapees from governor dukakis furlough program and the first was as i mentioned willie horton who was serving a sentence without the possibility of parole for firstdegree murder and on his 10th furlough in june 1986 he escaped on april 3 1987 he terrorized the maryland couple in their home stabbing the man and raping the woman he was later apprehended and sentenced in maryland to two consecutive life terms plus 85 years somewhat incredibly massachusetts requested his extradition the judge however ruled that he should not be sent back to massachusetts where he could become eligible for parole once again it is fascinating by the way and i have seen a videotape which has been made of the murderers furlough program in that videotape the maryland judge says quite specifically that he refused to send willie horton back to massachusetts on the grounds that it was clear that he would be allowed out on the weekends and he would once again run away and the judge in maryland did not want to let governor dukakis massachusetts threaten the people of america with this kind of murderer that tape by the way is called justice on furlough it is a videotape available that is really a remarkable document another example brendan boyd a convicted rapist who was also serving a life sentence for murdering a prison inmate but he was however released on furlough in 1986 during which he raped a woman in mattapan and then shot himself to death armand carrier a former new hampshire state trooper who shot a police officer and another man to death but he was permitted a work detail to worcester hospital which had been approved by the massachusetts corrections commissioner and he escaped charles costa serving 3 to 5 years for the rape of a child by force in everett a career criminal he had a record of burglary and escapes in other states yet he was placed on work release at the south middlesex prerelease center from which he escaped on february 27 1987 michael jones serving 10 to 12 years for rape and armed robbery walked away from the northeast corrections center prerelease center in january eugenio torres convicted in 1986 for the unlawful possession of a controlled substance a few months later was permitted a work release from the massachusetts corrections institute at shirley from which he escaped and stabbed his wife and another male at home robert jeffries had a criminal record including burglaries drugs assault with a dangerous weapon and assault on a police office nevertheless he was permitted to take furloughs at his motherinlaws home while serving 6 to 10 for a 1980 armed robbery he escaped from the boston prerelease center january 30 1986 those are some cxamples of the kinds of dangerous tough criminals which governor dukakis has said he favors being given the right to run loose and to be given the opportunity to escape through his furlough program governor dukakis described his furlough program in the eagle tribune article of january 31 1988 as saying it is a very tough strong welldefined furlough program in this state which by and large has been very successful it is a sign that governor dukakis had not talked to any of the victims who were in fact victimized recently by people governor dukakis had allowed to go out on weekends this is a tragic story and i commend to anyone who wants to read more about it the article from readers digest in july entitled getting away with murder that article getting away with murder outlines in some detail the kinds of examples of the problems that governor dukakis had in massachusetts because he was willing to allow very dangerous prisoners to have weekends off to go out in the world even though in fact there had been consistent warnings about the dangers of the furlough program for example there was a commission which in 1975 the special commission relative to the effect of the prisoner furlough program on the citizens of the commonwealth issued the following report on october 16 1975 the commission has found no benefits singly or in toto attributable to the fur lough program that can justify for the publics sake the continuance of a practice that allows convicted criminals to walk the streets devoid of restraints and free to commit crimes against their fellow man to give an example if my colleagues ever get the chance to see the videotape justice on furlough they interview on that particular tape a woman who talks about her older daughter being killed and then several years later taking her younger daughter to dinner and having in the very same restaurant having dinner with her younger daughter and herself in the very same restaurant the convicted murderer who is now out on furlough and she describes in this videotape justice on furlough how emotionally deeply she felt about the impact of knowing that the murderer who had killed her older daughter was right there across the room in that restaurant out on furlough i think that it is important to recognize that governor dukakis was warned over and over again that releasing murderers who had been convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment without parole is very very dangerous that real human beings innocent citizens were suffering because of governor dukakis willingness to let innocent citizens take the risk consider some of these facts the wall street journal pointed out on april 19 1988 between 1980 and 1987 the massachusetts corrections department granted an average of 388 furloughs a year to killers in other words in the average year in massachusetts 388 furloughs were being given to people who had been convicted of killing somebody else so if you lived anywhere and given the mobility of modern america a convicted killer could get out of jail on friday night travel anywhere in america and if he or she was honorable show back up by monday they could fly to los angeles they could fly to san francisco they could fly to houston or miami on friday evening do whatever they wanted to do on saturday and sunday fly back as long as they reported in that is if you thought the convicted killers were going to come back on average a first degree murderer was let out on furlough every day for the past 7 years from the lawrence ma eagle tribune december 30 imagine governor dukakis being willing to have all of the rest of us take the risk of having a first degree murderer let out on furlough every day of the year in effect let me go back again to the case of willie horton because people might say well should we not have given him a chance let me explain some of the background november 1 1974 during an armed robbery of a gas station in lawrence ma horton held at gun point a 17yearold gas station attendant joseph fournier having robbed the youth horton brutally stabbed him 19 times and stashed him in a garbage can for this crime horton was sentenced to life in prison without benefit of parole i might mention that earlier in his life horton had been convicted of another armed robbery and had been left out on parole in another state before he went to massachusetts to commit that robbery and kill that young man june 2 1986 horton escaped from massachusetts while on a weekend pass from a state prison in concord horton was on his 10th furlough when he escaped april 3 1987 horton breaks into the home of a maryland couple clifford and angela barnes and terrorizes them for 12 hours during the night of terror he tied mr barnes up in the basement stabbed him repeatedly and robbed him and waited for mrs barnes to return home upon her entrance horton dragged her upstairs and rapxi her twice horton then stole a car and after a highspeed auto chase was recaptured after being shot twice for this and other offenses horton committed during the hours of terror he was charged with 13 different crimes including two counts of kidnaping two counts of false imprisonment five counts of assault with intent to murder two counts of first degree rape two counts of second degree rape one count of malicious cutting of a person one count of possession of a firearm by a felon one count of breaking and entering one count of burglary two counts of discharging a loaded weapon while under arrest one count of possession of a firearm while a felon horton was found guilty of these crimes in maryland and sentenced to two life terms plus 85 years the sentencing judge stated at the close of the trial with all due respect to the citizens of our sister state the commonwealth of massachusetts im not prepared to take the chance that mr horton might again be furloughed or otherwise released he now belongs to the state of maryland in this setting understanding the risk to innocent citizens understanding the difficulties that would happen realizing that we are talking here about releasing very very dangerous people that on occasion they committed crimes and in some cases on some occasions as i already indicated the murderers when released by governor dukakis program murdered other people what is the dukakis record of learning about that let us look over the years in 1976 after vetoing a bill to end furloughs for first degree murderers dukakis said this bill would have cut the heart out of the efforts at inmate rehabilitation with 89 percent of those committed to our institutions eventually returning to society it is essential that we retain what has proven to be a successful tool for breaking the cycle of crime which our prison systems used to encourage let me suggest that that successful tool did not look very successful to cliff and angle barnes that successful tool did not look very successful to the people who have been killed robbed and otherwise violated by the various murderers that governor dukakis has released on june 7 1987 governor dukakis said i am a supporter of the furlough program because i think it is an important part of any modern and any effective correctional system there is always a risk and our job is to make that furlough program as strong and as well administered and as responsible as possible notice that while governor dukakis recognizes the risk it is not his risk it is the risk of innocent citizens it is the risk of the victims and the families of victims who have to suffer knowing that somebody who killed one of their relatives is now alive and free on weekends on june 30 1987 the furlough program over the past 10 years has been quite successful and its something i rely on very heavily when it comes to making decisions about commutations again i would just suggest it has been successful for the murderers it has been successful in terms of getting people out of the prison population but one has to question how successful it has been for those who have been raped terrorized tortured or killed by people released by governor dukakis november 23 1987 i just dont like the idea of absolutely prohibiting the possibility of a furlough program in these cases i do not see how a governor can responsibly exercise his commutation power under these circumstances notice governor dukakis comes back again and again to how can i commute the sentence of the killer how can i take care of the person who has been sentenced to life in prison how can i make sure that the person who has a major problem having murdered a fellow human being or raped or tortured a fellow human being how can governor dukaks make sure that it is the murderer who is taken care of not the victim december 17 1987 i think a good strong aggressive corrections system requires a well managed furlough program apparently again he represented a program in which 62 murderers sentenced and violent criminals had escaped from his furloughs as a good strong aggressive corrections system january 6 1988 we recognize this is a serious problem of great concern to people and it is of great concern to me we have brought all of the lifers back into more secure settings as a practical matter the furlough program for lifers is on hold what happened was despite the consistent effort to stop every repeal of the furlough for murderers public anger public outrage had built families who had had somebody killed families of victims had gathered the signatures to put an initiative on the ballot this fall in massachusetts and the legislature was in rebellion against governor dukakis and was insisting on passing a bill to repeal the furlough for life murderers sentenced to life in prison without parole finally the governor began to crumble but it is fascinating if members get a chance to see the videotape justice on furlough to notice that when victims of the murderers who had been furloughed by governor dukakis tried to see the governor he would not see them when cliff and angle barnes who had been tortured and raped by willie horton went to massachusetts to try to see the governor he would not talk to them governor dukakis had time for the families of the prisoners but he did not have time for the families of the murder victims that is pretty much typical of the leftwing mindset which always finds an excuse for the criminal but never finds much compassion for the innocent citizens which always finds a reason to make sure that the criminal gets the best possible defense but does not quite notice the policeman who may have lost his life in the process the result is a very biased viewpoint a viewpoint which i think is not representative of much of america but while all of us should read getting away with murder the article from the july readers digest and as many people as possible should see the justice on furlough video let me suggest to my colleagues here in the house that it is not good enough for the house of representatives simply to set the rules for the rest of the country it is not good enough for us to talk about rules as they apply to murderers in massachusetts or rules as they apply to wall street corruption but we also have to confront the fact that we here in the house have an obligation to look at some very real problems there is a fascinating article in this weeks congressional quarterly which talks about what is happening with political action committees and its impact on the congress there has been a series of articles recently in the new york times the washington post the wall street journal and the washington times outlining these problems the national journal has been commenting on the difficulties we are now faced with in terms of the ethics and election reform in the house i want to suggest that we are in a period when we have at least the beginnings of a very very serious need to change the rules of the house to reform the way in which we do business both in terms of our own ethics and in terms of our election procedure let me start by saying that i think rules need to be reasonable my guess is that the current rules as they apply to elections as they apply to office accounts as they apply to expenses and as they apply to a whole range of things are so complicated there are so many pages of detail they are so bureaucratized that virtually every member of the house engages occasionally in small minor violations that virtually everybody if they were carefully enough audited and if every question of doubt went against them would have something wrong i think that is a mistake and i think we need a very serious reform effort to rewrite the rules of the house and to write a coherent code of rules that includes our official duties our political behavior as candidates and our responsibilities as individuals i think it ought to be one set of documents which would cover all three questions because each of us plays a different role when we are a candidate when we are an official when we are a private citizen and very often because we have different agencies now writing overlapping rules frankly we have a lot of confusion but in addition i think we have to recognize just how serious the problem of incumbent invulnerability is becoming 98 4 percent of the incumbents were reelected in 1986 that is fundamentally undermining a process of the constitution the founding fathers clearly wanted the congress to be reelected every 2 years the founding fathers wanted in the constitution to have a peoples house by biennial elections in which we would renew ourselves and 40 percent of the incumbents in the first congress were not returned in 1790 when they had the first election after the beginning of the american government that is of those elected in 1788 40 percent did not come back in 1790 the founding fathers wanted a process of renewal a process of equal opportunity for the voter to fire those they could not get to to make sure that while you served for a while when you went back home every 2 years if the voters did not like you or like what you were doing they could get rid of you so that while the voter loaned power for you to go to the house the voter retained the power to fire you and that was the ultimate check on your behavior as a representative interestingly in the debates on the constitution at philadelphia the founding fathers debated between 6month terms and 2year terms many of the founding fathers wanted the house to be even more representative even closer to the people what do we have today we have quite the opposite of that system we have a system growing up now where the power of the incumbent to survive a combination of taxpaid office accounts congressional junk mail massive advantages in raising money from political action committees and from other contributors the ability of incumbents to affect gerrymandering so that when reapportionment occurs it tends to have a bias in favor of the incumbents the result is that we now have a house which is dramatically different than the founding fathers intended as the wall street journal noted in 1986 10 of the 34 senate seats that is 30 percent of the senate seats 14 of the 33 governorships or 42 percent of the governorships changed hands yet only 15 of the 435 house seats changed parties less than 4 percent less than onetenth of those which changed in the very first congress and of the incumbents who sought reelection in the house only 1 6 percent were defeated i yield to my colleague from texas"],

allocation for both budget authority and for outlays like many conference reports it was a very difficult exercise we had to reconcile 204 amendments i will not say that the other bodys conferees were stubborn but they were insistent upon their position nevertheless we persevered and we succeeded in our mission because this is a very good bill thanks to the excellent conferees on the part of the house particularly our good friend the gentleman from ohio the ranking member of our subcommittee the total recommended for this bill is 9 981 961 000 this is an increase of 194 163 000 over the

now seems far in the past its resulting high levels of air pollution particularly in urban areas still lingers on however and it has focused the attention of many in this country on the socalled greenhouse effect and on the related problems such as acid rain this bill for years has provided impetus to technologies that would mitigate the effects of both acid rain and atmospheric warming or the greenhouse effect since 1981 and again this year the congress has provided funding well in excess of that requested by the administration for research development and demonstration of such technologies for previous appropriations during this administration from fiscal year 1982 through 1988 the congress has increased acid rain related research from a request of 530 million to 1 2 billion an increase of 128 percent research related to global warming has been increased from 388 million to 862 million an increase of 123 percent in energy conservation research and development has been increased from a request of 560 million to 1 1 billion a 98percent increase i cite these increases to show the determination by our committee to treat the problems of acid rain and the warming atmosphere for demonstration of technologies that could lead to commercial plants in the 1990s the conference agreement supports an aggressive clean coal technology program which is also supported by the administration these technologies would decrease pollutants which cause acid rain as well as in some cases increase the efficiency of coalburning technologies which would in turn reduce coals contribution to carbon dioxide in the atmosphere for the clean coal program the conference agreement provides 190 million for fiscal year 1989 as part of the second procurement with an additional 135 million to become available in 1990 and 200 million to become available in 1991 in addition the conferees agreed to include 575 million for fiscal year 1990 to provide for a third competitive procurement research in other areas of fossil energy as well as in energy conservation have also been increased the conferees have recommended continuing energy research and development in fossil energy and conservation and energy conservation grants to states for lowincome weatherization and schools and hospitals recommendations for these programs total 753 million some 497 million over the budget request in fossil energy the conference agreement increases acid rain related research from 76 million to 191 million and carbon dioxide or greenhouse related research from 48 million to 140 million in conservation research and development has been increased from 86 million to 153 million the bill provides 1 1 billion for clean coal technology over a period of years and over 300 million in fossil energy and conservation to combat acid rain and carbon dioxide pollution but more effort will be required to deal with them in the future in order to prevent significant deterioration in our environment we plan to continue our support of this research just as we have done in the past and in this conference agreement the conferees have once again rejected the administrations attempts to curtail land acquisition for our national parks for our national forests our public lands and wildlife refuges the presidents budget request for the land and water conservation fund was only 21 653 000 that figure was raisea in the conference report to 206 633 000 which is an increase of 184 980 000 over the budget request the committee was determined again to support and maintain these areas so that this generation may pass along to our children and grandchildren and future generations the parks the forests the public lands the refuges the beauties that we now enjoy so that they may be enjoyed by those who come after us as well a minimal land acquisition program would only result in future bills facing higher land prices loss of critical habitat and hardships for private landowners included in this amount is 20 million for state grants from the land and water conservation fund the conferees have also responded to a general accounting office report detailing deficiencies in park maintenance by providing a net increase of 24 092 000 for maintenance the conference report includes 4 577 623 000 for programs of the department of the interior 1 845 011 000 for the unitedstates forest service 1 633 971 000 for programs of the department of energy and 1 835 356 000 for indian health indian education the smithsonian institution the national endowment for the arts and the humanities and the other related agencies of the bill i would like to highlight two major changes from the house bill the conferees agreed to include revised language on the national film preservation board which establishes it within the library of congress the board is authorized for 3 years with an appropriation not to exceed 250 000 for each fiscal year labeling is required for films nominated for inclusion in a national film registry the conferees have not included the house bill language which requires 50 percent domestic construction and content for any new construction of vessels rigs platforms and other structures used in the outer continental shelf the bill also contains provisions with respect to the outer continental shelf for a moratorium on leasing for oil drilling off the northern california coast and a moratorium on portions of the eastern gulf of mexico and georges bank in the north atlantic they are retained the moratorium to protect environmentally sensitive areas which would be affected adversely by drilling operations in the minerals management service program the conferees included 400 000 for tile audit program in mineral revenue collection and 35 000 for the state of louisiana to conduct 8 g audits in systems development and maintenance the conferees agree that these funds are to be used in mineral revenue compliance the conferees also have recommended 242 million for acquisition and transportation of oil for the strategic petroleum reserve at levels of 50 000 barrels per day they have also included 173 million to continue reserve capacity construction with regard to the 5 million in the conference agreement for competitive geoscience programs in the department of energy i want to clarify that the conferees intend that this money be allocated to procurements in the individual programs to which the money has been provided and not in one large procurement package which might tend to lessen the amount of competition for tile funds i want to mention an initiative taken by our committee in the house which i think is a most important development it is the appropriation for the national endowment for the humanities which deals with the deterioration of books in libraries a recent office of technology assessment study says this and i quote even in todays hightech society books are the principal records of human civilization over the centuries books have become the most reliable and permanent records available but in the last century that reliability has been tlhreatened by the use of modern acidic paper that beeones brittle and unstable in a relatively short period of time books printed since 1850 are deteriorating en masse in libraries the world over to deal with this problem the conferees agreed to provide 12 500 000 for such actions as microfilming brittie books including grants for national cooperative microfilming projects and awards to individual research libraries to film endangered volumes in their collections it is our expectation that research libraries which have preservation capabilities such as the new york public library would qualify for awards under this program the conferees finally have struggled with the question of squeezing all our programs to fit within a split of the difference between the house and senate 302 b allocations as i said i think we have succeeded we have brought the house a very good bill it continues important programs necessary for the protection and enhancement of our national resources while maintaining fiscal responsibility and providing a substantial return to the treasury again i want to commend all the conferees for their determined and unselfish efforts and contributions in rising to this difficult fiscal challenge and again i want to note the contributions of our ranking minority member the gentleman from ohio ralph regula i urge members on both sides of the aisle to support the conference report for further clarification i am

apologize if somebody else has asked you this questionis that the multilateral development banks provide assistance to developing nations for the production of commodities already in surplus i notice that in your preliminary statement this morning you indicated that you would take steps to discourage mdbs from doing this but we are getting some legislative proposals now on capitol hill for example our colleague mr boulter has introduced a bill h r 306 which is designed to put some legislative leverage behind this issue the bill would do a number of things but one of the things it would do is to require the mdbs to sign a written commitment that such lending will not occur for production of commodities already in surplus and if indeed that written commitment is thereafter breached by any mdb the united states would be required to terminate participation financial participation in that particular mdb do you have a position on that particular bill or more generally on that kind of legislative approach secretary baker yes sir we would be unequivocably opposed to that mr mchugh we think that legislation like that would really have a serious detrimental impact on our participation in the mdbs it would constitute a significant threat to replenishments and it would i think limit the ability of mdbs to raise money in the private capital markets the fact of the matter is as my statement indicates we have been successful in reducing significantly the number of loans that have been made by the mdbs to support the production of commodities in oversupply in fact i think there is only one loan in 1986 that could be criticized or questioned from that standpoint so immediate action legislation like this would be extremely counterproductive in my view as i indicated in my statement it seems to me we live in an ever increasingly interdependent world and we ought to recognize that fact if the united states has the worlds largest economy and is going to lead we cannot simply pull back and say we are not going to fund these institutions except under very rigid constraints"], [0.0001283586025238037, 0.4998716413974762, 1, "i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time it has been suggested that if gephardt is passed there will be massive retaliation in fact retaliation has been going on for 20 or 30 years there is literally nothing that can be done to american industry workers farmers agriculture that has not already been done we have 170 billion a year trade deficit it is costing us 4 million jobs it is costing us about a million and a half jobs to the japanese alone let us be clear about the primary cause of the trade deficitit is the unfair advantage our trading partners achieve because we play by different rules this analysis is crucial to todays debate when we first began these hearings the administration claimed that the cause of the emerging trade deficit was not unfair trade practices but high labor costs inefficient management and most importantly high differential real interest rates labor costs dropped management improved and the differential in interest rates narrowed considerably but the trade deficit continued to rise then they told us that it was the artificially overvalued dollar but the dollar has dropped precipitously and yet the trade deficit has continued to rise to the record levels of today now they blame the budget deficit and the policies of the central banks of bonn and tokyo i say they are running out of excuses for a trade deficit that is a function of the addlepated ideology of an administration which refuses to face the facts of the world marketplace as a consequence of the 1984 act ustr publishes annually a report on the foreign barriers to unitedstates exports the latest addition totals 291 pages it closely tracks the findings of the oversight subcommitteeyet somehow despite the evidence the administration continues to minimize the problems we believe that what is missing is an understanding that unfair foreign trade practices are not isolated acts but are part of an economic development strategy which we call the japanese model first technology is appropriated legally and illegally then certain perfections occur either in the product itself or the manufacturing process or both usually with government subsidies next the domestic market is protected from international competition goods are then dumped in third country markets and in the united states itself american firms are driven out of business and the foreign firm or firms become dominant in the world market when domination is achieved the resulting funds are then used to finance the next attack on a market for even more technically sophisticated products variations of this model affect our agricultural and service sectors as well as manufacturing a classic study involves the japanese targeting of electronic goods from the transistor radios in the 1950s to their attack on the supercomputer market today it is not sufficient to attack the separate facets of the problem particularly given that our trading partners have perfected the art of talking and shipping to the point where relief in those cases when it is finally obtained comes too late to save the targeted industry indeed the gephardt requirement that countries that have built hug trade surpluses based on unfair trade practices must take effective action to reverse those surpluses or face retaliation in this market is the only way to reverse the enormous incentive of the japanese and their imitators to continue to rely on this model for their economic development those who would label us protectionist often cite the infamous smoothawley tariff as the direct cause of the great depression and the indirect cause of world war ii i think that we should draw a lesson from another experience of those troubled years in considering this amendment in order to protect its borders forever from the germans the french built a chain of fortresses across the historical invasion routes called the maginot line the french relied on their technical advantage and guarded against the most visible threat to their security in 1974 we passed a trade bill which contained protections against unfair trade practicesour maginot line if you will we relied on the technical advantages our economy had acheived since the end of world war ii and built our paper forts in 1979 and 1984 we improved the existing fortifications the antidumping and countervailing laws sections 201 and 301 conditional gsp and so forth and today without the gephardt amendment we will further improve our reactive stationary fortificationsand we will continue to ignore our flanks i predict that if we do not pass this amendment our trading adversaries will continue to ignore our paper forts relying on the bunker mentality of our political leadership and the fifth column of economists and editorial writers to keep our guns silent as they continue their raids into our heartland and bar our firms from their markets what is happening here we are not seeking by the gephardt amendment to confer upon our people a special advantage all we ask is fair treatment in our marketplaces and in the worlds marketplaces the majority part of our problem is not noncompetitiveness it is restrictive trade practices by the foreigners we are not talking about smoothawley and protectism we are talking about fair treatment for american workers we are talking about eliminating targeting dumping and subsidies nothing in american trade law today or this bill without the gephardt amendment is going to protect the american workers against unfair trade practices which rob us of jobs opportunities and the ability to defend ourselves and assure our national security these unfair practices exist in every nation in the world the way nations get richer and they recognize this is to sell more than buy and they rig their laws to achieve that end the united states is the only country in the world which does not do this the gephardt amendment says that we are going to insist as a matter of law that our people are treated fairly and we are going to by this mechanism assure that the president takes the steps that are necessary to give fair treatment to american workers american agriculture and american industry that is not protectionism that is good sense and that assures that others do not get richer at our expense through unfair trade practices i urge my colleagues to vote for the gephardt amendment it is in the best interests of the country

0.49984151124954224, 0, "i rise today in strong support of h r 515 the credit card disclosure bill this bill acknowledges the basic consumers right to make an informed decision the disclosure requirements in this bill provide consumers the information necessary to make that choice for credit cards the three key pieces of information are the interest rate the annual fee and the grace period already we have seen dramatic downward shifts in interest rates as publicity surrounding institutions which offer extremely low interest rates has soared the disclosure requirements in this bill are basic consumer safeguards but it is important to remember that the language in this bill has been carefully crafted so as not to make it unnecessarily complicated for banks and other financial institutions to readily comply with the provisions i think there is basic agreement on the main provisions of this bill however i also want to address the amendment which will be offered by my distinguished colleague from illinois mr annunzio there is no one on the committee for whom i have more respect and i believe his goal of helping consumers is a laudable one i strongly believe that his amendment to cap interest rates is ill advised and may have unintended consequences a wise man once said that for every complicated problem there is an answer which is both simple and direct and wrong let me suggest that an interest rate cap fits that analogy first it is important to remember that there are three things that affect the cost of a credit card interest rates annual fees and grace periods depending on a consumers spending habits one or the other of these factors may be more important than the others for example a consumer who carries a balance over every month will seek low interest rates but may not mind a shortened or eliminated grace period a consumer who pays the balance in full each month and who therefore incurs no interest charges may not be as concerned with the interest rates as long as the annual fee is low and there is a reasonable grace period it is important to note that because this amendment does not limit annual fees there is nothing which would preclude a bank from doubling or tripling their annual fees especially if an interest rate cap is imposed i fail to see how it is going to help consumers if one of the costs of credit is kept arbitrarily low while allowing other charges to rise without limit at best some consumers would come out even from the change but those consumers who do not incur interest from month to month will end up paying more for their cards as the annual fees increase supporters of this amendment claim they are trying to help consumers by putting a cap on the cost of credit cards although we would all like to assist the consumer in making prudent credit choices and which is why i am supporting this disclosure bill we must face the facts that the consumers cost of credit is not solely a matter of interest rates smart consumers know that there are many other factors which can be even more important i strongly support this bill and oppose the annunzio amendment it does limit the choices that consumers have to shop wisely for their credit cards it does not limit any of the other costs of credit cards such as the annual fee and finally the amendment will restrict credit when such an action may have disastrous effects over the long term"]]}
