to hear from people for a little bit more than 1 minute to talk about issues that are significant and who would like to bring them to the attention of the american people and of course to their colleagues here in congress today i intend to bring the attention of the american people and my colleagues to a threat to the wellbeing of the american people a major threat that has gone unrecognized and could well change our way of life and change the way of life for our children and destroy one of the basic rights that were written into our constitution in order to protect the prosperity and security of our country i am talking about the changes that are being proposed in our fundamental technology law in our patent system and i know that sounds very boring to most people but the fact is without a strong patent system the american people would be at the mercy of both competitors in terms of their labor overseas but also in terms of the vicious and totalitarian elements in other countries that might want to do us harm it is our ability to produce the technology that america needs in order to make our people competitive and to produce the wealth that is necessary for a decent standard of living that has made america the great country that it is we are a great country not because we have very powerful and wealthy interests here in the united states which we do we are a great country because ordinary people are permitted to live decent lives and because our country has not been challenged throughout its history over and over again and had to waste all of our resources and all of our wealth on vast amounts of armaments and drafting all of our people into the military and having a militarized society in order to have us safe from a foreign threat no what we have done is we have been able to produce wealth dramatically in our country and had our workers being competitive with labor from around the world because we have been technologically superior there is a threat to that technology superiority an incredible threat that is being foisted off on the congress and the american people i am here to alert my fellow members of congress to this threat one needs only to see how important the technology element of our society has been right here in the united states congress there is a statue here in the capitol to philo farnsworth now who the heck knows who philo farnsworth was well not many but there is a statue to him here because he represents a very significant part of the american story philo farnsworth was a farmer in utah a man who was educated in engineering but a man who had very little resources he set out in between farming to try to find and discover a technological secret that had perplexed some of the most powerful and financial interests in our country rca at that time under a man named david sarnoff was americas premier technology company a company that had vast resources and was deeply involved in trying to find out how to invent a picture tube how we would have a tube that showed images rather than just radio waves that had voice on them this was a huge challenge and a historic challenge rca pumped millions of dollars of research into this the one who discovered this secret was philo farnsworth an independent inventor a man who was a farmer in utah he discovered the secret and then wrote to rca very naively believing that this big corporation would honor his discovery and permit him to have the benefitor at least a benefitfrom this discovery yes then rca sent philo farnsworth a representative from their laboratories when he described what he had found the scientist from rca went away saying we will be in touch and never got in touch the next thing that philo knew was that there was an announcement that rca had made a major breakthrough in discoveryonly it was exactly the discovery that philo farnsworth had made and had transmitted the information to rca this became one of the great jury and great legal battles of the early 20th century philo farnsworth an individual person was up against the most powerful american corporation of the day rca and had one of the strongest and toughest leaders of that corporation david sarnoff who vowed not to give him a penny and not to recognize him because it was rca that actually came up with this philo farnsworth was able to mobilize support behind his claim he was able to have people invest in his lawsuits and slowly but surely they made their way through our court system all the way to the supreme court of the united states god bless the united states of america a single man a poor individual farmer who had come up with an important technology secret had his rights respected by our supreme court over the power and influence of americas most powerful corporation of the day rca philo farnsworth was recognized as the inventor the inventor of the picture tube which has transformed our country and transformed the world all the picture tubes you see and now the screens that we see on our computers can be traced back to the discovery of this one individual philo farnsworth and the tragedy that his life was because over the years he lived a very poor life he was constantly in struggle he had very little resources by the time he won the supreme court case it was late in his life and he did not benefit as he should have greatly from that we have a statue to this wonderful american a man who stands for what america stands for using technology to benefit the people not just to enrich huge corporate interests indeed philo farnsworth has a statue here in the capitol but you will never see a statue to david sarnoff of rca that shows you where the heart and soul of america is the fact that we had a supreme court that decided for the little guy rather than the huge powerful corporation showed what kind of country we have that is what makes america great that is what has created the new technologies that have uplifted our people and made sure that our people were competitive and thus had high standards of living and that we were secure from foreign threats because we were technologically superior to those foreign threats this is what has made america great and today it is in jeopardy the technological edge of our country will be robbed from us by multinational corporations who are powerful and are shifting issues through the congress that will greatly diminish the patent protection of the american people had these same changes in the law that these multinational corporations would now foist upon us been the law in the days of philo farnsworth we would have no picture tube we would never have had a philo farnsworth we would never have had the recognition of the creative genius of the american people instead we would have had the powerful rich multinational corporations running roughshod over americas creative genius no we have that threat today and i would ask people to pay close attention to what is happening here on the floor of house in the next few months what has happened is we have to understand that patent protection of the american people is something that was written into our constitution it is part of the heart and soul of our country benjamin franklin is wellknown as the man who discovered electricity but he was also one of the great founders of our declaration of independence and yes one of the people who authored our constitutionbenjamin franklin the great technology hero the hero of liberty and just for all if you go to monticello and visit thomas jeffersons home it is filled with inventions small inventions thomas jefferson knew that we were not going to rely on big government we couldnt rely on big corporate interests and rich people but we would rely on the genius of the american people through technology freedom and technology are the two things that would uplift ordinary americans those things are now at stake they are now in danger we in fact are now facing basic changes to the concept of intellectual property rights and especially the rights of our inventors and it is being foisted upon this body in what i would say is a very deceitful manner by powerful interest groups from the outside but remember with the protection that we have had america has had the inventions we have uplifted the standard of living of the ordinary american we built the reaper which permitted us to harvest huge crops of food so that americans were wellfed and we became the breadbasket of the world the cotton gin which made sure that people had clothing there was a black american who invented the machine that permitted the mass production of shoes the mass production of shoes was permitted because a black american whose other rights were not protected his rights to own the intellectual property the inventions the patent rights to his invention were respected because of that all americans ended up with being able to have more than just one pair of shoes before this man invented his invention of how to mass produce shoes ordinary people had one pair of shoes and that was it that was it when they wore out your feet wore out we had things like the electric light that we know that thomas edison was so involved with telephones alexander graham bell all the major inventions that we have were invented by american genius not of very powerful corporations but of the american genius of the american people what we have always had however is a situation where big guys did try to steal the creativity of the little guy but in our country they couldnt get away with it in our country the philo farnsworths knew that they would be protected if they created something that uplifted their fellow man so americans and american genius was put to work as never before in any countrys history to make sure ordinary people and especially our working people in our factories and our companies could be competitive with those factories and companies and the workers overseas our people dont work harder than the people overseas that is not what made us a great country the fact is people work really hard all over the world especially in third world countries where people live in utter poverty they work really hard but it is the technology that is put into play the technology put into play with that hard work and the profit motive for investing in that technology and creating that technology that is what has made the difference in an american people that are wellfed american people with great opportunities american people who can be proud that they have a decent standard of living and are able to make decisions for themselves and their families not just live in the abject poverty that existed for so long in so much of the world no it wasnt just our hard work it wasnt just our natural resources it was a constitution that wrote into it the rights of every individual citizen and paramount to those rights even before the bill of rights in our constitution is a provision that guarantees that our inventors and our writers will be given the right to own to control their invention or their book for a given period of time and profit from it traditionally our inventors have had ownership rights to what they have invented for 17 years of protection during that 17 years they would own it and when they applied for a patent once that patent was issued they would have 17 years to control what they had invented also until that patent was issued it has always been in the united states kept totally secret what that invention is until the inventor has been actually granted the rights to own that invention well these things have led directly to a genius a surge of genius in our borders that reflected the fact that our people had freedom and technology available to them so these are things that we have taken for granted because this is what america is all about but today powerful multinational corporations especially in the electronics industry are trying to destroy americas patent system my colleagues should now understand this and the american people should understand this and be talking to their member of congress and their senators because if they succeed in undermining our patent system and destroying the rights of the little guy to own what he has created and give the big guys the power to steal from the little guys we will see a difference in our country within a generation we will no longer have these advantages that i just spoke about what we have today is an effort by the big guys to change the rules so they can get away with stealing from the little guys now obviously people arent going to come out and just say please lets vote for a bill that is going to break down the patent system so that big multinational corporations can steal from american inventors of course they are not going to say that so what do they say well let me put it this way 25 years ago when i first noticedthis fight has been going on the entire time that i have been in congress i noticed that what had happened was that some big corporations were trying to put into the gatt implementationgatt is a trade treaty they were trying to put into that trade treatys implementation language a bill that had to go through congress changes in our patent system that werent even required by the treaty i will get into what they were doing if you really want to see how heinous and sinister this is what were those changes 25 years ago that these big corporations wanted to make number one was saying that yes when you apply for your patent 20 years after you apply for it you really have no patent rights after that at all even if it takes 15 years to get your patent the american system was the clock starts ticking when you get your patent 17 years of protection these big guys were trying to give our american inventors maybe no protection after 20 years they had nothing but everybody would know about it because the second provision they were trying to foist off on us was that after 18 months if a patent had been applied for after 18 months even if the patent had not been granted they were going to publish the patent application so that every thief in the world would have heard all of the secrets of every american inventor they called it the patent application publication act they were so blatant about it after we fingered it and drew americas attention to it they changed the name of course then it became an issue of not trying to disclose patents or patent applications not trying to limit the amount of ownership that our patent people had it became instead a battle against the submarine patentors that is what they called it that was the bogeyman that was created that day in order to get people here to vote in a way that would destroy the patent rights of the american people the patent rights that i just outlined both of those were going to be eliminated you are going to have instead of no disclosure you will have full disclosure of your patent application even before you are granted the patent and you are not guaranteed any specific time but your patent was going to run out after 20 years even if you had never had any time to protect it that is what they were trying to do and we managed to stop them we put a coalition together a bipartisan coalition marcy kaptur of ohio and myself have been active on this issue for the last 25 years trying to thwart these huge corporate interests who are trying to neuter the rights of the little guy of the small inventor of the independent operator how did we stop them that very first time well we added an amendment on that said these changes that are being foisted on us todayor being voted on todayonly apply to companies that have over 100 employees all of a sudden those people who were advocating this saying oh this will be good for everybody especially the small inventor all of a sudden they had to withdraw the bill well if it was so good for the little guy why would they withdraw the bill well they withdrew the bill because the bill was aimed at helping huge corporate interests to step on the little guy in the united states we defeated that but we have been fighting fighting fighting for 20 years and this year it looks like we have lost the leverage that we had to defeat these powerful special interests that is why it is important for the american people and people involved in technology development to pay attention to proposals that are being made here in the house and in the senate concerning intellectual property rights especially concerning the patent rights that our people have enjoyed as i say since the founding of our country today we have a bill that is being presented again it cant be presented on how do we destroy the patent rights of the average american they have to find something that sounds so sinister that they can set up a straw man they will say look at him we are going to beat him up that is what this bill is about just like i said submarine patents were the reason why they had to eliminate the right of the small inventor to a guaranteed term or to have confidentiality in its patent application like before that was a submarine patent well now they are not saying that they have had to come up with a better term that is even more frightening and sickening than submarine patent the cynical nature of this type of debate on an issue was demonstrated by the fact that a corporate leader who was on the other side of this issue than i am has now changed his position and come to me with a description of how the words patent troll came about because now we hear that we have got to change the law not for submarine patents but now because patent trolls are preying on the american people they are draining us of funds and enriching themselves these patent trolls well where did that word come from this gentleman that i am talking about was in a meeting with the heads of some very powerful corporations they sat around in a circle to decide what term they should use he said to me well i recommended patent pirate well that wasnt sinister enough so they came up with patent troll by the time everyone heard that yes that is the one well why is it the one because it sounds so sinister that it is going to be able to blind people as to who the real victim is now we are out to get the patent troll but it is the little guy it is the small inventor it is the independent inventors that are going to be damaged severely by an attack on a patent troll now what is a patent troll by what they are trying to tell us patent trollwe keep hearing the argument that there are people in our society that are using basically patents that are not really good patents they are patents that really are not legitimate patents and they are using these to create litigation that will enrich the lawyersthe patent trollsbecause the patent trolls just reach out with some illegitimate patent claim and then they have to get paid off or they have to go to jail well how much of this is there there is some of that but let us note this there are frivolous lawsuits throughout our entire system there are frivolous lawsuits in almost every endeavor in the american economy but there are also legitimate lawsuits there are people who are really damaged and deserve to have the right to sue somebody the law that we are facing now that is being proposed here in congress for a patent law is the equivalent of eliminating the right of people to sue someone who has done damage to them in order to prevent a frivolous lawsuit from happening do we really want to neuter the rights of people because some people abuse the system you are going to take the 90 percent of the cases where it is not being abused or 95 percent of the cases where it is a legitimate suit and eliminate that right in order to handle the frivolous suits that is what is happening although we are being told that all of the suits are frivolous and that the inventors are being portrayed as moneygrubbers these guys trying to take advantage of these big corporationsyeah right the little guy is trying to take advantage of the big guy and that is why we have got to pass a law that dramatically restricts the rights of the little guy to deal with an infringement by a big corporation what this bill is h r 9 and it is waiting to be brought to the floor it could be brought to the floor in the next week month 2 months we dont know yet this bill dramatically undercuts the rights of legitimate patentholders to enforce their patents the patent troll element comes in with this today if you are a small inventor and a large corporate interest has been infringing on your invention if you own it for 17 yearsafter that by the way everybody can use it for freebut during that 17 years you have a right to be compensated for the fact that you are the one who discovered this you invested your time and your effort and your scarce resources in order to come up with this new discovery yes and they have a right then to try to bring if a large corporation is using it without paying them royalties they have a right to bring suit but many of them dont have those resources they dont have any money they are indeed independent small inventors up against corporations that are worth billions of dollars and i might say multinational corporations these arent just an american david sarnoff a lot of these corporations we are talking about are multinational corporations and they have nothing to do with the american interests they have everything to do with the interest of making money for their stockholders and their company which is multinational which is global in scope and not an american company necessarily we are going to undercut american inventors rights to try to enforce their patent from being stolen by multinational corporations that is what this bill does this is to me in my 25 or 26 years here in congress the best example of crony capitalism that i have ever seen what is crony capitalism that is when we pass laws and we set up regulations that are aimed atwhathelping the big guy in relationship to the little guy crony capitalism is when the little guys pay and end up having their rights trampled upon but the big guys are protected by different laws and clauses that we put into law here in washington in the house and in the senate well the bogeyman this time as i say is the patent troll the patent troll is what the patent troll is someonealthough i wouldnt call him a patent troll i would say there is a person who is willing to join with a small inventoror independent inventorto see that his patent is enforced we are not talking about phony patents we are talking about legitimate patents we are not talking about frivolous claims we are talking about legitimate claims to patent claims of an inventor but the inventor does not have the strength to enforce that against a big corporation that has an unlimited budget this bill would make it dramatically more difficult for anyone to enlist someone who is not the inventor to help them press their case against the infringement the stuff that they had by the way if this law h r 9 was passed and would have been law at the time of philo farnsworth philo farnsworth would have been beaten up kicked around stepped upon and he would not have had any benefit from his invention of the picture tube do we want a country in which the big guys are able to do that to the small inventors how long are we going to be on top of things how long will the standard of living of our people stay high and our businesses competitive and our country safe and secure because of technological advances how long will that last if we are stepping on the little guy and we fundamentally change the nature of technology law in our country that is what is happening this bill passed last year in the house and it was stopped in the senate let me note that one of the amendments that i personally had to propose that demonstrate how bad this bill isalthough i managed to win the one amendment that we were able to winwas they wanted to take away the rights of an inventor to sue the patent office if indeed the patent office was not legally acting in terms of his patent application in other words if a government agency was doing something illegally using illegal criteriamaybe because someone else was influencing the decision from the outside maybe there was just some sort of personality problem maybe it was corruption from withinbut if an independent inventor sees that he is being treated and is being dealt with in a way that is not consistent with the law the small inventor has always had a right just like any other american to sue and take his case to court this is how blatant h r 9 is that bill contained a provision that said the small inventor cant take his case to court they are going to neuter the small inventor of his right to take it to court and he has to instead go to an ombudsman at the patent officeoh my an ombudsman how nice eliminating the right of an american citizen and inventor in order towhatin order to send him to a government bureaucrat and the agency that he thinks has done him wrong rather than having a day in court that exemplifies everything that is in h r 9 and it is so cynical because what we have got is again the american people saying look at this straw man it is called straw man argumentation lets build up a straw manthe trollsand everybody will think that we are aiming at the trolls when in fact the real targets are the little guysthe american independent inventorsthe little guys who cant afford without some help from the outside to enforce their patents there is nothing wrong with someone investing in an inventor who says look i have got my whole lifes savings in this i have invented this but this big corporation refuses to give me any royalties from my patent there is nothing wrong with trying to help that inventor enforce his rightsthere is nothing wrong at allbut the straw man is that person who is actually investing in this now he didnt invent it and he is going to profit by it thus he is a troll no that person is fulfilling an important role in not permitting outside people to invest in inventions and with inventors by doing that what we have done is diminish the value of every american patent that understanding defeated this bill in the senate last year because our american universities understood that if that went in the value of all of these patents that the american universities have been developing would dramatically go down it diminishes the value of all patents when you eliminate that right of the people to invest in patent enforcement that makes sense so there was an upheaval at almost every american major university and in many other industries that deal directly with longterm research and development like the pharmaceutical industry for example they knew that we could not allow this to happen that was stopped in the senate the last time around people realized that this type of crony capitalist attempt was to the detriment of the american people we have some of the most powerful multinational corporations still at play trying to push this through this session of congress people have to know that h r 9 is crony capitalism personified they need to talk to their congressmen and my colleagues need to talk to each other about this bill and not just accept what is being handed to them as something that has made its way through the committee process this bill destroys the rights of discovery for the little guy this suit basically doesnt do anything to go up against frivolous lawsuits but it deems all of the legitimate cases and puts them in the same category as frivolous lawsuits h r 9 causes fees and fees on defending infringement would be leveled not on the guys who have committed the crime we are actually leveling fees on the people who are trying to enforce their rights we are asking people to pay more money in order to enforce their rights it destroys for example the treble damage awards now what does that mean if you are a little guy to get a lawyer to help you that lawyer has to know he is going to make a profit when getting involved in a suit against a big corporation today they have what they call triple damages if the corporation knows that it is infringing on the little guy there are triple damages they are trying to get rid of those triple damages and say no only actual damages what does that mean the little guy can never afford to hire a lawyer the lawyers wont get involved you can see these big corporations they certainly have all of the legal help they need basically that provision alone neuters the leverage that a small inventor has to get some legal help in his battle to defend his or her own property rights this bill by the way fails to identifyand it even sometimes protectslawyers who are operating on bad faith with frivolous lawsuits as compared to trying to helplets deter frivolous lawsuits but lets not do it by eliminating the rights of people who have legitimate claims against big corporations there is another bill now emerging in the house it is h r 9 it is a disaster we need to make sure people know that the american people have been tipped off and that we are not going to let this happen by the major huge corporations like google which is one of the main groups behind this trying to rip off these little guys we are not going to allow that to happen and they are not going to rip us off either this has been recognized in the senate like i said it was stopped the last time so there is a bill in the senate s 632 senator coons has put this bill in this bill reasserts the condition of willful infringement basically it reinforces the idea that if a company is willfully infringing this is something that someone needs to be paid for and compensated for because someone intentionally stepped on his rights it gives the pto the discretion to award damages in these cases when you see that a big company has willfully said we will ignore the fact that we know this group invented it ignore that just go ahead and if they try to sue us we will step on them or we will get the rules of the game changed in congress so that they dont have a chance to sue us s 632 the coons bill in the senate specifically allows higher education and smaller entities to be identified as legitimate owners thus we are protecting the actual little guys and their educational institutions what we also have in the senate bill is something that identifies bad faith in these demand letters there are frivolous lawsuits it actually gives strength and power to thwart these frivolous lawsuits without damaging the rights of the small inventor and the traditional rights of the american people we are up against a major fight but here we have a good piece of legislation in the senate in the coons bill s 632 and in a crony capitalism bill h r 9 here in the house the american people have to at times get involved or things will go haywire in our country we dont have the rights and privileges that every american enjoys simply because they are in the constitution over the years the american people have stepped up when they have seen that their rights were being trampled upon the big guys were always around trying to steal from the little guys but as we saw in the case of philo farnsworth we have a commitment to americas little guys as for the men and women who maybe are not rich but who have a creative genius that will uplift all of us we have made a commitment to them h r 9 breaks that commitment and destroys their ability to actually benefit from their own creative genius i would ask my colleagues to spend time reading h r 9 and consider the straw man argumentthe trolls get beyond the slogan and see what effect it will have and ask small inventorsindependent inventorsand educators what impact the changes in h r 9 will have once the legislators here in the house do and once they understand the damage that this will do to the american people and how the little guy is going to be stepped upon they will vote against it but they have to have their attention drawn to this people are busy here in washington the biggest problem is getting the attention of our colleagues to pay attention to a bill like h r 9 that is part of what the citizenry has to do if our process is going to work they need to be talking to their congressmen they need to be talking to their senators whether you are an educator and you deal with patents of your educational institution or whether you are an independent inventor and have an idea that will make americans more productive and more competitive or make our country safer you are the treasure house of this country and they are trying to destroy that treasure right now i call on my colleagues to join me in opposition to h r 9 and to work with the senate to try to have the senate bill intertwined and to come to a compromise so we can have a positive bill here in the house and so we can move forward in a positive way to make sure that americans remain prosperous that americans remain secure and that americans remain free that is what our constitution was all about that is what thomas jefferson was all about and that is what benjamin franklin was all about that is what we are supposed to be all about i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.0, 0.0, 0, "i rise today to speak about an issue that i care deeply about protecting unborn babies later today this body will vote on h r 36 the paincapable unborn child protection act this legislation should not be controversial it simply protects unborn babies that a preponderance of scientific evidence has proven can feel pain we are talking about the sixth month of pregnancy this bill is an important step in protecting the unborn i am a proud cosponsor i look forward to casting my vote in favor of the legislation later today recently a group of students at west virginia university made news for courageously speaking out in defense of life at an abortion clinic near morgantown i know firsthand that it is not always politically correct to stand for your values but we should never back down from protecting the unborn i applaud these brave wvu students for their actions their willingness to stand for life reminds me of my days at dartmouth college when i served as the president of the dartmouth coalition for life i remember standing in the cafeteria and handing out educational materials about protecting the unborn and the development of life while i may not have won any popularity contest by standing up for my beliefs that life is precious and abortion is wrong i sure got my fellow students thinking about the prolife issue my prolife commitment was cemented even further when i became a father i have three children and actually today my youngest daughter turns 7 months old i am pleased to represent the state of west virginia where the prolife movement is thriving and the rights of the unborn are being restored in fact just this past february our west virginia state legislature passed our own paincapable unborn protection act by wide bipartisan margins in the state senate of west virginia the exact same bill banning abortion after 20 weeks passed the state senate of west virginia by a vote of 295 with 11 of 16 democrat state senators in my statethat is 68 percent of the democratsvoting for the bill in the west virginia state house of delegates the vote was 8812 again with twothirds of state house members that are democrats voting for the bill this is a bipartisan issue i am hopeful today that a strong bipartisan majority in this chamber will follow the example of my home state of west virginia and pass the paincapable unborn child protection act so these protections are extended to unborn babies in every state in the united states i am honored to also be the lead cosponsor of the life at conception act which simply clarifies that human life begins at conception there is no question that we in the prolife community have our work cut out for us president obama and most democrats in congress refuse to protect life at any stage one of the best examples of how out of touch the other side on this abortion issue came just a few weeks ago across the aisle in the senate where democrats were willing to block a bill aimed at protecting victims of human trafficking simply because it included a provision that prohibited taxpayer funding of abortion they are the extremists on this issue look at president obama himself in 2008 when he was running for president and he was in a debate against john mccain in the saddleback church forum moderated by rick warren the moderator asked president obama when life began and the presidents response was whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade the president of the united states said it is above his pay grade to say when human life begins that is a shame when i ran for congress i made the commitment to the people of the second district of west virginia that i would do everything in my power to defend the unborn i continue to be guided by my faith my values my education and my constituents on this issue i look forward to working with

their 2015 taxes and americans from all walks of life disclosed some of their most private information and handed over their hardearned dollars to the government with this in mind last week i was proud to introduce legislation prohibiting the use of funds by the irs to target citizens for exercising their first amendment rights americans have seen federal agencies abuse their power and the irs is one of the worst offenders the irs has specifically targeted conservative groups simply for being conservative this is a direct violation of the first amendment my bill preserves the integrity of the first amendment by ensuring its protections are never compromised by unelected federal bureaucrats specifically h r 4903 protects americans by prohibiting use of funds by the irs and its rogue bureaucrats to carry out government abuse on citizens for exercising their constitutional rights i can think of nothing more despicable than persecution for beliefs tax day is stressful enough with the tax code we have in place the irs has no business in striking fear into the hearts of americans for expressing their strongly held beliefs and convictions the constitution is the law of the land whether the irs likes it or not we must hold the irs and its unelected bureaucrats accountable especially because they have overstepped their constitutional bounds before as my colleague pointed out my colleague on the other side may dispute our legislation but they cant dispute the facts my colleagues serving on the oversight and government reform committee and the ways and means committee have been investigating the irs unlawful targeting of conservative groups since 2012 they were dogged in their pursuit of justice for every americans fundamental right the freedom of speech the investigation revealed that as a result of the supreme courts decision in citizens united v federal election commission democratic leadership pressured irs bureaucrats to fix the problem by taking an aggressive stance against political speech by taxexempt entities my colleagues also found clear evidence and testimony that the tea party and other conservative organizations were targeted for enhanced scrutiny because their organizations names reflected their conservative beliefs for 27 months from february 2010 until may 2012 the irs systematically targeted conservative taxexempt applicants for additional scrutiny and delay this is an egregious violation of the first amendment rights of all americans the leader of this scheme was lois lerner an irs official at the time as was mentioned in april 2010 a sensitive case report on the targeted tea party groups is shared with lerner when she first learned of a spike in tea party applications in june and july of 2011 lerner is

vehemently denied on the record to congress that the agency was targeting conservative groups in may 2013 lois lerner testified before the house committee on oversight and government reform she proclaimed her innocence before invoking her fifth amendment right and refusing to answer questions from lawmakers for 2 more years the irs circumvented congress investigations lois lerner time and time again refused to cooperate with congress in its investigation of targeting conservative groups and instead hid behind the fifth amendment before i was elected to congress my colleagues in the

american energy means jobs when we come here on this house floor and talk about ways to get our economy moving again ways to help americans who want to get back to work there is a very clearcut commonsense answer to get our economy moving again and that is just to open up more of the resources of this great nation just on the placard right there above us inscribed on the walls of this house chamber is a plaque that starts off that says let us develop the resources of our land it is on the house chamber and yet president obama through his policies through his radical regulationsevery single day his unelected bureaucrats wake up figuring out more ways to close off those resources to kill those american jobs when my colleagues come here on the house floor and tell story after story about things like the war on coal these are real wars that this obama administration is waging upon american workers the war on coal is real i have seen it in the eyes of coal workers when i went to my colleagues district in ohio we sat out before a whole room full of coal workers many of them multigenerational these arent people who have their first job in the industry for many of them their father their grandfather worked in the coal industry when you look out at coal workers today as i saw in eastern ohio you see the look of fear not because they face global competition they can beat global competition what they cant beat right now is the barrage of radical regulations coming from the obama administration killing american jobs it has got a real direct impact on workers across this country people who are part of the middle class today that the president loves talking about yet that middle class dream is under attack by these policies they have real impacts in fact one of the other things i went out and saw when i was out in eastern ohio was the utica shale play another example of great american ingenuity these arent just american jobs this is american ingenuity that is figuring out how to explore new areas of energy to allow us not only to create good jobs in america but to be completely energy independent to export our energy to other countries including some of our friends in the world our allies around the world right now that have to get energy from countries like russia who use energy as a weapon against those very countries who would love to get energy from america what is the presidents answer to them the presidents answer is to make it more difficult to create that energy here through rules through regulations what are some real examples just this week the president is in paris not to talk about ways to combat isis and the global threat of terrorism the president is over in paris talking about global warming as people are walking around this town in parkas right now because it is so cold the president is trying to focus on ways to make our economy in america less competitive globally so this week we are bringing up more legislation to push back on those kind of regulations one example is later this week under the congressional review act we are going to be bringing up legislation to reverse president obamas new source performance standard this was one of the many radical rules coming out of the epa one of the biggest threats to jobs in america is the unelected bureaucrats over the epa who have another brilliant idea again dreamed up by people that are unelected that now have a plan to actually make it more difficult to create electricity in america not only more difficult but dramatically more expensive for hardworking taxpayers in this country to buy electricity so we are going to bring up a bill on the house floor this week to reverse that radical regulation as we bring that up we are going to have this debate about something very specific in terms of a policy brought up by the president that is going to make it much harder for our country to be competitive much harder for middle class families to achieve that american dream because it is going to make things more expensive for them things that they buy not just their electricity but it cascades into all the other things that people buy when they go to grocery stores when they go do their christmas shopping these are having real impacts on real people something else we are going to be taking on is the department of the interior right now one of the other agencies of president obama coming out with a well control rule that is going to make it very difficult to drill for oil in the gulf of mexico a place where we through american ingenuity have figured out ways to generate more energy in america that we can use not only to help our economy but to help our friends all around the world so what is the presidents answer using unelected bureaucrats once again to propose a rule that is going to make it more difficult to create those american jobs then of course as my colleague from ohio was talking about this week we are also going to bring up a bill called the architecture of abundance a bill to create more american jobs to create real american energy security again to open up those natural resources that are being shut down by this president so when you talk about getting the economy back on track you dont need a team of economists to come in and figure out some new way to invent the wheel the answer is sitting right underneath our feet in many cases it is the energy that is trapped not trapped by the lack of ingenuity because americans more than anybody in the world have figured out great ways to go and use technology to go and get those resources attract those resources explore and then produce those resources but unfortunately their biggest challenge every day is not the competition from other states not the competition from other companies it is the challenge of the threatening regulations from this obama administration that are trying to shut those opportunities down it has real impacts on real people the coal industry the oil industry the natural gas industry all across the board when our allies around the world are looking to us and saying we want to trade with the united states we want to be able to buy the oil that america is generating that we have now a surplus of and yet the president wants to issue a veto threat when we say lets allow for exporting of oil for goodness sake we have an abundance of it people are getting laid off in the united states those middle class workers that the president loves talking about at photoops who are being laid off because of his policies we have got the technology we have got the expertise we are the world leader all we need is for the right policies to unleash that potential to unleash that opportunity to create those american jobs so as we have been talking about tonight the house will actually be taking actionnot sitting on the sidelines not just criticizing but taking actionbringing bills on the house floor this week to open up those opportunities for hardworking taxpayers to create more middle class opportunities for people who want to be a part of this industry but also to lower costs for these middle class families who are struggling under these tough economic times to be able to have more opportunities for themselves and their families hopefully we will continue this debate throughout this week and throughout the rest of this congress as we bring these good pieces of legislation to open up those resources again as the placard says at the top of the house chamber here to develop the resources of this land so that america can be the world leader in energy so we dont have to get our energy from countries who dont like us but we can actually export and create more job opportunities and help our allies around the world by undermining countries like iran and russia and others who want to do them harm i look forward to continuing this debate i am so proud to be a part of this effort in the house to create more energy opportunities in america i thank my colleague from ohio for leading in this effort"], [0.0, 0.0, 0, "i want to thank my good friend chairman royce for his leadership on this bill the markup and for the very timely recommendations he and staff made to improve it i would like to thank eliot engel again for working hand in glove in a good bipartisan effort to protect international religious freedom as my good friend chairman royce noted a moment ago 18 years ago congress had the foresight to pass the international religious freedom act of 1998 that landmark bill authored by congressman frank wolf of virginia made advancing the right to religious freedom a significant and profoundly serious unitedstates foreign policy priority passage of the international religious freedom act was not easy there were determined opponents in congress and in the clinton administration i know i chaired the congressional hearings and the subcommittee markup it was no cakewalk but our opposition was overcome by the courage tenacity and vision of frank wolf bolstered by a diverse bipartisan and ecumenical coalition of members of congress ethnic minority and religions groups and human rights organizations that coalition has reassembled to support this bill today the frank r wolf international religious freedom act i want to especially thank anna eshoo who is the principal democratic sponsor of this legislation for her leadership and for working particularly in the middle east to combat the savagery that is being imposed upon people of minority faiths including christians i thank her for her leadership and again for being the principal democrat on this bill let me just note that naming this bill after frank wolf who i consider to be and many of us consider to be the william wilberforce of modern times is an attempt to recognize his extraordinary lifes work promoting human rights 34 years as a member of congress including and especially religious freedom he now serves as the wilson chair at baylor again continuing his lifesaving work for religious believers all over the world he just returned from nigeria and testified at our hearing last week he was in the embattled states in northern nigeria where boko haram runs free massacring people he was there on a factfinding mission to promote religious freedom the frank r wolf international religious freedom act that is before us is a series of upgrades to meet the challenges of the 21st century we know that the world is experiencing an unprecedented crisis of international religious freedom a crisis that continues to create millionsno tens of millions of victims a crisis that undermines liberty prosperity and peace a crisis that poses a direct challenge to the unitedstates interests in the middle east russia china subsaharan africa and elsewhere in the world the pew research center notes that over 75 percent of the worlds population today lives in countries where severe religious freedom abuses occur annually according to pew instances of antisemitism are at a 7year high it is getting worse everywhere particularly in the middle east but also in europe and in the united states ancient christian communities in iraq and syria are on the verge of extinction and other religious minorities in the middle east face a constant assault from the islamic state several weeks ago this congress passed a resolution sponsored by jeff fortenberry that was followed by a declaration by secretary of state john kerry that said that isis has committed and continues to commit genocide mass atrocities and war crimes against christians yazidis and other minority faiths we are on record we know it is happening we are speaking out in a couple of weeks i am chairing a hearing on what is next what should we be doing next to combat this terrible terrible crisis in nigeria the islamist terror group boko haram is believed to have killed over 6 600 people last year alone mostly christian but there are muslims as well who are being targeted according to the testimony we received last week since 2009 the number is about 15 000 year to date since 2009 at one of those hearings a few years ago i had a man named habila habila i met him at an idp camp in jos nigeria where a lot of churches have been firebombed he told me this story he was credible and it checked out and he came to congress and testified boko haram put an ak47a terroristto his jaw and said renounce christ or i will kill you you must become a muslim on the spot habila said i am ready to meet my lord and this terrorist pulled the trigger and blew most of his face away what courage what faith for a man and when he told the story you could have heard a pin drop the bipartisan unitedstates commission on international religious freedom just released its 2016 annual report and let me note parenthetically uscirf or that commission was also created by chairman wolf as part of irfa the original bill they have found that the abuses committed by governments and nonstate actors has deteriorated the incarceration of prisoners of conscience they point out remains astonishingly widespread they point out that over the past year the chinese government as just one of many examples has stepped up its persecution of religious groups across the board tibetans uighurs muslim uighurs christians and of course the falun gong i spoke in midfebruary at nyu i gave a keynote there in shanghai and talked about how xi jinping the president of china is in a race to the bottom with north korea to make religion absolutely subservient to the communist party he calls it the sinification of religion and what was already a bad situation has now become demonstrably worse the frank r wolf international religious freedom act will upgrade the tools so that this administration and subsequent ones can do an even better job to try to mitigate and hopefully end religious persecution it does this by one requiring that international religious freedom policies be integrated into national security immigration rule of law and other relevant unitedstates foreign policies it creates a designated persons list of individuals sanctioned for participating in or directing religious freedom abuses it expands diplomatic training on international religious freedoms for all state department diplomats creates a tier system for irfa for the reports not just countries of particular concern of which there are currently 10 but also those that are on a watch list those that are bad and perhaps getting worse it gives the president authority to designate nonstate actors in addition to countries and it also requires the ambassador at large to report directly to the secretary of state it also is increasingly clear that religious freedom diplomacy is really needed to advance unitedstates interests around the world this will do it the legislation is backed by the unitedstates conference of catholic bishops and the international religious freedom roundtable a diverse and ecumenical group of individuals from the faith community finally just let me thank scott flipse who worked for frank wolf previously then he worked for the international religious freedom office at the state department and now is working at the china commission our general counsel piero tozzi janice kaguyutan i thank her for her work on this and sajit gandhi this is a true bipartisan piece of legislation and hopefully the senate will favorably receive it"], [0.0, 0.0, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume h r 758 the lawsuit abuse reduction act would restore mandatory sanctions for frivolous lawsuits filed in federal court many americans may not realize it but today under what is called rule 11 of the federal rules of civil procedure there is no requirement that those who file frivolous lawsuits pay for the unjustified legal costs they impose on their victims even when those victims prove to a judge the lawsuit was without any basis in law or fact as a result the current rule 11 goes largely unenforced because the victims of frivolous lawsuits have little incentive to pursue additional litigation to have the case declared frivolous when there is no guarantee of compensation at the end of the day h r 758 would finally provide light at the end of the tunnel for the victims of frivolous lawsuits by requiring sanctions against the filers of frivolous lawsuits sanctions which include paying back victims for the full costs of their reasonable expenses incurred as a direct result of the rule 11 violation including attorneys fees the bill also strikes the current provisions in rule 11 that allow lawyers to avoid sanctions for making frivolous claims and demands by simply withdrawing them within 21 days this change eliminates the free pass lawyers now have to file frivolous lawsuits in federal court the current lack of mandatory sanctions leads to the regular filing of lawsuits that are clearly baseless so many frivolous pleadings currently go under the radar because the lack of mandatory sanctions for frivolous filings forces victims of frivolous lawsuits to roll over and settle the case because doing that is less expensive than litigating the case to a victory in court correspondence written by someone filing a frivolous lawsuit which became public concisely illustrates how the current lack of mandatory sanctions for filing frivolous lawsuits leads to legal extortion that correspondence to the victim of a frivolous lawsuit states i really dont care what the law allows you to do its a more practical issue do you want to send your attorney a check every month indefinitely as i continue to pursue this under the lawsuit abuse reduction act those who file frivolous lawsuits would no longer be able to get off scotfree and therefore they could not get away with those sorts of extortionary threats any longer the victims of lawsuit abuse are not just those who are actually sued rather we all suffer under a system in which innocent americans everywhere live under the constant fear of a potentially bankrupting frivolous lawsuit as the former chairman of the home depot company has written an unpredictable legal system casts a shadow over every plan and investment it is devastating for startups the cost of even one illtimed abusive lawsuit can bankrupt a growing company and cost hundreds of thousands of jobs the prevalence of frivolous lawsuits in america is reflected in the absurd warning labels companies must place on their products to limit their exposure to frivolous claims a 5inch brass fishing lure with three hooks is labeled harmful if swallowed a vanishing fabric marker warns it should not be used for signing checks or any legal documents as signatures will disappear completely a household iron contains the warning never iron clothes while they are being worn a piece of ovenware warns ovenware will get hot when used in oven a hair dryer warns never use while sleeping a cardboard car sun shield that keeps sun off the dashboard warns do not drive with sun shield in place not to be outdone a giant yellow pages directory warns do not use this directory while operating a motor vehicle here are just a couple of examples of frivolous lawsuits brought in federal court in which judges failed to award compensation to the victims a man sued a television network for 2 5 million because he said a show it aired raised his blood pressure when the network publicized his frivolous lawsuit he demanded the court make them stop although the court found the case frivolous not only did it not compensate the victim it granted the man who filed the frivolous lawsuit an exemption from even paying the ordinary court filing fees in another case lawyers filed a case against a parent claiming the parents discipline of his child violated the eighth amendment of the constitution which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment by the government not private citizens one of the lawyers even admitted to signing the complaint without reading it the court found the case frivolous but it awarded the victim only about a quarter of its legal costs because rule 11 currently doesnt require that a victims legal costs be paid in full the lawsuit abuse reduction act would change that in his 2011 state of the union address president obama said im willing to look at other ideas to rein in frivolous lawsuits mr president here it is a onepage bill that would significantly reduce the burden of frivolous litigation on innocent americans i thank the former chairman of the judiciary committee congressman lamar smith for introducing this simple commonsense legislation that would do so much to prevent lawsuit abuse and to restore americans confidence in the legal
