{"top_correct": [[0.0, 1.0, 1, "i appreciate and commend the gentleman from illinois my colleague and alpha brother for scheduling this special order this afternoon i am delighted that we have an opportunity through this special order to talk about the proud history of alpha phi alpha and its ongoing nationwide efforts to meet some of the critical needs of the africanamerican community we have already heard men of alpha phi alpha have had a strong positive impact on our society in every profession and in every field of endeavor i am fortunate to serve with many of our alpha colleagues the gentleman from the 15th congressional district of new york the gentleman from the 32nd congressional district of california the gentleman from the 7th congressional district of alabama the gentleman from the 2nd congressional district of pennsylvania the gentleman from the 6th congressional district of new york we follow the proud footsteps of adam clayton powell who was elected in congress in the late 1940s and many other alpha brothers who have served in congress and prepared the pathway for numerous other alpha brothers who serve in public office at the local state and federal levels alphas can also claim three of the big four civil rights movements so when one considers the members of this distinguished fraternity it should come at no surprise that alpha brothers would be in the leadership of addressing some of our most serious social problems whitney young martin luther king floyd mckessick were also in the forefront as alpha brothers in the civil rights movement they focused on the right to vote as has already been indicated one of the early slogans of the fraternity was a voteless people is a hopeless people because of this focus the martin luther king memorial is so appropriate and we are proud to have an alpha member so honored we also must not forget the late thurgoqd marshall who argued the supreme court case brown v board of education which desegregated public schools and led to the fall of jim crow laws everywhere that is important to note because education has been such a critical issue in the alpha history go to high school go to college was andther early slogan an early program in alpha phi alpha project alpha is another one of those important projects young africanamerican males today face many challenges truancy illiteracy drugs violence and teen fatherhood and those needs need to be addressed that is why the week of october 7 through october 14 will be project alpha week focusing on project alpha for some 20 years now alpha phi alpha fraternity has worked with the march of dimes in an effort to respond to the challenges facing young black males project alpha is a result of this project and its mission has been to create a national program to prepare young men for the roles that they will be expected to assume in their adulthood in communities throughout this country project alpha has created safe havens for young men to learn about and explore ways to develop protective factors to minimize the impact of the social hazards which are present today project alpha provides education on sexuality fatherhood and the role of men in responsible relationships it motivates young men to make smart decisions about their future and to take an active role in achieving their desired goals it is a daunting task that project alpha has taken on young black men today face many obstacles on their road to adulthood africanamerican males continue to lag behind their female counterparts in most measures of academic progress it is particularly unfortunate to note that 25 percent of all black men can expect to have some contact with the criminal justice system we know already that nationally 3 out of every 10 young black males are in jail prison on probation or otherwise involved in the criminal justice system while unemployment levels for african americans are at an alltime low the rate continues to be unacceptable in many urban communities and this presents yet another risk factor for young african american males by focusing on those 12 to 15 project alpha lays the groundwork early for developing the protective factors that reduces the likelihood of teen fatherhood and the associated risks that result from teen pregnancy by providing positive role models from the community project alpha teaches the participants about the social economic and personal consequences of early fatherhood and by reducing the rate of teen pregnancy we are improving thq likelihood that these young men will stay in school stay away from drug use and other negative behaviors that is why we congratulate the alpha phi alpha in designating october 7 through 14 as project alpha week i want to thank the gentleman from illinois my brother alpha member for holding this special order this afternoon i applaud the members of alpha phi alpha and the march of dimes for their continued commitment to improving the lives of young african american males in the african american community and again congratulate the gentleman on holding this special order"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "i originally voted for this bill but only very reluctantly i will not vote to override the presidents veto i am not voting to sustain the veto because i oppose estatetax relief for familyowned ranches and farms or other small businesses in fact i definitely think we should act to make it easier for their owners to pass them on to future generations this is important for the whole country or course but it is particularly important for coloradans who want to help keep ranch lands in open undeveloped condition by reducing the pressure to sell them to pay estate taxes but there is a better way to do it than by enacting this republican bill that is why i voted for the democratic alternative when the house originally considered this bill that democratic alternative bill would have provided real effective relief without the excesses of the republican bill it would have raised the estate taxs special exclusion to 4 million for a couple owning a farm or small business so under that alternative a married couple owning a family farm or ranch or a small business worth up to 4 million could pass it on intact with no estate tax whatsoever also the democratic alternative actually would have provided more immediate relief to small business and farm owners unlike the republican billwhich is phased in over 10 yearsthe democratic alternative would have taken effect immediately that means a couple passing on their farm or small business in the near future would avoid more tax under the democratic plan than under the republican bill they would not have to hope to live long enough to see the benefits in addition by increasing the general exclusion from 675 000 to 1 1 million next year the democratic alternative would have allowed parents to pass on millionaire status to their children without a penny of estate tax burden and the democratic alternative also would have lowered estate tax rates by 20 across the board so the democratic alternativewhich i voted for which deserved adoption and which would not have been vetoedwould have provided important relief from the estate tax and would have done so in a real effective and prompt way furthermore the democratic alternative would have provided this relief in a fiscally responsible way that would not jeopardize our ability to do what is needed to maintain and strengthen social security and medicare provide a prescription drug benefit for seniors and pay down the public debt by contrast it is precisely the fiscal overkill of the republican bill that made me most reluctant to vote for it and that leads me to vote to sustain the presidents veto as the rocky mountain news put it in a september 3rd editorial the republican tax cut is a gamble that the present economic boom isnt going to slow and is fiscally irre mr lantos i will vote today sponsible to uphold the presidents veto of the estate once fully phased in the republican bill tax elimination act would forgo nearly 50 billion a year in rev when this legislation was first considered in enue with no guarantee that this revenue loss the house in june i strongly supported and will not harm social security and medicare in voted for the democratic alternative which was future years presented by congressman rangel of new the bills sponsors say it will cost 28 2 bil york that proposal called for a significant relion over 5 years and 104 5 billion over 10 duction in the rate of taxation of estates and years but that is far from the whole story be a 50 percent increase in the small business cause of the way the bill is phased in its true exclusion the rangel proposal was a cost is cleverly hidden and does not show up thoughtful and reasonable effort to deal with until after the 10year budget window the legitimate concerns of small businesses that means the full effects of the repub and family farms but it did not have the problican bill will come just at the time when we lems of the legislation which was being urged will have to face budget pressures because by the republican majority my own baby boom generation is starting to when the rangel substitute was defeated retire and if we feel we need to phase in by the house i nevertheless voted for the h r 8 because we cannot afford the full re adoption of h r 8 in order to continue the legpeal now how are we ever going to afford it islative process initial senate action was 10 years from now much closer to the rangel substitute and i we do not need to engage in this fiscal expected a housesenate conference comoverkill mittee to produce a bill that i could support according to the treasury department unfortunately the senate simunder current law only 2 of all decedents ply accepted the flawed version of the bill as have enough wealth to be subject to the es adopted by the house and did not make those tate tax at all changes that would improve the legislation to be more specific the treasury depart president clinton was right to veto this bill ment tells me that in 1997 estatetax returns and i will vote to sustain that veto were filed for only 297 coloradans i urge my colleagues in the furthermore according to the treasury de republican leadership of this house to work partment of those estates that are affected by with the democratic leadership and with the the estate tax only 30 that is only 6 in president to craft legislation that deals with the 10 000 american estateswere comprised legitimate problems of estate taxation and that primarily of familyowned small businesses provides the relief small businesses need we ranches or farms need to deal with legitimate problems with the looking just at our state that means that in federal estate tax but this bill is clearly the 1997 fewer than a dozen estatetax returns wrong way to do that"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "i rise in opposition to h r 2488 i believe that this legislation will lead us back to another era of budget deficits this bill is irresponsible because it relies upon uncertain projections it is irresponsible because it relies upon unrealistic assumptions it is irresponsible because it would cut taxes dramatically before congress has taken the necessary steps to address the longterm solvency of social security and medicarenot to mention the other challenges facing this country challenges like providing education for our children prescription drug benefits for our seniors and affordable health insurance for all americans and it is irresponsible because it targets its tax relief to the wealthiest households in the country the ones who have benefited most from the economic growth of the last 20 yearsrather than to the hardworking families who have borne the burden of modernizing and streamlining our economy over the last two decades this bill would be paid for with a trilliondollar surplus that doesnt yet exist at this point it is just a budget projection anyone who has watched the federal government struggle to gets its deficits under control over the last 18 years knows that budget projections are notoriously inaccurate and that slight changes in some of the assumptions can change the results significantly the trillion dollarsurplus we are expecting might never materialize if the economy suffers some kind of setback furthermore an 800 billion dollar tax cut might even be the cause of such a setback a tax cut now when unemployment and inflation are both at record lows could overheat the economy bring back inflation and trigger economic stagnation or even recession afternatively it is conceivable that a huge tax cut could conceivably end the current period of economic growth simply by destroying public confidence in the federal governments willingness to exercise fiscal restraint in addition the trillion dollar surplus is based on the assumption that discretionary spending will stay below the existing budget caps until 2002 and then rise only with inflation there is no trillion dollar surplus if discretionary spending is raised above the levels set by the current caps but many of our colleagues both republicans and democrats have indicated that they believe that the current discretionary spending caps are unacceptably low and should be raised enough to allow adequate levels of spending on federal activities like law enforcement medical research and education i share their concerns and i firmly believe that discretionary spending should be increased to address such pressing domestic needs moreover in considering the tax bill before us today it is important to remember that even if the economic assumptions are correct and congress chooses to limit discretionary spending sharply in order to pay for these tax cuts the projected onbudget surpluses are only expected to last for 15 years after 2015 social security medicare and medicaid costs are expected to produce massive budget deficits as the baby boom generation retiresdeficts in the hundreds of billions of dollars each year we cannot responsibly make large tax cuts today without first preparing for the massive financial challenge that awaits us in a few years such fiscal irresponsibility reflects a dramatic aboutface from the progress we have made on the budget in recent years i strongly believe that we must pursue fiscal policies that are conservative and cautious that means that tax cuts should wait until after weve fixed social security and medicareand until the federal government has actually produced the surpluses necessary to pay for them in addition i believe that tax cuts should be balanced against other pressing national needs4ike lifting children out of poverty making prescription drugs affordable for our seniors providing highquality education to our children and guaranteeing affordable health insurance to all americans and if we are going to cut taxes i believe that we should cut the taxes of the workingand middleclass households who need and deserve tax relief the most instead of cutting taxes disproportionately for the wealthy as h r 2488 does that is why i support the democratic alternative tax cut proposal which provides significant but not profligate tax relief conditions that tax relief upon action to make social security and medicare solvent and targets its tax relief to hardworking middleclass american families who are struggling to make ends meet rather than those fortunate few who already have it pretty good like the bill introduced by chairman archer the democratic alternative raises the standard deduction for married couples filing jointly to eliminate the marriage penalty for many middieclass familiesbut it also reduces the marriage penalty on many workingclass couples by fixing the earned income tax credit the democratic alternative also increases the size of the existing family credit by 250 for each child less than 5 years old and it uses tax credits to leverage private investment in poor communities in improving the environment and in school construction and modernization the democratic bill provides tax relief to small and familyowned businesses by increasing the existing section 179 expending provision and by accelerating the expansion of the estate tax exclusion and the democratic tax cut simplifies multiemployer pension programs that cover millions of working amdricans the republican tax plan by contrast disproportionately benefits the wealthiest americans it would phase out the estate tax which currently only affects the richest 2 percent it would lower taxes on capital gains income most of which goes to the most affluent americans and even the centerpiece of the republican tax cut the 10 percent across the board rate reduction would disproportionately benefit the rich the most important difference between the democratic republication bills however is the fact that the tax cuts in the democratic alternative are contingent upon action on social security and medicare the majority of the tax cuts in the bill would not take effect until after the solvency of the social security and medicare programs is ensured the tax cuts that would be enacted immediatelythe sections of the bill making certain existing tax provisions permanent would be offset with the revenueraising provisions identified in chairman archers bill i believe that the more modest size and the contingency provisions of the democratic alternative tax cut bill make it a much more responsible tax relief bill than h r 2488 finally the democratic tax cut alternative targets tax relief to the workingand middleclass families who are struggling to make ends meet those are the people who deserve tax relief the most the democratic bill unlike the republican bill would eliminate the marriage penalty for lowincome families the democratic alternative unlike the republican bill would provide targeted assistance to working families for education health care longterm care and child care and the democratic bill would provide estate tax relief to family farms and small businesses without like the republican bill exempting the superrich from all estate taxes in short while the democratic tax cut alternative would not cut taxes as much as the republican bill it would cut taxes for many working families more than would the republican bill consequently on the grounds of fiscal restraint responsibility and fairness i urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting this unwise legislation and supporting the democratic alternative"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "i rise today to express some concerns about environmental conditions on guam as a result of problems with pcbs and as a result of some recently discovered mustard gas vials left over from the military i am very concerned about the safety of my constituents in light of these recent discoveries of chemical weapons testing kits containing measurable amounts of mustard gas and other toxic chemicals on guam given the public health dangers associated with exposure to these substances i have requested the department of defense to perform a historical record survey to determine the final disposition of chemical weaponry that was brought to guam this survey should be comprehensive and include identifying former military dump sites as well as other potential disposal sites used by the military guam has been a significant area for unitedstates military activity for more than 50 years first used as a major staging area during world war ii the military presence in guam increased correspondingly with the korean and vietnam wars its full value as an area to forward deploy american military forces continues to be strong even in todays postcold war era at the time guam was home to a fully operational naval base naval air station naval communications submarine base air force strategic air command and naval weapons depot and today still has the largest weapons storage area in the entire pacific but over these many years it has become clear that it was military activities during world war ii that posed the greatest threat to the people of guam during world war ii guam was used as a staging area for the invasion of the philippines iwo jima okinawa and eventually as contemplated the invasion of the japanese homeland over time several instances of mustard gas have been discovered and a few months ago officials from the university of guam presented documents to military officials that a huge shipment of mustard gas was brought to guam in 1945 but there has been no documentation of these weapons leaving the island in a september 5 2000 pacific daily news article a spokesman for the army corps of engineers surmised that the shipment had been likely dumped at sea it is illogical because the shipment was brought to guam how could it be taken off and dumped at sea he went on to say that lacking evidence of a definitive area that should be searched the army corps could not conduct a comprehensive search otherwise it is almost like a needle in a haystack however just last week additional chemical weapon cannisters were found with a pile of unexploded ordnance at anderson air force base and these cannisters resemble the testing kits that had been earlier found in the central part of guam in mongmong an area that used to be a military base with these two discoveries of toxic chemicals in less than 2 years i believe that we have in fact found just the beginning of countless needles in the haystack i would have hoped that the first discovery of mustard gas would have spurred the department of defense to engage in this exhaustive survey historical survey of what chemical weapons and what general ordnance was stored on guam left over from world war ii in addition this is combined with another issue concerning the environmental condition of guam and that is the inability to take pcbs out of guam guam and other territories are outside the customs zone and as laws regarding the disposal of pcbs pcbs can be brought to guam from the unitedstates mainland but they cannot be brought back into the unitedstates mainland for proper disposal i remain in strong conversation with epa officials and have received a strong commitment to resolve this problem administratively in the upcoming months however in a neighboring island to the north saipan there were recently discovered pcb materials but the epa has already issued an administrative order releasing those pcb items to be moved back into the unitedstates mainland i think it is a situation that cries out for solution and fair and balanced treatment for all the territories it is important to understand that the toxic substances control act prohibits guam from importing pcbs inside the unitedstates customs zone even though the pcbs originated inside the unitedstates customs zone the unitedstates court of appeals ninth circuits 1997 ruling of sierra club v epa overturned an attempt by epa to solve this problem administratively which would have dealt with pcbs in a more rational manner parenthetically pcbs that are on military bases are easily moved back into the unitedstates this disparate treatment between military bases and the civilian community of guam composed of unitedstates citizens just like everywhere else is simply intolerable and must be resolved by epa in general we have a very difficult situation with pcbs and their disposal in guam we have this issue with chemical toxic weapons i certainly call upon the army corps of engineers and the department of defense to conduct an exhaustive search we first called for this exhaustive search in july of 1999 we continue to press the issue and certainly i hope that the department of defense will see fit to finally review all of the weapons which have been brought into guam and through which two or three generations of people from guam have been raised in the shadow of these weapons"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "i sit on the committee on the judiciary i would like to respond to the issue of the latino immigration fairness act and the authorizing committee we made every effort to respond to this issue in the authorizing committee but we were denied by the republican majority i would like to support this legislation it is an important piece of legislation but i think it is important to reunite families the same as we did for eastern european families a few years ago this legislation now is the only vehicle to be able to answer the concerns of haitians hondurans and guatemalans and others who were left out we need parity in addition this is the only vehicle that we can support the hate crimes legislation that has been denied to many states in this country i think james byrd jr s heinous murderous deceased condition obviously warrants us passing both the hate crimes legislation and as well this legislation with the immigration fairness act included i ask for my colleagues to vote against this legislation i rise to express my outrage that this house has brought forth the important commercejusticestate conference report to be voted on yet the republican leadership has not felt the need or importance to include language to address the dreadful acts of hate crimes this move by the republican leadership is a slap in the face to the many people here in the united states who have historically been subjected to hateful acts resulting in death bodily harm as well as mental and physical anguish only due to a persons race ethnicity gender age or sexual orientation how can we as elected representatives for the american people ignore our duty to ensure that all people are treated equally how can we ignore our moral oath to protect people from hateful acts that arise because of a person race ethnicity gender age or sexual orientation how can we allow hateful skeletons of this countrys past to be revived and allowed to infect our society today this chambers silence on the need for hate crimes legislation would do just that and the absence of hate crimes language in the cjs conference report sends the message that this countrys stance on crimes of hate is not a top priority this issue is very dear to me and i am ashamed that after two years from the date of james bryd juniors vicious murder on a paved road in my home state of texas that a bipartisan hate crimes prevention act has not become law time and time again i have come to the floor and asked the republican leadership to support meaningful hate crimes legislation i have introduced my own hate crimes legislation and have supported legislation and resolutions introduced by my colleagues in both the house and the senate yet i find myself coming before the american people once again to compel the republican leadership to include hate crimes language in the cjs conference report in order to increase penalties on perpetrators of hate crimes before the 106th congress comes to a close the same tactics that have been used in the texas state legislature to run out the time in the legislative session to defeat the passage of hate crimes legislation have been used here in the united states congress as well when the james byrd jr hate crimes act was introduced in my home state of texas in january 1999 it was hastily defeated in the state senate and when state democrats attempted to negotiate with republicans in the state senate and the governors administration to get a bipartisan hate crimes bill passed political games were played to extend the process until the end of the state legislative session as i have stated this political ploy was not only used in my home state of texas but it has been used here in both chambers of the united states congress as well we have attempted to negotiate with members of the republican party to get hate crimes legislation passed within the 106th congress however political games and wizardry have been used to delay the process until the congressional session comes to an end i therefore call on the republican leadership with the american people as my witnesses to once again ask for the passage of hate crimes legislation to address senseless killings and crimes of hate and to make a statement that the united states will no longer tolerate these acts since james byrd juniors death our nation has experienced an alarming increase in hate violence directed at men women and even children of all races creeds and colors ronald taylor traveled to the eastside of pittsburgh in what has been characterized as an act of hate violence to kill three and wound two in a fast food restaurant eight weeks later in pittsburgh richard baumhammers armed with a 357caliber pistol traveled 20 miles across the west side of pittsburgh where he killed five people his shooting victims included a jewish women an indian vietnamese chinese and several black men the decade of the 1990s saw an unprecedented rise in the number of hate groups preaching violence and intolerance with more than 50 000 hate crimes reported during the years 1991 through 1997 the summer of 1999 was dubbed the summer of hate as each month brought forth another appalling incident commencing with a threeday shooting spree aimed at minorities in the midwest and culminating with an attack on mere children in california from 1995 through 1999 there has been 206 different arson or bomb attacks on churches and synagogues throughout the united statesan average of one house of worship attacked every week like the rest of the nation some in congress have been tempted to dismiss these atrocities as the anomalous acts of lunatics but news accounts of this homicidal fringe are merely the tip of the iceberg the beliefs they act on are held by a far larger though less visible segment of our society these atrocities illustrate the need for continued vigilance and the passage of the hate crimes prevention act it is long past the time for congress to pass a comprehensive law banning such atrocities it is a federal crime to hijack an automobile or to possess cocaine and it ought to be a federal crime to drag a man to death becauseof his race or to hang a person because of his or her sexual orientation these are crimes that shock and shame our national conscience and they should be subject to federal law enforcement assistance and prosecution therefore i would urge my fellow members of the united states congress and the american people to be counted among those who will stand for justice in this country for all americans and nothing else we must address the problem of hate crimes before the 106th congress convenes its legislative business"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "i will vote for this bill but only very reluctantly my reluctance does not mean i dont support estatetax relief for familyowned ranches and farms or other small businesses in fact i definitely think we

keep ranch lands in open undeveloped condition by reducing the pressure to sell them to pay estate taxes but we do not need to do all that this republican bill would do in order to make sure the

contrast it is precisely the fiscal overkill of the republican bill that makes me most reluctant to vote for it once fully phased in the republican bill would forgo nearly 50 billion a year in revenue with no guarantee that this revenue loss will not harm social security and medicare in future years the bills sponsors say it will cost 28 2 billion over 5 years and 104 5 billion over 10 years but that is far from the whole story because of the way the bill is phased in its true cost is cleverly hidden and does not show up until after the 10year budget window that means the full effects of the republican bill will come just at the time when we will have to face budget pressures because my own baby boom generation is starting to retire and if we feel we need to phase in h r 8 because we cannot afford the full repeal now how are we ever going to afford it 10 years from now we do not need to engage in this fiscal overkill according to the treasury department under current law only 2 of all decedents have enough wealth to be subject to the estate tax at all to be more specific the treasury department tells me that in 1997 estatetax returns were filed for only 297 coloradans furthermore according to the treasury department of those estates that are affected by the estate tax only 30 that is only 6 in 10 000 american estateswere comprised primarily of familyowned small businesses ranches or farms looking just at our state that means that in 1997 fewer than a dozen estatetax returns were comprised primarily of small businesses ranches or farms of course those numbers only relate to the cases in which an estate tax was actually paid clearly in many other cases families have taken actions to forestall the estate tax i understand that and do think that in appropriate cases we should lessen the pressure that prompted some of those actions as i said the democratic alternative would have provided real effective and immediate estatetax relief to the owners of small businesses including farms and ranches and would have done so in a fiscally responsible way that is why i voted for it in contrast the biggest beneficiaries of the republican legislation are not those middleclass families who own small ranches or farms or other small businesses but instead are very wealthy families with very large assets over the past two decades income and wealth disparities have increased the republican bill while it does have some positive aspects would increase those wealth disparities i find this troubling and it adds to my reluctance to support the bill however i will vote for the bill because the republican leadership has made it clear that it is this bill or no estatetax relief bill at least for now here in the house that being the case i have decided that the republican billalthough very flawed and excessive is just acceptable enough for me to vote for today i do so in the hope and expectation that the bills faults can be corrected as it proceeds through the legislative process and that ultimately it can be refined into a bill that deserves to be enacted into law if that does not occur if that hope and expectation prove unfoundedi will not vote for a bill that fails to meet that standard"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "i wish i could give my appreciation to those who brought this bill to the floor of the house but clearly this is a true example of compassionate conservatism when so many of us are left out of the circle of inclusion in this legislation first let me say what a poor example of procedural prowess to attach to the district of columbia bill disparate legislation that has nothing to do with the fine people of washington d c attaching this bill dealing with commerce and state and justice then might i say that after all the begging as the ranking member of the subcommittee on immigration and claims working with so many of the leaders of this democratic caucus of the hispanic caucus of senator reid and not having the latino fairness act that deals with restoring the rights to those who deserve to be counted in this country taxpayers families to be reunited individuals who are strong and who demand and should receive the right to access legalization our friends and our neighbors and then this country under this republican leadership refused to stand up and acknowledge that most americans support hate crimes legislation it is not divisive it is inclusive it is to say that all of us are under the same umbrella and that in fact we are against the attack on the jewish day care center in california or the citizens going to church in illinois who were shot by a hateful person who believed that we should divide and not overcome division i would ask that we send this bill back and do the right thing for our good friends of this nation and restore their rights as immigrants to make them citizens i am very disappointed in what the republican leadership brought to floor in the form and guise of the commerce justice state appropriations as ranking member of the subcommittee on immigration and claims i am mostly concerned about the latino immigration fairness act lifa the phrase compassionate conservatism has very hollow meaning if you just talk the talk and not walk the walk this lifa proposal is the modem day civil rights issue of our time and just 12 days to election day the republicans are thumbing their noses at immigrants who have contributed to our society and are trying to play by the rules i say no deal to this proposal and i urged a no vote this involves amnesty for immigrants who have paid their dues and have been in this country since 1986 parity for liberians guatemalans haitians and hondurans and restoring section 245 i which allows immigrants to adjust their illegal status pay a fee and remain in this country with their spouses and children these are reasonable proposals and the republican leadership has a blind eye for faimessfor justiceand for equity the republican proposal to provide relief to only 400 000 immigrants who were unable to take advantage of the 1986 law for those entering the country before 1982 is unacceptable it is unacceptable because it leaves and locks to many people out this is a proposal that is thinly veiled as an open door but it really is a feeble attempt to play up to the hispanic vote during the political season the republican legislation is a piecemeal correction of the flawed implementation of the 1986 legalization program basically those individuals who sought the counsel of a specific lawyer and filed suit with him are protected while countless others are left out of those people who are covered in the flawed proposal less than 40 percent are expected to prevail if the gop acknowledges that the 1986 law was not implemented correctly they should try to right the wrong entirely not pick some winners and losers based on what law firm they signed up to represent them also it is important to understand that this amnesty program in fact is just a long overdue update in the registry provision of the immigration and nationality act the registry provision gives immigrants who have been here without proper documents an opportunity to adjust to permanent status if they have been here for a long enough time and have nothing in their background that would disqualify them from immigrant status the legislation would just update the cutoff date for registry which is now set at 1972 then there is juan gonzalez who has been working for a construction company in houston texas for more than 13 years recently he lost his job because he was not able to present his employer a renewed employment authorization since then his family is living a nightmare juan and his wife luisa are having problems and close to a divorce they lost their home and rented a 2bedroom apartment unfortunately their children are paying the consequences we also need to remain every vigilant on nacara parity this would address an injustice in the provisions of the nicaraguan adjustment and central american relief act of 1997 nacara nacara currently provides qualified cubans and nicaraguans an opportunity to become lawful permanent residents of the united states the proposed legislation would extend the same benefits to eligible nationals of guatemala el salvador honduras and haiti the bill that the republicans have brought to the floor has completely left nacara parity out i say no deal and a no vote like nicaraguans and cubans many salvadorans guatemalans hondurans and haitians fled human rights abuses or unstable political and economic conditions in the 1980s and 1990s the united states has a strong foreign policy interest in providing the same treatment to these similarly situated people in addition returning migrants to these countries would place significant demands on their fragile economic and political systems like senator jack reed i have worked very hard to ensure that the 10 000 liberian nationals who have been living in the united states since the mid1980s and have significantly contributed to the american economy are not deported this legislation should also include these liberian nationals if the latino immigrant fairness act is not enacted hundreds of thousands of people will be forced to abandon their homes will have to separate from their families move out of their communities be removed from their jobs and return to countries where they no longer have ties the inclusion of the latino immigrant fairness provisions would evidence our commitment to fair and evenhanded treatment of nationals from these countries and to the strengthening of democracy and economic stability among important neighbors the republican proposal creates a v visa for people waiting in the family backlogs but not all including unitedstates citizens this counterproposal treats the family members of some legal permanent residents better than unitedstates citizens the gop proposal leaves out unitedstates citizens applying for their children over the age of 21 ironically the gop fails to help even united states citizens seeking to reunite with their spouses and children if the spouse or the child fell out of status for six months or more in contrast the latino immigrant fairness act 245 i proposal would cover all people in the pipeline to becoming legal equally i say no deal and a no vote the republicans are failing to correct their flawed legislation of 1997 and 1998 it was the republicans who passed piecemeal programs in 1997 and 1998 for some refugees these flaws failed to correct years of uneven treatment to legitimate refugees from central america haiti and does nothing for liberian nationals it is baffling why today the republicans are now turning their backs on the lifa proposal for long time refugees that have been in the united states for years worked hard and paid their taxes when a few short years ago they advanced these same proposals there is no compassion here congress should stop trying to trade some deserving immigrant groups for others and move to help all deserving immigrants willing to play by the rules pay taxes and work hard in the united states i am also outraged that this house has brought forth the important commercejusticestate conference report to be voted on yet the republican leadership has not felt the need or impoitance to include language to address the dreadful acts of hate crimes this move by the republican leadership is a slap in the face to the many people here in the united states who have historically been subjected to hateful acts resulting in death bodily harm as well as mental and physical anguish only due to a persons race ethnicity gender age or sexual orientation how can we as elected representatives for the american people ignore our duty to ensure that all people are treated equally how can we ignore our moral oath to protect people from hateful acts that arise because of a persons race ethnicity gender age or sexual orientation how can we allow hateful skeleions of this countrys past to be revived and allowed to infect our society today this chambers silence on the need forhate crimes legislation would do just that and the absence of hate crimes language in the cjs conference report sends the message that this countrys stance on crimes of hate is not a top priority this issue is very dear to me and i am ashamed that after two years from the date of james byrd juniors vicious murder on a iaved road in my home state of texas that a bipartisan hate crimes prevention act has not become law time and time again i have come to the floor and asked the republican leadership to support meaningful hate crimes legislation i have introduced my own hate crimes legislation and have supported legislation and resolutions introduced by my colleagues in both the house and the senate yet i find myself coming before the american people once again to compel the republican leadership to include hate crimes language in the cjs conference report in order to increase penalties on perpetrators of hate crimes before the 106th congress comes to a close the same tactics that have been used in the texas state legislature to run out the time in the legislative session to defeat the passage of hate crimes legislation have been used here in the united states congress as well when the james byrd jr hate crimes act was introduced in my home state of texas in january of 1999 it was hastily defeated in the state senate and when state democrats attempted to negotiate with republicans in the state senate and the governors administration to get a bipartisan hate crimes bill passed political games were played to extend the process until the end of the state legislative session as i have stated this political ploy was not only used in my home state of texas but it has been used here in both chambers of the united states congress as well we have attempted to negotiate with members of the republican party to get hate crimes legislation passed within the 106th congress however political games and wizardry have been used to delay the process until the congressional session comes to an end i therefore call on the republican leadership with the american people as my witnesses to once again ask for the passage of hate crimes legislation to address senseless killings and crimes of hate and to make a statement that the united states will no longer tolerate these acts since james byrd juniors death our nation has experienced an alarming increase in hate violence directed at men women and even children of all races creeds and colors ronald taylor traveled to the eastside of pittsburgh in what has been characterized as an act of hate violence to kill three and wound two in a fast food restaurant eight weeks later in pittsburgh richard baumhammers armed with a 357caliber pistol traveled 20 miles across the west side of pittsburgh where he killed five people his shooting victims included a jewish woman an indian vietnamese chinese and several black men the decade of the 1990s saw an unprecedented rise in the number of hate groups preaching violence and intolerance with more than 50 000 hate crimes reported during the years 1991 through 1997 the summer of 1999 was dubbed the summer of hate as each month brought forth another appalling incident commencing with a threeday shooting spree aimed at minorities in the midwest and culminating with an attack on mere children in california from 1995 through 1999 there has been 206 different arson or bomb attacks on churches and synagogues throughout the united statesan average of one house of worship attacked every week like the rest of the nation some in congress have been tempted to dismiss these atrocities as the anomalous acts of lunatics but news accounts of this homicidal fringe are merely the tip of the iceberg the beliefs they act on are held by a far larger though less visible segment of our society these atrocities illustrate the need for continued vigilance and the passage of the hate crimes prevention act it is long past the time for congress to pass a comprehensive law banning such atrocities it is a federal crime to hijack an automobile or to possess cocaine and it ought to be a federal crime to drag a man to death because of his race or to hang a person because of his or her sexual orientation these are crimes that shock and shame our national conscience and they should be subject to federal law enforcement assistance and prosecution therefore i would urge my fellow members of the united states house congress and the american people to be counted among those who will stand for justice in this country for all americans and nothing else we must address the problem of hate crimes before the 106th congress convenes its legislation i say no deal and no vote to this conference report until these issues are addressed"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i support passage of bankruptcy reform and so in order for it to pass before the adjournment of the 106th congress i will vote for this rule and for the conference report but the reason the republican leadership has been forced to resort to this kind of parliamentary game is because the republican majority in this congress has left unfinished the agenda that matters most to the people of this country it is october 12 and there is not an end in sight to this congress and there is little hope left that the real american agenda will be finished thus in order to pass legislation which has overwhelming bipartisan support the republican leadership has resorted to using tricks and games rather than regular order were thij situation not so sad it would be laughable for 2 years democrats in this body have asked the republican leadership for the opportunity to address the issues that matter most to americans real medicare prescription drug coverage real help for americas schools a real and meaningful patients bill of rights an increase in the minimum wage campaign finance reform saving social security and medicare paying down the national debt these are real issues that matter to real people but in those 2 years what have my republican colleagues done they have brought forward legislation that does everything but what the american people want when the republican leaderships position has been soundly defeated on a bipartisan basis they have simply shelved the wishes of the bipartisan majority in this house for example in august of 1999 the house passed a real patients bill of rights a bipartisan patients bill of rights passed it by a vote of 275 to 151 it took the speaker until november 3 of 1999 to appoint conferees when he did he failed to appoint a single republican conferee who supported the bill that passed the house not a single one today that conference has still not reported back to either the house or senate the patients bill of rights sits on a shelf in september of last year the house passed a bipartisan campaign finance reform bill by a bipartisan vote of 252 to 177 that bill has also disappeared into the legislative dustbin of the 106th congress the democrats in this body as well as in the senate have repeatedly asked for further consideration of that legislation but our requests have gone unanswered yet another meaningful bill sits on the shelf in the republican leaderships closet we asked that the house consider legislation that would give seniors a real medicare prescription drug benefit but we were prevented from getting a vote on the democratic version of the bill we have asked that the congress consider legislation which would provide more welltrained teachers for schools across the country in order to reduce class size we have been ignored we have asked for a clean vote on increasing the minimum wage and our republican colleagues loaded up the bill with tax cuts that would benefit the wealthiest while begrudgingly offering a 1 an hour over 2 years wage increase for americans who are at the very low end of the income scale we have asked repeatedly for this congress to consider issues that really matter to real americans the people who pay mortgages who pay rent who make car payments who send their children to school that they want to be safe but we have been ignored so we find ourselves in this situation today while the house has rules which regulate how and when legislation and amendments can come to the floor the other body does not as a consequence the refusal of the congressional republican leadership to consider real legislation that would mean something to real americans the refusal of the congressional republican leadership to sit down and work on a bipartisan basis with the democrats in the house and senate and with the president of the united states has resulted in the need to play these kinds of legislative games we are engaged in today i have long supported reform of our bankruptcy laws i support this conference report it will allow americans who need a fresh financial start to get one but it will also prevent those who have indebted themselves and who are able to pay those debts from just walking away from their obligations this bill affords new protections for consumers by requiring that credit statements include more detailed disclosures it protects the homes of individuals who live in states with homestead exemptions but not those who move there simply to claim the exemption in a bankruptcy it gives permanent chapter 12 relief to farmers many members are concerned about the process quite frankly i share their views it is not proper that the house should be considering this important legislative reform within a shell of a bill that has already been passed and signed into law but given the hour given the inability of therepublican leadership to manage the business of this house and the congress any better than it has in the past 6 years i will reluctantly vote for this rule so we may at least pass some meaningful legislation before the end of this congress i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "today we consider a very important education bill it is important because the republican majority made it important it is important because it is all that we have in a year when we expect to be reauthorizing the elementary and secondary education assistance act we have been denied that opportunity but pieces of the elementary and secondary education assistance act have been put forward the edflex act is a piece of it and now this piece on teacher empowerment act h r 1995 which was considered today the consideration of this bill today which was kind of rushed to the floor and it was hoped that they would get enough votes to send a message to the white house that it cannot be successfully vetoed but of course they failed in that effort the president has promised to veto this bill because at the heart of the bill is an attempt to derail the presidents initiative on more teachers for the classroom especially in grades 1 through 3 where there is a need for smaller class sizes we did get a bill approved an appropriation approved last year which would permit the beginning of the process of hiring more teachers for the classroom virtually 100 000 teachers would be hired under this legislation and 30 000 the process has started as of this month so in order to derail that for some reason the republican majority is against smaller class sizes and they want to take away that priority take away the targeting and they came up with this teacher empowerment act which is not a bad idea the thrust of the bill is to provide a special initiative for the training and professional development of teachers to improve the quality of teachers by itself that is a lofty goal and who could not subscribe to having better prepared teachers in our classroom we want quality teachers but for some reason to get quality teachers the republican majority chose to sacrifice the more teachers for the classroom the act that is designed to lower the class sizes in the first three grades has to be sacrificed put on the chopping block in order to take care of meeting teachers professional development needs and training needs i think that for the republican majority it was more important to derail the initiative to have smaller class sizes than it is really to train teachers the training of the teachers and the opportunities for professional development is secondary for them they are pursuing an agenda and this bill was a part of that agenda to reach a point where all of the influence and direction from the federal government is wiped from the education sphere they want to abolish the education role of the federal government and this of course takes them one step closer if they can take the presidents initiative on class sizes and get rid of that it is one more step toward reducing the federal governments role in education so that bill was on the floor today the republican majority had the greatest number of votes because they are the majority they passed the bill but the number of defections by democrats was not as great as they expected and the presidents threat to veto the bill certainly can hold the bill can be vetoed until something more reasonable is done about the class size initiative of the president there were a lot of good things in the teacher empowerment act by the way it is called teacher empowerment act but all the teacher organizations the n~tional education association the american federation of teachers the grade schools group all of the various education groups opposed it because they saw it as a sabotage operation designed to wipe out the reduction of the classroom size initiative now that bill was on the floor today tomorrow the major bill on the floor will be the tax cut bill and i want to talk about the importance of dealing with the education initiative the education investments should come before big spending tax cuts education investments should dome before big spending tax cuts and it is very important to note that during the whole discussion of the socalled teacher empowerment act today the one thing that the republican majority refused to allow any discussion of was additional funding no new money is involved in their initiative they want to take the money that has already been appropriated for the class size reduction and the money that already exists in various other teacher training and professional development programs and use that in a different way mainly throw it out there to the states let the governors decide how they want to spend that money on education that is the thrust of what the republicans want to do it takes us one step closer to their longterm objective and that is to block grant all funds available for education to the states by block grant i mean take away the federal guidelines take away the federal priorities take away the longterm federal commitment to the poorest districts and the poorest schools out there the federal thrust in education since 1965 since the first elementary and secondary education assistance act in the era of lyndon johnson has been to focus on those areas of greatest need to target the federal money to help with the problem that the states were not able to deal with and chose not to deal with and that is provide a decent education for the poorest students in the poorest schools in the poorest districts so that initiative by the federal government is targeted by the republicans they want to take it away their longterm goal is to wipe out the federal government involvement in education in 1995 my colleagues will recall the newt gingrich program went head on in a direct attack on the department of education they called for the abolishment of the department of education they pursued that for a while it turned out that the american people did not think that was a good idea the voters did not think it was a good idea they retreated and now we have no more talk about abolishing the department of education what we have is instead of the direct assault we have a great deal of warfare going on where they slfip away at the powers they attack at small beachheads that they establish and they find every way to cut into the power of the department of education and into the federal role in education the federal role in education of course is already limited they make it appear that the federal government is responsible for all that is wrong in education it is a very limited role already less than 8 percent of the education funding in this country that is including higher education funding less than 8 percent of that is provided for by the federal government at this point but that is what we had on the floor today another assault on that small role that lessthan8percent role fiscally if one got 8 percent of the funds involved across the country then i think that the influence of the federal government is probably no more also than about 8 percent control is vested in states and local education agencies for education already but that is targeted first they wanted to get rid of it all together now they want to block grant it and turn it over to the governments that is what was on the floor today no item which talked about additional funding was received in an amicable spirit by the republican majority in fact the only amendment that called for fresh funds new money new initiative with new money was the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from hawaii the gentlewoman wanted to offer grants some help for sabbaticals for teachers if one is talking about training then in order to hold certain people into the career path in order to make certain that they have an opportunity for growth somewhere they ought to encourage and help to finance the sabbaticals which already are offered in many local education systems it is an area that was not new but the gentlewoman from hawaii wanted to give more help and called for more money for that that of course was voted down by a large margin and condemned by the chairman and the republican majority no new money is the credo of the leadership of the committee on education and the workforce the republican majority insists that we never discuss authorizing new funding but tomorrow we will be discussing on the floor an expenditure of 864 billion over a 10year period for tax cuts we cannot talk about money when we are talking about education no new money the government is broke we cannot make investments in education but we can have big spending tax cuts that is obvious it is a huge monstrous piece of big spending 864 billion and there is no room anywhere for an investment in education i think my colleagues have heard the previous speaker tonight and they heard the previous set of speakers from the democratic side talk about this tax cut while i am not prepared and do not intend to go into it with great deal i associate myself with most of the remarks made by the gentleman from maryland and his associates their plea was that we not go forward with this monstrous 864 billion tax cut that we look at other kinds of things that ought to be considered at the same time we cannot separate in my opinion the discussion of the tax cut however from the discussion of education they did not do it neither the democrats nor the republicans that talked tonight really placed education on the table for discussion within the parameters of the conventional wisdom here in washington and that sometimes includes the white house when we talk about large amounts of money they do not want to talk about education it is a direct insult to the voters we have poll after poll which shows that education ranks as one of the number one priorities over the last 5 years and recently moved to the very top before social security before defense spending before all of the other priorities which are usually considered education ranked as number one why are the voters being ignored i do not know they can ask their congressman why is it that when my colleagues discuss education they insist that they cannot discuss new money additional resources why is it that theamerican public repeatedly says we would like to see more federal assistance for education but they are only answered with rhetoric about new kinds of changes in the reform programs but none of those new changes have any resources behind them with the acknowledgment of the existence of a huge budget surplus and i do not want to get into an argument about how much the surplus is or what it is going to be over the next 10 years i just know that it is foolish for us laymen who are not involved directly in the calculation process to sit still and watch our leaders talk about huge sums of money that they are going to negotiate on and we question whether it really exists i have some friends who went to a meeting today to hear someone lecture about the fact that there really is no budget surplus and we should stop discussing it i heard that in 1996 when we were on the eve of an election and we had gone through 2 years of the republican majority insisting not only that there was no money for an increase in funding for education but that education should be cut and we had proposals in 1995 that education be cut by almost 4 billion but in 1996 something miraculous happened both parties agreed in the negotiations at the white house that there was additional money available somewhere and instead of cutting education by 4 billion because we were approaching an election where the polls showed that the public wanted more federal assistance for education and the party that stood in the way might suffer and might lose seats suddenly there was agreement the republican majority agreed to an increase in education funding of 4 billion instead of a 4 billion cut we got a 4 billion increase they found the money somewhere now i remember the argument at the time was that we would get the money from sales of the spectrum the spectrum auctioning the auctioning of the spectrum was going to create that money it was not in hand but since both parties of the negotiation agreed it suddenly became a reality the 4 billion that was appropriated it has been spent since 1996 they have been spending the money so i assume that whatever assumptions they made they lived up to those assumptions one way or the other i have not checked to see if we have auctioned off enough of the spectrum to add up to 4 billion but when it came time to make the decision the reality was what the two parties agreed upon if both the white house and the republican majority leaders are saying now that we have a huge surplus that could accommodate over the next 10 years an 864 billion republican tax cut and the president has said well he will entertain some kind of tax cut not that much i assume the surplus is real and the tax cut possibilities are real and they are going to go forward it would be ridiculous for us to sit out the process and not get involved education ought to be put on the table so that it becomes a part of the discussion the doors of opportunity are open for education to be discussed in terms of new resources and new appropriations if the blind men who arein charge here insist that they do not see that as a possibility some of us who are not in charge must sound the alarm we must tell the american people do not sit stilland accept a big spending tax cut while there isno new investment ineducation i hope that my party will rally behind me soon and that they will see the folly of allowing a huge amount of surplus over the next 10 years to get committed to something and it is going to happen there are going to be some commitments of that surplus over the next 10 years we sit still and we let education be left out at this point the forecast for edu cation being included is quite dismal we have a bill which has been set forth by the administration for the reauthor ization of the elementary and secondary education assistance act in their reauthorization proposals they do not propose any great increases in the funding for the ongoing programs in fact there is sort of an understanding that we are going to live within certain budget guidelines there are ceilings that have been set the budget caps as they call them will not be taken off that may all be true in conventional wisdom but if the surplus exists it is folly to assume that they will not in the final analysis be negotiations of some part of the surplus being committed to programs certainly it would be folly to sit still and not commit any part of the surplus to programs and let it all be used for big spending tax cuts the forecast for education right now may be dismal but if we put on our thinking caps if we sound the alarm for the general public the people who in poll after poll show that they think education is important if we let common sense enter into this matter then we can go forward beyond the republican plot to have edflex and teacher empowerment and other kinds of block granting drain off the funds and we would not make any progress in terms of new resources for education there have been some dramatic changes now in the fiscal environment those people who said there was no money available 2 months ago cannot insist that there is no money available now in light of the facts that have been revealed even the budget agencies the congressional budget office they all admit there is a surplus there is an argument about how much of the surplus is from social security funds and ought to be reserved only for social security the lock box theory there is an argument that there are certain amounts of money available and will be available beyond the social security surplus and that that should be budgeted either way either set of assumptions that are accepted there is an acceptance of the fact there is going to be additional money available why not put education on the table why must we accept what the republican majority has offered us on the committee on education and the workforce and on the floor today what they offered us today was a perverted robin hood operation they were going to take only existing funds and scramble them and use them for other purposes instead of having any new funding when they do that what they are doing is taking money away from the traditionally targeted programs which are designed to help the poorest students in our poorest schools and redirect that money away from the poorest schools stealing pilfering from the poor to take care of other sectors and making that the hallmark of their education reform program going to the public and saying this is our answer to their request or their demand for more federal assistance we give them the same money in new forms and we hope that they will be fooled by it but i hope that common sense will not allow us to be fooled that we will insist that education appropriations be put on the table alongside any tax cut spending alongside any spending for shoring up social security alongside spending for health care probably there is going to be a package which contains all of those elements now on may 26 i introduced a bill which deals with one aspect of education which i think is critical in the light of the large amounts of money that were being made available in the surplus now is the timeto discuss it not all the problems of education will be solved by new construction and modernization of our schools although that was on the agenda today we did discuss the need for more technology in our schools and the need for teachers to be trained to utilize technology and how important that was it the modernization process requires that we have money to repair the schools and take care of the old wiring and make certain that they can be wired in some cases some schools cannot be rewired they are going to have to build new schools so construction and modernization ought to be a part of this agenda it was totally ruled out before because of the budget caps and if we take the ongoing budget as it is common sense and conventional wisdom says there is just no money but if we accept the fact that there is going to be a surplus and we talk about large amounts of money like 864 billion for a tax cut then we can also talk about taking this opportunity to plan to spend over the next 10 years or 5 or 10 years money that is necessary to provide adequate schools safe schools schools where there are no health hazards as well as schools that can be modernized to the point where they can make use of modern technology schools can take advantage of the fact that we have an erate which provides a reduced rate for people who make use of technology on an ongoing basis the online services the telephone services 90 percent of that in the poorest of schools would be paid through this erate fund provided by the federal communications commission a lot of things are happening that we need to catch up with by providing more funds for construction and for modernization now on may 26 i called on my colleagues to join me in the cosponsorship of h r 1820 which is an amendment to the elementary and secondary assistance act and this amendment would be germane certainly because there is already a provision title 12 under the elementary and secondary assistance act which calls for money for repairs and construction so we can add if we ever get around to reauthorizing the elementary and secondary assistance act we can certainly add that to the package or if we do not get around to reauthorizing the entire act it is in the law it is the law right now we can amend it to provide for this injection of necessary funding for school construction i am just going to read from my own letter to my colleagues and i have a big heading on top which says that in the year 2000 we launch the march towards a new cybercivilization we are spending 218 billion on highways and roads in 6 years let us invest half this amount 110 billion in 5 years to build repair and modernize schools let me repeat that in the year 2000 we launch the march toward a new cybercivilization a cybercivilization meaning the digital world is taking over the computers are taking over they are everywhere infused in our life and they are probably going to have a greater influence and a greater presence in our lives as we move on recently there was a lot of discussion of the fact that one individual now his net worth is 100 billion this tops all the millionaires and billionaires throughout american history the name of that individual is bill gates now bill gates is worth they say at least 100 billion and his company is worth far more now bill gates does not own any gold mines he does not own any oil wells he does not own any uranium mines all the kinds of things that used to make pe6ple rich are not associated at all with bill gates what does bill gates have that allows him to accumulate 100 billion as an individual and a company worth far more than that microsoft well bill gates is where he is and has the kind of gigantic assets that he has through the application of brainpower it is all about the brains that were used to develop the software in harmony with the computers and then to capitalize on the internet he has been accused of some unscrupulous actions and so forth but that is irrelevant in terms of the basic thrust of what happened here what happened here is that brainpower marshaled repeatedly directed concentrated on certain objectives produced results and the same thing is happening over and over again in numerous hightech companies we are ahead of the rest of the world because we did not have any central committees making rules which said that we can only focus our brainpower on natural resources we are only going to concentrate on mining and oil wells and so forth people who had the knowhow to launch the cyberrevolution went ahead and launched it very young people who are in charge the guys who used to be called nerds or probably similar people are still called nerds in high school and college the nerds triumphed with brainpower it is all about very educated people concentrating their resources and being able to generate wealth so there is a direct association between brainpower and wealth we are definitely moving into a cybercivilization and it is ridiculous for us not to recognize that and to shape our public policy in a way which accommodates the fact that we are moving into a cybercivilization there are some nations like india who recognize this and public policy has produced in india large amounts of people personnel who are in the computer programming arena who are in various stages as computer programmers and document technologists out of proportion to other similarly situated nations india is producing people in the area of information technology with information technology expertise but let me just get back to the appeal to my colleagues that i sent out on may 26 in the year 2000 we launch the march toward a new cybercivilization we are spending 218 billion on highways and roads in 6 years let us invest half this amount 110 billion in 5 years to build repair and modernize schools please join me as a cosponsor for h r 1820 an amendment to the elementary and secondary assistance act which mandates a worthy federal investment in education for the children of america public opinion polls consistently show that our voters consider federal aid to education as the nations number one priority we must now move beyondpaltry pilot projects in our response to this longterm public outcry h r 1820 commits the federal government to make the contribution most suitable to its role through direct appropriations we must make capital investments in school infrastructures offer leadership in the building of schools and then leave the details of the daytoday operations to local and state authorities i have no problem with local and state authorities bding in charge of the implementation but the resources need to come from the federal government because most states and local governmerrts cannot commit the kind of resources necessary to modernize our school systems the way they should be h r 1820 proposes to help all schools by authorizing on the basis of schoolaged children a per capita distribution of the allocations for the purposes of modernization security by the way should be added repair technology and renovations as well as new school construction h r 1820 deserves national priority consideration for the following reasons one the best protection for social security is an educated workforce able to qualify for hightech jobs and steadily pay dollars into the social security trust fund two the effective performance of our military in action utilizing hightech weaponry requires an educated pool of recruits three the unitedstates economy will continue to be the pace setter for the globe only if we maintain a steady flow of qualified brainpower and updated knowhow at all performance levels theoretical scientific technical and mechanical invest in education and all other national goals become reachable invest in education and all other national goals become reachable invest in education and we have a great possibility a greater possibility i do not think social security is about to go bankrupt there are a lot of scare tactics applied to discussions of where social security funds are now and where they will be 50 years from now but one way to assure that social security funding will be there is to have a workforce out there paying into the social security fund whatever else we do and i do not rule out having general appropriations for social security but whatever else we do we should keep the payment of funds into the social security treasury from working people people who are working and if we do not have people who can qualify for the jobs that are going to be available 20 30 40 years from now if we do not have people that have the knowhow to do the hightech jobs the likelihood is that we are going to contract out a lot of our work to other countries that do have the population and the workforce with the knowhow and they are going to pay money into their social security fund and we will have our social security fund deprived of the payment by workers into the fund that is the first source so the best protection for social security is an educated workforce we ought to have a discussion of education on the table when we consider what to do with the huge surplus that is anticipated over the next 10 years instead of being a projected 864 billion in tax expenditures we should say some portion of that money should go for education in this particular piece of legislation the bill i have introduced i only want 110 billion out of the total that is projected even if we have to take the 110 billion away from the tax expenditures that is 110 billion from 864 billion the parameters for the discussion have been set by the majority party they have said we can talk big money we can talk in billions we can talk 864 billion so let us use that as a reference point and say why spend on tax cuts the full 864 billion let us negotiate at least 110 billion over a 5year period to build schools and to modernize schools invest in education there may be additional money we will want to invest in whole school reform which despite the fact that the authorizing committee on education and the workforce did not come up with the program for whole school reform we get high praise for some of the whole school reform efforts that are going forward there are many other places where we may need some investment in education but a large capital expenditure is needed for school construction and modernization and a capital expenditure of this kind is only a onetime expenditure it is not something we would saddle the budget with forever it would not be ongoing we would take care of the problem we would invest in building schools and then we will have a result from that investment a return on that investment later on i think any businessman if he had a surplus and there was clearly identified needs in the area of capital investments would make those investments in order to be able to realize that return in the future the general accounting office told us in 1995 that we needed 112 billion at that time that was 4 years ago we needed 112 billion just to keep the infrastructure at a level which would accommodate the amount of schoolchildren attending school at that time we now have many more children attending school i think we have close to 53 million children out there in schools and what i have just projected an expenditure of 110 billion over a 5year period would be only an expenditure of 416 per year per schoolaged child an expenditure of 416 per child per year over a 5year period so we are talking about a relatively small amount of money to invest in education and guaranty the workforce that we need for tomorrow and that is an appeal i made to my colleagues on may 26 to cosponsor and i recently developed another appeal in light of the changed circumstances that we now know that there definitely is additional money available i projected it before and i said we should get ready for it and we should put on the table a reasonable package which includes school construction i am all for the presidents call for an expenditure of a part of the surplus on medicare i am all for his call of an expenditure of the bulk of the surplus on shoring up social security i am not against that but i think it is a great mistake a great blunder by both democrats and republicans not to put education on the table and make it part of the package but circumstances recently have changed so favorably until i do not see how we can ignore the great window of opportunity that is now open so i prepared another letter which i have not sent out yet i will send it out tomorrow i start with the following heading democrats must respond to the overwhelming change in the fiscal surplus negotiating environment i repeat democrats must respond to the overwhelming change in the fiscal surplus negotiating environment republicans have now ratcheted up their demands for a megabilliondollar tax cut the democratic president has now indicated that he will entertain a tax cut at some level so it is definitely on the table missing from the end game negotiating table is a democratic scenario for school construction and moderniza tion at this moment that is not on the table none of the speakers tonight have talked about education being part of the mix i heard discussions of defense additional expenditures for defense that ought to come out of the surplus and a few other items but no one talked about education although education if you want to consider the national security of the country as being important the first item you ought to look at is the quality of our education including such practical and immediate problems as the workforce required by the military the military requires recruits that are highly educated people who must have had enough prerequisite education in order to be able to go into the military and learn how to deal with a hightech military hightech equipment procedures et cetera youneed welltrained people in the military as much as you need them in the area of information technology so the first step toward shoring up our military should not be new expenditures for equipment like aircraft carriers and b2 bombers and smart bombs but to make certain that the people who guide those smart bombs and who prepare the maps and the intelligence before you drop the bombs do not make a mistake of the kind we made with the chinese embassy in yugoslavia or you have people who are smart enough with their hightech equipment not to be fooled the way we were fooled with the yugoslav dummy equipment wooden weapons and all kinds of things that made us believe that we were bombing their military into ineffectiveness when actually we were hitting very little of their military equipment i do not know why we fell for that trick because we pulled that on hitler when we were projecting openly exposing equipment in the south of france to make it appear that we were going to launch an invasion of the mainland of europe from the south toward the south of france instead of at normandy and the germans fell for that and we are proud of the fact that we pulled that off why we would let yugoslavia pull the same kind of trick on us with respect to equipment that we thought we were bombing i do not know but it points up the need to have better training and a better educated military set of military personnel from the bottom to the top let me continue as i said before missing from the end game negotiating table is a democratic scenario for school construction and modernization h r 1820 an amendment to the elementary and secondary education assistance act authorizes a direct appropriation which is only onehalf the amount authorized and appropriated for transportation not 218 billion but 110 billion or 416 per child per year for 5 years all of the democratic proposals for school reform and education are worthy but nothing proposed is equal to the number one priority ranking that the voters have assigned to education a construction and modernization initiative of this kind fills the vacuum this kind of initiative is a response worthy of what the voters have demanded in poll after poll you have said education should get more assistance from the federal government you do not want to hear an answer that we are going to have a teacher empowerment act which takes old funds away from poor schools and redirects thern spreading them out over the whole country to train teachers better but no new funds are going to be allocated you do not want to hear that kind of response to an overwhelming demand that the federal government play a greater role in providing assistance to education here is a response worthy of it lay these responses alongside of the 218 billion that we approved for highway and transportation last year 218 billion over a 6year period that is about 50 some billion dollars a year for the next 6 years we approved that the authorization committee came forward with it it was not the appropriations committee the appropriations committee was driven by the energy of the authorizing committee today we had the authorizing committee education and the workforce refusing to even ask for additional funding and take to the appropriations committee the priorities that have been set by the american people so we are asking for a worthy response 110 billion over 5 years lay that aside the highway and transportation bill of 218 billion over 6 years and then lay that aside of the new request from the republican majority for 864 billion over 10 years if you get dizzy considering billions of dollars i can understand but at least let us look at the comparisons and understand the framework in which we are operating i have had people say to me when you talk about 22 billion a year for school construction over a 5year period which all adds up to 110 billion over 5 years that is mindboggling it may be mindboggling but we live in a mindboggling era and we are a country of more than 250 million people there are more than 16 000 school districts out there and there are 53 million children out there when you look at the number of children and you look at the amount spent per child we are talking about 416 per child per year maybe that can help you understand the mindboggling figure of 22 billion per year over a 5year period which adds up to 110 billion and then lay the 110 billion alongside 218 billion for highways lay that alongside 864 billion for a tax cut and you are able to comprehend maybe what is going on in washington do you want to stand by and let your government leaders make the blunder of a tax cut expenditure of 864 billion while schools receive zero from a surplus that does exist or we assume exists democrats risk also being upstaged on this because i do not think the majority party is as dumb as some people consider it to be and i do not think this whole process is going to go forward without the majority party waking up to the fact that the people out there are still demanding that the federal government do more for education between now and the next election in the year 2000 i expect some movement on the part of the majority party and i hope the democrats are not going to be victimized by an october surprise like the one we had in october of 1996 when the republicans agreed to an increase in education funding of 4 billion after the republicans had gone for a period from 1994 to the fall of 1996 calling for the abolishment of the department of education wanting to cut school lunches they attacked education vigorously they cut head start they cut title i they went into 1995 and shut down the government because the president would not agree to those kinds of cuts after all that had happened in the fall of 1996 they decided to appropriate 4 billion more for education and they went out and told the public we are the party which supports education and they had enough people to believe that to win back the majority i am convinced that that was a major item a major part of their winning in 1996 democratic refusal to support a meaningful dollar investment in school construction and modernization could weaken our ties to our labor allies and leave open an opportunity for republicans to capture more labor union support i have talked before about the way we treat the working people in this country people look at requests for new money for education for items like school construction or items like whole school reform or any items related to education they look at it and say well thats for minorities thats for people in the inner cities but most of the working families in this country cannot afford to send their children to private schools so we are talking about the public school system and a refusal to direct funding into school building repair and modernization is an abandonment of the public school system and working families are out there who are going to suffer as a result we cannot emphasize too much the fact that the fiscal negotiating environment has undergone a rapid almost revolutionary seachange since the announcement of the longterm multitrillion dollar surplus to adapt to this change and at the same time respond to the number one priority of the voters we urge you to review your position on h r 1820 and sign up for cosponsorship now i am trying to get this new letter out i have some sponsors that we did not have before the minority whip the gentleman from michigan now is a cosponsor of this bill the gentlewoman from california on the appropriations committee is a cosponsor we hope that we can have new momentum that will be generated among those skeptical democrats who did not want to be associated with an appropriation figure which seemed unreal it is not unreal anymore i hope i do not have to repeat why it is not unreal i think that every one of my colleagues republican or democrat can see that 110 billion alongside 864 billion is not an unreal projection of what should be available for school construction now one final specific item about this particular bill h r 1820 we propose to appropriate the money on the basis of the number of school aged children in each state this is a bill that would not be targeted meanstested and that the utilization of it would have great flexibility for security purposes for repair for modernization for technology for construction for renovation there would be great flexibility and it would be appropriated according to the number of school aged children if you look at it in terms of the blanket call for 110 billion it may seem kind of irrelevant to you but let us look at what each state will get if you take the number of school aged children projected for that state for this year and you apply that to the formula alabama would receive 341 million for school construction per year this is the first year each year for 5 years alabama would receive 340 million california would receive 2 7 billion a year for 5 years florida would receive 1 1 billion hawaii 92 million iowa 233 million it would be money which is real enough to deal with the problem that the general accounting office has cited we are talking about expenditures which would make a big difference in terms of school construction and school modernization and repair et cetera we are talking about an investment in education which would be a capital investment the value over 30 40 50 years versus the 864 billion projected for a tax cut expenditure over a 10year period i include for the record these two items my dear colleague letter of may 26 1999 and my dear colleague letter of

of our nations priorities why because the republican house leadership passed a bad budget resolution that puts tax cuts for the wealthiest americans above investments to promote americas education workforce and health services their 175 billion tax cut exceeds the projected budget surplus and requires deep cuts in nondefense discretionary appropriations and here we are again voting on a measure that would provide over 50 billion to the wealthiest 2 percent of taxpayers how much is enough when will republicans be satisfied with the amount of money they have given to the wealthy and turn their attention to the majority of americans who want a good education a strong work force and a healthy future this bill will cost 50 billion per year when fully phased in this monstrous hole in the federal budget will undoubtedly translate into cuts from areas that the american people care about just as the proposed 175 billion republican tax cut translated into cuts in yesterdays proposed labor hhs education appropriations bill when we prioritize tax cuts over health education and labor we make sacrifices and these sacrifices affect everybody the repeal of the estate tax does nothing for working families most american families would not receive a single dollar of tax relief from this bill so i want the american people to know what they are sacrificing in order to provide a tax cut to

afterschool services to 1 6 million kids and eliminating headstart assistance to 50 000 kids they have also proposed cutting nih 439 million below current services and cutting 16 million from clintons request for battered womens shelters these are the kinds of sacrifices that americans are being asked to make in exchange for a tax cut that would give 300 billion to the 400 richest americans 300 billion is enough to pay for a prescription drug benefit for seniors for 10 years the republican majority placed the needs of big business over working people yesterday by voting to once again delay the implementation of new ergonomics regulations which protect working people from repetitive motion injuries and here they are again asking working families to make sacrifices so that the wealthy can

government responds to their needs taxes them excessively continuing to spend without regard i hope today is the day we can return some of the confidence in the government to the people the tax limitation amendment will return confidence by promising that the congress will no longer raise their taxes without careful consideration and a twothirds vote in support this would have precluded the passage of a lot of bad socalled tax reform acts there would have to be a strong consensus among members of both parties not just one side to raise taxes making sure it would be a necessity this is a simple straightforward proposition that a number of states have already adopted and a number of others are expected to consider this year including my home state of texas in states that require a twothirds vote to increase tax rates growth in both spending and taxing is lower than in states without it this simple fact is proof that the intent of this legislation can and will accomplish its

costly investments our government can make every 1 spent on americorps generates l66 in benefits to the community every fulltime americorps members generates an average of 12 additional volunteers americorps is one of the most successful experiments in state and local controls the federal government has embarked upon twothirds of americorps funding goes directly to the governorappointed state

million students recruited supervised or trained more than 1 6 million volunteers built or rehabilitated more than 25 000 homes provided living assistance to more than 208 000 senior citizens and planted more than more than 52 million trees americorps members are not only helping meet the immediate needs in our communities they are also teaching through their example the importance of serving
