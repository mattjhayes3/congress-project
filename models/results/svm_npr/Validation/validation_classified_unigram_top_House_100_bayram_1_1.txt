and the free markets should be borne evenly and proportionally by those who benefit from them this resolution gives japan an option if the japanese government feels that it cannot exceed their politically established 1 percent of gross national product we offer them a mechanism to meet their responsibilities they can pay the united states for the protective service we provide them perhaps that sounds unrealistic perhaps it sounds less than genteel or diplomatic but the defense spending imbalance between our two nations stands at the very heart of potential longterm problems between our two countries we must elevate the debate bring it into the public arena in our two countries and settle it in an equitable fashion there has been concern that the japanese constitution prohibits defense spending above 1 percent of gross national product this is not true this is a politically established limit as a matter of fact the japanese government spent 1 004 percent of their gross national product on defense last year i must add that i am extremely concerned over the recent export violations by toshiba machine co inc of japan while the united states is spending billions on national security a security that as ive discussed accrues great benefit to the japanese toshiba sold sophisticated propeller manufacturing equipment expressly prohibited by law to the soviet union this sale and unbelievably its accompanying service contract approved by the japanese ministry of international trade and industry miti served as a veritable stab in the back of all americans our nation which has stood as the rebuilder and protector of a nation which at one time struck out in a violent act of hostility against our nation 46 years ago views this sale of ship and submarine quieting technology which occurred twice with particular disdain i am pleased to see the substantive steps taken by the japanese to get to the heart of the toshiba problem and ask that they take the message of this resolution as seriously a rapid and resolute response to this bill to the negotiations that i trust will ensue would mean the japanese have aligned themselves with strengthening democracy and security there are costs as well as benefits of being a global economic superpower it is time japan recognized and shared more of the costs it is simply not fair to the american people that we devote so much of our resources to being the protector of law and order in the world while japan is free to devote their resources to being the worlds producers and salesmen i include for the record the text of joint resolution 327 and a copy of a recent article by richard perle president reagans former assistant secretary of defense for international security policy regarding the toshiba

defense burden by either increasing its annual defense expenditures to at least 3 percent of japans gross national product or by obtaining payment by japan to the united states of the difference between 3 percent of japans gross national product and what japan actually spends on defense whereas without freedom democracy and capitalism global economic vitality is diminished and individual markets diminish as well which is demonstrated by the far higher average gnp per capital for western market economies versus eastern socialist non market economies whereas without the military strength and the political resolve of the united states to protect and augment freedom democracy and capitalism throughout the world the global markets upon which exporting nations depend would not be

and japan spent 1 of its gnp on defense whereas if the japanese spent 3 percent of their gnp on defense rather than 1 they would have spent an additional 39 billion on defense in 1986 money which would not be used to promote their civilian export industries and which over the last 5 years would have amounted to a staggering 139 billion whereas japan has the second largest economy in the world with a gnp of 1 963 trillion in 1986 and had an inflation rate of 1 percent and an unemployment rate of 2 8 percent during the same period whereas the united states overall trade deficit in 1986 was

keep japanese computers out of the united states are allied with those who want to get them into the soviet union a selfserving industry lobby now argues that while it is harmful to national defense to import semiconductors from taiwan it is perfectly all right to ship them to moscow the competitiveness argument has it that in order for american industry to remain competitive we must equal the laxness with which our allies administer their export controls by diminishing the effectiveness of ours thus sinking to the lowest common denominator this is the central point of a shallow and tendentious study recently released by the national academy of sciences on which opponents of export controls have relied heavily in their irresponsible campaign to weaken them it seems not to have occurred to those who hold this view that is might be wiser to bring others up to our standard rather than haul us down to theirs how many more toshibas will it take before the allure of irresponsibilitly ceases to attract the national association of manufacturers and the business roundtable the business community complains with some validity that export controls entail bureaucratic

time effort and resources into running the licensing function of the commerce department with even minimal competence we could get rid of the red tape without shipping our technology to the red army that is what defense secretary caspar weinberger and deputy undersecretary stephen bryen have done at the pentagon where they have treated technology control with the seriousness it merits and built

for processing license requests expeditiously coupled with a vigorous campaign to get our allies to play by and enforce the same rules replacing the bonker and heinz measures with congressional support for administering export controls efficiently would be a good place to begin and legislation to bar toshiba and kongsberg from doing business in the united states would work wonders in getting our allies to enforce the rules they claim to respect much of what animates the white house these days has to do with issues of consistency and credibility values vital to our leadership of the

the equation that presently exists i ask simply what is the impact on the young people of today when they see professional football players slapped on the wrist for 30 days and supposedly beginning their drug rehabilitation by playing golf what do they think when they hear on the floor of the house that we should excuse drug traffickers because they happen to be veterans i heard someone ask how can we take a particular benefit away from somebody when their service in vietnam drove them to trafficking in drugs is that the message you want to send forward do you want to send a message forward that in a courtroom in america that if someone is a drug trafficker they can say they got involved in drugs in vietnam and therefore they are excused i am concerned about veterans of america and concerned about the vietnam veterans but more concerned about the young people of america today in this respect what i heard on the floor is that if a trafficker sells drugs to my son or your son or grandson that person ought to receive special treatment because that person happened to be a veteran we made an exemption because we understood the problem of drug usage among some that returned from vietnam you do not suffer the same disability under the mccollum amendment if you are merely using drugs and convicted of use if you happen to be a veteran they are therefore given a special exemption but when their action rises to the question of drug trafficking we say that at that we draw the line we dont take away your health benefit we dont take away your retirement benefit we protect those but other types of benefits we are going to subject to penalty why do we do that because we have tried the purely criminal sanction route and we have recognized that is not sufficient we have to send a message that is more than that we have to change the culture of america with respect to usage of drugs that is why the amendment is crucial it goes to the question of true user accountability unfortunately the rangel substitute guts the effectiveness of this crucial amendment this amendment may be more important than any other single amendment we have here because it reflects a change in attitude of our approach on the drug problem we can talk big we can have mandatory penalties but if we excuse the users as we have done time and time again if we now excuse the trafficker because the trafficker happens to be a veteran we are going to send the wrong message to america if we want to save this generation of young people if we want to save the next generation we have to do more than we have done before we have to establish user accountability and that means changing the rules of the game that we have had thus far is this something new absolutely the reason it is new is because we

visible progress in ending apartheid despite passage of previous sanctions legislation i have some serious reservations about this bill h r as the ranking republican on the banking committee let me address one problem in this bill with reepect to bank loans under this bill banks will not be able to reschedule existing loans with south africa because of the debt moratorium that south africa imposed after the first sanctions bill no payments are being made under original loan terms thus united states banks will have no other alternative then to sell the loans because they will become uncollectible under original terms the bottom line impact is that united states banks stand to lose over a billion dollars and our banks loss will become the south african governments gain it is inconceivable to me that the authors of this legislation would want to confer such a windfall on the south african government i should make the point that no new lending has occured since the last sanctions bill the only new money flowing into south africa has been shortterm trade financing which will be prevented under this bill additionally no new investment has been allowed either the first sanctions bill was a positive step forward which banned new banks loans but to allow the south africans to excuse their debt now is in my opinion not a sanction other provisions of the bill are also troublesome for instance unitedstates investors big and small may lose over a billion dollars because of the mandated disinvestment also the breaking of all intelligence ties between our two nations is mandated by this bill despite the strategic location of south africa t enetrage my colleagues to support tht 1roomfield alternative as a more sensiole in their approach to this problem we should seek allied strength if these sanctions are to be effective as the broomfield alternative suggests moreover thl burton substitute would specifically attempt to improve black economic power in south africa while maintaining the existing sanctions both of these objectives are laudableand notably lacking in h r 1580 h r 1580 in its present form is a solo effort because we do not have indications that other nations plan to follow our lead in the sanctions effort will blacks have more economic power if we pass this bill most likely notand therefore their leverage for change will diminish in the final analysis what we are doing here is simply sending a signal that we will have nothing to do with south africa it is a symbolic move and i can understand that approach but with respect to real economic harm to the south african government and economy i really dont believe that there will be any significant impact from the sanctions contained in h r 1580 as i mentioned i have supported sanctions in the past on every occasion i favor more punitive action against south africa but i believe that this legislation needs to be improved as it stands unitedstates banks and investors will be

right at first glance on further examination however it is clear that the budget committee has recommended funds for function 700 that places veterans medical care at less than a priority level as

cry from current services for va medicine it means that va will treat fewer outpatients next year it means that fewer inpatients will be treated it means that quality medical care for veterans is in

america were cutting back other companies were being created in my area precisely because of foreign investment what do we want them to do with their money hold it in their countries build more infrastructure in their countries take that money out of the united states or maybe instead of investing maybe they should just hold the debt of america maybe that is the better thing for them to do so they can take it out at a moments notice when they invest in america they make a commitment to america they cannot easily take that money out they cannot pick up a factory they cannot pick up a new port as easily as they can wire somebody within 30 seconds to say that they want to sell off a debt they happen to own this is creating jobs in america this is helping us be a real part of the

of certain amendments added by the other body to the fair housing amendments act of 1988 my colleagues will recall that the house considered the fair housing legislation on june 22 and june 23 and finally approved the legislation on june 29 subsequently when the housepassed bill went to the other body a series of negotiations ensued to resolve the remaining differences between the civil rights community and the administration our purpose here today is to consider and hopefully accept the changes to h r 1158 adopted by the senate it should be pointed out that these changes have the support of the unitedstates department of housing and urban development the department of justice as well as key elements in the business community principally the national association of realtors and the national association of home builders the amendments adopted in the other body do no harm to the spirit of the balanced compromise approved by this house just a few weeks ago in fact many of these amendments serve to enhance and reinforce some of the provisions contained in that compromise for example many members of this house were concerned about the potential adverse impact that the coverage of families with children could have on senior citizens retirement communities under the language of one notable senate amendment existing senior citizen communities will have increased flexibility and possibility to qualify for the exemption from the familial status requirements just as important is the senateadded language providing a transition period for the current residents of housing that excludes children they will not be required to leave that housing nor will they be subject to eviction that is existing residents whose presence in a community or apartment complex might otherwise cause the community to fall outside the protections in section 807 b 2 will not be counted in calculating whether the exemption should apply the bottom line is that senior citizens retirement communities across the united states will have a greater chance of qualifying for the housing for older persons exemption furthermore no one will be evicted whether in a senior citizens community or an alladult community because of the enactment of this bill litigation authority was also an issue when we considered h r 1158 on this floor approximately 6 weeks ago the language contained in the bill before the house today fully consolidates in the department of justice the authority to represent the federal government in all of the enforcement actions under the fair housing act however while the litigation will be conducted by lawyers from the department of justice the decision as to whether or not prompt judicial action is necessary to obtain injunctive relief or to seek court enforcement of a finding of discriminatirn will still be lodged with the secretary of housing and urban development so under the latest compromise the secretary will decide whether or not litigation should occur where the secretary authorizes the litigation it is transmitted to the attorney general and lie is required to promptly commence and maintain such action consistent with the terms of the senate amendment the amended version of h r 1158 also contains a technical amendment to the bills language providing for a transition period for state and local fair housing agencies making it clear that certain interim certifications by hud are included in the bill the language adopted in the other body also makes it clear that this legislation is not requiring the establishment of a federal building code because of the accessibility and adaptability requirement for newly constructed multifamlly dwellings these and the other changes made in h r 1158 are improvements and refinements fully consistent with the spirit of the housepassed compromise bill we are in the final stretch run of a circuitous race that began nearly 10 years ago this bipartisan effortto strengthen the enforcement provisions of the 1968 law and expand the coverage of the fair housing protections under title viii of the civil rights acthas tested the stamina of many of us in this house my good friend and distinguished colleague from california civil and constitutional rights subcommittee chairman don edwards in particular is to be commended for his patience determination and effective leadership in this effort we are on the threshold of finally passing a federal fair housing law that is workable and effective thirtysix million disabled persons will receive the protections of this fundamental civil rights statute families with children will no longer be arbitrarily limited in their choice of decent housing the secretary of hud will have new and significant powers to investigate discrimination complaints and to enforce the rights guaranteed under this statute if discrimination is found and proven state and local fair housing agencies will contintic their vital integral role in fair housing enforcement all across the united states the states and localities are given an adequate grace period to bring their statutes and ordinances in line with the new federal law so that they can continue to handle a majority of these fair housing complaints complainants and respondents in fair housing discrimination cases are guaranteed due process rights in administrative proceedings and the fundamental right to a trial by jury in a unitedstates district court in instances where they so elect either the adjudication or the trial that results from the election is intended to be a final decision concerning the claims raised by the aggrieved person or any intervenor the aggrieved person or any intervenor may not relitigate the same claims raised in the complaint or seek additional or alternative relief through a direct action in federal court as was reflected in the colloquy between the gentleman from california and myself during consideration of this legislation in june res judicata applies and the intent is that claims based upon the same set of facts should be consolidated into one case before concluding i want to take this one last opportunity to mention some of the individuals who over the years have made positive and prominent contributions to this effort i have already noted and want to reinforce the tremendous contribution made by the gentleman from california the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner deserves special recognition our thanks go to the secretary of housing and urban development sam pierce for his pivotal role in this entire effort through his 8 years in office as the hud secretary sam pierce has consistently and staunchly advocated fair housing reform now on the threshold of a final success secretary pierce deserves acknowledgment and acclaim for his many contributions in addition i also want to give muchdeserved credit to our former colleague and friend from the other body the distinguished senator from maryland charles mcc mathias for many years mac was the principal sponsor of this legislation in the senate and was always ready and willing to lend his time and his advice to this effort pivotal players over the years have been ralph neas the executive director of the leadership conference on civil rights as well as my good friend althea simmons executive director washington office of the naacp kerry scanlon of the washington lawyers committee for civil rights under law wade henderson of the aclu and penda hair of the naacp legal defense fund also brought their usual fairness and balance to this effort the compromise that brought about prompt approval of this legislation in the house of representatives just a few weeks ago could never have occurred without the assistance of these and other representatives of the civil rights community their willingness to compromise was the key this is also an appropriate time to give recognition to many of the unsung heroes which you may not read about in the newspapers but nevertheless have made major contributions to the development of this legislation and its prospects for success from the staff of the subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights chief counsel catherine leroy associate counsel stuart ishimaru and minority counsel alan slobodin i also want to express grateful thanks and appreciation to marion morris who served for 4 years as the legislative assistant to senator mathias during that time ms morris made numerous and significant contributions in the development of this legislation particularly in the

worlds defense burden the cost of protecting freedom and the free markets should be borne evenly and proportionally by those who benefit from them this resolution gives japan an option if the japanese government feels that it cannot exceed their politically established 1 percent of gross national product we offer them a mechanism to meet their responsibilities they can pay the united states for the protective service we provide them perhaps that sounds unrealistic perhaps it sounds less than genteel or diplomatic but the defense spending imbalance between our two nations stands at the very heart of potential longterm problems between our two countries we must elevate the debate bring it into the public arena in our two countries and settle it in an equitable fashion there has been concern that the japanese constitution prohibits defense spending above 1 percent of gross national product this is not true this is a politically established limit as a matter of fact the japanese government spent 1 004 percent of their gross national product on defense last year i must add that i am extremely concerned over the recent export violations by toshiba machine co inc of japan while the united states is spending billions on national security a security that as ive discussed accrues great benefit to the japanese toshiba sold sophisticated propeller manufacturing equipment expressly prohibited by law to the soviet union this sale and unbelievably its accompanying service contract approved by the japanese ministry of international trade and industry miti served as a veritable stab

and ask that they take the message of this resolution as seriously a rapid and resolute response to this bill to the negotiations that i trust will ensue would mean the japanese have aligned themselves with strengthening democracy and security there are costs as well as benefits of being a global economic superpower it is time japan recognized and shared more of the costs it is simply not fair to the american people that we devote so much of our resources to being the protector of law and order in the world while japan is free to devote their resources to being the worlds producers and

states of the difference between 3 percent of japans gross national product and what japan actually spends on defense whereas without freedom democracy and capitalism global economic vitality is diminished and individual markets diminish as well which is demonstrated by the far higher average gnp per capital for western market economies versus eastern socialist non market economies whereas without the military strength and the political resolve of the united states to protect and augment freedom democracy and capitalism throughout the world the global markets upon which exporting nations depend would not be available whereas the recent developments in the persian gulf bring to light once again the dependence of our allies on the united states for the protection of strategic

consumed by japan passes through the gulf of hormuz whereas there have been disturbing revelations that the japanese company toshiba machine has on two occasions sold strategic technological equipment to the soviet union which gives the soviets the ability to reduce the noise level of their submarines by a factor of twenty significantly undermining the security of the united states and the rest of

relatively high interest rates and the erosion of united states manufacturing jobs this sale with the approval of the japanese ministry of international trade and industry miti is looked on with

their gnp on defense and japan spent 1 of its gnp on defense whereas if the japanese spent 3 percent of their gnp on defense rather than 1 they would have spent an additional 39 billion on defense in 1986 money which would not be used to promote their civilian export industries and which over the last 5 years would have amounted to a staggering 139 billion whereas japan has the second largest

like japan and norway that have done little or nothing to stop diversions to the soviets and their allies and it would on the theory that the list of forbidden exports is too long arbitrarily release 40 percent of the items now controlled without regard to the security consequences of such an indiscriminate policy having voted consistently to slash unitedstates defenses bonker and his house allies would now imperil us further by facilitating soviet acquisition of our technology while similar legislation in the senate doesnt go quite as far the bill put together by the senate banking committee and shaped largely by sen john heinz r pa shares many of the worst features of hr3 one can only hope that the senate armed services committee under chairman sam nunn dga will take time to review the bill that has emerged from the banking committee and recommend changes aimed at protecting national security war after all is too important to be left to the bankers since 1981 the reagan administration has been pressing its allies to follow our lead in restricting the flow of technology tothe soviets thus passage of the house or even the senate bill as it now stands would do irreparable damage to our credibility abroad six years of cajoling pleading bargaining and negotiating will be made to appear a capricious ephemeral impulse rather than the serious policy initiative the president intended what congress simply doesnt understand is that no president can defend our interests in this or any other matter if his policies can be snapped around like a rubber band the march so evident in congress and in such executive agencies as the department of commerce to weaken export controls is lumbering forward behind the banner of competitiveness this years slogan masquerading as a policy the fellows who want to keep japanese computers out of the united states are allied with those who want to get them into the soviet union a selfserving industry lobby now argues that while it is harmful to national defense to import semiconductors from taiwan it is perfectly all right to ship them to moscow the competitiveness argument has it that in order for american industry to remain competitive we must equal the laxness with which our allies administer their export controls by diminishing the effectiveness of ours thus sinking to the lowest common denominator this is the central point of a shallow and tendentious study recently released by the national academy of sciences on which opponents of export controls have relied heavily in their irresponsible campaign to weaken them it seems not to have occurred to those who hold this view that is might be wiser to bring others up to our standard rather than haul us down to theirs how many more toshibas will it take before the allure of irresponsibilitly ceases to attract the national association of manufacturers and the business roundtable the business community complains with some validity that export controls entail bureaucratic red tapea complaint that commerce secretary malcolm baldrige whose department dispenses red tape by the mile echoes happily at industry lunches and in congressional testimony now if mac would put the time effort and resources into running the licensing function of the commerce department with even minimal competence we could get rid of the red tape without shipping our technology to the red army that is what defense secretary caspar weinberger and deputy undersecretary stephen bryen have done at the pentagon where they have treated technology control with the seriousness it merits and built an organization that can protect both trade and national security the greatest single service that government could provide to american exporters would be an efficient consistent and effective system for processing license requests expeditiously coupled with a vigorous campaign to get our allies to play by and enforce the same rules replacing the bonker and heinz measures with congressional support for administering export controls efficiently would be a good place to begin and legislation to bar toshiba and kongsberg from doing business in the united states would work wonders in getting our allies to enforce the rules they claim to respect much of what animates the white house these days has to do with issues of consistency and credibility values vital to our leadership of the western alliance the president who has taken the lead in arguing for effective export controls will appear pale and depleted if he falls to take charge of the kongsbergtoshlba affair and abandoning policies aimed at protecting our technology will diminish both consistency and credibilityand our security as well ronald reagans signature on a bill that vitiates the effectiveness of export controls for national security purposes would abdicate executive authority and sound policy when we need them most"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "anyone wh6 has ever been

going to win the war on drugs until we change the culture of america with respect to the use and toleration of drug use we can point all the fingers we want to mexico to other south and central american countries to the golden triangle and other parts of the world we can say all we want to about how one administration or another has not done enough or states have not done enough but we arp not really going to get to the crux of the problem until we have a comprehensive approach which involves for the very first time a recognition of the fact that until you change the attitude toward drug users in this country you are not going to change the equation that presently exists i ask simply what is the impact on the young people of today when they see professional football players slapped on the wrist for 30 days and supposedly beginning their drug rehabilitation by playing golf what do they think when they hear on the floor of the house that we should excuse drug traffickers because they happen to be veterans i heard someone ask how can we take a particular benefit away from somebody when their service in vietnam drove them to trafficking in drugs is that the message you want to send forward do you want to send a message forward that in a courtroom in america that if someone is a drug trafficker they can say they got involved in drugs in vietnam and therefore they are excused i am concerned about veterans of america and concerned about the vietnam veterans but more concerned about the young people of america today in this respect what i heard on the floor is that if a trafficker sells drugs to my son or your son or grandson that person ought to receive special treatment because that person happened to be a veteran we made an exemption because we understood the problem of drug usage among some that returned from vietnam you do not suffer the same disability under the mccollum amendment if you are merely using drugs and convicted of use if you happen to be a veteran they are therefore given a special exemption but when their action rises to the question of drug trafficking we say that at that we draw the line we dont take away your health benefit we dont take away your retirement benefit we protect those but other types of benefits we are going to subject to penalty why do we do that because we have tried the purely criminal sanction route and we have recognized that is not sufficient we have to send a message that is more than that we have to change the culture of america with respect to usage of drugs that is why the amendment is crucial it goes to the question of true user accountability unfortunately the rangel substitute guts the effectiveness of this crucial amendment this amendment may be more important than any other single amendment we have here because it reflects a change in attitude of our approach on the drug problem we can talk big we can have mandatory penalties but if we excuse the users as we have done time and time again if we now excuse the trafficker because the trafficker happens to be a veteran we are going to send the wrong message to america if we want to save this generation of young people if we want to save the next generation we have to do more than we have done before we have to establish user accountability and that means changing the rules of the game that we have had thus far is this something new absolutely the reason it is new is because we have a tragedy affecting far more people than affected us in the vietnam war remember more people were killed or destroyed by drug use than were killed in the vietnam war"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "as i stated 2 years ago when the house was debating h r 1460 th first sanctions bill there is no room in the world today for officially sanctioned racial discrimination apartheid is abhorrent and i agree that the united states should not stand by and ignore the continuation of this policy although i have always been a strong proponent of sanctions legislation and fully understand that south africa has made no visible progress in ending apartheid despite passage of previous sanctions legislation i have some serious reservations about this bill h r as the ranking republican on the banking committee let me address one problem in this bill with reepect to bank loans under this bill banks will not be able to reschedule existing loans with south africa because of the debt moratorium that south africa imposed after the first sanctions bill no payments are being made under original loan terms thus united states banks will have no other alternative then to sell the loans because they will become uncollectible under original terms the bottom line impact is that united states banks stand to lose over a billion dollars and our banks loss will become the south african governments gain it is inconceivable to me that the authors of this legislation would want to confer such a windfall on the south african government i should make the point that no new lending has occured since the last sanctions bill the only new money flowing into south africa has been shortterm trade financing which will be prevented under this bill additionally no new investment has been allowed either the first sanctions bill was a positive step forward which banned new banks loans but to allow the south africans to excuse their debt now is in my opinion not a sanction other provisions of the bill are also troublesome for instance unitedstates investors big and small may lose over a billion dollars because of the mandated disinvestment also the breaking of all intelligence ties between our two nations is mandated by this bill despite the strategic location of south africa t enetrage my colleagues to support tht 1roomfield alternative as a more sensiole in their approach to this problem we should seek allied strength if these sanctions are to be effective as the broomfield alternative suggests moreover thl burton substitute would specifically attempt to improve black economic power in south africa while maintaining the existing sanctions both of these objectives are laudableand notably lacking in h r 1580 h r 1580 in its present form is a solo effort because we do not have indications that other nations plan to follow our lead in the sanctions effort will blacks have more economic power if we pass this bill most likely notand therefore their leverage for change will diminish in the final analysis what we are doing here is simply sending a signal that we will have nothing to do with south africa it is a symbolic move and i can understand that approach but with respect to real economic harm to the south african government and economy i really dont believe that there will be any significant impact from the sanctions contained in h r 1580 as i mentioned i have supported sanctions in the past on every occasion i favor more punitive action against south africa but i believe that this legislation needs to be improved as it stands unitedstates banks and investors will be injured with no corresponding benefit or gain to the black majority in south africa moreover this legislation will provide a significant financial windfall for the south african government and i fall to understand how that is a sanction i am hopeful that the authors of this bill will set politics aside and support an

budget resolution i rise to comment on that portion of the budget resolution that is concorned with the veterans medical program it has been my strongly held view and the view of the entire house veterans affairs committee that at the very least the medical program of the veterans administration should be funded at a current services level this budget resolution falls considerably short of current services and therefore is of groat concern to me the resolution may look all right at first glance on further examination however it is clear that the budget committee has recommended funds for function 700 that places veterans medical care at less than a priority level as compared to a number of other programs the budget committee recommendation figures might indicate to some that they are 250 million over the presidents reestimated request for budget authority and budget outlays on closer look however we can see that such is not the case a recommended 1percent acrosstheboard decrease for va medicine relates to 150 mll lion absorption of onehalf of the cost of a federal pay raise relates to another 150 mil lion this 300 million in turn relates to a loss of about 3 000 employees in vas department of medicine and surgery this budget committee report is a far cry from current services for va medicine it means that va will treat fewer outpatients next year it means that fewer inpatients will be treated it means that quality medical care for veterans is in jeopardy it means a diminishing of the historic pledge of this body that it will always assure adequate funds for va medicine the house veterans affairs committee carefully studied the presidents budget and then made recommendations to the budget committee we were unanimous in those recommendations we said that the presidents budget ought to be very modestly amended upward for va medical care and for the administration of veterans benefits we recommended a very modest increase in construction funds to build three more nursing homes to try to take care of aging veterans we wanted to start work on a badly needed clinical addition and spinal cord injury unit at dallas tx we rejected a 1percent projected increase in productivity in va hospitals and clinics because medical care is just not measured that way in essence we asked for a budget to adequately provide current services with only bare bones enhancemerits already fully justified these were modest but vitally needed recommendations we tried to be responsible we trisd to be frugal however it seems obvious that this budget resolution was preordained by the economic summit agreements of last decomber i say this because of the very quick action of the budget committee in reporting it to us i was not party to that agreement and do not feel compelled to support any part of it that does harm to va medicine i believe the veterans of this nation deserve a quality medical program i intend always to lend my best efforts in that direction in that regard i must state publicly that the resolution before us is most seriously flawed in a very critical area"]]}
