sure that these dollars are paid look this is a fundamental question should iran receive relief from the unitedstates sanctions before it pays the victims of terrorism the 43 billion that unitedstates courts say these victims are owed when we say terrorism what are we talking about we are talking about iranianbacked assassinations bombings and attacks across time zones from paris to jerusalem to new york to beirut to east africa to buenos aires i say not one cent these victims are united states citizens they are wives brothers and sisters children who hail from all across the nation and they were killed in hijackings and suicide attacks and bombings of buses and planes and buildings and embassies and shopping malls and pizza parlors in fact i met with one of those victims this morning and yesterday the widow of kenneth welch and his child they are here in washington today they have been waiting 30 years for the opportunity to see this issue addressed my friends by voting against this legislation you are saying that iran and the perpetrators of these atrocities deserve unitedstates sanctions relief before the victims deserve the courtordered compensation let me say it again by voting no you are putting the interests of irans terror machine before the american victims of that terror i say not 1 cent to those who say iran cant afford to pay these damages let me remind you of a few facts iran has a yearly gross domestic product in excess of 1 3 trillion and they just spent 21 billion on russian jets the facts show that iran has the money and will have much more if the sanctions are lifted money that our own administration freely admits will go to finance even more terror i sat yesterday with ken stethem the brother of robert stethem the united states navy diver who was executed on beirut flight 847 his brother ken himself a retired navy seal said to me yesterday if the president doesnt take this opportunity and congress doesnt take the opportunity to hold iran accountable for their terrorist acts now i have to ask them when will they thirty years for one family more than 15 for another when will they he is talking to us lets answer him lets today stand up for the standards of unitedstates navy petty officer robert stethem lets today vote as one house to say we will put robert stethem and the many victims of irans terrorism beforebeforethe criminals who

corps of engineers and the epa go out and purport to be defenders of wetlands good stewards of our wetlands yet the greatest cause of wetlands loss in the united states is actually caused by historic current and future actions of the unitedstates army corps of engineers in our home state of louisiana we have lost over 1 900 square miles of our coast and the majority of that land loss has been caused by the management or the mismanagement by the unitedstates army corps of engineers of our coastal resources and the river resources particularly the mississippi river what this amendment does is it simply requires that the unitedstates army corps of engineers comply with the same standards as anything else if there are permits required they have to get them if there are mitigation requirements they have to get them they can no longer mismanage our coastal resources this isnt a parochial this is an issue whereby the nation truly benefits from this this is the area where fishery

auspicious day to actually do some of this as we are getting ready to do the omnibus the big budgetary bill what is so important here is i want everyone first to understand the 1 1plus trillion we are talking about is solely what we call the discretionary portion of the budget this is the portion of the budget we debate here we do amendments we work through and then in this particular case because of a series of blocks and frustrations and gameplaying that happened previously we get here to the end and we are trying to package it all together but it is not the majority it is not anywhere near close to the majority of our federal spending so take a look at this board and this is for 2015 so we are right now working on the budget for the 2016 appropriation cycle if you see the blue the blue is mandatory spending those are things like social security and medicare and medicaid and other parts of the welfare portion of our budget that are formuladriven that you hit a certain age you get a benefit you fall below a certain income you get a certain benefit it is about 69plus percent of our spending and this is for last year only 31 percent of the 2015 budget actually goes through this sort of normal appropriation process and that is really important to understand the scale of the spending and how little of it actually is debated because it is a formula it is also the portion of our spending that is exploding so we are going to walk through a couple of these boards today one of my goals is actually to also walk through and talk about what is actually happening in some of the mandatory spending and why for all of us we are going to have to have that very honest very difficult very math factbased conversation in my district the scottsdale phoenix area i am incredibly blessed i have an amazing constituency i have a wonderful area but we have done 100 of these budget townhalls over the last couple of years and i will get people who will come in and say but that number doesnt feel right i know it may not feel right previous politicians on both sides i think have underplayed what is happening in this country demographically and what it actually means to our commitment so if you are someone who really really really cares about keeping this country safe you need to be willing to start to understand what is happening in these numbers you need to understand the financial pressure that is going to be on your ability to finance the military if you care about health care you need to understand the financial pressure that is going to be coming to deal with those medical research education so lets first get our head around what is both happening and then we are going to actually walk through some demographic slides and the reason i want to do that is to understand this isnt the type of discussion where you can throw a switch and the solutions are simple the next slide this is actually sort of walking through the projections and understand these projections have actually changed a little bit but i didnt have a chance to finish all the calculations so this is functionally four budget cycles from now so it is the 2020 budget we are right now doing the 2016 budget at that point 76 percent of the spending is medicare medicaid social security interest on the debt veterans benefits and other transfer programs welfare programs 76 remember the budget cycle we just finished it was 69 in functionally 4 or 5 years it becomes 76 percent of all of our spending so if you care about the military if you care about healthcare research if you care about foreign aid if you care about any of those things it is shrinking rather dramatically as a percentage of our total spending yet you have got to understand from 2015 to that 2020 budget this government is going to go from i think it is a 3some trillion budget to a 4 1 trillion budget so in that few years we are going to actually increase by 1 trillion in spending and revenues and some of those revenues come from borrowing yet the ratio continues to explode because it is going into that mandatory spending this is demographics this is reality and unless you have a solution for baby boomers to stop like me turning gray we have to grow up and deal with it i find here in washington there is pathological avoidance of the reality that is upon us i am going to do this without knocking anything down and i believe these are already up on our web site the ability to sort of take a look and see where is the money actually going because i cant tell you how many times we would do those budget townhalls and someone would come in the door and say well david if you just did this if you would get rid of foreign aid that would take care of the problem then you go to this slide and try showing them that the tiny tiny tiny little sliver right there was foreign aid well david if you would just get rid of this well waste and fraud is huge the reality of it we know in medicare and medicaid and many of these things we have to come up with more dramatically efficient ways the use of technology we are going to start to talk about that at the end of this that there really are some solutions we need to be embracing but they are little slivers do you see the blue areas social security medicare medicaid welfare benefits interest on the debt as you saw today with the fed starting to raise interest rates we expect in just a few years interest to be bigger than the defense budget in about 7 years interest will be approaching 1 trillion a year understand this is the reality of the math this is no more happy talk that seems to go around in politics it is math this portion over here if you take out the defense departmentso if you look at defense and all this blue these here are all the agencies it is important to understand these numbers because i have been heartbroken at how often we do townhalls around our state and there is this misunderstanding of where the money is actually being appropriated so we are going to talk about a little bit of the demographics of what is going on but also how much trouble how much difficulty is social security in remember they used to say it is the third rail of politics you are not allowed to talk about it or tell the truth about it but we have a moral obligation to explain what is going on how about medicare how about some of these others so i wanted you to see this particular slide here and this just gives you a sense of also what is happening with us demographically i can remember many many years ago sitting in a statistics class over at arizona state universityi love that schooland this is i think in the early eighties and the professor is showing graphs saying you have got to understand in the 20152028 point you have all these baby boomers that move into retirement so i am sure the government i am sure washington d c will make sure they have these massive amounts of reserves set aside to provide benefits for our seniors well being one of those end of the baby boomer folks and now being here in washington realizing that money isnt there so when you look at this particular chartand the only reason it is partially hereyou see 2018 it is the next to the last bar and then all of a sudden the last bar do you see it is shooting up we have hit the time they have called the inflection point so in 22 months we hit the time that we have talked about for 30 years that the debt is going to start to explode in this country 2018 we are doing the 2016 budget right now we are already in the 2016 budget so 22 months from now the debt starts to explode so we are going to have a good year this year though because of some of the budget deal that was done about a month or so ago and some of the other lifting some of the spending caps of sequestration we are going to end up with a larger deficit this year so i guess the best number i have seen right now is 440 billion 450 billion this year but come 2018 a couple of years from now it starts to take off and it takes off for functionally the next 40 years this is the reality that is facing us so if you care about the military and education and all these other things understand what is about to happen here actually are some of the slides that start to become more difficult to talk about and i am actually sort of frustrated that we dont do more of this this particular chart hereand actually i think this one i may have taken from the wall street journal and for folks who are actually interested in these demographic facts and how they affect your country but also affect the world the wall street journal actually just recently finished a series i think they call 2050 and it actually has some of the best narratives best graphs best details i have ever seen in sort of walking through that this just isnt an american trend take a look at the numbers you see in china and other places around the world where the aging of the population compared to the benefits that have been promised compared to the number of workers and that imbalance and what that means to future economic growth for the world let alone just the united states but do you see this line where it starts to explode off the charts that is functionally enrollment in social security so when we were at 2008 we had about 41 million folks who were in social security today i believe now we have crossed 50 million so 20082015 this is the reality of how quickly that slope and it is the what it is the baby boomers remember we have about 76 million of our brothers and sisters who turn 65 in about an 18year period the first one the first baby boomer crossed that threshold i believe in late 2008 so we are in that demographic inflection you are going to start to see more and more of this reflected in our economic growth in the debt and the movement of your federal government resources into retirement programs for those who are over 65 whether it be medical whether it be indigent medical whether it be social security and others it is our commitment we have made these promises we have also made a promise that we need to find some way to pay for them and that is where this discussion hopefully is going to take us this slide is a bit more of a concern we are doing a project in our office right now we have a little a couple of folks set aside in our office called the idea shop and they try to do sort of detailed research outside the daytoday chaos that is being a member of congress it is really the bottom point here that i want to pop out at you and that is the number of our brothers and sisters the number of our fellow americans that are 5564 so they are heading towards retirement nineteen percent of them have no retirement savings at all so they are solely dependent on social security and the medical benefits that they will receive from medicare if we bounce up one 25 percent of those older than 45 have functionally no money set aside now i accept we have just come through a pretty rough economic cycle but the last couple of years it is getting better it is still not great but this is a point where we are starting to step up and understand we need a revolution in this countrys tax code we need a revolution in how we regulate in this country we all walk around with these supercomputers in our pocket information is ultimately the greatest regulator in a society and yet we still try and design these commandandcontrol functions of bureaucracies like it was the 1930s we are also going to do a little talking about embracing the new economy the hyperefficient economy that will hopefully maximize economic growth but everything whether it be from immigration to tax code to regulatory codes everything now the first words out of that politicians that policymakers that researchers and you as the constituents mouth needs to be how does this maximize economic growth for the country because i want to keep my commitment to the young and our commitments to seniors when you look at the numbers it does not happen unless we can get this economic expansion some economic growth really working so as we go through these slidesthe other thing is also for someone that is also really interested in these we try to put these up on our social media but these are some of the different projects we are working on now on this one this is just to sort of understand one more timeand i know i am repeating myself with the different slides but we did a budget deal about what 2 months ago social security disability was going broke social security disability in early mid2016 was functionally the trust fund for that was going to be gone so the solution that congress supportedi voted no but that is because we thought we had a more elegant solution functionally the political will was not there for the types of reforms we thought were appropriate they reached in and took 114 billion out of the big social security trust fund and moved it over here to the social security disability fund to shore it up okay that was their solution but there was almost no discussion around this body that it shortened the life of social security by about another year so when you take a lookthe reason we are showing these istake a look at this middle one if you were to exclude the interestnow understand the revenues for social security come from really two pots the taxes and then the money it has loaned to the government back to the general fund so the federal governmenti know it is just an accounting gimmick back and forth because we are paying ourselves interest but that is what we do we pay ourselves interest and that is considered one of the revenue sources for social security so if you were to take taxes and interest but if you were to look at that midline and say instead of the sort of bookkeeping entry we do back and forth no interest just the revenues from taxes on fica social security it went negative in 2010 so more money was going out to beneficiaries than what has been coming in in taxes but if you actually put both the interest and the tax stream it goes negative no longer in 2022 it goes negative now in 2021 so if i had a big marker i would walk over there and cross that out of course i would also knock over the board in doing it so functionally 5 years 60 months from now social security goes negative this is no longer that theoretical discussion we were having saying sometime off in the future sometime in 2027 sometime in 2040 it is 5 years it is less than one unitedstates senatorial term that social security goes negative how much discussion do you see in the political class in the researcher class the policy class and in our communities saying we need to deal with this today because every day we wait it becomes more difficult if we look at the history of the last couple of decades when those of us who care about this deeply have gotten behind microphones and started to point out the numbers we see the television ad the next campaign whether it be pushing paul ryan or a lookalike off of a cliff and saying that paul ryan wants to try to reform your entitlements becausethe fact of the matter is medicare is going bankrupt he wants to save the system but if we can scare you to death it becomes a great political issue i also believe the voters are way ahead of the political class in understanding we need to step up and do hard things to fix these i also want to make the argument that these are the biggest issues in front of us because if we dont do it then everything in the future is going to be how do we survive the promises we have made in our entitlements and it is coming fast remember social security goes negative in about 60 months that is how fast it is coming at us this was just to sort of reemphasize the factdo you see that little red area that is what we did in the budget deal a couple months ago we grabbed that 114 billion and pulled it out of social security because of that we shortened the life we tried to do this without knocking them over this was just another variation of the same set of numbers so now you know the reality we have some on medicare but when you start to see some of the charts we have charts that say that if there is not a substantial economic expansion medicare could be 7 years and the trust fund is substantially drained remember these are supposed to be freestanding trust funds the way the law works is you start to cut benefits we need to avoid these so how do you do it how do you avoid these the first argument i want to make is it is next year when we start to discuss tax reform a tax reform that maximizes economic growth maybe not the benefit for the group you belong to or the industry you are in but the tax reform that benefits the entire country to maximize economic growth i am also asking for a revolution in the way we look at the regulatory state there are a few people who have written about this there are a few people who have thought about this for a couple of years i sat on the science space and technology committee we would have debates back and forth with the epa on how did you get to this regulation how did you find this out they would say we are not going to give you our data sets it is proprietary we are just doing the command and control i learned there is this intense frustration there is this fight out there between i believe people who make money off the regulatory state and those who functionally pay for it which is all of us the fact of the matter is the crowdsourcing of information and data are we actually doing the most efficient methodology to have clean water and the most efficient technology to have clean air how about in my financial world i sit on the financial services committee this is going to get a little geeky but in 2008 the bonds that were backed by mortgages blew up all of a sudden we found out there were lots and lots and lots of mortgages and deeds of trust rolled into these bonds that stopped performing there were lots of debates and discussions of these were toxic loans they were alta that were put into these bonds whatever the reason how did we not know so we set up a financial system that bundled these mortgages into bonds are you telling me that from the regulatory state if we had designed an informationbased regulatory system where those of uswhen i was maricopa county treasurer and you were looking at buying debt to park the cash you had so you would get a rate of return for your taxpayers you would pick up the phone and call moodys or call s p or call the rating and say hey is this a safe bond is this a rated is it aaa or whatever it is you would get a phone call back they would say yes it is fine that was your due diligence how about a system that uses information so the information flows saying hey the bond you are looking at you now have 5 percent of the loans on it that arent making their payments hey do you realize this bond has an intense geographic concentration so if something happens in that geography you are going to have ever greater difficulties all of a sudden the regulators that are built into the system come in and bayonet the wounded after the war is lost sorry that was one of my fathers favorite sayings but the fact of the matter is the way we do much of our regulation is after the sins have happened instead of using information to avoid the mistake in the beginning so i am making the argument that that type of revolutionary thinking in the way we as a society regulate will maximize economic growth on immigration you need to change this immigration system when you realize that twothirds of the immigration population is familialand i know this sets peoples hair on fire but if you are going to take in 1 million 1 2 million legal immigrants into the country this year you do realize twothirds of that population functionally gets to come to the united states because of a family member where much of the rest of the world whether it be australia new zealand great britain canada have moved to a system that maximizes talent because they figured out they desperately need economic growth to keep their commitments but there is a fourth one that is almost never talked about and i can actually start to see here in congress and i see it in our state legislatures and that is actually the new economy i promise sometime when we get back in january we are going to do a presentation of how the new economy can both change how the government functions but also if we can get out of its way it provides opportunity for everyone and hopefully maybe some escape velocity economically so let me throw you first just a simple concept how many of you out there have ever ridden in a ride share or seen these things they call like zipcar where you hit the button on your phone and you are able to just use a car why doesnt government do that i think we saw some data that there are 176 000 cars that are either owned or leased by the federal government we found one small agency that had more vehicles than employees so if i came to you right now and said lets rethink this does this agency here belong owning their own little vehicle fleet and this agency that is right next door belong owning theirs why wouldnt you pool them together and create a simple app that does two things it says the cars belong to everyone in the agency you hit the button and say i need to use one today and tomorrow i dont need one and oh by the way the technology says that i am going to this community and it tells you who else from the bureaucracy is also going in the same direction it is already happening in the private sector now think of it even more expansive why is it just the federal government why wouldnt it be your state your local your tribal another example we are working on right now in arizona and we are actually working on with some of my state legislators is this concept for capital assets i live in maricopa county it is maybe the third or fourth most populous county in the country it is made up of 30some cities and tribal communities how many of those communities own the really expensive earthmovers how many of those earthmovers are used to their max every single day if they are not why isnt a simple app created to share so do this tribal community this city this county and this government each need to own their own why arent they put on sharing platforms the concept is real simple capital assets need to be maximized it is like the concept of a classroom at 3 45 when school is out does that classroom become the community college at 7 30 does it become the senior learning class it is a building we are paying to heat and cool it it is there we spent the capital money how do you maximize the utilization of capital assets this is happening in the private world much of this technology is coming out of silicon valley and other hubs of innovation in our country we need to open ourselves up in the government and say we need to be embracing this technology to move it to ourselves in the last half of this i see fights starting to break out on the new technology and how it changes how we work it changes our optionality we need to understand that technology is changing our society but if we can get out of the way it can actually really provide us some opportunities so there are crazy thoughts we are researching these lets say you are one of these drivers whether it be an uber platform or something else and there is this argument saying well you are being treated as a selfemployed 1099 or you are getting direct payments electronically or you are doing airbnb or these sorts of things how is that going to help you fund your social security maybe we need to rethink it maybe it really is time to have that honest conversation of should you be allowed to have that account that is truly yours and set up your technology that every time you have a client and you take them and deliver them to a location every time you have guests in your airbnb every time you provide a certain service you can use that technology so that a little bit of that money goes to your retirement account we have the technology it would be a very lowcost way to do it and we start to engage in the technology revolution that is happening around us to basically embrace it not be scared of it and at the same time use that technology to shore up what we have just talked about the devastating actuarial math we are running into i know there is a political battle coming in this because for some of my brothers and sisters on the other side it is very much how do i unionize that population how do i do this type of control how do i have this for many of those on the more free market side we are making the argument for individuals to be able to use technology and the new economy to pursue their optionality maximizing the value of their time they need to be allowed to do that we are americans being free is part of the basicit is supposed to be part of our dna at the same time use that same creativity that same optionality to not be afraid of it but to use that technology to actually grow the economy and embrace the empowerment of individuals to deal with the very problems we were showing on those

began when republicans took control of the house 4 years ago in addition we have continued the freeze on member pay that has been in place since 2010 we believe that in order for us to ask others to sacrifice throughout the government that we have to sacrifice ourselves first and that is what this bill does the bill includes numerous provisions designed to guarantee that the house and its support agencies are spending their tax dollars appropriately and to keep them accountable to the taxpayers this includes enhancing oversight of the cannon building restoration project and making sure that congress approves any largescale construction project these steps will help ensure that this type of major undertaking stays on time and on budget and are especially important given the historical significance of our buildings and the importance of their use the 3 3 billion this bill provides for the house is directed to support the most important functions of our legislative branch keeping our member and committee offices open for business protecting the safety of those who work in and visit the capitol complex and improving the way we support our agenciesand the importance of doing just

that if enacted will put management and labor on the same side thus fostering cooperation rather than conflict president jefferson recognized ownership of private property as the keystone of a free society only a few decades after jeffersons presidency abraham lincoln pushed for and congress delivered the homestead act of 1862 which has proven to be one of the most important manifestations of jeffersons vision for broadbased ownership of property more recently president reagan supported employee stock ownership labeling it the next logical step a path that benefits a free people the belief that all citizens should be able to acquire property and wealth made our country the envy of the world this legislation is consistent with the vision of our founding fathers because it empowers employeesnot just a select few at the top of the management structureto share in the development success and profits of a company our proposal would enhance accountability productivity and prosperity by making sure all employeesboth inside and outside of managementkeep an eye toward the longterm interests of their company our proposal would provide certain tax benefits to employees who are recipients of a broad distribution of voting company stock so long as that stock is held for a specified amount of time specifically when an employer makes an acrosstheboard distribution of voting stock the value of the grant would not be counted as an employees taxable income provided that the same number of shares is granted to every employee and the stock is held for five years if held for ten years employee stockholders can begin to sell or exchange a portion of their stock for other similarlypriced stock free of capital gains thus after 20 years the stock would be totally tax free the provisions of this bill are carefully crafted to allow for the empowerment of employees and the diversification of an employees portfolio the phasein of the capitalgainsfree treatment is meant to ensure that the company stock will not simply be dumped all at once one of the most important aspects of my bill is that it would unlike traditional esops allow employees to directly own the stock granted to them including all voting rights granted to any other normal stockholder this would empower employees to exercise oversight of their managers in an enlightened and responsible manner and

silhouetted against the twilight glow of the evening and then i glanced over to the buildings here at the capitol and was suddenly brought back to reality when i saw so many flags on our buildings flying at half mast flying at half mast because once again we are remembering the tragedies that have shaken our nation time and time again this has been a bloody summer a bloody summer of many attacks that have been associated with folks with mental illness i know most people with mental illness are not violent and i know that there are many other tragedies that occur but tonight during this week which is mental health week in america i want to highlight what we must do as a nation what we cannot continue to push aside just think of what happened this summer just a few examples june 13 attack on the dallas police headquarters by a man who had a history of family violence and mental instability july 23 lafayette louisiana a shooting in a movie theater by a man who had had a judges orders to send him to a mental hospital in the past august 16 antioch tennessee a movie theater attack august 26 roanoke virginia a live onair shooting a tragic scene of a reporter being killed and a cameraman august 28 2015 houston texas while a deputy police officer was at a gas station riddled with bullets by a man who had a history of mental illness september 22 the son of a state senator former state senator of virginia killed a man and also killed himself in bowling green and this last week october 1 in roseburg oregon nine people were killed and the gunman killed himself in another tragic scene there is more to it than this of course in this country last year 125 people with mental illness were killed in some sort of a police shooting where the police oftentimes did not even know but the confrontation grew and ended in a death it is estimated there were somewhere between 1 200 and 1 500 murders in this country this last year by people with mental illness but more than that there are 10 000 or more maybe 20 000 maybe 100 000 people with mental illness who are the victims of crime some are killed there are thousands and thousands of people who are homeless who die that slowmotion death of homelessness of their physical ailments and their illnesses there were 41 000 suicide deaths 1 2 million suicide attempts that required some medical care 43 000 substance abuse overdose deaths this list goes on and on and on and what happens is when we treat people with mental illness early in their life their prognosis is improved in many cases they can go on to have fruitful lives but when it is untreated they likely develop other problems not just with mental illness but social job and physical health persons with serious mental illness in treatment are 15 times less likely to engage in an act of violence than those who are not in treatment in america some 60 million people in any given year will have some diagnosable mental illness from the very mild and transient ones which we all experience to severe mental illness such as schizophrenia or bipolar or extreme depression but of those with serious mental illness about 4 million of those 11 million will not have any treatment for a variety of reasons treatment may not be available they may refuse treatment or what happens so often with those with serious mental illness they are characteristically unaware that they have an illnessit is a brain illness a serious mental illnesslike a person with alzheimers or stroke or traumatic brain injury a person who may not even know that they have a problem what do we do about this as a nation mostly we just talk sadly and tragically what we do here in the house of representatives we will have a moment of silence but it is not followed by action what we need is not more silence we need action we need people in this country to rise up and say this is the time this is the day this is the issue where we are once and for all going to do comprehensive

auspicious day to actually do some of this as we are getting ready to do the omnibus the big budgetary bill what is so important here is i want everyone first to understand the 1 1plus trillion we are talking about is solely what we call the discretionary portion of the budget this is the portion of the budget we debate here we do amendments we work through and then in this particular case because of a series of blocks and frustrations and gameplaying that happened previously we get here to the end and we are trying to package it all together but it is not the majority it is not anywhere near close to the majority of our federal spending so take a look at this board and this is for 2015 so we are right now working on the budget for the 2016 appropriation cycle if you see the blue the blue is mandatory spending those are things like social security and medicare and medicaid and other parts of the welfare portion of our budget that are formuladriven that you hit a certain age you get a benefit you fall below a certain income you get a certain benefit it is about 69plus percent of our spending and this is for last year only 31 percent of the 2015 budget actually goes through this sort of normal appropriation process and that is really important to understand the scale of the spending and how little of it actually is debated because it is a formula it is also the portion of our spending that is exploding so we are going to walk through a couple of these boards today one of my goals is actually to also walk through and talk about what is actually happening in some of the mandatory spending and why for all of us we are going to have to have that very honest very difficult very math factbased conversation in my district the scottsdale phoenix area i am incredibly blessed i have an amazing constituency i have a wonderful area but we have done 100 of these budget townhalls over the last couple of years and i will get people who will come in and say but that number doesnt feel right i know it may not feel right previous politicians on both sides i think have underplayed what is happening in this country demographically and what it actually means to our commitment so if you are someone who really really really cares about keeping this country safe you need to be willing to start to understand what is happening in these numbers you need to understand the financial pressure that is going to be on your ability to finance the military if you care about health care you need to understand the financial pressure that is going to be coming to deal with those medical research education so lets first get our head around what is both happening and then we are going to actually walk through some demographic slides and the reason i want to do that is to understand this isnt the type of discussion where you can throw a switch and the solutions are simple the next slide this is actually sort of walking through the projections and understand these projections have actually changed a little bit but i didnt have a chance to finish all the calculations so this is functionally four budget cycles from now so it is the 2020 budget we are right now doing the 2016 budget at that point 76 percent of the spending is medicare medicaid social security interest on the debt veterans benefits and other transfer programs welfare programs 76 remember the budget cycle we just finished it was 69 in functionally 4 or 5 years it becomes 76 percent of all of our spending so if you care about the military if you care about healthcare research if you care about foreign aid if you care about any of those things it is shrinking rather dramatically as a percentage of our total spending yet you have got to understand from 2015 to that 2020 budget this government is going to go from i think it is a 3some trillion budget to a 4 1 trillion budget so in that few years we are going to actually increase by 1 trillion in spending and revenues and some of those revenues come from borrowing yet the ratio continues to explode because it is going into that mandatory spending this is demographics this is reality and unless you have a solution for baby boomers to stop like me turning gray we have to grow up and deal with it i find here in washington there is pathological avoidance of the reality that is upon us i am going to do this without knocking anything down and i believe these are already up on our web site the ability to sort of take a look and see where is the money actually going because i cant tell you how many times we would do those budget townhalls and someone would come in the door and say well david if you just did this if you would get rid of foreign aid that would take care of the problem then you go to this slide and try showing them that the tiny tiny tiny little sliver right there was foreign aid well david if you would just get rid of this well waste and fraud is huge the reality of it we know in medicare and medicaid and many of these things we have to come up with more dramatically efficient ways the use of technology we are going to start to talk about that at the end of this that there really are some solutions we need to be embracing but they are little slivers do you see the blue areas social security medicare medicaid welfare benefits interest on the debt as you saw today with the fed starting to raise interest rates we expect in just a few years interest to be bigger than the defense budget in about 7 years interest will be approaching 1 trillion a year understand this is the reality of the math this is no more happy talk that seems to go around in politics it is math this portion over here if you take out the defense departmentso if you look at defense and all this blue these here are all the agencies it is important to understand these numbers because i have been heartbroken at how often we do townhalls around our state and there is this misunderstanding of where the money is actually being appropriated so we are going to talk about a little bit of the demographics of what is going on but also how much trouble how much difficulty is social security in remember they used to say it is the third rail of politics you are not allowed to talk about it or tell the truth about it but we have a moral obligation to explain what is going on how about medicare how about some of these others so i wanted you to see this particular slide here and this just gives you a sense of also what is happening with us demographically i can remember many many years ago sitting in a statistics class over at arizona state universityi love that schooland this is i think in the early eighties and the professor is showing graphs saying you have got to understand in the 20152028 point you have all these baby boomers that move into retirement so i am sure the government i am sure washington d c will make sure they have these massive amounts of reserves set aside to provide benefits for our seniors well being one of those end of the baby boomer folks and now being here in washington realizing that money isnt there so when you look at this particular chartand the only reason it is partially hereyou see 2018 it is the next to the last bar and then all of a sudden the last bar do you see it is shooting up we have hit the time they have called the inflection point so in 22 months we hit the time that we have talked about for 30 years that the debt is going to start to explode in this country 2018 we are doing the 2016 budget right now we are already in the 2016 budget so 22 months from now the debt starts to explode so we are going to have a good year this year though because of some of the budget deal that was done about a month or so ago and some of the other lifting some of the spending caps of sequestration we are going to end up with a larger deficit this year so i guess the best number i have seen right now is 440 billion 450 billion this year but come 2018 a couple of years from now it starts to take off and it takes off for functionally the next 40 years this is the reality that is facing us so if you care about the military and education and all these other things understand what is about to happen here actually are some of the slides that start to become more difficult to talk about and i am actually sort of frustrated that we dont do more of this this particular chart hereand actually i think this one i may have taken from the wall street journal and for folks who are actually interested in these demographic facts and how they affect your country but also affect the world the wall street journal actually just recently finished a series i think they call 2050 and it actually has some of the best narratives best graphs best details i have ever seen in sort of walking through that this just isnt an american trend take a look at the numbers you see in china and other places around the world where the aging of the population compared to the benefits that have been promised compared to the number of workers and that imbalance and what that means to future economic growth for the world let alone just the united states but do you see this line where it starts to explode off the charts that is functionally enrollment in social security so when we were at 2008 we had about 41 million folks who were in social security today i believe now we have crossed 50 million so 20082015 this is the reality of how quickly that slope and it is the what it is the baby boomers remember we have about 76 million of our brothers and sisters who turn 65 in about an 18year period the first one the first baby boomer crossed that threshold i believe in late 2008 so we are in that demographic inflection you are going to start to see more and more of this reflected in our economic growth in the debt and the movement of your federal government resources into retirement programs for those who are over 65 whether it be medical whether it be indigent medical whether it be social security and others it is our commitment we have made these promises we have also made a promise that we need to find some way to pay for them and that is where this discussion hopefully is going to take us this slide is a bit more of a concern we are doing a project in our office right now we have a little a couple of folks set aside in our office called the idea shop and they try to do sort of detailed research outside the daytoday chaos that is being a member of congress it is really the bottom point here that i want to pop out at you and that is the number of our brothers and sisters the number of our fellow americans that are 5564 so they are heading towards retirement nineteen percent of them have no retirement savings at all so they are solely dependent on social security and the medical benefits that they will receive from medicare if we bounce up one 25 percent of those older than 45 have functionally no money set aside now i accept we have just come through a pretty rough economic cycle but the last couple of years it is getting better it is still not great but this is a point where we are starting to step up and understand we need a revolution in this countrys tax code we need a revolution in how we regulate in this country we all walk around with these supercomputers in our pocket information is ultimately the greatest regulator in a society and yet we still try and design these commandandcontrol functions of bureaucracies like it was the 1930s we are also going to do a little talking about embracing the new economy the hyperefficient economy that will hopefully maximize economic growth but everything whether it be from immigration to tax code to regulatory codes everything now the first words out of that politicians that policymakers that researchers and you as the constituents mouth needs to be how does this maximize economic growth for the country because i want to keep my commitment to the young and our commitments to seniors when you look at the numbers it does not happen unless we can get this economic expansion some economic growth really working so as we go through these slidesthe other thing is also for someone that is also really interested in these we try to put these up on our social media but these are some of the different projects we are working on now on this one this is just to sort of understand one more timeand i know i am repeating myself with the different slides but we did a budget deal about what 2 months ago social security disability was going broke social security disability in early mid2016 was functionally the trust fund for that was going to be gone so the solution that congress supportedi voted no but that is because we thought we had a more elegant solution functionally the political will was not there for the types of reforms we thought were appropriate they reached in and took 114 billion out of the big social security trust fund and moved it over here to the social security disability fund to shore it up okay that was their solution but there was almost no discussion around this body that it shortened the life of social security by about another year so when you take a lookthe reason we are showing these istake a look at this middle one if you were to exclude the interestnow understand the revenues for social security come from really two pots the taxes and then the money it has loaned to the government back to the general fund so the federal governmenti know it is just an accounting gimmick back and forth because we are paying ourselves interest but that is what we do we pay ourselves interest and that is considered one of the revenue sources for social security so if you were to take taxes and interest but if you were to look at that midline and say instead of the sort of bookkeeping entry we do back and forth no interest just the revenues from taxes on fica social security it went negative in 2010 so more money was going out to beneficiaries than what has been coming in in taxes but if you actually put both the interest and the tax stream it goes negative no longer in 2022 it goes negative now in 2021 so if i had a big marker i would walk over there and cross that out of course i would also knock over the board in doing it so functionally 5 years 60 months from now social security goes negative this is no longer that theoretical discussion we were having saying sometime off in the future sometime in 2027 sometime in 2040 it is 5 years it is less than one unitedstates senatorial term that social security goes negative how much discussion do you see in the political class in the researcher class the policy class and in our communities saying we need to deal with this today because every day we wait it becomes more difficult if we look at the history of the last couple of decades when those of us who care about this deeply have gotten behind microphones and started to point out the numbers we see the television ad the next campaign whether it be pushing paul ryan or a lookalike off of a cliff and saying that paul ryan wants to try to reform your entitlements becausethe fact of the matter is medicare is going bankrupt he wants to save the system but if we can scare you to death it becomes a great political issue i also believe the voters are way ahead of the political class in understanding we need to step up and do hard things to fix these i also want to make the argument that these are the biggest issues in front of us because if we dont do it then everything in the future is going to be how do we survive the promises we have made in our entitlements and it is coming fast remember social security goes negative in about 60 months that is how fast it is coming at us this was just to sort of reemphasize the factdo you see that little red area that is what we did in the budget deal a couple months ago we grabbed that 114 billion and pulled it out of social security because of that we shortened the life we tried to do this without knocking them over this was just another variation of the same set of numbers so now you know the reality we have some on medicare but when you start to see some of the charts we have charts that say that if there is not a substantial economic expansion medicare could be 7 years and the trust fund is substantially drained remember these are supposed to be freestanding trust funds the way the law works is you start to cut benefits we need to avoid these so how do you do it how do you avoid these the first argument i want to make is it is next year when we start to discuss tax reform a tax reform that maximizes economic growth maybe not the benefit for the group you belong to or the industry you are in but the tax reform that benefits the entire country to maximize economic growth i am also asking for a revolution in the way we look at the regulatory state there are a few people who have written about this there are a few people who have thought about this for a couple of years i sat on the science space and technology committee we would have debates back and forth with the epa on how did you get to this regulation how did you find this out they would say we are not going to give you our data sets it is proprietary we are just doing the command and control i learned there is this intense frustration there is this fight out there between i believe people who make money off the regulatory state and those who functionally pay for it which is all of us the fact of the matter is the crowdsourcing of information and data are we actually doing the most efficient methodology to have clean water and the most efficient technology to have clean air how about in my financial world i sit on the financial services committee this is going to get a little geeky but in 2008 the bonds that were backed by mortgages blew up all of a sudden we found out there were lots and lots and lots of mortgages and deeds of trust rolled into these bonds that stopped performing there were lots of debates and discussions of these were toxic loans they were alta that were put into these bonds whatever the reason how did we not know so we set up a financial system that bundled these mortgages into bonds are you telling me that from the regulatory state if we had designed an informationbased regulatory system where those of uswhen i was maricopa county treasurer and you were looking at buying debt to park the cash you had so you would get a rate of return for your taxpayers you would pick up the phone and call moodys or call s p or call the rating and say hey is this a safe bond is this a rated is it aaa or whatever it is you would get a phone call back they would say yes it is fine that was your due diligence how about a system that uses information so the information flows saying hey the bond you are looking at you now have 5 percent of the loans on it that arent making their payments hey do you realize this bond has an intense geographic concentration so if something happens in that geography you are going to have ever greater difficulties all of a sudden the regulators that are built into the system come in and bayonet the wounded after the war is lost sorry that was one of my fathers favorite sayings but the fact of the matter is the way we do much of our regulation is after the sins have happened instead of using information to avoid the mistake in the beginning so i am making the argument that that type of revolutionary thinking in the way we as a society regulate will maximize economic growth on immigration you need to change this immigration system when you realize that twothirds of the immigration population is familialand i know this sets peoples hair on fire but if you are going to take in 1 million 1 2 million legal immigrants into the country this year you do realize twothirds of that population functionally gets to come to the united states because of a family member where much of the rest of the world whether it be australia new zealand great britain canada have moved to a system that maximizes talent because they figured out they desperately need economic growth to keep their commitments but there is a fourth one that is almost never talked about and i can actually start to see here in congress and i see it in our state legislatures and that is actually the new economy i promise sometime when we get back in january we are going to do a presentation of how the new economy can both change how the government functions but also if we can get out of its way it provides opportunity for everyone and hopefully maybe some escape velocity economically so let me throw you first just a simple concept how many of you out there have ever ridden in a ride share or seen these things they call like zipcar where you hit the button on your phone and you are able to just use a car why doesnt government do that i think we saw some data that there are 176 000 cars that are either owned or leased by the federal government we found one small agency that had more vehicles than employees so if i came to you right now and said lets rethink this does this agency here belong owning their own little vehicle fleet and this agency that is right next door belong owning theirs why wouldnt you pool them together and create a simple app that does two things it says the cars belong to everyone in the agency you hit the button and say i need to use one today and tomorrow i dont need one and oh by the way the technology says that i am going to this community and it tells you who else from the bureaucracy is also going in the same direction it is already happening in the private sector now think of it even more expansive why is it just the federal government why wouldnt it be your state your local your tribal another example we are working on right now in arizona and we are actually working on with some of my state legislators is this concept for capital assets i live in maricopa county it is maybe the third or fourth most populous county in the country it is made up of 30some cities and tribal communities how many of those communities own the really expensive earthmovers how many of those earthmovers are used to their max every single day if they are not why isnt a simple app created to share so do this tribal community this city this county and this government each need to own their own why arent they put on sharing platforms the concept is real simple capital assets need to be maximized it is like the concept of a classroom at 3 45 when school is out does that classroom become the community college at 7 30 does it become the senior learning class it is a building we are paying to heat and cool it it is there we spent the capital money how do you maximize the utilization of capital assets this is happening in the private world much of this technology is coming out of silicon valley and other hubs of innovation in our country we need to open ourselves up in the government and say we need to be embracing this technology to move it to ourselves in the last half of this i see fights starting to break out on the new technology and how it changes how we work it changes our optionality we need to understand that technology is changing our society but if we can get out of the way it can actually really provide us some opportunities so there are crazy thoughts we are researching these lets say you are one of these drivers whether it be an uber platform or something else and there is this argument saying well you are being treated as a selfemployed 1099 or you are getting direct payments electronically or you are doing airbnb or these sorts of things how is that going to help you fund your social security maybe we need to rethink it maybe it really is time to have that honest conversation of should you be allowed to have that account that is truly yours and set up your technology that every time you have a client and you take them and deliver them to a location every time you have guests in your airbnb every time you provide a certain service you can use that technology so that a little bit of that money goes to your retirement account we have the technology it would be a very lowcost way to do it and we start to engage in the technology revolution that is happening around us to basically embrace it not be scared of it and at the same time use that technology to shore up what we have just talked about the devastating actuarial math we are running into i know there is a political battle coming in this because for some of my brothers and sisters on the other side it is very much how do i unionize that population how do i do this type of control how do i have this for many of those on the more free market side we are making the argument for individuals to be able to use technology and the new economy to pursue their optionality maximizing the value of their time they need to be allowed to do that we are americans being free is part of the basicit is supposed to be part of our dna at the same time use that same creativity that same optionality to not be afraid of it but to use that technology to actually grow the economy and embrace the empowerment of individuals to deal with the very problems we were showing on those slides i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "chairman graves thank you for yielding the time and thank you for the great work this is the first bill that chairman graves has brought to the floor of the house he is the newest cardinal that we have one of the 12 subcommittee chairmenthey are called cardinalsand this is his first bill i want to congratulate him and ranking member wasserman schultz for putting together what i think is a pretty high standard for fiscal responsibility for the house freezing funding at last years level 3 3 billion that is the third year in a row that we have frozen the budget of the house of representatives making good on our promise to rein in spending and do more with less this level maintains the 14 percent reduction in house funding that began when republicans took control of the house 4 years ago in addition we have continued the freeze on member pay that has been in place since 2010 we believe that in order for us to ask others to sacrifice throughout the government that we have to sacrifice ourselves first and that is what this bill does the bill includes numerous provisions designed to guarantee that the house and its support agencies are spending their tax dollars appropriately and to keep them accountable to the taxpayers this includes enhancing oversight of the cannon building restoration project and making sure that congress approves any largescale construction project these steps will help ensure that this type of major undertaking stays on time and on budget and are especially important given the historical significance of our buildings and the importance of their use the 3 3 billion this bill provides for the house is directed to support the most important functions of our legislative branch keeping our member and committee offices open for business protecting the safety of those who work in and visit the capitol complex and improving the way we support our agenciesand the importance of doing just that for instance the capitol police budget has been increased by 21 million to ensure our men in blue have the resources needed to protect this hallowed building and its grounds and where we have seen issues in the agencies funded by the billfor example it infrastructure challenges at the library of congresswe have taken the steps to make sure that these will be fixed moving forward again i want to thank chairman graves ranking member wasserman schultz and this great staff that has worked hard on this bill they have demonstrated their love of this institution and these grounds by the hard work and devotion they have put into making this bill possible so we want to thank the staff on both sides of the aisle for putting together this small but mighty bill so i thank them for all of their work i am proud that the house can lead by example when it comes to restoring fiscal discipline to the operations of the federal government this bill will allow the house to fulfill its core duties within a responsible realistic budget and preserve the democracy that makes this nation so great i thank the chairman for the time"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "chairman smith thank you so much for your

vital information when a sex offender is traveling to america it attacks the sickening practice of child sex tourism by requiring the united states to notify other countries when convicted pedophiles travel abroad it encourages president obama to use bilateral agreements and assistance to establish reciprocal notification so that we will know when convicted child offenders are coming here
