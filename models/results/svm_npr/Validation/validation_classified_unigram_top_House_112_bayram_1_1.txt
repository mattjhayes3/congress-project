defense has taken no steps to award combat benefits to the casualties or even officially recognize the attack as a terrorist incident the house and senate have included two reform measures in the ndaa which we just passed while additional attacks have been attempted by similar highprofile radical islamic terrorists it is past time for the government to deliver on this act here we are almost 3 years later and theres been a recent report that has come out and in that report it references this incident of this slaughter of american troops on fort hood soil in texas it references that it shall be taken up as part of workplace violence the obama regime calls the fort hood shooting workplace violence sure its workplace violence its where they work and its violence but we have a concept of what workplace violence is and your normal workplace violence is not preceded by a shout by the shooter god is great in the arabic language its not preceded by discussions by the alleged perpetrator its alleged because he hasnt been convicted yet and we in a free american world take the position that all are innocent until proven guilty so we will call him the alleged shooter but theres clear evidence in reports by the defense department and by reports by the news media reports by witnesses on the scene reports by his fellow soldiers reports by folks from walter reed hospital where this americantrained militarytrained doctor worked that he had advocated that the american soldier was wrong and that he was contrary and he spoke and preached islamic terrorism so your normal workplace violence thats not a part of the factor yet this is what happened in this case senator collins on wednesday blasted the defense department and bless her for it for classifying the fort hood massacre as workplace violence and suggested political correctness is being placed above the security of the nations armed forces at home ive been talking about this now since the day after this happened we cant have a world where political correctness fails to define the criminal act by its very nature whether were talking about military law and the criminal relations in military law were just talking about criminal acts in general we have to be able to define them just to make the system work we have to be able to define them but more importantly we owe a duty and a responsibility to the american soldier to call an event what it is and not try to put a smokescreen over it or cloud the issue or in any way worry about the feelings of groups because the definition is the definition this man identified himself that he was committing this act in the name of god is great in arabic he acknowledged when questioned that it was part of his mission he acknowledged that he had dealt with terrorist spokesmen in the past and that the concept came from his interaction with awlaki and others so this guy is an islamic terrorist theres no other way you can describe this gentleman but now years after the event as he sits in the bell county jail in belton texas we continue to have reports coming down from our defense department that the folks that are responsible for our soldiers and responsible for those who died in this incident want to downplay this to be treated as an incident of workplace violence with all the white bread connotation that that has to me we ought to be ashamed of ourselves so lets look at some of the evidence we have that connects this to islamic terrorism recognizing the november 5 2009 attack on fort hood texas as an act of radical islamic terrorism and jihad anwar awlaki connection now mr awlaki is no longer with us we have taken that boy out yet the bottom line is at the time this happened they were directly connected this man preached taught and encouraged violenceislamic terrorist violence hasans presentations to the dod on jihad justification he would argue with his fellow soldiers about the justification for having jihad against the american military mr hasan was a member of the united states army he was a major he had been serving in the medical corps as a psychiatrist he was trained with american taxpayer dollars but he was preaching jihad to soldiers and there was lots of evidence i had a bill which was included in this recent defense bill that we just passed it said that this guy was telling people that hed believed in this kind of thing since medical school now hes a major serving as a psychiatrist advising our soldiers hasan purchased and practiced with highcapacity firearms prior to the attack he went out and he bought firearms he bought them at a local gun store of the guns that were used in the killings one of them was a semiautomatic weapon with a large magazine capacity he went out to the firing range and familiarized himself with these weapons prior to this incident you cant think of this as some guy who goes postal all of a sudden this guy was planning this whole event he shouts god is great in arabic before he starts shooting but they refer to it in the context of the broader threat of workplace violence i think there is a very good argument that the evidence shows this was a premeditated act on the part of major hasan and i believe when this case finally gets to trial that the evidence will be overwhelming that it was premeditated at the time of the event lieutenant general cone the iii corps commander at fort hood told nbcs today show on the friday after the shooting that the soldiers who witnessed the shooting rampage that left 13 people dead reported that the gunman shouted allahu akbar which means god is great before opening fire at the texas post the day after it was being reported that he did this yet in the initial report that came out from the defense department the mans name didnt even appear the relationship to any islamic terrorism was not referenced it was like any major from any outfit just wandered in and started shooting soldiers like he was having a bad day or something now we get another comment saying that were going to treat this in the bigger scope of workplace violence certainly we want to prevent workplace violence in every workplace but the connotation is that this is just something that happened its not something that just happened because quite honestly since that time others have been caught who reportedly were trying to imitate this shooter mr hasan we introduced a bill the fort hood families benefits protection act it would award both military and civilian casualties of the ford hood attack with combat status to ensure full benefits and eligibility for the purple heart and other awards and for the civilian award equivalence to the secretary of defenses defense of freedom medal now why did i ask for that because there was a precedent for it when they flew the plane into the pentagon on 9 11 this is what was the finding of the department of defensethat it was an act of terrorism and therefore they should be treated as combat casualties and those two medals were awarded this didnt just come off the top of my head this is what happened with the first terrorist attack in our country and with the second or third or whatever attack this one was when this man walked into that room there were people in civilian garb and there were people in uniform he went out of his way to shoot the people in uniform the civilians who were injured were injured because of misfire or misdirection as he walked down that line his target was all of those soldiers who were doing nothing more than either coming back from being off post and out of the countryor wherever theyd beenor preparing for their next duty stations wherever they may be goingiraq or afghanistan they were being processed and they were in this big room he walked down the line shooting everybody in uniform now when youre killing our combat soldiers and when youre crying out slogans of the jihad terrorists why wouldnt you think its a terrorist attack and why shouldnt these people who died in the line of duty be treated like those at the pentagon who died in the line of duty in fact except for what we were able to put together in circumstantial evidence after the fact at the time of the incident we had no idea who flew that plane into the pentagon we just made an educated guess in this case before this shooting started the guy identified himself and what his mission was for some reason in this world of political correctness someone has the idea that this is good for the morale of our military soldiers or that its good for something as i think the chief of staff said when this happened oh this is sure going to hurt our islamic outreach program whether its good for that or not i hold nothing against the islamic people nor does anybody at fort hood but we hold a lot against islamic terrorists who kill soldiers and the department of defense should have the guts to step up and to stand up for these soldiers i see my good

those repeal requests at the opening of business that same day because it was after midnight when obamacare passed it was on that time the strategy that i put together then was that we would file a repeal bill seek the maximum number of cosponsors to repeal obamacare and then move forward with the discharge petition to seek to get 218 signatures on that so that thenspeaker pelosi couldnt block the repeal from coming to the floor we followed through on all of that to the point where we peaked out at 178 signatures on the discharge petition that could have circumvented the speaker seeking to block the repeal of obamacare that discharge petition was one of the tools that was useful in winning the majority on november 2 of this past year and there are members here that openly say they wouldnt be here if they didnt have the discharge petition to point to their opponent and say sign the discharge petition if youre serious if youre against obamacare heres the vehicle to repeal it sign it a number of those who did not and would not were voted out of office and we have a new freshman class here that is 96 strong 87 of them are republicans and i know of none of the 87 that did not run on the repeal of obamacare i dont have confirmation but i believe that every one of the freshmen republicans the 87 ran at least in part if not centrally on working to repeal obamacare after winning the majority so we could actually bring legislation to repeal obamacare the next phase was to bring a repeal bill here to the floor of the house i wanted it to be h r 1 it turned out to be h r 2 i dont know what h r 1 is yet but im very very happy that the leadership took that high a priority to hold a vote here in the house to repeal obamacare so early in the first session of the 112th congress we saw a vote here that was bipartisan and it was unanimous among republicans to repeal obamacare that is a very sound a ringing sound rejection of obamacare by the american people as a result of the election of november 2 by the people they sent here 87 new freshmen republican many of them very very solid then after h r 2 passed the house with unanimous republican support and bipartisan support it went over to the senate where they said it could never pass over here and its a symbolic vote well the republican leader mitch mcconnell did force a vote on the repeal of obamacare it would have taken 60 votes to break the filibuster under those rules well every republican in the united states senate voted to repeal obamacare so we are in this situation today where if you look in the house and in the senate with far larger republican numbers than we have had in past years every republican in the house and the senate has voted to repeal obamacare every single one they are serious and they want to get the job done and their constituents insist that we get the job done as well so now that we have taken this position that we are all of us for repealing obamacare and consistent with two thirds of the american people if we voted to repeal it it would be completely inconsistent for us to vote then to turn around and fund obamacare well if the cr has language in it that allows for funding of obamacare then a vote in support of the continuing resolution is a vote that funds the very thing that we voted to repeal which would be inconsistent and i do not believe that we will have inconsistent members here in the house of representatives i think they voted to repeal obamacare i think they are happy to vote to cut off the funding to obamacare and i believe that we will have universal support for that among our conference and i believe the senate if they have an opportunity for the vote would do the same thing down party lines perhaps but they would do the same thing but herein is the difficulty and its this that the funding that might otherwise be in this continuing resolution or may perhaps actually come out tomorrow in it is not very large in comparison to the overall cost the chairman of the budget committee has said that the spending under obamacare is 2 6 trillion 2 6 trillion now there are taxes enacted by it and we know how the cbo scored the information that they were given but 2 6 trillion in spending would be shut off if we repealed obamacare today we have voted to do so in the house the senate wasnt successful the president likely would veto it is his signature bill it is his identity he is the one that called it obamacare at the blair house february 25 and now its in our dictionary my spell check spells it out for me obamacare but in any case the 1 billion or so that might be cut out of obamacare in the cr if we say none of the funds that are written into this bill can be used to implement or enforce obamacare that 1 billion pales by comparison to the funds that are automatically appropriated that are written into the obamacare bill itself and it is an unusual practice to have that happen when you have a large authorization bill like obamacare come through generally it authorizes the appropriations they are authorized to be appropriated under this section x many dollars to go to implement or enforce the various provisions of obamacare thats where the money is and the real money thats up in that thats automatically appropriated obamacare anticipates and authorizes trillions of dollars to be appropriated to fund it and it authorizes the collection of i believe trillions of dollars in fees and taxes to fund it over time but the automatic appropriations that are unusual but written into obamacare that a lot of people didnt know was in there when it was voted on they will automatically appropriate a number that approaches or exceeds 100 billion in automatic appropriations we are crunching these numbers now and i have to qualify these numbers our low number is down around 65 3 billion our upper number is up around 107 billion crs doesnt have a number cbo doesnt have a number apparently nobody has pressed them to produce the numbers of the automatic appropriations in obamacare in all this time so we are taking this apart and putting it back together and thats why the range is its my shop doing the math on this range 65 3 billion on the low side 107 billion on the high side lets just call it around 100 billion for round figures we could come here on the floor next week and debate a cr and we could see an amendment come thats in order that would cut off all funding in the cr that would be used to fund obamacare if we do that we are cutting off about 1 2 billion in spending if we bring an amendment that shuts off all the funding thats automatically appropriated in obamacare and if we are successful we shut off maybe 100 billion that would be used to implement and enforce obamacare one billion versus 100 billion a 1 percent solution versus a 100 percent solution and if we dont use the 100 percent solution then 100 billion as much as or perhaps more will be aggressively used by the obama administration to implement and enforce obamacare and if they do that the cancerous tumor thats growing because of what it does to our liberty and our freedom sends its roots down deeper and it gets bigger and stronger and harder to eradicate that is part of the strategy so i am hopeful that leadership and the chairman of the appropriations committee will get together and sometime tonight as they put the finishing touches on the cr legislation that they say will come out tomorrow that they will write into the bill the language that i have proposed and since we deal with 2 500 page bills here in the house and we are chastised if we dont read and understand every word of them i have an amendment here that i can read every word of and perhaps it could be understood by everyone in america this is the amendment that shuts off the automatic appropriations to obamacare it is this and i quote notwithstanding any other provision of law none of the funds made available in this act or any previous or subsequent act may be used to carry out the provisions of public law 111148 public law 111152 or any amendment made by either such public law thats the amendment that shuts off not just the funding in the cr to obamacare but it shuts off the selfenacting automatic appropriations that were i believe inappropriately written into the obamacare bill and the reconciliation package that came over from the senate as part of their deal that is why i gave you two bill numbers instead of one but they encompass what we commonly refer to as obamacare that is the amendment that needs to be made in order here on the floor that allows the house to work its will that allows the house to work within order under the rules and by the way regular order is holding committee meetings holding hearings holding subcommittee markups and subcommittee appropriations chairman rehberg would be seated at one of those markups i would think and that would be useful a full appropriations committee markup at all of those stops there would be an opportunity to introduce this language in committee and then succeed i believe in dealing with a parliamentary challenge or if its written into the base bill certainly there would be no parliamentary challenge and if this goes out of the appropriations committee up to the rules committee and doesnt have my language in it at that point the rules committee can protect this language from a point of order but if i bring this language to the floor under an appropriations bill i know that i am facing a parliamentary challenge to this language and it will be hard for the house to work its will if we get to the point where we have a parliamentary challenge on a piece of language that mirrors the will of the american people mirrors the wishes of the american people and mirrors the will and wishes of the members of congress the majority of the members of congress and mirrors the will and the wishes and the votes of 100 percent of the republicans in the united states house and the united states senate and is bipartisan at least in the house that is the endeavor that we need to be successful with and i am very determined to have this kind of debate and find a way to have this vote if we are blocked from a vote that is essential to work the will of the house how then can we say how then can we say that the house has worked its will if the house has been denied an opportunity to work its will i know there are arguments on both sides but i would point out that the language that i have read into the record is not a precedent it doesnt stretch the rules or the history or the traditions of this house it doesnt stretch any written rule that i know of and it is this there is ample precedent ample precedent in the form of the appropriations bills that were used to shut off the funding for the vietnam war now i disagreed with the decision back then i remember reading about it in the news in 1973 and 1974

united states currently has means there is nothing for lenders to worry about it lets investors know how likely a borrower can pay back a loan and that they will receive a good return on their investment thats why i cant emphasize enough the importance of our nations credit rating a downgraded credit rating would erode confidence in our economy and reduce certainty for businesses investors at home and abroad we must work to ensure that this never happens by reforming spending and fixing our debt problem make it so that there is not one doubt when it comes to the creditworthiness of the united states in april standard poors lowered the outlook on the united states credit to negative s ps rationale the unitedstates has a large debt and deficit compared with other highly rated nations and unlike with those other nations the path to addressing the debt and the deficit is not clear to us to be clear this warning from the s p was not over the debt limit debate but because washington has no plan to tackle its massive debt since 1975 there have been at least nine examples when clean debt limit bills have failed to pass in either the house or the senate and remember in 2006 thenunitedstates senator obama voted against a clean increase of 781 billion in each case days weeks or months later a debt limit was ultimately enacted so again its not about the debate weve seen this discussion many times over the last several decades but it is about world markets losing confidence in our ability to implement those needed reforms and address our growing 14 trillion debt over the past 2 years we have seen the largest budget deficits in the history of the united states this along with our structural deficits due to insolvent entitlement programs and the rising cost of health care is the reason we face serious issues regarding the confidence in our ability to make good on our commitments in april the united states kept its aaa rating unfortunately as s p warned if we fail to act on these reforms this could happen raising the debt ceiling without significant structural spending reforms would send a signal to the world that america lacks the political will to restore fiscal sanity and meet our obligations unfortunately many of our democratic colleagues have continued to ask for a clean upordown vote on raising the debt limit including most recently when more than 100 democrats sent a letter to house leadership requesting an upordown vote on the issue earlier this week that request was granted and the legislations failure demonstrates that any plan to raise the debt limit without dramatic steps to reduce spending and reform the budget process is unacceptable to the american people with any hope we sent a clear message that its time to stop with the political pandering and get serious about bringing about real budgetary reforms its unfortunate however the problem has been identified while tough decisions must be made the solution is in our reach

ever thoughti certainly wouldnt i know i have got some democratic friends who would have thought it but i wouldntbut when we got a republican president and we had republican majorities in the house and senate we began to spend again there wasnt the friction there to hold spending down and republicans i would submit lost their way and began spending too much money my first year in congress in 2005 and 2006 we shouldnt have spent the money we did and i can recall being here on the floor and having democratic friends beating us up rightfully so because in 2006 we spent 160 billion more than we had coming in we didnt have to do that we shouldnt have done that i would never have dreamed that 5 short years later that with the democratic majority the spending would have exploded once they had no friction between a democratic president and a democratic congress and that we would go from the 160 billion in deficit spending in 2006 that republicans got beat up for to 1 6 trillion in deficit spending10 times moreand people still thinking thats somehow okay it wasnt okay for republicans to overspend by 160 billion and its not okay for this democratic senate and president to continue to push to spend 1 6 trillion more than the 2 2 trillion we supposedly will have coming in now were told today were going to have a vote on a republican bill a little surprising to some of us republicans we passed a bill cut cap and balance it wasnt what i wanted i liked the balanced budget amendment with a percentage of gdp cap on spending to help rein congress in and that was negotiable on the percentage but it also had 111 billion out of 1 6 trillion that would have been cut from spending that just wasnt enough but the balanced budget amendment if it had been passed and become part of the law was enough of a game changer it was worth voting for then the senate sits back and says were not going to go for that were not going to pass anything so pass something else and now our leadership has heard the call of leader reid down the hall and is going to bring another bill and i know the intentions of both sides of the aisle want the best for the country i get that i understand that we have different ideas on how that can be done and i know that there are people in my party that want to keep beating up on me because i cant vote for a bill that only cuts 1 trillion out of 15 trillion to 16 trillion that will be deficit spending over the next 10 years because its easy to do the math we cut 1 trillion out of 15 trillion 16 trillion over the next 10 years and if we can keep doing that and there are no assurances we can every 10 years cut another trillion then when i have my 207th birthday we can celebrate that year a balanced budget and we will have only added 120 trillion to the 14 3 trillion deficit now i cant vote for that politically were told this is the political thing to do youve got to do the political thing if you dont vote for the boehner bill youre voting for obama thats not true if the senate will pass anythinganythingthen we could drive this to a conference committee and get a compromise the senate has to pass something well think about this scenario very quickly we pass this say hypothetically the senate says oh well you pushed us to the edge of the cliff we didnt want to vote for this then they pass it just like we did and the president says i was going to veto but were on the edge of the cliff a 100 percent republican bill they wouldnt compromise and now they say well gee republicans inherited the economy its not right practically its not right politically lets do the right thing for america"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "the amendment that i was thinking i was going to offer and actually we cant is on the energy independence and security act of 2007 its an interesting topic because were going back again once more to the subject of mercury but really were going to a more basic subject than mercury and that is the subject of freedom because this energy independence and security act of 2007 is a de facto ban on the plain old lightbulb that americans have known a long time its the incandescent bulb and this de facto ban essentially says that all the new lightbulbs have to be these mercury vapor fluorescent lightbulbs and so the question that comes to my mind is aside from the benefits of one type of lightbulb over anotherand you could argue the benefits the mercury vapor lightbulb is a little more expensive but it saves energy but the incandescent lightbulb burns more energy but it doesnt have any mercury youre bringing into your living room but the point though is dont we trust our constituents to pick the kind of lightbulb that they want im just wondering if theres anybody in this chamber who wants to stand up and vote and say im going to tell my constituents what kind of lightbulb they ought to buy i mean lightbulbs are used in a lot of different contexts a lot of different situations and if people want one of those mercury vapor bulbs thats got good efficiency fine let them buy one but dont tell them they cant buy another kind of bulb that may meet their circumstances and i think thats the kind of arrogance that the public is really fed up with out of congress is when we have this arrogant attitude that were going to tell people even what kind of lightbulb to buy and so what my amendment was going to do was of course to strike this piece of legislation technically we cant do that on this appropriations bill so we have to wait for a different venue in order to do it but i would conclude

unconstitutional war in libya the united states has been at war against libya for nearly 4 months we have dropped bombs on libyan buildings we have flown sorties over libyan airspace it has been reported that we have even targeted qadhafi himself we are at war the constitution vests congress with the exclusive power to declare war the president has not attempted to obtain congresss authorization for the war and yet at this moment as we debate on the house floor the war continues instead of following the constitution and seeking authorization the president made strained arguments to justify the continued operation at first the operation was supposed to be limited as though that undefined term serves as a constitutional escape clause my constituents certainly would be surprised if congress established a limited religion or subjected them to limited cruel and unusual punishment or quartered soldiers in their houses but only for a limited time after that limited argument ran its course the president turned to a u n security council resolution and an invitation from an organization of arab states to justify our involvement those organizations were not around at the time the constitution was written much less are they listed in its text the administration now has retreated from its constitutional arguments in public and claims that at least the war powers resolution does not forbid the strikes because were not involved in quote hostilities against libya imagine that the shoe were on the other foot that libya was bombing us would we view the libyan air forces bombing of our infrastructure as a hostile act of course we would last week a member of the other chamber called the presidents arguments quote cute i would use a different term embarrassing its embarrassing that the administration attempts to hide behind these transparently strained and flimsy arguments especially when were dealing with such a grave issue but do you know what would be more embarrassing if this congress did nothing more embarrassing than the presidents contortions of the law and disregard for the constitution would be if congress with full knowledge that it was occurring gave him a pass in the face of an attack on the constitution in the face of an attack on this institution and our powers as a coequal branch we must stand up and say stop if we dont we should be the ones who are embarrassed the amashkucinich amendment prohibits funds from being used for military force against libya to be clear i believe that congress doesnt need to do anything to stop the president from ordering force against libya because the president has not received authorization the use of force is already illegal however to reinforce our constitutional position our amendment says that beginning at the start of the fiscal year on october 1 the armed forces may not drop bombs on libya or otherwise use military force unlike the bill we considered the week before last our amendment does not implicitly authorize any actions against libya it simply says force may not be used because the president has not sought nor has he received authorization for force please vote yes

minnesota and the state of wisconsin can build this commonsense bridge at their own expense and thats the point that were at not only will representative mccollum be acting against the wishes of 86 percent of the people that live and reside in the st croix river valley the responsibility for the increased costs of building this bridge rests squarely on the shoulders of representative mccollum and on her compatriots who have fought for decades to kill the building of this bridge the cost the bridge would have cost 80 million to complete back in 1992 if her compatriots wouldnt have tied this bridge project up for decades in the federal courts in nuisance lawsuits and why because they said there was pollution that was involved and what was this pollution that they asserted they said it would be visual pollution visual pollution because a federal bureaucrat came out to this river and pointed to the river and said that they didnt think that a bridge would look good built on this river

have been in the state of minnesota stillwater is the birthplace ive been working on this issue as a young mother living in this community as an activist citizen who saw what a commonsense project this is representative mccollum has talked about this being a megabridge this is a fourlane bridge and after all why wouldnt you build a fourlane bridge when you have a fourlane highway on minnesota connected to a fourlane highway in wisconsin representative mccollum is suggesting that we should be building a two or a threelane bridge why would you build a bridge that would be obsolete the day that its opened you would build a commonsense fourlane bridge to connect two fourlane highways this is also a center for industry in this region we have not only the prison the state prison we have also one of the largest window manufacturers in the world we have the sewer treatment plant the water treatment plant and we have a marina this is the place that has been the site thats been selected as the perfect place to build this bridge to connect these two communities as weve heard before this is an area that has a bridge that currently has a safety rating thats far below the safety rating of the bridge that collapsed in minneapolis in 2007 we have a historic opportunity a once inalifetime magic moment when we have governors that are republican and democrat senators that are republican

foursquare agreement with the administration saying lets get this done on behalf of the people of these two states lets do what should have been done decades ago and lets build this commonsense bridge stillwater minnesota is the site of minnesotas birthplace and now its the site of what we are told is the longestrunning unfinished bridge project in the nation in the 1950s discussions began for a replacement to the current 1931 lift bridge connecting minnesota and wisconsin over the st croix river in 1992 we saw progress that year a coalition of residents businesses transportation officials and environmental experts settled on a bridge design to replace the existing lift bridge they proposed a fourlane bridge to connect fourlane highways in both states to be built south of stillwater we are here today for congressional approval for this project to proceed without congressional approval the project will continue to face the government redtape and lawsuits that its seen over the past

these companies we all know the big names of the big titan companies but nearly every week i get a chance to tour one of these small companies that might have five employees that might have 10 employeescompanies that are not yet profitable theyre working on these really innovative and neat technologies that are there to help patients improve their lives and save their lives in fact from 1980 to 2000 the medical technology firms were responsible for a 4 percent increase in unitedstates life expectancy a 16 percent decrease in mortality rates and also an astounding 25 percent decline in elderly disability rates i think as well hear from some of our colleagues particularly from the indiana delegation which is where we were just about a week and a half ago were learning there are some new hurdles on the horizon number one there is a medical device tax that will be imposed in just a little over a year its a 20 billion tax and studies have shown its going to cost the industry about 10 percent of their workforce its about 43 000 jobs that will be at risk in fact i just met with an owner of a company today who mentioned that he believes this excise tax if put in place 1 year from now will cost his company at least 50 highpaying jobs then you have the other issue of just an fda that has become so bureaucratic so unpredictable so inconsistent and so nontransparent that its becoming more difficult for these companies to bring these lifesaving technologies to market to make sure that the patients have access to them i have traveled the countryto california to boston to new york and well have a chance to go to north carolinawhere these pockets of industries in the medical technology field are really strong and vibrant one area in particular was indiana we were there just a little over a week and a half ago and i will tell you of the folks who testified therethe companies and the presence there and the jobs thereit was compelling in fact ill never forget the words from one of the testifiers there at the committee when he mentioned when he gets asked for advice on where to invest on where to start up that his advice to new companies is go to europe go to europe that is the wrong message in this down economy when we are trying to save jobs when we are trying to encourage job creation were encouraging one of our best american success stories one of our few net exporters to move overseas weve got legislation thats actually moving forward now many of these members are coauthors of not only repealing the tax but also of streamlining and modernizing the fda to

were killed and 31 individuals were wounded in a shooting attack at fort hood texas on november 5 2009 since that time the department of defense has taken no steps to award combat benefits to the casualties or even officially recognize the attack as a terrorist incident the house and senate have included two reform measures in the ndaa which we just passed while additional attacks have been attempted by similar highprofile radical islamic terrorists it is past time for the government to deliver on this act here we are almost 3 years later and theres been a recent report that has come out and in that report it references this incident of this slaughter of american troops on fort hood soil in texas it references that it shall be taken up as part of workplace violence the obama regime calls the fort hood shooting workplace violence sure its workplace violence its where they work and its violence but we have a concept of what workplace violence is and your normal workplace violence is not preceded by a shout by the shooter god is great in the arabic language its not preceded by discussions by the alleged perpetrator its alleged because he hasnt been convicted yet and we in a free american world take the position that all are innocent until proven guilty so we will call him the alleged shooter but theres clear evidence in reports by the defense department and by reports by the news media reports by witnesses on the scene reports by his fellow soldiers reports by folks from walter reed hospital where this americantrained militarytrained doctor worked that he had advocated that the american soldier was wrong and that he was contrary and he spoke and preached islamic terrorism so your normal workplace violence thats not a part of the factor yet this is what happened in this case senator collins on wednesday blasted the defense department and bless her for it for classifying the fort hood massacre as workplace violence and suggested political correctness is being placed above the security of the nations armed forces at home ive been talking about this now since the day after this happened we cant have a world where political correctness fails to define the criminal act by its very nature whether were talking about military law and the criminal relations in military law were just talking about criminal acts in general we have to be able to define them just to make the system work we have to be able to define them but more importantly we owe a duty and a responsibility to the american soldier to call an event what it is and not try to put a smokescreen over it or cloud the issue or in any way worry about the feelings of groups because the definition is the definition this man identified himself that he was committing this act in the name of god is great in arabic he acknowledged when questioned that it was part of his mission he acknowledged that he had dealt with terrorist spokesmen in the past and that the concept came from his interaction with awlaki and others so this guy is an islamic terrorist theres no other way you can describe this gentleman but now years after the event as he sits in the bell county jail in belton texas we continue to have reports coming down from our defense department that the folks that are responsible for our soldiers and responsible for those who died in this incident want to downplay this to be treated as an incident of workplace violence with all the white bread connotation that that has to me we ought to be ashamed of ourselves so lets look at some of the evidence we have that connects this to islamic terrorism recognizing the november 5 2009 attack on fort hood texas as an act of radical islamic terrorism and jihad anwar awlaki connection now mr awlaki is no longer with us we have taken that boy out yet the bottom line is at the time this happened they were directly connected this man preached taught and encouraged violenceislamic terrorist violence hasans presentations to the dod on jihad justification he would argue with his fellow soldiers about the justification for having jihad against the american military mr hasan was a member of the united states army he was a major he had been serving in the medical corps as a psychiatrist he was trained with american taxpayer dollars but he was preaching jihad to soldiers and there was lots of evidence i had a bill which was included in this recent defense bill that we just passed it said that this guy was telling people that hed believed in this kind of thing since medical school now hes a major serving as a psychiatrist advising our soldiers hasan purchased and practiced with highcapacity firearms prior to the attack he went out and he bought firearms he bought them at a local gun store of the guns that were used in the killings one of them was a semiautomatic weapon with a large magazine capacity he went out to the firing range and familiarized himself with these weapons prior to this incident you cant think of this as some guy who goes postal all of a sudden this guy was planning this whole event he shouts god is great in arabic before he starts shooting but they refer to it in the context of the broader threat of workplace violence i think there is a very good argument that the evidence shows this was a premeditated act on the part of major hasan and i believe when this case finally gets to trial that the evidence will be overwhelming that it was premeditated at the time of the event lieutenant general cone the iii corps commander at fort hood told nbcs today show on the friday after the shooting that the soldiers who witnessed the shooting rampage that left 13 people dead reported that the gunman shouted allahu akbar which means god is great before opening fire at the texas post the day after it was being reported that he did this yet in the initial report that came out from the defense department the mans name didnt even appear the relationship to any islamic terrorism was not referenced it was like any major from any outfit just wandered in and started shooting soldiers like he was having a bad day or something now we get another comment saying that were going to treat this in the bigger scope of workplace violence certainly we want to prevent workplace violence in every workplace but the connotation is that this is just something that happened its not something that just happened because quite honestly since that time others have been caught who reportedly were trying to imitate this shooter mr hasan we introduced a bill the fort hood families benefits protection act it would award both military and civilian casualties of the ford hood attack with combat status to ensure full benefits and eligibility for the purple heart and other awards and for the civilian award equivalence to the secretary of defenses defense of freedom medal now why did i ask for that because there was a precedent for it when they flew the plane into the pentagon on 9 11 this is what was the finding of the department of defensethat it was an act of terrorism and therefore they should be treated as combat casualties and those two medals were awarded this didnt just come off the top of my head this is what happened with the first terrorist attack in our country and with the second or third or whatever attack this one was when this man walked into that room there were people in civilian garb and there were people in uniform he went out of his way to shoot the people in uniform the civilians who were injured were injured because of misfire or misdirection as he walked down that line his target was all of those soldiers who were doing nothing more than either coming back from being off post and out of the countryor wherever theyd beenor preparing for their next duty stations wherever they may be goingiraq or afghanistan they were being processed and they were in this big room he walked down the line shooting everybody in uniform now when youre killing our combat soldiers and when youre crying out slogans of the jihad terrorists why wouldnt you think its a terrorist attack and why shouldnt these people who died in the line of duty be treated like those at the pentagon who died in the line of duty in fact except for what we were able to put together in circumstantial evidence after the fact at the time of the incident we had no idea who flew that plane into the pentagon we just made an educated guess in this case before this shooting started the guy identified himself and what his mission was for some reason in this world of political correctness someone has the idea that this is good for the morale of our military soldiers or that its good for something as i think the chief of staff said when this happened oh this is sure going to hurt our islamic outreach program whether its good for that or not i hold nothing against the islamic people nor does anybody at fort hood but we hold a lot against

senate where they said it could never pass over here and its a symbolic vote well the republican leader mitch mcconnell did force a vote on the repeal of obamacare it would have taken 60 votes to break the filibuster under those rules well every republican in the united states senate voted to repeal obamacare so we are in this situation today where if you look in the house and in the senate with far larger republican numbers than we have had in past years every republican in the house and the senate has voted to repeal obamacare every single one they are serious and they want to get the job done and their constituents insist that we get the job done as well so now that we have taken this position that we are all of us for repealing obamacare and consistent with two thirds of the american people if we voted to repeal it it would be completely inconsistent for us to vote then to turn around and fund obamacare well if the cr has language in it that allows for funding of obamacare then a vote in support of the continuing resolution is a vote that funds the very thing that we voted to repeal which would be inconsistent and i do not believe that we will have inconsistent members here in the house of representatives i think they voted to repeal obamacare i think they are happy to vote to cut off the funding to obamacare and i believe that we will have universal support for that among our conference and i believe the senate if they have an opportunity for the vote would do the same thing down party lines perhaps but they would do the same thing but herein is the difficulty and its this that the funding that might otherwise be in this continuing resolution or may perhaps actually come out tomorrow in it is not very large in comparison to the overall cost the chairman of the budget committee has said that the spending under obamacare is 2 6 trillion 2 6 trillion now there are taxes enacted by it and we know how the cbo scored the information that they were given but 2 6 trillion in spending would be shut off if we repealed obamacare today we have voted to do so in the house the senate wasnt successful the president likely would veto it is his signature bill it is his identity he is the one that called it obamacare at the blair house february 25 and now its in our dictionary my spell check spells it out for me obamacare but in any case the 1 billion or so that might be cut out of obamacare in the cr if we say none of the funds that are written into this bill can be used to implement or enforce obamacare that 1 billion pales by comparison to the funds that are automatically appropriated that are written into the obamacare bill itself and it is an unusual practice to have that happen when you have a large authorization bill like obamacare come through generally it authorizes the appropriations they are authorized to be appropriated under this section x many dollars to go to implement or enforce the various provisions of obamacare thats where the money is and the real money thats up in that thats automatically appropriated obamacare anticipates and authorizes trillions of dollars to be appropriated to fund it and it authorizes the collection of i believe trillions of dollars in fees and taxes to fund it over time but the automatic appropriations that are unusual but written into obamacare that a lot of people didnt know was in there when it was voted on they will automatically appropriate a number that approaches or exceeds 100 billion in automatic appropriations we are crunching these numbers now and i have to qualify these numbers our low number is down around 65 3 billion our upper number is up around 107 billion crs doesnt have a number cbo doesnt have a number apparently nobody has pressed them to produce the numbers of the automatic appropriations in obamacare in all this time so we are taking this apart and putting it back together and thats why the range is its my shop doing the math on this range 65 3 billion on the low side 107 billion on the high side lets just call it around 100 billion for round figures we could come here on the floor next week and debate a cr and we could see an amendment come thats in order that would cut off all funding in the cr that would be used to fund obamacare if we do that we are cutting off about 1 2 billion in spending if we bring an amendment that shuts off all the funding thats automatically appropriated in obamacare and if we are successful we shut off maybe 100 billion that would be used to implement and enforce obamacare one billion versus 100 billion a 1 percent solution versus a 100 percent solution and if we dont use the 100 percent solution then 100 billion as much as or perhaps more will be aggressively used by the obama administration to implement and enforce obamacare and if they do that the cancerous tumor thats growing because of what it does to our liberty and our freedom sends its roots down deeper and it gets bigger and stronger and harder to eradicate that is part of the strategy so i am hopeful that leadership and the chairman of the appropriations committee will get together and sometime tonight as they put the finishing touches on the cr legislation that they say will come out tomorrow that they will write into the bill the language that i have proposed and since we deal with 2 500 page bills here in the house and we are chastised if we dont read and understand every word of them i have an amendment here that i can read every word of and perhaps it could be understood by everyone in america this is the amendment that shuts off the automatic appropriations to obamacare it is this and i quote notwithstanding any other provision of law none of the funds made available in this act or any previous or subsequent act may be used to carry out the provisions of public law 111148 public law 111152 or any amendment made by either such public law thats the amendment that shuts off not just the funding in the cr to obamacare but it shuts off the selfenacting automatic appropriations that were i believe inappropriately written into the obamacare bill and the reconciliation package that came over from the senate as part of their deal that is why i gave you two bill numbers instead of one but they encompass what we commonly refer to as obamacare that is the amendment that needs to be made in order here on the floor that allows the house to work its will that allows the house to work within order under the rules and by the way regular order is holding committee meetings holding hearings holding subcommittee markups and subcommittee appropriations chairman rehberg would be seated at one of those markups i would think and that would be useful a full appropriations committee markup at all of those stops there would be an opportunity to introduce this language in committee and then succeed i believe in dealing with a parliamentary challenge or if its written into the base bill certainly there would be no parliamentary challenge and if this goes out of the appropriations committee up to the rules committee and doesnt have my language in it at that point the rules committee can protect this language from a point of order but if i bring this language to the floor under an appropriations bill i know that i am facing a parliamentary challenge to this language and it will be hard for the house to work its will if we get to the point where we have a parliamentary challenge on a piece of language that mirrors the will of the american people mirrors the wishes of the american people and mirrors the will and wishes of the members of congress the majority of the members of congress and mirrors the will and the wishes and the votes of 100 percent of the republicans in the united states house and the united states senate and is bipartisan at least in the house that is the endeavor that we need to be successful with and i am very determined to have this kind of debate and find a way to have this vote if we are blocked from a vote that is essential to work the will of the house how then can we say how then can we say that the house has worked its will if the house has been denied an opportunity to work its will i know there are arguments on both sides but i would point out that the language that i have read into the record is not a precedent it doesnt stretch the rules or the history or the traditions of this house it doesnt stretch any written rule that i know of and it is this there is ample precedent ample precedent in the form of the appropriations bills that were used to shut off the funding for the vietnam war now i disagreed with the decision back then i remember reading about it in the news in 1973 and 1974 in fact my recollection says also 1975 but i dont happen to have those notes but i do have the notes to draw from a report by crs out of the con"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "as i traveled across the second
