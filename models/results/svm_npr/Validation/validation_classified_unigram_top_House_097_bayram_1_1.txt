do you disagree with the assessment of roman catholic archbishop rivera of san salvador that the guerrillas are now rejected by a majority of people in el salvador because they tend toward the conquest of power for its own sake third do you agree or disagree with the el salvadoran governments practice of land reform fourth since all of these critics bring up the vietnam tragedy let me ask

federal tax rates on longterm capital gains from 49 to 28 percent as a result of this farsighted action there has been a significant increase in both the number of individual investors and in total equity values unfortunately however despite these positive developments current economic conditions demand that we enact additional tax measures to further stimulate capital format ion and to end the tax bias against savings and investment for this reason i am today introducing the comprehensive savings incentive act of 1981 a bill designed to significantly increase both our savings and productivity rate to expand the number of individual shareholders and to create millions of dollars of equity capital for our financially starving industries in brief the bill is comprised of three major provisions the first provision permanently increases the amount of money an individual may exclude from taxation on dividends and interest earned on savinus accounts from the current limit of 200 400 to 1 000 2 000 for individuals and married couples as my colleagues will recall the 200 400 provision was incorporated within the socalled windfall profits tax bill and is expected to significantly increase our gross national product the rate of private investment productivity and employment i believe that far greater benefits are to be gained by increasing the exclusion amount and by making it a permanent part of our tax code the second provision of this legislation modifies our tax code as it affects individual retirement accounts at present to qualify for an ira an individtual must be earning an income either as a salaried or selfemployed worker and must not be eligible for an organized pension or retirement plan iras are personal taxdeferred retirement plans which allow individuals to put 15 dercent of their yearly incomeup to 1 500into a special interestbearing account while i believe there is merit in reevaluating the eligibility requirements for an ira my bill simply recognizes that because of recurrent doubledigit inflation we must increase the amount of money people are ab le to setaside in an ira for this reason my bill increases the individual limit of 1 500 to 2 500 and correspondingly increases the spousal deduction from 1 750 to 3 000 the third and final provision of this legislation provides for a further rollback in the effective tax rates on capital gains from 28 to 21 percent for individuals and corporations i am convinced that a further reduction in the capital gains rate is overdue and that it can be financed in effect by higher realizations of gains and related tax receipts consisting largely of ordinary income earned by brokers executing sales commissions in fact this finding is consistent with the results of the 1978 reduction which has increased capital gains receipts to the treasury department by some 900 million additionally it is significant to note that a reduction in the capital gains tax from 28 to 21 percent received the enthusiastic support of the senate in its consideration of the revenue act of 1978 at that time the senate finance committee reported that the committee believes that lower capital gains tax will markedly increase sales of appreciated assets which will offset much of the revenue loss from the tax cut and potentially lead to an actual increase in revenues in addition the improved mobility of capital will stimulate investment thereby generating more economic activity and more tax revenue it is my firm belief that this type of antiinflationary individual tax cut compliments the presidents own tax proposal which i fully support and will help produce lasting jobs in the private sector minimize the risk of a new and worse recession result in lower interest rates increased capital investment and productivity and will strengthen the dollar abroad what i am proposing here today is an idea designed to benefit all americans for in this time of economic crisis we must do all thatwe can to increase the amount of available capital capital is the lifeblood of our economy and without it we will continue to experience high interest rates high unemployment astronomical trade imbalances and sagging levels of productivity i believe that if enacted this legislation will unlock important sources of capital and will allow american industries to expand their facilities to create thousands of jobs to more effectively compete abroad and to more efficiently produce those products we depend upon in our daily lives i urge my colleagues to join me inthis bipartisan effort to restore economic vitality to this great nation by cosponsoring the comprehensive savings incentive act of 1981"], [0.0, 0.0, 0, "a couple of weeks ago when we had a bill dealing

the change we made in the reconciliation bill where we prohibited such payments except under certain circumstances this reversal or retreat from action we have already taken in the reconciliation bill should be defeated for basically four reasons the first reason i offer is the fact that this is bad policy a serviceman and an employee in the private sector should be treated equally the same rule should apply to either one in the private sector when an employee leaves voluntarily a place of employment he is not qualified for unemployment compensation benefits yet if section 2405 stays in this bill we are going to treat the serviceman differently than the private employee by allowing him unemployment compensation benefits when he voluntarily leaves the service it is bad policy to create this difference in treatment when we used to have draftees i guess one could rationalize the law being that way on the grounds that we were involuntarily plucking a man or woman out of their employment and putting them in the service of their country and perhaps we should do something for them when they leave we do not have that anymore now we have a voluntary military people go into the

the administrative costs incurred by the united states because of the presence of these fleets the american fisherles promotion act passed in 1980 solved this problem by requiring that foreign fishing fees equal the administrative cost of having foreign fishermen in our zone the american fisheries promotion act solved another problem associated with the foreign fishing fee system the problem was that these fees were being placed in the general treasury and no benefit was being derived by the unitedstates fishing industry the act placed foreign fishing fees in a special fund to be used to assist the unitedstates fishing industry using foreign fishing fees for this purpose is only right because the once healthy and prosperous unitedstates fishing industry had been devastated economically by the predatory practices of foreign fishing fleets many of which were subsidized fish resources which were once abundant were overfished and on the brink of economic collapse when the 200mile act was passed the major part of the blame for this resource disaster must be laid at the feet of foreign fishing fleets which operated with little or no regard for the resource these same fleets which are now regulated by the fcma bear some responsibility to the unitedstates industry for the economic damage inflicted by overfishing the fees paid by these foreign fishermen should be

because of current economic conditions and competition with subsidized foreign fish imports are experiencing significant economic difficulties moneys which were already available in the fisheries loan fund and which were used to assist vessel owners with federally guaranteed loans not only permitted these fishermen to continue their operations and to recover economically but also to avoid defaulting on approximately 21 1 million in governmentguaranteed loans this type of shortterm assistance benefits the government as well as the fishermen and the u s economy it is clear however that

were roughly equal at that time the soviets refused to agree to a freeze they chose instead to pursue an enormous very costly arms buildup in the 1970s over the same period of time the unitedstates

reagan has proposed a strategic modernization effort to redress the deficiencies now that the soviets have had a decade of massive military buildup behind them now that they are ahead frankly in many

the gentleman from new york is buying the brezhnev line sorry to even bring it up but he has suggested that a weapon freeze would be good for his country at this point i think that we must first make sure that our good intentions do not lure this country into a position of inferiority thereby precluding us ultimately from reaching the goal that the gentleman from iowa would like to see which is to reduce armaments and to bring about a more stable nuclear balance in the world i know that there are many in the united states who believe that the soviet union is genuinely interested in fair and equitable arms control agreements we have had about a decade of negotiating with them and frankly as a past congressional representative at the salt talksnot that i am an expert but i have sat in several sessions in genevai have never found a more disingenuous set of negotiators than those from the soviet union we should not gamble away the defense of the united states and the attempt by this country to prevent a nuclear war on the good intentions of the soviet union the gentleman from illinois pointed out that if we were to freeze weapon production now we would end up canceling our mx b1

inquire about prepurchase inspections warn the consumer about oral promises provide the consumer with information on the nature and extent of the warranties offered on the vehicle and prohibit affirmative misrepresentations regarding the condition of the car i beleleve that these provisions would more than adequately address the problems in used car sales which have been identified by the commission during its extensive investigation all of these provisions of the rule are straightforward effective and relatively simple for dealers to comply with generally these provisions would help the consumer to make a more informed decision when he or she is buying a used car unfortunately section 21 dictates that this rule must either be accepted or rejected in its entirety given that limited choice i believe that we must reject the rule by adoption of this concurrent resolution and i am going to explain why the disclosure requirement the socalled defect disclosure requirement of the rule is both ambiguous and ineffective although the provision clearly states that an inspection of the car is not required many of the 52 listed defects which dealers must disclose are such that accurate disclosure could not be made unless an inspection is conducted if the dealer does not inspect the car he will be conveying information about the car to the consumer which is either incorrect or incomplete or both that outcome is clearly of no benefit to consumers it will also expose dealers to litigation for failing to disclose accurate information"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "today i join with many of my fellow colleagues in urging congress to bestow honorary citizenship upon raoul wallenberg mr wallenberg displayed extraordinary heroism in assisting tens of thousands of jews to freedom from nazioccupied hungary late in world war ii i feel it is only fitting and proper to honor this man who sacrificed so much for so many in 1944 wallenberg a swedish diplomat was sent to budapest as a result of requests from the american war refugee board and a representative of the world jewish council his mission was to assist jews to escape from the wholesale slaughter being conducted by adolph hitler his mission and the activities he carried out were both daring and successful the swedish raoul wallenberg association has attributed wallenbergs work to directly saving 20 000 hungarian jews in addition he assisted with the collaboration of others in aiding approximately 100 000 jews to escape unfortunately mr wallenberg would never see the success of his work he would never see the children he helped escape grow to adulthood and he would never receive the thanks of a grateful world unfortunately the yoke of oppression that mr wallenberg helped to lift frcm the hungarian people was only fated to be replaced by another form of oppression mr wallenbergs biography reads like a greek tragedy it is a mixture of triumph and tragedy when soviet forces eventually ended the nazi occupation of hungary in january 1944 one of the first actions they took was to arrest wallenberg for suspicion of spying the charges were unfounded and the act unpardonable instead of being hailed as a hero wallenberg was carted off as a common criminal today a mystery surrounds the fate of raoul wallenberg since his incarceration by the soviets 36 years ago after repeated inquires as to his fate the soviets issued a statement claiming mr wallenberg died of a heart attack in 1974 however former prisoners in the soviet gulag system have claimed to have seen a man resembling mr wallenberg during their confinement in 1975 a russian jew jan kaplan met a swede in the butyrka prison who had been imprisoned for 30 years but still seemed healthy if this man is raoul wallenberg then the soviets are once again heinously guilty of repression and the denial of human rights why will the soviets not reveal the real truth about raoul wallenberg how much longer must we accept the lies and falsehoods offered to us by them hopefully the actions we are taking today as representatives of the people of the united states will help clear up the mystery of raoul wallenberg if he is alive after all these years of unnecessary penal servitude then grant him his freedom so that he can live out the remainder of his years with dignity if he is dead then perhaps the knowledge of his fate will permit his soul to rest in peace regardless of his fate i am both proud and honored to join with my colleagues in asking the congress of the united states to bestow honorary citizenship upon raoul wallenberg"]],

on longterm capital gains from 49 to 28 percent as a result of this farsighted action there has been a significant increase in both the number of individual investors and in total equity values unfortunately however despite these positive developments current economic conditions demand that we enact additional tax measures to further stimulate capital format ion and to end the tax bias against savings and investment for this reason i am today introducing the comprehensive savings incentive act of 1981 a bill designed to significantly increase both our savings and productivity rate to expand the number of individual shareholders and to create millions of dollars of equity capital for our financially starving industries in brief the bill is comprised of three major provisions the first provision permanently increases the amount of money an individual may exclude from taxation on dividends and interest earned on savinus accounts from the current limit of 200 400 to 1 000 2 000 for individuals and married couples as my colleagues will recall the 200 400 provision was incorporated within the socalled windfall profits tax bill and is expected to significantly increase our gross national product the rate of private investment productivity and employment i believe that far greater benefits are to be gained by increasing the exclusion amount and by making it a permanent part of our tax code the second provision of this legislation modifies our tax code as it affects individual retirement accounts at present to qualify for an ira an individtual must be earning an income either as a salaried or selfemployed worker and must not be eligible for an organized pension or retirement plan iras are personal taxdeferred retirement plans which allow individuals to put 15 dercent of their yearly incomeup to 1 500into a special interestbearing account while i believe there is merit in reevaluating the eligibility requirements for an ira my bill simply recognizes that because of recurrent doubledigit inflation we must increase the amount of money people are ab le to setaside in an ira for this reason my bill increases the individual limit of 1 500 to 2 500 and correspondingly increases the spousal deduction from 1 750 to 3 000 the third and final provision of this legislation provides for a further rollback in the effective tax rates on capital gains from 28 to 21 percent for individuals and corporations i am convinced that a further reduction in the capital gains rate is overdue and that it can be financed in effect by higher realizations of gains and related tax receipts consisting largely of ordinary income earned by brokers executing sales commissions in fact this finding is consistent with the results of the 1978 reduction which has increased capital gains receipts to the treasury department by some 900 million additionally it is significant to note that a reduction in the capital gains tax from 28 to 21 percent received the enthusiastic support of the senate in its consideration of the revenue act of 1978 at that time the senate finance committee reported that the committee believes that lower capital gains tax will markedly increase sales of appreciated assets which will offset much of the revenue loss from the tax cut and potentially lead to an actual increase in revenues in addition the improved mobility of capital will stimulate investment thereby generating more economic activity and more tax revenue it is my firm belief that this type of antiinflationary individual tax cut compliments the presidents own tax proposal which i fully support and will help produce lasting jobs in the private sector minimize the risk of a new and worse recession result in lower interest rates increased capital investment and productivity and will strengthen the dollar abroad what i am proposing here today is an idea designed to benefit all americans for in this time of economic crisis we must do all thatwe can to increase the amount of available capital capital is the lifeblood of our economy and without it we will continue to experience high interest rates high unemployment astronomical trade imbalances and sagging levels of productivity i believe that if enacted this legislation will unlock important sources of capital and will allow american industries to expand their facilities to create thousands of jobs to more effectively compete abroad and to more efficiently produce those products we depend upon in our daily lives i urge my colleagues to join me inthis bipartisan effort to restore economic vitality to this great nation by cosponsoring the comprehensive savings incentive act of 1981"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a couple of weeks ago when we had a bill dealing with the ftc before this body there was a great

is indeed quite possible that if this section remains in the bill in the other body the bill itself might never become law since it taints it to that degree section 2405 to which i object provides unemployment compensation benefits to essentially all exservicemen who voluntarily leave the military this reverses and retreats from the change we made in the reconciliation bill where we prohibited such payments except under certain circumstances this reversal or retreat from action we have already taken in the reconciliation bill should be defeated for basically four reasons the first reason i offer is the fact that this is bad policy a serviceman and an employee in the private sector should be treated equally the same rule should apply to either one in the private sector when an employee leaves voluntarily a place of employment he is not qualified for unemployment compensation benefits yet if section 2405 stays in this bill we are going to treat the serviceman differently than the private employee by allowing him unemployment compensation benefits when he voluntarily leaves the service it is bad policy to create this difference in treatment when we used to have draftees i guess one could rationalize the law being that way on the grounds that we were involuntarily plucking a man or woman out of their employment and putting them in the service of their country and perhaps we should do something for them when they leave we do not have that anymore now we have a voluntary military people go into the military knowing they are going to leave at a certain time most of them are

have made substantial progress in checking overexploitation of many fish stocks and established a national pattern of fish conservation which previously had been lacking the national advisory committee on oceans and atmosphere nacoa recently reported that foreign fishing within the unitedstates fishery conservation zone has been reduced by 34 percent from 1976 to 1980 and domestic fish catches in the fishery conservation zone were 28 percent more during 1980 than in 1976 by the end of 1981 the fifth year in which the 200mile limit law had been in full operation 14 fishery management plans had been implemented but more needs to be done if we are to realize the full potential of our unitedstates fisheries industries in addition to reauthorizing the fcma for 3 years the legislation before us makes a number of important improvements to the act which clarify the role of the regional fish ery management councils in developing management plans and streamline the plan review and implementation process the legislation specifies that the guidelines issued by the secretary of commerce to assist in the development of fishery management plans are advisory only and that it is the
