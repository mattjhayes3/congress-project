final measure free trade is a better answer to the worlds economic disequililbrtum than foreign aid shared economic hope is a more effective deterrent top war than competitive protectionism when it comes to advancing peace as well as prosperity big fences simply do not make good neighbors if there is any hope of countries and peoples coming to have shared values in a world of nuclear weapons and fractured group identities competition must be in trade not arms in markets not land masses nafta in this context is a step toward providing citizens of the globe a common selfinterest shared prosperity based on shared economic growth of all the major economic issues before congress nafta is a decision for which there are a large number of meritorious arguments on each aide there are certain risks involved in enacting nafta but my best judgment at thispoint is that the aimrican economy especially the iowa economy will benefit in the long run from freer trade and that more jobs will be created than lost in the united states because of nafta my support for nafta in based partly on a look at the benefits of free trade throughout american history one of the lessons of t 19vs was that protectionist ltegislation such as the smoothawley tariff lengthened and deepened the great depression by reverse logic in recessionary times promotng policies that impel the growth of international trade is likely to serve as an economic sttnoulant trade barriers are particularly harmful to icmaas agrtealtualbased economy hence the importance of reginal agreements like nafta and the larger multicontinent gatt process lt cannot be stressed enough that defeat of na ta will preduce a double whammy for the iowa farmer loss of new markets south of our border and loss of the last vestiges of leverage for fairness in agricultural trade in the gatt discussions if nafta goes down the french would crow the contention on the continent would be that americans have no right to petition for fairer trade in agricultural commodities that is reduced subsidies if we refused to embrace free trade in our own hemisphere our farmers are the most productive in the world yet in the absence of international markets this very prodhctivity is the largest contributor to our excess supply problems what iowa farmers need is open markets abroad that are based on fair and equal trade this it also true for iowas manufac turing and services economy many companies with substantial capital investments in the first district like hon industries in muscatine expectto be able to create more iowa jobs because they will not only be subject to lower mexican tariffs but the dismantling over time of madenmexico product requirements some companies will always seek the lowest wage environment for this type of company mexico is more attractive without than with nafta because mexico will not have to adjust its labor or environmental standards and will be able to keep in place discriminatory tariffs with or without nafta some jobs will flow to mexico with nafta more new jobs are likely to be created is the united states than would otherwise be the case several years ago the united states established a freetrade agreement with canada in advance of the agreemeat most economists suggested it would be good for the united states and even better for canada in retrospect the agreement has proven good for canada and even better for the united state canada which had very high tariffs on united states goods has bee required to drop far more trade barriers than the united states in this regard a like circumstance exists with mexico their tarifs are extremely high often s to 10 times higher than very modest unitedstates ones and their current nontarift barriers vat unitedstates companies in a competitively untenable posltion under nafta in exchange for assured asee to the united states and canadian markets the mexicans must give the moat os tarf and on accepting changes in their environmental and labor policies while freetrade arrangements with lowerwage societie holds particular risks for some co panies midwesten farmers as well as farm implement food processing and trucking companies centered in cities like cedar rapids and the quad cities should be benefited and it must be empha esd without nafta united states cotpanies are free to invest in mexico all nafta does is lower already low barriers to mexican imports and in exchange lower what are substantially higher barriers to united states exports to mexico the most risky aspect of the agreement relates to the significant wage differential in mexico this could pose a problem in some industries but it should be stressed the same problem exists without an agreement one protection for us that seldom is noted is that the effect of an agreement can be measured over time and either party will retain the right to withdraw if it does not prove fair here those of us who are fortunate enough to live north of the rio grands must understand that when opportunity and hope are lacking at home individuals will make the obvious decision they vote with their feet for a better life president salinas is neither exaggerating nor threatening when he suggests the choice for america is whether we want more mexican products or more mexican people another factor of interest is that the asian countries which unlike mexico have developed an enormous trade surplus with the united states in recent years radically oppose the agreement they conjecture taht a partnership of countries of north america will cause more job creation hereand a rower reliance on imports from asia economists point out for instance that when the united states imports a finished product from the far east almost all the component parts are manufactured in the far east in mexico the reverse is the case a growing jobs base in mexico can potentially impel a growing jobs base in the united states as mexican buying power increases so will mexican demand for united states goodsa likewise our european competitors are very apprehenive of nafta because they fear they will be boxed out of the mexican market because they will be forced to pay tariffs that united states firma will not one cedar rapids company for instance4 tells me they expect to be in a positton to replace a european companys

resolution authorizing the dumping although this provision has been in force since 1985 congress has yet to authorize any radioactive dumping for decades unitedstates law on ocean pollution has been more stringent than international law at the time of enactment the radioactive dumping provisions in oda were among the most restrictive in the world going well beyond international treaty obligations that is no longer the case the ocean radioactive dumping ban act corrects this by eliminating odas current arduous permitting process and i h 1243 replacing it with a simple ban it ensures that the

totaling 10 million curies is currently stored aboard vessels in murmansk harbor even after the fall of communism moscow has continued to dispose of radioactive waste at sea in october 1993 russia

higher education act the 8515 regulations were set to go into effect on july 1 1994 and therefore would apply to the previous years revenues it is patently unfair to expect proprietary institutions to comply with an extremely complex formula that is applied retroactivelythere is an excellent proprietary institution in the first congressional district of nebraska the lincoln school oft commerce the school has been in existence for 110 years has a 92percent placern rate for graduates and has had a default rate of 18 percent this yea the colleges default rate is expected to decrease to 14 percenl as one example in order to prepare for the irplementation of the 8515 rule the college decided to give students who purchased their books with cash a 10percent discount this move was made in order to provide an icentive for students to use cash and not their student loans to pay for books thereby decreesing the percentage of funds coming intothe institution from the federal government the college implemented this program last fall however under the formula issued by the department of education on april 29 books are not considered part of the education program so even though the lincoln school of commerce tried to comply in advance with these regulations their efforts were in vain right now they are within the 8515 percentage division but they are right on the edge of course the original intent of this provision in the 1992 higher education act was to regulate those proprietary institutions that were abusing their students and the student loan system uncoln school of commerce for example is clearly not one of those schools in fact generally proprietary institutions in nebraska are doing an excellent job and a majority of these schools will be adversely impacted by the

of us recognise there are risks in freetrade agreements particularly with societies with lower standards of living but in the final measure free trade is a better answer to the worlds economic disequililbrtum than foreign aid shared economic hope is a more effective deterrent top war than competitive protectionism when it comes to advancing peace as well as prosperity big fences simply do not make good neighbors if there is any hope of countries and peoples coming to have shared values in a world of nuclear weapons and fractured group identities competition must be in trade not arms in markets not land masses nafta in this context is a step toward providing citizens of the globe a common selfinterest shared prosperity based on shared economic growth of all the major economic issues before congress nafta is a decision for which there are a large number of meritorious arguments on each aide there are certain risks involved in enacting nafta but my best judgment at thispoint is that the aimrican economy especially the iowa economy will benefit in the long run from freer trade and that more jobs will be created than lost in the united states because of nafta my support for nafta in based partly on a look at the benefits of free trade throughout american history one of the lessons of t 19vs was that protectionist ltegislation such as the smoothawley tariff lengthened and deepened the great depression by reverse logic in recessionary times promotng policies that impel the growth of international trade is likely to serve as an economic sttnoulant trade barriers are particularly harmful to icmaas agrtealtualbased economy hence the importance of reginal agreements like nafta and the larger multicontinent gatt process lt cannot be stressed enough that defeat of na ta will preduce a double whammy for the iowa farmer loss of new markets south of our border and loss of the last vestiges of leverage for fairness in agricultural trade in the gatt discussions if nafta goes down the french would crow the contention on the continent would be that americans have no right to petition for fairer trade in agricultural commodities that is reduced subsidies if we refused to embrace free trade in our own hemisphere our farmers are the most productive in the world yet in the absence of international markets this very prodhctivity is the largest contributor to our excess supply problems what iowa farmers need is open markets abroad that are based on fair and equal trade this it also true for iowas manufac turing and services economy many companies with substantial capital investments in the first district like hon industries in muscatine expectto be able to create more iowa jobs because they will not only be subject to lower mexican tariffs but the dismantling over time of madenmexico product requirements some companies will always seek the lowest wage environment for this type of company mexico is more attractive without than with nafta because mexico will not have to adjust its labor or environmental standards and will be able to keep in place discriminatory tariffs with or without nafta some jobs will flow to mexico with nafta more new jobs are likely to be created is the united states than would otherwise be the case several years ago the united states established a freetrade agreement with canada in advance of the agreemeat most economists suggested it would be good for the united states and even better for canada in retrospect the agreement has proven good for canada and even better for the united state canada which had very high tariffs on united states goods has bee required to drop far more trade barriers than the united states in this regard a like circumstance exists with mexico their tarifs are extremely high often s to 10 times higher than very modest unitedstates ones and their current nontarift barriers vat unitedstates companies in a competitively untenable posltion under nafta in exchange for assured asee to the united states and canadian markets the mexicans must give the moat os tarf and on accepting changes in their environmental and labor policies while freetrade arrangements with lowerwage societie holds particular risks for some co panies midwesten farmers as well as farm implement food processing and trucking companies centered in cities like cedar rapids and the quad cities should be benefited and it must be empha esd without nafta united states cotpanies are free to invest in mexico all nafta does is lower already low barriers to mexican imports and in exchange lower what are substantially higher barriers to united states exports to mexico the most risky aspect of the agreement relates to the significant wage differential in mexico this could pose a problem in some industries but it should be stressed the same problem exists without an agreement one protection for us that seldom is noted is that the effect of an agreement can be measured over time and either party will retain the right to withdraw if it does not prove fair here those of us who are fortunate enough to live north of the rio grands must understand that when opportunity and hope are lacking at home individuals will make the obvious decision they vote with their feet for a better life president salinas is neither exaggerating nor threatening when he suggests the choice for america is whether we want more mexican products or more mexican people another factor of interest is that the asian countries which unlike mexico have developed an enormous trade surplus with the united states in recent years radically oppose the agreement they conjecture taht a partnership of countries of north america will cause more job creation hereand a rower reliance on imports from asia economists point out for instance that when the united states imports a finished product from the far east almost all the component parts are manufactured in the far east in mexico the reverse is the case a growing jobs base in mexico can potentially impel a growing jobs base in the united states as mexican buying power increases so will mexican demand for united states goodsa likewise our european competitors are very apprehenive of nafta because they fear they will be boxed out of the mexican market because they will be forced to pay tariffs that united states firma will not one cedar rapids company for instance4 tells me they expect to be in a positton to replace a european companys current dqnzinance of the mexican market for agricultural byproducts finally two notes about the
