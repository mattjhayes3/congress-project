farreaching requirement which will require many of those 1 million people to prove that they are in the state legally to receive benefits without that proof they lose the benefits that americans have to pay for because americans always pay always pay for illegal entry illegals will lose unemployment checks grants to pay energy bills and even some public medical care and even applying for these perks means a monetary punishment to illegals they are also now busting business owners who until recently have left their own porch lights on guiding illegals their way in the name of a bigger bottom

have dividend income and 26 million taxpayers realize capital gains i think that shows how little they know about employee ownership in america of so many companies where people work so to dismiss out of hand as if no one benefits from these provisions is absolutely false and not to mention the effect of these investment tax reductions on our economy and what that means for peoples individual lives and their prosperity i spent some time earlier going through a number of statistics about how we have record unemployment record homeownership record productivity and so many indicators of strength in our national economy that are as a result of the 2003 tax relief also the potential tax hike in investment taxes could already potentially be weighing on people about to retire the 70 million baby boomers who are about to retire and could weigh on investors as they make their longerterm investment decisions that is why it is so important that we continue the capital gains and dividend tax relief in reconciliation that we dont have a tax hike on investment taxes because that would hurt the economic growth that we have been able to achieve in recent years let me just say that we have been able to do both in our legislation both capital gains and middleincome amt and they have been done within the budget the congressionally approved budget by this congress allows up to 70 billion in reconciliation and tax relief within our budget we do both of them we may not do it exactly the way the other side does but we accomplish both goals in our legislation again i would urge a no vote

to solve important problems for our nation i too hear when i am at home doing town hall meetings why do we not put the money aside why do we not spend it on general fund items like congress has been doing for 60 years now there is a mechanism to make sure that the money can only be used for social security beiefits that mechanism is called personal accounts when you allow people to set aside part of their payroll taxes into a personal account that they have some discretion on how that money is invested in a very safe and secure investment that money is theirs it cannot be used for any other purpose and it is going back to a term that has been used in the past a personal lockbox for every individual again i thank the gentlewoman for her leadership this is a debate that will be ongoing and

come here and expect a handout and a free ride and now americans they are speaking out recently taxpayers in houston forked out over 125 million in hospital costs in just 1 year by treating more than 53 000 illegals taking advantage of the system in our hospitals taking advantage of americans and really taking advantage of legal immigrants it is morally wrong for illegals to enter this country with the expectation that they will live off of others it is morally wrong for them to expect that americans will pay to take care of them take care of their health costs their education costs and their social services costs but now it is becoming illegal for illegals to get these services that even many americans do not receive taxpayers are finding their own answers while some federal lawmakers in washington remain deaf to their desire because they are too busy dueling over illegal immigration doctrines state leaders are stepping in across the couhtry just this week in colorado lawmakers took a cue from their citizens by cutting through the conflict and passed 11 bipartisan bills taking a tougher stance on illegal entry just like houston illegals have been drawn to colorado like moths to a flame and like many states colorado has left the porch light on for them because they have bad laws that encourage illegal entry such as laws that protect employers that hire illegals providing illegals benefits that many americans do not receive such as unemployment grants and even medical care this may explain why half of colorados immigrants are illegal but those days may be over because now state legislators are aiming to flip the switch and turn out the lights and turn off the benefits that make being illegal so lucrative this week they passed 11 immigration bills including making people prove that they are legal residents of colorado in order to receive state and federal benefits that is a farreaching requirement which will require many of those 1 million people to prove that they are in the state legally to receive benefits without that proof they lose the benefits that americans have to pay for because americans always pay always pay for illegal entry illegals will lose unemployment checks grants to pay energy bills and even some public medical care and even applying for these perks means a monetary punishment to illegals they are also now busting business owners who until recently have left their own porch lights on guiding illegals their way in the name of a bigger bottom line those businesses who exploit illegals make a profit off of cheap labor but americans pick up the tab for all social services now they are going to lose a grip on that filthy lucre that they have gotten businesses that exploit those already living in the shadows of our society beyond the scope of federal work and wage regulations it will cost those illicit businesses money in the form of fines if they do not keep records proving that they hire only legal residents and while many americans do not turn out at the polls it seems some illegals find some way to vote in this country and now it is going to be a felony if they do so and while colorado legislators have been hard at work they are letting the voters make the really tough decisions they are asking them in november on the ballot if they should sue the federal government for not enforcing federal immigration laws voters will also be asked to deny tax benefits to business owners who hire illegals each day my office gets inundated with calls emails and faxes of people demanding their voices be heard demanding we secure the borders demanding that government enforce the law and demanding that government uphold its greatest responsibility protecting the citizens the bills are

began by talkingabout the myths all around america the people whowould be discussing what is going on here would have to find that something is odd about a budget that goes up 7 percent every year but

every word in the dictionary crisis problem trouble bankruptcy one can filay the semantics game with social security all they want but the fact of the matter is that social security is broken and needs fixing back in 1935 the system worked well retirement age back then was 65 and the average life expectancy 63 a pretty good deal for the government today however americans are living longer than ever and far more likely to live long enough to get their benefits social security is not a savings plan it is a payasyougo system where todays workers support todays retirees and tomorrows workers support tomorrows retirees the number of workers supporting each retiree was 42 when the program started it is now three with the payroll taxes on the paychecks of hardworking americans going up 600 percent over the time when it gets to two just in 3 years 2008 the government will begin to pay out more in social security benefits than it collects in payroll taxes it does not take a math whiz to understand that the payasyougo system will not provide retirement security for american workers it is a problem and must be resolved i urge my colleagues to join me in solving it"]]}
