this country from having this endless plethora of lawsuits that stop the permitting and stop the production what it would do is it would require that all lawsuits be filed within 60 days and that the courts would have to have a determination or solution to that case within 180 days and that if the district court ruling was appealed that it would go to the supreme court and the supreme court would have a ruling within another 180 days it would also allow some relief from the frivolous lawsuits by allowing the prevailing party to be able to seek legal fees and other expenses under the act this

about your own country and your own experiences because of the points of contrast what a wonderful thing it is that america has now tens of thousands of people who have served in the peace corps who have returned and who now are working in every walk of lifeworking in international organizations working in business organizations knowing different cultures knowing different languagesthereby

catching and they would participate in all kinds of little volunteer activities and things that they hadnt necessarily thought of doing themselves of course the peace corps volunteers are not representatives of the american government they are representatives of the american people that was always emphasized very very strongly to all of us as part of our peace corps training the way we were living was among the people not behind these diplomatic bunkers that we sometimes see in the world today youre experiencing life in the country in which youre serving one thing just as an example is that peace corps volunteers of course do their assignments but theyre also people who do volunteer work of one kind or another one of the big hits was when i was in mogadishu in the peace corps i was with two other people who were peace corps lawyers at that time and there were about 50 60 people who were teachers some were community health workers and some were community school construction workers they would come to mogadishu for a couple days off for vacation time when school was down that kind of thing and five or six of them got together and started playing some american young

a lawyer im a medical doctor as the gentleman knows in law school they teach you not to ask a question if you dont know what the answer is and i didnt know what your answer was going to be but i felt sure you were going to answer the way you did for the simple reason that we hear our colleagues on the other side the democrats keep talking about wanting to create jobs but their policies are destroying jobsamerican jobs private pay jobs their policies are developing bigger jobs bigger government here in washington d c so much so that the only city in this country that real estate prices have not gone down is washington d c theyve gone up why because this administration nancy pelosi harry reid and their colleagues in the house and the senate in the 111th congress are creating bigger government more regulations more taxes more attacks on jobs in the private sector more attacks on small businesses and its creating a bigger government thus higher real estate prices here in washington because weve created government jobs they claim about all the jobs created with the stimulus bill et cetera but its government jobs is pretty much what were creating weve got another problem in fact i introduced h r 1032 the relief act because we have excessive and frivolous lawsuits against our own energy production and it has significantly delayed and in many cases prevented our energy resources from reaching the american marketplace h r 1032 the relief act doesnt stop people from having their day in court but what it would do is it would allow the environmental wackos that are trying to stop energy production here in this country from having this endless plethora of lawsuits that stop the permitting and stop the production what it would do is it would require that all lawsuits be filed within 60 days and that the courts would have to have a determination or solution to that case within 180 days and that if the district court ruling was appealed that it would go to the supreme court and the supreme court would have a ruling within another 180 days it would also allow some relief from the frivolous lawsuits by allowing the prevailing party to be able to seek legal fees and other expenses under the act this is the kind of bill that we need to pass ive been asking members of congress to cosponsor this because we need to pass this kind of legislation we hear

the ultimate goal to which we are all committed a bipartisan agreement to avert the debt ceiling crisis looming right before us even more importantly we have crafted a plan that addresses the real underlying challenge of our ballooning national debt the bipartisan agreement before us today is an historic achievement this is the 76th time that we have raised the debt ceiling since 1962 seventyfive times it has been raised this is the 76th time yet it is the very first time that we have done so while making corresponding cuts in spending that exceed the ceiling increase to most of us this is just good common sense its the only responsible thing to do yet 75 times before no connection was made between the debt ceiling and efforts to tackle our debt with todays underlying legislation we are fundamentally changing the way business is done here in washington we are setting a new precedent for fiscal discipline and accountability this is a tremendous achievement that will have a profound and lasting impact on our budget and our economy in both the short medium and long term this is an especially critical point to focus on todays legislation has dramatic implications for both the budget and our economy as you know very well the two are inextricably linked this is why our fiscal situation is so important we dont need a balanced budget for the sake of a balanced budget we need to balance our budget because job creation and economic growth depend on it there is a reason why the major credit agencies have said that our aaa credit rating is in jeopardy if we dont dramatically cut spending multitrilliondollar deficits and a national debt that approaches 100 percent of gdp are not sustainable democrats and republicans alike recognize that if we want to inspire confidence in the unitedstates economy create jobs and restore our position as the worlds most vital and dynamic economy we absolutely must chart a new fiscal course the bipartisan agreement that we will consider today does just that it makes meaningful immediate spending cuts it sets up a process that guarantees votes in both chambers by thanksgiving on an even bigger package this will give us the time necessary to go beyond cuts to significant new reforms that includes reforming entitlement programs to keep them solvent and ensure that they dont force us back onto a path of spiraling deficits and debt by setting up this process we can responsibly make the hard but essential choices that will restore our economy and unleash its power to create new opportunities for americans the underlying legislation will also impose additional automatic cuts should congress fail to continue on a path to real reform we are all in this together democrat and republican alike we all stand to suffer tremendously if we fail to either raise the debt ceiling or take this opportunity to fundamentally change course we will all suffer if we fail to continue the process of meaningful reform but by coming together and enacting real reform by remaining committed to this joint effort into the future we can all share in the benefits of a surging economy and job market we cant approach

the work product of this body what is the replace its repeal and replace i think there has been some acknowledgment in fact the gentleman from florida mentioned that the committee might work on some of these areas what is that proposed body of work why are we not looking at repeal and replace and what we are replacing it with is it going to be similar to former chairman waxmans net neutrality

traditionally have had just a booming timber economy resourcebased economy and a lot of those operations have either shut down or moved elsewhere to be more competitive weve got to allow job growth i mean it sounds simple it really does you know the last time our country had the amount of spending that we see happening right now was actually in the lead up to world war ii and ive talked a lot about cutting and reducing government overspending and government growth it needs to be done in the last 3 years the what we call discretionary spending the money that has to be appropriated annually has increased by over 80 percent federal employment has increased by 10 percent in about that same time so government spending has grown and people are saying that the way tonot people my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and the president are saying that the reason we have stagnant job opportunities is because we havent spent enough well i listed earlier the stimulus the bailouts the auto bailouts the health care bill all this spending thats taken place and were still where we are now and people say well it happened during world war ii we spent a ton of money and then coming out of that we grew jobs the difference the big difference was coming out of world war ii the last time our debt to gdp ratio was near where it is now the difference was and the thing that saved us was the immediate cuts right we cut government spending back but we grew jobs we literally made things here in america you know why we had an environment that fostered job creation we had an environment that cultivated entrepreneurs we grew jobs here in america because we made things here we produced things again in southwest washington we had a roaring timber industry that has all but shut down and the sad thing is if you dont manage the health of a forest it deteriorates some of these folks who are here in these bureaucratic offices in washington d c i swear have never stepped foot in a real forest they think you just tie a big ribbon around it and dont let anybody in or out and thats how we protect our environment theyre wrong you see they think that our environment and our economy are mutually exclusive man that is such a low opinion of american researchers that really must say that we dont think we can our citizens our people are intelligent enough to come up with new and innovative ways to both manage our timber and our timber economy and protect our environment so what we have now is shut off stands of trees ripe for beetle infestation disease or worse fire as we enter the summer seasons with a lot of dry foliage and underbrush you know it sure would be great if the epa would have allowed some of those companies i mentioned in my district to create their
