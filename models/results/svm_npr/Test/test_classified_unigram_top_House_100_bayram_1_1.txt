negotiations with the soviet union relative to its presence in nicaragua it is a most fascinating letter signed on to by a large portion of the democratic leadership including the people who brought the bill to the floor the othl day that had provisions in it whiei would have committed our military to central america and to the nicaraguan problem for the first time but in this letter to the president they say some very fascinating things that i think the american people should reflect upon for example in this letter they are saying quite clearly that the nicaraguan communist government represents a real threat to unitedstates security they say at present the greatest danger of such a threatmeaning to central america in this case and they above say that the united states has valid security concerns in central america and then they say at present the greatest danger of such a threat is in nicaragua under the government of the sandinista junta then they go on to say some very interesting things for instance they make the point about the massive amount of soviet aid that is there including as they put it mi24 hind attack helicopters and then they make this statement there are also rumors of the construction of submarine bases and airfields capable of landing the largest bombers we know that that is more than rumor unless of course pictures of those bases are simply rumor because on this floor during the debate my colleague the gentleman from california actually showed this house pictures of the airfields pictures of the submarine bases it is more than rumor it is fact that is the problem that we are faced with anyhow they go on and they suggest to the president that what he ought to do is to negotiate the soviet presence out of nicaragua the problem with this letter is that it does not seem to recognize that those negotiations have already been under way and that the soviet union is not responding in a manner which helps our security interests i have here another letter this one from colin powell the national security adviser to the president who has pointqd out to us he wrote it to one of our colleagues the chairman of the subcommittee on europe and the middle east and he says in the letter president reagan raised the issue of nicaragua with the general secretary pointing out that continuing massive soviet supply of military equipment to the sandinista regime aggravates the situation in central america and constitutes another instance in which soviet actions in regional conflicts made unitedstates soviet relations more difficult secretary schultz pursued the same topic with the soviets in postsummit consultations in other words what this letter says is that there is an ongoing process of discussions taking place on the very topic that the democrats are saying open negotiations about i am surprised that they do not know what is really going on but let us go on in the letter because this is the problem mr powell goes on and points out the soviet position on the question is clear they propose to limit military assistance to the sandinistas to only small armswhich the general secretary characterized as police arms in exchange for unitedstates stopping its military assistance programs to the other nations of central america and to the nicaraguan democratic resistance this proposal needless to say is not congruent with our commitments to the central american democracies nor with our national interest its acceptance would leave the present dangerous sandinista military preponderance over its neighbors entirely intact moreover it would have us legitimize a dangerous extension of soviet power onto the mainland of the western hemisphere now the only thing that i can conclude is either the people who signed on to this letter are totally ignorant of the negotiations that are ongoing or they intend for us to accept the soviet proposal because i can come to no other interpretation of what they are saying to the president if in fact what they are saying is mr president accept what the soviets offer let us understand what that means it means the soviets would continue to send the small arms in ak47s for instance automatic rifles while we would send no aid whatsoever to the central american democracies what that would mean is that the guerrilla forces that have been funded and have been supported out of nicaragua would be able to get those ak47s to use against el salvador to use against guatemala to use against honduras to use against costa rica and those countries would not have any help to respond the soviets are saying let us send small arms we wont send tanks but we are going to send small arms but you send nothing is that really the deal that the democrats would have us sign on to i

appropriations amounts in the bill a percentage reduction at this level will reduce total appropriations in the bill by 300 million down to 9 14 billion this amount would still be nearly 900 million above fiscal year 1987 levels and more than 1 2 billion above the administration request my colleagues will ask why a 300 million cut is the right amount to cut from the interior appropriations bill the response is that a 300 million reduction would reduce by one half the level of increase in appropriations from last year to this year except for the increase in the fillrate of the strategic petroleum reserve last year the congress approved 8 3 billion for the department of interior and related agencies appropriations bill as part of the omnibus continuing resolution this year the committee is recommending a 9 45 billion bill an increase of almost 1 2 billion if one sets aside the decision to provide 600 million in strategic reserve funds this leaves an increase in discretionary spending of approximately 600 million the amendment i am offering would cut this increase in half i believe my amendment is necessary to compensate for the blatantly artificial and unrealistic assumptions made by the budget conference agreement this budget agreement assumes 7 2 billion in revenues from early payment of rea loans my colleagues know that this is not going to happen in todays interest rate market is the rea going to go out and borrow private money to repay subsidized public funds of course not this 7 2 billion savings is no savings at all another assumption is that congress is going to raise nearly 20 billion in taxes this year the conference agreement assumes that 1988 revenues will be in the range of 932 billion is this really going to happen are twothirds of my colleagues in the house and twothirds of the members of the other body going to put their names on the line to6 override a presidential veto of a tax increase that is what it would take to raise 16 billion in taxes this year i dont think its going to happen finally the conference agreement reconciles only 4 billion of the 30 billion savings requiired for fiscal year 1988 my colleagues know that the amount of unreconciled savings slips and slips and slips through the budget process is this year going to be any different i dont think so mr chairman i think it is clear that we have nearly 30 billion in furmy money in the budget resolution in order to reduce this funny money a bipartisan group of members have gotten together and agreed that congress needs to make the tough choices to achieve real deficit reduction our goal is to reduce this funny money by around one half or 15 billion this works out to be a need for approximately a 300 million reduction in the interior appropriations bill this is what my amendment does it simply reduces each and every appropriated amount by 3 2 percent i recognize the concerns of some of my colleagues that this is a meat ax approach well weve tried the scalpelweve tried to make careful measured cuts in programs weve tried to work with members of the committee to achieve 300 million in reductions but our efforts

whether there are insufficient funds in some programs and not others and then without waiting to see what that agency does assigns the money appropriates the money and spends the money this amendment puts the horse back in front where it belongs and really implements the will of the authors of this bill it says that this interagency commission which now has 30 days to report back to the congress under the wording of the bill would simply have 6 months to do so but that no money shall be spent under the appropriations until that agency which this bill creates reports back to the congress and determines whether or not there has been overlapping whether or not there has been overspending in any or underspending in any and if that report confirms the levels of funding that appear in the main body of this bill then that will be the end of it and the appropriation will take place if the money is too much in one area because of overlapping then the congress will have another opportunity to

indecisiveness and procrastination on the part of congress relative to the budget process while we had an omnibus continuing resolution that contained all federal spending last year at least that cr was enacted by midoctober 1986 only a couple weeks after the start of the fiscal year this years bickering for 3 months after the start of the fiscal year over the specifics of deficit reduction and program funding is totally unacceptable i have made clear my objection to the use of the omnibus cr as a way of skirting the budget process and forcing a show down at the 11th hour on contentious issues that couldnt survive on their own this process forces members to accept bad legislation because the only alternative is to shut down the entire federal government i am a cosponsor of legislation h res 271 introduced by my friend congressman amo houghton that would require each full year appropriations bill to be passed by congress individually and sent to the president in that form in lieu of separate movement of appropriations bills i have also cosponsored congressman mickey edwards bill h r 3199 that would require separation of any cr into the 13 individual appropriations bills upon presention to the president for signature i would hope that in view of the fiasco of this budgetary cycle there will be much greater pressure for responsible consideration of the appropriations bills in the coming year the specter of grammrudman sequestration and the scare of the stock market crash have forced congress and the white house to get down to specifics and come up with a deficit reduction package that eliminates the need for acrosstheboard cuts as i said when grammrudman was first approved by the house in 1985 the only good thing about it is that it is so bad in the final hours of november 21 the date sequestration began the budget summit negotiators announced the framework of an agreement without grammrudman it is hard to believe that this consensus would ever have been reached implementation of this agreement has proved difficult but i am pleased that we are finally able to vote on a package that makes sufficient cuts in federal spending to allow the repeal of this years sequestration order the budget agreement requires defense spending to drop 5 billion from the grammrudman baseline established in the july fix while i would have preferred the house defense figures that were 1 2 billion below the summit level at least defense is contributing a substantial share to deficit reduction nondetense discretionary programs are cut by about 2 6 billion from the grammrudman baseline because this baseline assumed an increase in all programs equal to the anticipated amount of inflation the 2 6 billion reduction allows for an overall increase in nondefense discretionary spending if we are to make serious progress on reducing the deficit again next year we will unfortunately have to make greater cuts in spending next time around lets turn to some specific provisions in this 600 billion bill my greatest objection to this bill is the inclusion of 8 1 million in aid to the contras i initiated a letter to house leaders on the conference committee signed by seven likeminded republicans expressing our strong support for the house position of no contra aid at this time unfortunately due to overwhelming support in the senate for 15 billion in aid and the white house threat to veto the entire funding bill if it didnt contain contra aid the house conferees gave in to demands to accept a scaledback level of aid at this point it appears that failure to pass the cr as it currently stands could result in disintegration of the agreement to provide only 8 1 million at which point the senate would insist on its full 15 million in aid members opposed to all contra aid are therefore caught between a rock and a hard place i am pleased that this legislation officially blocks the 2 percent pay raise for members of congress it came to membera 3tention earlier this year that the proposed cola increase for federal employees would apply to members of congress executive officers and judges unless these individuals were specifically separated from all other federal employees if we are going to ask many americans to sacrifice for the good of fiscal responsibility the least that members of congress can do is to contribute their 2 percent cola to that effort this legislation also contains language applauded by environmental groups that allows an 8month delay in sanctions for noncompliance with clean air act standards on ozone and carbon monoxide emissions this will pressure congress to reauthorize the clean air act this coming year instead of letting it slip into the next congress as some members had wished the cr also contains a provision that is very important to our nations dairy farmers the conferees on the agriculture appropriations section have included the text of my bill that will ensure that grammrudman sequestration does not unfairly impact dairy farmers back in 1986 congress and the president approved legislation i introduced h r 4188 public law 99260 to correct a flaw in the original grammrudman that would have cost dairymen 360 million in lost income in order to produce only 80 million in budget savings unfortunately in approving this years grammrudman fix the conferees neglected to

commission have this privilege there is no good reason why these commission employees should be forced to travel into the cities where the unrest is at its peak to buy food while most other american

obligation to the community when he receives his license broadcasters are obliged and licensed to serve their communities fair and complete news is inherent in such public service it is unfortunate

provide some sort of medical help the question is how there is some dispute as to whether or not more ought to be done at this particular time in the prevention role we believe that the substitute which does a great deal to try to expand the protection of existing workers and prevent the kind of problems which we have been talking about today is much superior in that regard we do a number of things in our amendment which help the present workers we expand the coverage under osha to take in other areas to include thousands if not millions of workers in the transportation and the mining industries we also upgrade the z tables that is those tables which were established some time ago which have not been upgraded a list of those hazardous chemicals about which we are concerned here today we give the secretary authority to do that there are only 400 on that list today and there could be thousands on there after that is done we employ training to ensure that the workers in the plant and the employers know how to deal with the problems of occupational diseases and their causes the secretary is required to recommend monitoring when it is essential depending on the type of exposure we create the office of hazard communications in order to deal with a serious problem and ensure that we provide maximum protection to our workers present and future we do a great deal h r

that rather than use the model which was a disaster the augusta experience and model the whole federal program and that program cannot go into effect for 2 years why not take that group of workers we already know who they are some hundred thousand that we know the kind of exposure they have had we know that they are being subjected to possible disease notify them and do it in a way that will be respon sible with the employers concerned and with the workers help them find out whether or not they do have a problem we would have those notices out in a matter of months we have to wait 2 years

to the president of the united states urging him to begin negotiations with the soviet union relative to its presence in nicaragua it is a most fascinating letter signed on to by a large portion of the democratic leadership including the people who brought the bill to the floor the othl day that had provisions in it whiei would have committed our military to central america and to the nicaraguan problem for the first time but in this letter to the president they say some very fascinating things that i think the american people should reflect upon for example in this letter they are saying quite clearly that the nicaraguan communist government represents a real threat to unitedstates security they say at present the greatest danger of such a threatmeaning to central america in this case and they above say that the united states has valid security concerns in central america and then they say at present the greatest danger of such a threat is in nicaragua under the government of the sandinista junta then they go on to say some very interesting things for instance they make the point about the massive amount of soviet aid that is there including as they put it mi24 hind attack helicopters and then they make this statement there are also rumors of the construction of submarine bases and airfields capable of landing the largest bombers we know that that is more than rumor unless of course pictures of those bases are simply rumor because on this floor during the debate my colleague the gentleman from california actually showed this house pictures of the airfields pictures of the submarine bases it is more than rumor it is fact that is the problem that we are faced with anyhow they go on and they suggest to the president that what he ought to do is to negotiate the soviet presence out of nicaragua the problem with this letter is that it does not seem to recognize that those negotiations have already been under way and that the soviet union is not responding in a manner which helps our security interests i have here another letter this one from colin powell the national security adviser to the president who has pointqd out to us he wrote it to one of our colleagues the chairman of the subcommittee on europe and the middle east and he says in the letter president reagan raised the issue of nicaragua with the general secretary pointing out that continuing massive soviet supply of military equipment to the sandinista regime aggravates the situation in central america and constitutes another instance in which soviet actions in regional conflicts made unitedstates soviet relations more difficult secretary schultz pursued the same topic with the soviets in postsummit consultations in other words what this letter says is that there is an ongoing process of discussions taking place on the very topic that the democrats are saying open negotiations about i am surprised that they do not know what is really going on but let us go on in the letter because this is the problem mr powell goes on and points out the soviet position on the question is clear they propose to limit military assistance to the sandinistas to only small armswhich the general secretary characterized as police arms in exchange for unitedstates stopping its military assistance programs to the other nations of central america and to the nicaraguan democratic resistance this proposal needless to say is not congruent with our commitments to the central american democracies nor with our national interest its acceptance would leave the present dangerous sandinista military preponderance over its neighbors entirely intact moreover it would have us legitimize a dangerous extension of soviet power onto the mainland of the western hemisphere now the only thing that i can conclude is either the people who signed on to this letter are totally ignorant of the negotiations that are ongoing or they intend for us to accept the soviet proposal because i can come to no other interpretation of what they are saying to the president if in fact what they are saying is mr president accept what the soviets offer let us understand what that means it means the soviets would continue to send the small arms in ak47s for instance automatic rifles while we would send no aid whatsoever to the central american democracies what that would mean is that the guerrilla forces that have been funded and have been supported out of nicaragua would be able to get those ak47s to use against el salvador to use against guatemala to use against honduras to use against costa rica and those countries would not have any help to respond the soviets are saying let us send small arms we wont send tanks but we are going to send small arms but you send nothing is

which requires a 3 2percent reduction in all the separate appropriations amounts in the bill a percentage reduction at this level will reduce total appropriations in the bill by 300 million down to 9 14 billion this amount would still be nearly 900 million above fiscal year 1987 levels and more than 1 2 billion above the administration request my colleagues will ask why a 300 million cut is the right amount to cut from the interior appropriations bill the response is that a 300 million reduction would reduce by one half the level of increase in appropriations from last year to this year except for the increase in the fillrate of the strategic petroleum reserve last year the congress approved 8 3 billion for the department of interior and related agencies appropriations bill as part of the omnibus continuing resolution this year the committee is recommending a 9 45 billion bill an increase of almost 1 2 billion if one sets aside the decision to provide 600 million in strategic reserve funds this leaves an increase in discretionary spending of approximately 600 million the amendment i am offering would cut this increase in half i believe my amendment is necessary to compensate for the blatantly artificial and unrealistic assumptions made by the budget conference agreement this budget agreement assumes 7 2 billion in revenues from early payment of rea loans my colleagues know that this is not going to happen in todays interest rate market is the rea going to go out and borrow private money to repay subsidized public funds of course not this 7 2 billion savings is no savings at all another assumption is that congress is going to raise nearly 20 billion in taxes this year the conference agreement assumes that 1988 revenues will be in the range of 932 billion is this really going to happen are twothirds of my colleagues in the house and twothirds of the members of the other body going to put their names on the line to6 override a presidential veto of a tax increase that is what it would take to raise 16 billion in taxes this year i dont think its going to happen finally the conference agreement reconciles only 4 billion of the 30 billion savings requiired for fiscal year 1988 my colleagues know that the amount of unreconciled savings slips and slips and slips through the budget process is this year going to be any different i dont think so mr chairman i think it is clear that we have nearly 30 billion in furmy money in the budget resolution in order to reduce this funny money a bipartisan group of members have gotten together and agreed that congress needs to make the tough choices to achieve real deficit reduction our goal is to reduce this funny money by around one half or 15 billion this works out to be a need for approximately a 300 million reduction in the interior appropriations bill this is what my amendment does it simply reduces each and every appropriated amount by 3 2 percent i recognize the concerns of some of my colleagues that this is a meat ax approach well weve tried the scalpelweve tried to make careful measured cuts in programs weve tried to work with members of the committee to achieve 300

there is money wasted whether there are insufficient funds in some programs and not others and then without waiting to see what that agency does assigns the money appropriates the money and spends the money this amendment puts the horse back in front where it belongs and really implements the will of the authors of this bill it says that this interagency commission which now has 30 days to report back to the congress under the wording of the bill would simply have 6 months to do so but that no money shall be spent under the appropriations until that agency which this bill creates reports back

the worst case of indecisiveness and procrastination on the part of congress relative to the budget process while we had an omnibus continuing resolution that contained all federal spending last year at least that cr was enacted by midoctober 1986 only a couple weeks after the start of the fiscal year this years bickering for 3 months after the start of the fiscal year over the specifics of deficit reduction and program funding is totally unacceptable i have made clear my objection to the use of the omnibus cr as a way of skirting the budget process and forcing a show down at the 11th hour on contentious issues that couldnt survive on their own this process forces members to accept bad legislation because the only alternative is to shut down the entire federal government i am a cosponsor of legislation h res 271 introduced by my friend congressman amo houghton that would require each full year appropriations bill to be passed by congress individually and sent to the president in that form in lieu of separate movement of appropriations bills i have also cosponsored congressman mickey edwards bill h r 3199 that would require separation of any cr into the 13 individual appropriations bills upon presention to the president for signature i would hope that in view of the fiasco of this budgetary cycle there will be much greater pressure for responsible consideration of the appropriations bills in the coming year the specter of grammrudman sequestration and the scare of the stock market crash have forced congress and the white house to get down to specifics and come up with a deficit reduction package that eliminates the need for acrosstheboard cuts as i said when grammrudman was first approved by the house in 1985 the only good thing about it is that it is so bad in the final hours of november 21 the date sequestration began the budget summit negotiators announced the framework of an agreement without grammrudman it is hard to believe that this consensus would ever have been reached implementation of this agreement has proved difficult but i am pleased that we are finally able to vote on a package that makes sufficient cuts in federal spending to allow the repeal of this years sequestration order the budget agreement requires defense spending to drop 5 billion from the grammrudman baseline established in the july fix while i would have preferred the house defense figures that were 1 2 billion below the summit level at least defense is contributing a substantial share to deficit reduction nondetense discretionary programs are cut by about 2 6 billion from the grammrudman baseline because this baseline assumed an increase in all programs equal to the anticipated amount of inflation the 2 6 billion reduction allows for an overall increase in nondefense discretionary spending if we are to make serious progress on reducing the deficit again next year we will unfortunately have to make greater cuts in spending next time around lets turn to some specific provisions in this 600 billion bill my greatest objection to this bill is the inclusion of 8 1 million in aid to the contras i initiated a letter to house leaders on the conference committee signed by seven likeminded republicans expressing our strong support for the house position of no contra aid at this time unfortunately due to overwhelming support in the senate for 15 billion in aid and the white house threat to veto the entire funding bill if it didnt contain contra aid the house conferees gave in to demands to accept a scaledback level of aid at this point it appears that failure to pass the cr as it currently stands could result in disintegration of the agreement to provide only 8 1 million at which point the senate would insist on its full 15 million in aid members opposed to all contra aid are therefore caught between a rock and a hard place i am pleased that this legislation officially blocks the 2 percent pay raise for members of congress it came to membera 3tention earlier this year that the proposed cola increase for federal employees would apply to members of congress executive officers and judges unless these individuals were specifically separated from all other federal employees if we are going to ask many americans to sacrifice for the good of fiscal responsibility the least that members of congress can do is to contribute their 2 percent cola to that effort this legislation also contains language applauded by environmental groups that allows an 8month delay in sanctions for noncompliance with clean air act standards on ozone and carbon monoxide emissions this will pressure congress to reauthorize the clean air act this coming year instead of letting it slip into the next congress as some members had wished the cr also contains a provision that is very important to our nations dairy farmers the conferees on the agriculture appropriations section have included the text of my bill that will ensure that grammrudman sequestration does not unfairly impact dairy farmers back in 1986 congress and the president approved legislation i introduced h r 4188 public law 99260 to correct a flaw in the

last several years over the last 2 years the fcc has undertaken an effort to repeal the fairness doctrine that effort has sparked the current debate the legislation before us today is intended to settle the debate by codifying the fairness doctrine into our communications laws it is important to note however that the debate is not simply a legislative issue the doctrine is currently subject to court challenge and quite frankly it will be settled in the court i believe by codifying the doctrine it actually assists the courts in ruling on the doctrines constitutionality i understand that the communications laws place special duties and privileges with broadcasters this unique treatment arises from the right to broadcast given by the government to a chosen few the broadcaster accepts an obligation to the community when he receives his license broadcasters are obliged and licensed to serve their communities fair and complete news is inherent in such public service it is unfortunate that we must resort tc any form of government requirementc for enforcing that obligation but i also acknowledge that the fair ness doctrine is not an overly burden some restriction imposed by the gov
