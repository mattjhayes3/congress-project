claim is that everyone has access to the system but you have to stop and ask yourself what is the quality of the system how long will i have to wait to getthe test or procedure i need how much more

encouraged to take 1 500 of that 4 500 and purchase a major medical insurance policy that would give employers everything they have now except the insurance policy would have a 3 000 deductible in other words the employee would pay the first 3 000 of health care costs the company would cover that possible 3 000 expense to employees by setting up a medical savings account in the employees name and depositing 3 000 in it each year whenever an employee needed medical service he would go get it wherever he chose and then would present a debit card and the bill would be paid from the 3 000 in his medical savings account anything he didnt spend at years end he would get to keep all of a sudden people have an incentive to make a choice between 200 at the emergency room or 50 at the doctors office because they are spending their own medical savings account money if a family had multiple illnesses the 3 000 would be spent from the account and then the major medical policy would kick in the employee is as well off as he is under the high premium low or no deductible plan he has today but if the employee be exercising prudence can save some of the 3 000 year after year that account can grow as a taxfree ira that money could then be used later in life to purchase longterm care or for other medical services the debate on health care reform has just begun whatever reforms we adopt

safety and because this city should represent the best our nation has to offer it is the home of our capital the home of our founders and the home of just under 600 000 people if the point of the statehood legislation is to provide for voting representation for the residents of dc and to provide autonomy and selfreliance then i do not see why an alternative suggestion that accomplishes these same goals should not also be considered my purpose today is to call attention to an alternative to statehood as provided in h r 1205 simply stated i support making the district a city in maryland instead of a statethis idea is called retrocession because we would be returning the land given by maryland to maryland the land that now comprises the district of columbia once belonged to maryland and it makes sense to return the district to the state of maryland minus a reduced federal enclave made up of the federal buildings just as the western portion of the district was returned to virginia in 1846 the federal enclave would be administered by congress as the unitedstates constitution requires current dc residents would become citizens of maryland with full voting representation and retrocession would preserve marylands intent that the land it gave be the seat of government ten ways the district benefits from retrocession first dc residents could run for and vote for at least one voting member in the house two senators and a governor second dc residents could run for and vote for dozens of state senators and delegates to represent washington in annapolis third dc could use the maryland state prisons and law enforcement officers could pursue interjurisdictional drug problems fourth the education system would have the same opportunities and taxing authority that marylands system enjoys fifth retrocession would expand the local ecotnomic base beyond its limited boundaries without the added bureaucracy of a state government sixth most importantly the residents of dc would have voting representation in a way more likely to be accepted by congress than statehood seventh dc residents could tap into transportation services as well as those relating to crime prevention and drug enforcement economic development health and the judicial system eighth dc would no longer be able to justify or pay for the excessive dc payroll by saying that extra people are needed to fulfill statelike functions ninth the districts political candidates would be able to run for statewide offices in maryland which would open up the political system to newcomers with fresh

adopted catellus will be permitted to swap all of the 355 000 acres let me give the members an idea in the bill they do not distinguish between excess and surplus land excess land by the federal government if the federal government has no use they can offer it up to another federal agency if they do not want it then it is considered surplus surplus is if no federal agency wants it then it can go to anybody what this does it puts the catellus corp on the same level as the federal government for land acquisition they can take over military bases and there is nothing in there that states that they could not even sell it to a foreign country like japan or one of the other countries that invests here it is absolutely wrong if after the 10year period catellus has not exchanged all of their landholdings the corporation would then be allowed to establish an exchange account there is nothing in there in the 10year period that even says they have to use those credits they can wait and pick and choose i have here a list of affected lands they can buy the 9acre site and exchange it for points in san francisco there is another 9 6 acres in malibu with a 6 000squarefoot house they can trade for it is wrong in effect catellus would go to the head of the line of all private parties we have talked about the little guy we have talked about the middle of the roader and we have talked about the rancher this is a company with a multibilliondollar prospectus this provision means that catellus would be compensated for 100 percent of their losses under this bill that is dramatically different from the way our government treats most people who become inholders as a result of federal land acquisitions that situation will get worse under this bill because this is the largest addition to federal landholdings in history of the lower 48 continental states under law it also says that one cannot exchange land outside the state of california that is law this bill reneges on that law because there is not enough land in the state of california to replace the 335 000 acres and we would be violating the law in that as well clearly this provision is the kind of special interest legislation that undermines the public faith in the fairnessgovernment if one is in a multimilliondollar corporation with the money to hire good lobbyists he will be taken care of if they simply are a retired couple who bought a cabin in the desert or a small mining corporation they are out of luck take a number and wait for the department of the interior to tell you what they think your land is worth and whether or not they will intend to pay for it what might catellus eventually get under the deal by being allowed exchange of 100 percent of their lands for property elsewhere they may reap up to 100 million more than the actual value of their land in compensation additionally they will be permitted to sell their exchange credits to others they can go to one corporation and rtc lands and exchange those credits to that company who in turn could buy land fdr 10 cents on the dollar that is not fair it is not right finally it takes more than 10 years to dispose of all the land they may be eligible for property seized by the unitedstates marshals such as the 9 acres in beackfront property in malibu no other desert landholder will get such a sweetheart deal i would love to get 9 acres in malibu if i had a little ranch in the desert and i think the chairman would also catellus stock sold at 38 per share back in 1989 before the real estate market collapsed but that is simply not justification to treat one landholder so much better than every other landholder this is not right the amendment is correct let us take the special interests and let us put catellus the same as everyone else and not give special interests to a gentlewoman from the other body"]], "top_unsure": [[0.5, 0.0, 0, "1 week ago over 300 republicansstood on the steps of the capitol and signed

and the government we have now is the culmination of his fears a bloated and ineffective mass that stretches itsconstitutional authority to the limit how bad is it this year with the introduction of his budget bill clinton claimed his administrations policies had solved the budget crisis his director of omb leon panetta stated that republicans would have killed to be able to offer this budget and we have been exposed to democrat after democrat crowing about the strength of the economy and their success at cutting the deficit what were they all cheering about according to clintons budget the deficit will fall to 175 billion next year then it will rise to 182 billion in 1997 256 billion in 2001 and 365 billion in 2004 in washington this is considered success obviously something stronger is needed despite these awesome numbers some groups still oppose the balanced budget amendment first they fear a balanced budget amendment will tie the hands of congress and force it to cut some programs in order to fund others in other words they fear that congress will have set priorities and stick with them that is not an argument against a balanced budget amendment its an argument for it if special interest groups object to the balanced budget amendment because it would restrict congress ability to spend and make the budget process less flexible lets pass it quickly unrestricted flexible spending is what created the deficit in the first place second there are those groups who question the effectiveness of a balanced budget amendment they claim it is just a feelgood measure which will fail to reduce the deficit and will add lots of unnecessary detail to the constitution someone should get the opponents of the amendment together and let them know their arguments contradict each other which is it will the balanced budget amendment will work or not the answer is the balanced budget amendment will establish the framework under which congress will have to make its spending decisions congress will still have to make the spending decisions but it will be done without the openended funding option now available this is the third time in the last 4 years the house will vote on a balanced budget amendment four years ago opponents of the balanced budget amendment argued that congress didnt need the amendment to balance our budget we have the power right now they argued to deal with our deficit without amending the constitution the house defeated the amendment by seven votes since then the federal debt has grown by over 1 trillion two years ago opponents of the balanced budget amendment argued that the amendment would demean the constitution tie congress hands and hurt the economy the house defeated the amendment by nine votes since then the federal debt has grown by

for that change and rightly so but they also want us to preserve the excellence and the choice they have come to expect and they dont want to see their health care costs go down only to see their taxes go up but as weve shown tonight in this debate all the canadian system can claim is that everyone has access to the system but you have to stop and ask yourself what is the quality of the system how long will i have to wait to getthe test or procedure i need how much more will i pay in taxes they promise that theyll be able to expand access to everyone and no one will have to pay more but remember what your mother told you if it sounds too good to be true it is they cite government estimates and reports produced by the cbo and gao but remember the government has never correctly estimated the cost of its programs thats why congress keeps going back to hardworking americans to ask them to pay more in taxes this case is no different their sole cost containment mechanism is simply to have the government say well have lower costs next year and then forbid hospitals from getting the latest and best equipment but is that how we want costs lowered fortunately there are other options out there if we want to control costs we should target the key cost drivers we should reform our malpractice system to eliminate the unnecessary procedures that are done simply to protect the provider if theyre dragged into court we should adopt a single insuranceform and electronic billing so that administrative costs are lowered we should tighten our fraud laws to eliminate this cost in our system we should reform our antitrust laws so that communities have the opportunity to coordinate the delivery of health care no longer will each hospital have to buy the latest and often most expensive diagnostic tool and if we want someone to control costs it should be the consumer in consultation with his her physician who decides if a treatment is appropriate or not we should allow the creation of medical savings accounts or medisave accounts that are integrated with a catastrophic plan let me explain how this would work on average employers nationwide pay 4 500 per year to buy health coverage for an employee family under our legislation employers would be encouraged to take 1 500 of that 4 500 and purchase a major medical insurance policy that would give employers everything they have now except the insurance policy would have a 3 000 deductible in other words the employee would pay the first 3 000 of health care costs the company would cover that possible 3 000 expense to employees by setting up a medical savings account in the employees name and depositing 3 000 in it each year whenever an employee needed medical service he would go get it wherever he chose and then would present a debit card and the bill would be paid from the 3 000 in his medical savings account anything he didnt spend at years end he would get to keep all of a sudden people have an incentive to make a choice between 200 at the emergency room or 50 at the doctors office because they are spending their own medical savings account money if a family had multiple illnesses the 3 000 would be spent from the account and then the major medical policy would kick in the employee is as well off as he is under the high premium low or no deductible plan he has today but if the employee be exercising prudence can save some of the 3 000 year after year that account can grow as a taxfree ira that money could then be used later in life to purchase longterm care or for other medical services the debate on health care reform has just begun whatever reforms we adopt we should make sure that it controls spiraling costs and makes health insurance affoidable most important we should make sure reform leaves the patient in charge of the health care decisions not the government thats a prescription for real change"]]}
