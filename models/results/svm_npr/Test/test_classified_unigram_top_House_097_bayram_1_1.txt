nearly a 100vote margin to increase the funding for the environmental protection agencys research program to last years appropriations level at that time it was made clear that such an increase was modest indeed given the epas new responsibilities with regard to toxic wastes and given the magnitude of the cuts in epas budget between 1981 and 1982 if we want to reaffirm the commitment we made 1 month ago to the epa budget and environmental protection we must vote today to bring the appropriations for epas research closer to the fiscal year 1982 appropriations level when we debated this issue previously i think we made obvious a contradiction in epa research policy on the one hand the agency is committed to improving the quality of scientific research that it uses to support our environmental standards that is a goal that all of us can enthusiastically endorse at the same time however the agency is cutting exactly those longterm research projects that keep the epa in the forefront of environmental science the point is obvious if the agency is going to focus its entire environmental program on shortterm regulatory needs the quality of its science will inevitably deteriorate that point has been underscored by the american chemical society which represents 125 000 chemists and engineers and which has enthusiastically endorsed the amendment to restore appropriations for epa research let me quote directly from the societys letter the scheuer amendment would increase funding for extramural research an area slated for drastic cuts by administration thereby allowing the agency to draw upon qualified creative experts outside epa who can assist in solving environmental problems the extramural program is critical because it is open to the entire scientific community including many of the best environmental scientists some of whom have become discouraged by their inability to have their work supported by funding through the epa laboratories the proposed additional funds will allow epa to increase its longrange research on emerging environmental problems it would be shortsighted to wait until such problems reach crisis proportions before attempting to develop the information that is needed for appropriate policies and regulations a lack of fundamental information is a major reason the agency has failed to meet some of the regulatory deadlines established by congress in summary the american chemical society believes that the house would be wise to accept the scheuer amendment i include the full text of the american chemical

responsibilities because it is beneath the dignity or not in the economic interests of the wealthy wall street lawyers to take their time pursuing the interests of the poor and the indigent well

with the many crosscurrents that accompany national emergencies poland was so blessed in the person of cardinal stefan wyszynski a courageous prudent farseeing and temperate spiritual leader who adroitly headed the polish catholic church of some 30 million souls for more than a generation the reach of this amazing prelates influence extended well beyond poland with the advent bf the papacy of john paul ii who at his inauguration indicated that it was because of his mentor wyszynski that the roman catholic church has its first polish pontiff 0 this symbol rept sents the time of day during the house proceedings e g o 1407 is 2 07 cardinal wyszynski spent much of his priestly life under the harsh anticlerical tyrannies of nazism and communism yet thanks to his brilliant leadership the polish catholic church today is far stronger than it was when he became primate of poland in 1949 in fact i believe it is fair to say that of the various current power centers in poland only the catholic church speaks for the vast majority of the polish people given what has transpired in postworld war ii poland that is a remarkable turn of events on a number of occasions during this period poland was rocked by domestic political troubles in each instance cardinal wyszynski played a pivotal role in the resolution of those problems primarily because he possessed the uncanny ability of knowing just when and how much to resist totalitarian rule and when to compromise without repudiating his principles adhering to those principles i might add cost him time in prison throughout that ordeal his paramount concern was that the church would never reject the will of its people for the better part of the last year the worlds attention has been riveted upon poland as we all know there have been moments when it appeared soviet intervention was imminent miraculously that has been avoided to date and much of the credit for that must go to cardinal wyszynski always able to keep things in perspective he skillfully served as a bridge between labor and government in a manner that inspired the confidence and trust of both parties i had the distinct honor and privilege of cochairing with our colleague clem zablocki the presidents delegation to the funeral of cardinal wyszynski the other members of the delegation were his eminence john cardinal krol archbishop of philadelphia

first grant came from the lilly drug foundation the money was soon matched and other grants have followed the organization has now blossomed into a 250 000 grantendowed operation the offices are on connecticut avenue and the operation is directed by former congressmen alternating parties each term in the first meeting of the association there were 60 former members now the body has grown to more than double the existing house membership and meets twice a year according to dr judd brooks hays had jokingly commented that neither of them would be remembered for great legislative acts or acts of courage rather that if they were remembered it would be for forming the former members of congress group in reminiscing about mr hays dr judd said brooks was not just known for his intellect dedication and unique way of capturing an issue in a story brooks hays would be remembered for his ability to win people over to his side dr judd said brooks hays would also be remembered for his ability to stand by the principle of an issue dr judd is right brooks hays was a man who embodied the best of this institution in defeat or victory brooks hays never stopped loving his colleagues his state nation or its people he also was a man who believed in standing beside a principle no matter what the cost brooks hays was a man with whom we all should be proud brooks hays was known far and wide for his sense of humor and wit hays used humor as a forensic tool he would use his sense of humor to win friends or to create an atmosphere for friendly discussion rather than yancorous debate of ten he would direct his humor at himself he would comment on his hairpiece saying wvhat god hath not wrought went out and bought he also liked to tell of his fathers answer to the question have you heard brooks last speech his father would answer i hope so ~ of brooks hays many talents one was his uncann rwit and his ability to transform it into writing in a review of hotbed of tranquility arthur schlesinger jr says this will undoubtedly be one of the most delicious political books of the year because brooks hays is a deeply serious man he is also a deeply witty man he cannot resist the comic perspective and he uses humor not as a technique of acquiescence but as a strategy of gentle subversion the following is a copy of mr schlesingers review of this american classic by mr hays i include it in the record at this point from the new york times book review"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "today you will hear a discussion of the defense of our country from a gardenvariety member who has the vanity to profess some knowledge in the field i received an army commission by completing the rotc course at kansas state university in 1938 i served in the army for 5 years in world war ii i was a member of the arizona national guard and army reserve prior to and for some years after my election to the congress i have a certificate of completion of the associate course of the armys command and general staff college i am now a retired colonel in the judge advocate generals corps more important i served for almost 5 years as a member of the defense subcommittee of the house appropriations committee later as minority leader of the house i was an ex officio member of the house intelligence committee i have a lasting personal interest in the field of geopolitics and in global strategy i have always classified myself as a hawk where matters of defense are concerned i feel that the communist world is absolutely serious in its intent to master the whole globe whenever it can do so it continues to probe where it can find weaknesses and if and when the ultimate weakness appears i have no doubt that it will move to take advantage of that situation as rapidly and effectively as possible yet i feel that our defense posture needs constant examination and reexamination right now is a period in our history when such reexamination is long overdue not only have we fallen behind the russians in some very important categories of armaments but our economic and fiscal situations are worrisome to say the least thus we have two problems first rearmament to deter effectively any attack and second rearming at a price our economy can support not easy the defense of the country must be a part of foreign policy and the framers of foreign policy must be constantly aware of our defense strengths and weaknesses too often persons in control of both our defense and foreign policies are individuals who have only superficial knowledge in the field or who have gathered their knowledge from having served in similar capacities in the past and are therefore guided by the methods and ideas of the past not since richard nixon have we had a president who really had a personal understanding of foreign policy not since dwight eisenhower have we had a president with a personal understanding of our defense needs and capabilities unfortunately the result has been a failure to develop our foreign policy and our defense strategy along the lines which would utilize the strength of america instead of building on our strength we have reacted to the initiatives both in diplomacy and in milltary developments of other nations too often ours has been a policy of response not innovation naturally other nations choose to center their activities in areas in which they are strong and we are weak as a result we are in effect playing in their ball park and by their rules not ours soviet russias great strength is the availability of huge quantities of manpower which hang like the sword of damocles over all of western europe the russian soldier can be inducted trained and maintained for a much smaller outlay of goods and services than can his american counterpart the russian soldier is used to the soviet society and economy a system in which ambitions are stultified by the limitation of opportunity on the other hand the american soldier eventually wants to get back into civilian life make some money provide security for himself and his family lead the good life and if he is very ambitious perhaps go to congress some day the result is that there is no way that the united states can except in an allout war situation compete with the russians in volume of manpower our military has problems in competing with the blandishnents of civilian lifetheirs does not so in preparation for war or in acting to deter it we should not rely on superiority in manpower we do not have it so where do we go you would think that a nation with the advanced technology and industrial capabilities which the united states possesses would be able to offset this manpower gap by the production and use of better and more sophisticated weapons but something is terribly wrong with the manner in which we utilize our economic power for military purposes for instance we seem to be incapable of building a tank which is the equal in firepower durability and maneuverability with those of other nations when i was on the defense subcommittee of the appropriations committee we finally had to give up on building the main battle tank mbt 70 i suggested to the then secretary of the army that it should not be too long before we could take the expertise that we had acquired from that abortive attempt and develop another tank he calmly told me that it would take 10 years to develop another tank i was never able to find out why this was so but obviously it was something must be wrong with the manner in which the pentagon sets about to develop a new tank and produce it and of course this is just one example we could go into many other areas such as attack helicopters in which we should excel and do not it is true that much of what we buy for the military is new and certainly is not for sale at any hardware store therefore cost overruns can be expected but i am bothered by the apparently widespread practice by defense cohtractors of making deliberately low estimates on the cost of new weapons systems the name of the game is to get the contract at any price get the military committed to you then raise the price the result is horrendous cost overruns there have to be better procurement methods than those we now use in other words eisenhower was ob viously right when he said that the military industrial complex needed to be watched it does and it is not being watched to the point that it must be in the future this adds up to a major defect in our military posturein our ability to build the best defense our economy can produce and can afford it must be remedied so why is it so necessary that we have a superior tank anyway we certainly need tanks to defend our own country and our own hemisphere but the main reason that we now need tanks is to blunt any armored attack by the russians across the north german plain our foreign policy and our defense policy are largely geared to defending western europe from a soviet attack we have some 350 000 american troops permanently stationed in germany for the purpose of containing such an attack until the total strength of nato can be mobilized to defeat the attack and hurl it back as a nation we have been preoccupied with western europe ever since world war i before world war i western europe was the undoubted master of the world through their co lonial systems the nations of western europe including england controlled most of the globe the industrial and technological might of western europe exceeded that of all the other nations of the world obviously if any one nation had been able to obtain hegemony over all of western europe that nation could have become the undisputed master of this globe the objective of our foreign policy was at that time and has been ever since to keep any nation or combination of nations from acquiring that hegemony but the situation today is entirely different the power of europe is infinitesimal compared to the dominant position which it occupied prior to world war i its colonial system is gone and while its scientific and technological capabilities are indeed formidable they are not in the dominant position which they ocupied in the early part of the century yet we continue to base much of our foreign policy and our military planning on the needs and wants of the nations of western europe i think it is becoming increasingly apparent that this policy needs to be reexamined keeping 350 000 troops in europe and keeping our total force ready to operate in a european war is obviously a real drain on our eonomy it is true that some european nations bear part of the expensesometimes grudgingly yet when we try to defend europe at less cost in assets and manpower we usually are met by firm opposition for instance president carter tried to get the agreement of the nations of europe to deploy a neutron bomb this weapons system if in place would be the most effective deterrent of all to a massed land attack by the unitedstatess r much better than any numer of allied tanks the neutron bomb could destroy soviet tanks and personnel without doing significant or lasting damage to the cities and populations of our allies in western europe it is ideal for the purpose of deterrence yet most of the governments of western europe will have no part of its deployment other than economically why was it necessary for us to have thi weapon a brief look at the map of europe should answer that question practically all of the american troops in europe are located in central and southern germany in the early days of the nato alliance these troops were supplied by supply lines across france from the french atlantic ports when de gaulle decided to in effect pull out of nato it became necessary for new supply lines to be established those lines run to the belgian dutch and german ports on the north sea thus supplies for american troops must cross the north german plain which of course is the most likely avenue of attack by the massed russian armies in a very few hours these supply lines could be interdicted and the american troops in germany could either be prisoners of war hostages or engaged in fighting desperately to maintain a defense perimeter without the requisite supplies of ammunition equipment and reinforcements an alliance which is truly reciprocal will last but one which is not has numbered days the refusal of the nato allies to allow deployment of the neutr n bomb certainly did not indicate any concern for the obviously exposed position of american troops in germany nor for the continued drain on the american economy is concern a oneway street in nato also i think we were all disappointed by the fact that the nations of western europe were so lukewarm in their support of our efforts to free the american hostages from our embassy in tehran i think it is also interesting that there is no plan for europe to take any part in the massive undertaking to defend the areas of the persian gulf from which comes most of the oil for europe in fact the nato nations have steadfastly refused to move outside of europe in effect leaving the rest of the free world for us to defend we even see some of our allies actively aiding rebels in central america against governments which have our backing if linkage is to be applied to our relatons with the unitedstatess r and it should be perhaps the same principle should apply to the actions or lack of action of our allies in various parts of the world i do not believe the nations of europe are adopting the policies which they now pursue because they do not like the united states they are doing so because they perceive their own best interests to be in a closer rapprochement and detente with eastern europe than we seem to want here is evidence they are perfectly willing to trust the future of much of their energy supplies to a gas pipeline from siberia which russia could cut off at a moments notice the energy supplied through this pipeline could be used by the russians to blackmail western europe western europes reactions to the invasion of afghanistan and to the polish situation have been measured to put it mildly it does seem possible that there is a conscious or unconscious policy in western europe to downgrade down play and perhaps eventually do away with american involvement in the affairs of that continent that might not be all bad in fact i think we should all consider the possibility that the relevance of the atlantic alliance is no longer as apparent as it used to be and that in our selfinterest and in theirs we should cease to center our foreign policy on western europe now let us turn to the middle east the obligations which we have to the state of israel are being fulfilled we can all wish that israel would realize that its best chance of ultimate survival is to have a tranquil peaceful middle east and that they would be more cooperative in working toward that end nevertheless the survival of israel and its capability to defend itself is very important to the united states and its people and will continue to be but speaking purely from selfinter est the middle easts oil reserves are the prime reasons for such intense american activity in that region today 30 9 percent of the worlds oil comes from the middle east and 55 8 percent of the known reserves of oil are in that area it is easy to see why people are preoccupied with keeping that oil available because unfortunately we are still in the oil age and probably will be for quite some time and yet when you consider the miles of ocean or air involved in our transporting and maintaining enough force to defend the persian gulf one must realize that defending it absolutely against a determined wellequipped locally based enemy is practically impossible nuclear weapons would be out of the question except in some tactical situations we could provide sufficient force to make it expensive for any enemy to conquer that part of the world but if the russians for instance persisted our prospects for ultimate victory are indeed small furthermore the danger of triggering world war iii is always present then nobody wins and everybody loses yet we are building a conventional rapid strike force at the expense of bilions of dollars the main purpose being for deployment in the area of the persian gulf i suggest that this defense buildup and the foreign policy which it seeks to implement are costing defense dollars which could be used better in other ways all right now where are we i have indicted willingness to withdraw our troops from europe i have also said that i would cut the rapid deployment force drastically i would tailor it for use only in the western hemisphere or perhaps in some of the nations of western africa now let me suggest another cut in defense i would not deploy the mx missile in anything resembling a racetrack i think the missile should be developed and some should be deployed however we should put them in superstrong silos and provide point defense systems i am not talking about deploying hundreds of mxs i am talking about deploying only a few whose survivability would be assured long enough to fire them at least for the present i would keep the minutemen which we now have deployed in order to make it very difficult for the russians to defeat spot defense systems by oversaturation deploying the mx in this manner would in my opinion save billions of dollars and accomplish the deterrence which we desire as well as the deployment of many hundreds would i would certainly continue to build and deploy the trident submarine and its very sophisticated missile system another saving i would make is to cease building the b1 bomber i once was a leading advocate of the b1 that was before the stealth concept came into the picture now i think we should go all out to develop stealth we will have a better more modern plane which the russians will have to match or find a way to defeat also the money spent on stealth in the next few critical budgetary years will be significantly less than the cash outlays for the b1 i am well aware of the problems of stealth but i have great confidence that they will be solved i am also aware that not building b1 may result in a defense gap in the middle and late 1980s personally i will take a chance on that i believe our deterrent even without b1 is sufficient the savings will cut the deficit or will allow us to mitigate some of the deep cuts made in funds for higher education now you are saying it looks like this guy is advocating unilateral disarmament nothing could be farther from the truth i said earlier that our defense systems are not geared to take advantage of the strengths of america but only to respond to the strengths of russia the strength of america is in our scientific and technological capabilities we have the capability now of putting satellites in orbit which would be able to defend themselves either with conventional weapons or beams and which would also have the capability of killing hostile intercontinental ballistic missiles before they can reach the point of reentry into the atmosphere eventually this capability would extend to destroying such missiles almost immediately after launch we can develop the technology to do this and it seems obvious to me that using that technology would be far better than building new missiles every time the russians do doing this we would truly be building a defensive system not an offensive one aimed at mass destruction the day of the mutually assured destruction theory of defense should be ended now it can be i am well aware that such a system would take some years to develop and deploy for that reason i would certainly keep most of the present systems which we have now for deterrence in good working order and well manned but there must come a time when we can say to the russians we can zap your missiles any time we want so let us each destroy our missiles and build no more operations in space are now being downgraded they should not be i am not a newcomer to the ranks of those who believe that the development of our capabilities in space is important not only to our civilian economy but to our defense i was on the independent offices subcommittee of the house appropriations committee when we committed the great acts of faith which resulted in funding manned space flight served to encourage and develop the various planetary probes which nasa has accomplished so brilliantly and redalted in the capability to produce reusable manned space vehicles such as the columbia to me with what military training i possess space represents a flank the high ground which we must occupy if we do not others will to our detriment we can do it we should do it and doing it will give us great benefits in the future one of those benefits is to develop sources of energy which would lessen considerably if not end our dependence on middle eastern oil and the consequent strains and distortions it causes in our economy and in our foreign policy the suns energy is there for the taking with the flights of the columbia and the attendant capability to produce satellites in orbit we can use suns rays with a photovoltaic array and produce huge amounts of electric power i am well aware of the environmentalproblems which production of that much power and its transfer through the atmosphere might cause i just happen to believe that the chances of success in developing power which could be made available anywhere in the world cheaply is so great that we would find ways to overcome whatever disadvantages might be inherent i am most unhappy with those portions of the reagan budget which have reduced governmental investment in research and development not only in solar energy but in fusion of the hydrogen atom and its isotopes we should be working contemporaneously on solar energy and fusion to the very limit of our capabilities not only would development of power from these sources be the means of deflecting the thrust of our defense dollars and our foreign policy away from the middle east and the persian gulf but it would be the means of providing the underdeveloped world with the wherewithal to work toward better lives for their people energy plus technology plus raw materials plus a good labor supply plus good management can make an industrialized nation out of an underdeveloped one in just a few years to sum up i would make the following changes to provide first a better defense second a sounder foreign policy not dependent on access to oil third a chance to build a peaceful affluent world population and fourth significant savings to our government which will help lower deficits cut the interest rate and provide a sound base for economic recovery first i would like our troops out of europe after consultation and hopefully i trust agreement with the nations of western europe second i would cut the mx program by at least 70 percent third i would abandon the b1 and proceed to perfect the stealth manned bomber fourth i would cut the rapid deployment force and change its mission to operate mainly in the western hemisphere fifth i would build a strategic defensive system in space and eventually would dismantle all ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads if other nations did the same and sixth i would proceed to build a consortium of interested nations to construct satellites in space to produce cheap electric energy for all and proceed full speed to develop electric energy from fusion of the hydrogen atom now i hope you realize that i know that all of these things cannot be accomplished overnight in fact i am probably talking about some things which should be accomplished within the next 50 years we must have a peaceful world or as admiral rickover said we will destroy ourselves for the next several years we will have to continue to rely on deterrence of aggressors but after that period of time we should have the most sophisticated defensive systems in the world in earth orbit and we should by then have been able to recruit most of the nations in the world in a mutual undertaking to provide cheap energy so that all the peoples of the globe can share in its wealth and its affluence this is the new frontier in years past when populations became restive and people got bored there was always new land to be utilized and put to the plow this is the new land and american science and technology are the plows which we must use to create a peaceful

last years appropriations level at that time it was made clear that such an increase was modest indeed given the epas new responsibilities with regard to toxic wastes and given the magnitude of the cuts in epas budget between 1981 and 1982 if we want to reaffirm the commitment we made 1 month ago to the epa budget and environmental protection we must vote today to bring the appropriations for epas research closer to the fiscal year 1982 appropriations level when we debated this issue previously i think we made obvious a contradiction in epa research policy on the one hand the agency is committed to improving the quality of scientific research that it uses to support our environmental standards that is a goal that all of us can enthusiastically endorse at the same time however the agency is cutting exactly those longterm research projects that keep the epa in the forefront of environmental science the point is obvious if the agency is going to focus its entire environmental program on shortterm regulatory needs the quality of its science will inevitably deteriorate that point has been underscored by the american chemical society which represents 125 000 chemists and engineers and which has enthusiastically endorsed the amendment to restore appropriations for epa research let me quote directly from the societys letter the scheuer amendment would increase funding for extramural research an area slated for drastic cuts by administration thereby allowing the agency to draw upon qualified creative experts outside epa who can assist in solving environmental problems the extramural program is critical because it is open to the entire scientific community including many of the best environmental scientists some of whom have become discouraged by their inability to have their work supported by funding through the epa laboratories the proposed additional funds will allow epa to increase its longrange research on emerging environmental problems it would be shortsighted to wait until such problems reach crisis proportions before attempting to develop the information that is needed for appropriate policies and regulations a lack of fundamental information is a major reason the agency has failed to meet some of the regulatory deadlines established by congress in summary the american chemical society believes that the house would be wise to accept the scheuer amendment i include the full text of the american chemical societys letter of endorsement at this point in the record and i ask that my colleagues support this important

permitted me to come within the bar of that curt he granted me a great privilege but concomitant with that privilege he also granted me a lot or responsibility the issue today is not whether poor people are entitled to legal services the issue today is whose responsibility is it to provide them for 15 years the congress of the united states has been trying to give people rights and take away their responsibilities the issue today is whether or not the legal business is a profession or a trade whether or not members of the bar have an obligation to do pro bono work one of the greatest deans of aiy law school ever in this country was dean carroll weathers and he spent many months in our senior year at wake forest law school instilling in us the history of the legal profession since the days of the greek citystates how advocacy was originally not something one pursued for gain or profit because ark advocate was not paid he was granted an honorarium but our legal profession wants to get rid of its responsibilities to the poor and have the american taxpayer assume those responsibilities because it is beneath the dignity or not in the economic interests of the wealthy wall street lawyers to take their time pursuing the interests of the poor and the indigent well actually we are doing the organized bar a great disservice by taking this responsibility away from them because once we do it then they become merely purveyors of their minds and their souls at the highest hourly rate because they have no responsibility that enures to their professlon somehow or another i do not think we will have done them a favor in the long run by taking away this responsibility we wm have denied them something special something that comes with being a professional i do not think any doctor in this country would deny a person needing an operation this operation because he could not pay for it if so they do not warrant the recognition that the hippocratic oath grants them but one thing is for sure if the legal profession does not pick up and assume the responsibilities to the poor the indigent it should not be the burden of the taxpayers of the united states to take up their responsibilities if we take it over they will never regain it and what was once a great and noble profession will degenerate into a mere craft"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "67 years ago the armenian people

nation is indeed fortunate when in times of crises a leader emerges with the capacity to cope effectively with the many crosscurrents that accompany national emergencies poland was so blessed in the person of cardinal stefan wyszynski a courageous prudent farseeing and temperate spiritual leader who adroitly headed the polish catholic church of some 30 million souls for more than a generation the reach of this amazing prelates influence extended well beyond poland with the advent bf the papacy of john paul ii who at his inauguration indicated that it was because of his mentor wyszynski that the roman catholic church has its first polish pontiff 0 this symbol rept sents the time of day during the house proceedings e g o 1407 is 2 07 cardinal wyszynski spent much of his priestly life under the harsh anticlerical tyrannies of nazism and communism yet thanks to his brilliant leadership the polish catholic church today is far stronger than it was when he became primate of poland in 1949 in fact i believe it is fair to say that of the various current power centers in poland only the catholic church speaks for the vast majority of the polish people given what has transpired in postworld war ii poland that is a remarkable turn of events on a number of occasions during this period poland was rocked by domestic political troubles in each instance cardinal wyszynski played a pivotal role in the resolution of those problems primarily because he possessed the uncanny ability of knowing just when and how much to resist totalitarian rule and when to compromise without repudiating his principles adhering to those principles i might add cost him time in prison throughout that ordeal his paramount concern was that the church would never reject the will of its people for the better part of the last year the worlds attention has been riveted upon poland as we all know there have been moments when it appeared soviet intervention was imminent miraculously that has been avoided to date and much of the credit for that must go to cardinal wyszynski always able to keep things in perspective he skillfully served as a bridge between labor and government in a manner that inspired the confidence and trust of both parties i had the distinct honor and privilege of cochairing with our colleague clem zablocki the presidents delegation to the funeral of cardinal wyszynski the other members of the delegation were his eminence john cardinal krol archbishop of philadelphia aloysius mazewski president polishamerican congress the honorable francis j meehan ambassador to poland the honorable william wilson the presidents personal envoy to the holy see and peter s bridges director eastern european affairs department of state also participating in the ceremony and of special meaning to me was the delegation from the archdiocese of detroit headed by his excellency edmund szoka archbishop of detroit who was accompanied by the reverend stanley milewski chancellor of orchard lake schools orchard lake mich mrs helen zielinska president of the polish womens alliance and mr joseph drobot president of the polish roman catholic union of america the outpouring of sympathy we witnessed for this towering religious figure has left me with poignant and lasting memories it also has caused me to realize what a legacy he leaves behind the poland we see today in many ways is the result of his efforts therefore while saluting his memory i pray that whoever is chosen as the next primate of poland will be able to build upon the wyszynski legacy and in so doing move poland toward a permanent solution to its most difficult internal problems"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a s a member of the foreign affairs coinmittee which recently visited the middle east i have returned encouraged and

arrested and imprisoned on charges of treason and espionage his real offense was a strong desire for freedom from the oppression of the soviet police state he has been incarcerated because his conscience would not permit him to stand idle in the face of persecution and injustice and he bravely protested soviet policies preventing emigration and threatening those who wish to practice their religion for those who do not consider the sovet government a threat to all individual liberty i urge careful attention to the case of anatoly shcharansky following his initial request for a visa anatoly lost his job soviet authorities made it extremely difficult for him to marry by refusing to grant permission for a civil ceremony and making lame excuses when anatoly finally was allowed to marry his wife was forced to leave the soviet union 1 day after their wedding this was only the beginning of shcharanskys struggle he faced 3 years of repeated harassment and surveillance by the kgb along with vicious attacks in the soviet press his wife remains waiting for him in israel shcharansky was imprisoned for well over a year with no trial and no opportunity to visit or even communicate
