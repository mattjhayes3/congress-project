gentlewomans perspective on that the 6ther thing i would note is that again this would be the only federal agency treated in this manner the only federal agency and there is really no justification for it i have heard a great deal about budget scoring and i cannot speak as to the author of this amendment but i suspect he along with others including myself stood in the well of this house many many times and spoke about the moronic perspective of scoring when it came to tax cuts we did not want that kind of scoring the same kind of scoring that is applied here we wanted dynamic scoring and if we were dynamically scoring i think we would be referring to the statistics provided by others including the envelope manufacturing association that says if this amendment were to pass it would result in the loss of 64 billion in tax revenues from those firms that use the postal service for mailing and such that pay sales taxes and others 245 000 jobs would be impacted just in the first year and 3 5 million jobs would be impacted over 10 years all of whom are taxpayers so if we are dynamically scoring as all of us who were so strongly in support of it when it came to the tax cuts this

that we were headed for a financial tsunami not long after the baby boomers start retiring in large numbers over the next few years the reasons are really pretty simple first we are trying to do way too much for other countries we have spent 300 billion in the last 3 years in iraq and afghanistan probably over half of it is just pure foreign aid we have every department and agency in the federal government doing operations overseas spending several hundred billion a year over there the liberal stand out here is that foreign aid was not popular so they will very possibly tell you that foreign aid is only 12 percent of the budget when we add up what all the departments and agencies are doing it is just phenomenal how much we are spending in other countries i heard a news report recently that said the fbi has more offices in other countries than we have in the unitedstates secondly we have promised too much here at home in retirement and medical benefits thirdly we will not reduce defense or homeland security spending even though there is waste in those departments just like all the other departments and there just simply is not enough money to pay for all of it on january 26 of this year the congressional budget office said the federal deficit for this fiscal year which ends september 30 will be around 360 billion some people say it will be much higher than that and similar amounts 350 billion to 400 billion for each of the next 10 or 11 years all of this comes on top of the national debt that is already 8 3 trillion and headed up very quickly our government in just a few years will not be able to pay all of the military pensions the civil service pensions the social security the medicare the medicaid and the new prescription drug benefit we have guaranteed 44 million private pensions through the pension benefit guaranty corporation we will just not be able to pay all those things with money that means anything but what we will do we will do what governments all over the world have done in similar situations and we will simply begin printing more money this will cause social security and all those government and private pension plans to buy less each year it doesnt work it is like a ball headed downhill its starts out slow and gathers speed when this money supply gimmick does not do enough pensions will have to be cut anyone who is relying just on social security for his or her retirement will face tremendous financial hardship all of this could be avoided if the congress would become much more fiscally conservative and do it now however because there are too many liberal big spenders in the congress aind because it is unpopular to say no to anyone the congress could not even late last year pass a 50 billion slowdown in spending spreadover the next 5 years the overall reduction was reduced to 39 5 billion with the bulk of the reductions put off until the fourth and fifth years the plan that was passed did not cut spending it simply slowed the rate of growth barely but of course even that very meager effort at fiscal restraint could be changed by the next congress now let me go to a totally different topic mr speaker another concern at the end of 1994 the conservative business magazine forbes carried a lengthy article about the justice department it said we had quadrupled the justice department since 1980 and that federal prosecutors were falling all over themselves trying to find cases to prosecute the article said people were being prosecuted for laws they didnt even know were in existence and then the congress trying to prove it was tough on crime has expanded the department of justice greatly since then in addition to all this expansion we then passed a socalled patriot act to try to show strong opposition to terrorism this was such a great expansion of government power and such an overreach that now approximately 400 cities and counties and seven state legislatures have passed resolutions against this act those who love big government love the patriot act the federal government through the supersecret national security agency in addition to the cia fbi and about 12 other intelligence agencies has more than enough power and ways and means to discover and prosecute terrorists the foreign intelligence surveillance act court created in 1978 approveal 18 742 warrants for wiretapping and physical surveillance by the end of 2004 in the 5 years from 2000 to 2004 the court received 6 650 requests from the government and approved 6 642 we will probably hav e another terrorist incident of some sort with or without the patriot act we need to take reasonable precautions but we also need to recognize that you are still hundreds of times more likely to be struck by lightning or to win a lottery than you are to be killed by a terrorist those in charge of all the many government programs which have sprung up to fight terrorism do not like to admit this because they want continual increases in funding but we should not create some kind of a federal police state in a huge overreaction to this threat it is sad that conservatives who have always been the main opponents of big government have gone along with this huge expansion of government power just because the word terrorism is used by every government agency to get more money and power"], [0.0, 0.0, 0,

states h r 4954 takes important strides to accomplish this by requiring the department of homeland security to deploy nuclear and radiological detection systems at 22 important seaports by the end of fy07 additionally this legislation puts an emphasis on traininga key component to readiness our port police local law enforcement and longshoremen need an established training program with set guidelines from homeland security to deal with security breaches and terrorist attacks this bill will create one for containers in transit to our shores this legislation requires the secretary of homeland security to develop standards for sealing containers en route to the united states the safe ports act boosts private sector investment into security by devoting 25 million a year to forge private public partnerships to bring new technologies and techniques to market faster for overseas ports this bill realizes that our homeland security does not end at our borders instead we need to take a global approach to the way we protect our nation including our ports this legislation requires dhs to gather more information from cargo importers it codifies the existing container security initiative which enables dhs to examine high risk maritime cargo at foreign ports h r 4954 represents an important step in enhancing our homeland security systems as a representative from southeastern pennsylvania whose lies within an hours distance or less from the ports of philadelphia and newark additionally my own district is home to a deepwater port that is badly in need of enhanced security measures i am voting for this act so that my backyard and the backyards of my constituents will not become the site of the next terrorist attack i call on my colleagues to support this legislation"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a couple points with respect to the gentlewomans comments about the 1971 legislation she is right but she is also a little behind because that is why we are making changes h r 22 in fact applies antitrust provisions against the postal service overturning the 1971 bill we require taxes paid on the business computations for the competitive products portion of the postal service again overchanging the 1971 bill so that is what this is all about i am glad i had the opportunity to update the gentlewomans perspective on that the 6ther thing i would note is that again this would be the only federal agency treated in this manner the only federal agency and there is really no justification for it i have heard a great deal about budget scoring and i cannot speak as to the author of this amendment but i suspect he along with others including myself stood in the well of this house many many times and spoke about the moronic perspective of scoring when it came to tax cuts we did not want that kind of scoring the same kind of scoring that is applied here we wanted dynamic scoring and if we were dynamically scoring i think we would be referring to the statistics provided by others including the envelope manufacturing association that says if this amendment were to pass it would result in the loss of 64 billion in tax revenues from those firms that use the postal service for mailing and such that pay sales taxes and others 245 000 jobs would be impacted just in the first year and 3 5 million jobs would be impacted over 10 years all of whom are taxpayers so if we are dynamically scoring as all of us who were so strongly in support of it when it came to the tax cuts this would not be even an issue let me just state here is what the postal service says about this particular amendment if the hensarling amendment is adopted the postal service will be in worse financial situation then it occupied before the csrs overfunding was identified and corrected if the hensarling amendment is adopted the total of these four payments would be 97 billion over the next 10 years that is a tax on the american mailing public and i think we ought to resist this amendment"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a few months ago a columnist for the scrippshoward newspaper chain wrote a column saying that we were headed for a financial tsunami not long after the baby boomers start retiring in large numbers over the next few years the reasons are really pretty simple first we are trying to do way too much for other countries we have spent 300 billion in the last 3 years in iraq and afghanistan probably over half of it is just pure foreign aid we have every department and agency in the federal government doing operations overseas spending several hundred billion a year over there the liberal stand out here is that foreign aid was not popular so they will very possibly tell you that foreign aid is only 12 percent of the budget when we add up what all the departments and agencies are doing it is just phenomenal how much we are spending in other countries i heard a news report recently that said the fbi has more offices in other countries than we have in the unitedstates secondly we have promised too much here at home in retirement and medical benefits thirdly we will not reduce defense or homeland security spending even though there is waste in those departments just like all the other departments and there just simply is not enough money to pay for all of it on january 26 of this year the congressional budget office said the federal deficit for this fiscal year which ends september 30 will be around 360 billion some people say it will be much higher than that and similar amounts 350 billion to 400 billion for each of the next 10 or 11 years all of this comes on top of the national debt that is already 8 3 trillion and headed up very quickly our government in just a few years will not be able to pay all of the military pensions the civil service pensions the social security the medicare the medicaid and the new prescription drug benefit we have guaranteed 44 million private pensions through the pension benefit guaranty corporation we will just not be able to pay all those things with money that means anything but what we will do we will do what governments all over the world have done in similar situations and we will simply begin printing more money this will cause social security and all those government and private pension plans to buy less each year it doesnt work it is like a ball headed downhill its starts out slow and gathers speed when this money supply gimmick does not do enough pensions will have to be cut anyone who is relying just on social security for his or her retirement will face tremendous financial hardship all of this could be avoided if the congress would become much more fiscally conservative and do it now however because there are too many liberal big spenders in the congress aind because it is unpopular to say no to anyone the congress could not even late last year pass a 50 billion slowdown in spending spreadover the next 5 years the overall reduction was reduced to 39 5 billion with the bulk of the reductions put off until the fourth and fifth years the plan that was passed did not cut spending it simply slowed the rate of growth barely but of course even that very meager effort at fiscal restraint could be changed by the next congress now let me go to a totally different topic mr speaker another concern at the end of 1994 the conservative business magazine forbes carried a lengthy article about the justice department it said we had quadrupled the justice department since 1980 and that federal prosecutors were falling all over themselves trying to find cases to prosecute the article said people were being prosecuted for laws they didnt even know were in existence and then the congress trying to prove it was tough on crime has expanded the department of justice greatly since then in addition to all this expansion we then passed a socalled patriot act to try to show strong opposition to terrorism this was such a great expansion of government power and such an overreach that now approximately 400 cities and counties and seven state legislatures have passed resolutions against this act those who love big government love the patriot act the federal government through the supersecret national security agency in addition to the cia fbi and about 12 other intelligence agencies has more than enough power and ways and means to discover and prosecute terrorists the foreign intelligence surveillance act court created in 1978 approveal 18 742 warrants for wiretapping and physical surveillance by the end of 2004 in the 5 years from 2000 to 2004 the court received 6 650 requests from the government and approved 6 642 we will probably hav e another terrorist incident of some sort with or without the patriot act we need to take reasonable precautions but we also need to recognize that you are still hundreds of times more likely to be struck by lightning or to win a lottery than you are to be killed by a terrorist those in charge of all the many government programs which have sprung up to fight terrorism do not like to admit this because they want continual increases in funding but we should not create some kind of a federal police state in a huge overreaction to this threat it is sad that conservatives who have always been the main opponents of big government have gone along with this huge expansion of government power just because the word terrorism is used by every government agency to get more money and power"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a free and prosperous iraq is one which is no longer a breeding ground for terrorism no longer a wealth of support for radical islam no longer a source of destabilization in the middle east the simple truth is that an iraqi people with hope for the future is an iraqi people with whom we can work for peace and nobody knows this better than the terrorists themselves they know they win only if they can maintain a strong divisive bloody insurgency in iraq they know they only win if they can keep the iraqi people feeling despondent for their future let me be clear the litmus test for whether or troops should stay or withdraw or on what timetable is not about nationbuilding the unitedstates should not be in the business of nationbuilding now or ever there is nothing in the constitution which grants this congress the authority to engage in nationbuilding nor does the american public wish that we do so instead the nation which we must always remain steadfast engaged in protecting and building up is this nationamerica the future of the iraqi people is in their hands and left to their imagination but the truth of the matter is that life for the iraqi peopledespite the ongoing war on their soil has been more hopeful than it was before wasting away in the shackles of saddam husseins tyranny and it is only getting better for those iraqis who survived saddams policies of genocide political imprisonment and nearconstant state of war they went without jobs food and medicine all the while saddam and his cronies pocketed billions in illicit oil profits and grew fat from oilforfood program kickbacks the iraqis have had increasingly broad and successful elections they have developed a constitution and established a government just last week the iraqis appointed key ministers for defense national security and interior now that the iraqi people are free to direct their own economy their own policies and their own destiny there is hope for a brighter future just last year in 2005 the iraqi economy grow by 3 percent this year economists predict that the economy will grow by 10 percent with a7 gdp that will have almost doubled since the fall of saddam hussein as freely elected economic officials begin to work for the benefit of all iraqis the future of the iraqi economy is bright the iraqi people are rebuilding their capability to care for their own medical needs last year 98 percent of children under the age of three were vaccinated against measles mumps and rubella basic care has been provided for 1 5 million new mothers and their children ensuring that a new generation of iraqis will grow up strong and healthy over 110 medical facilities have been renovated and 600 centers have been equipped with basic clinical and lab equipment by providing training for 2 500 health care workers iraqis will build a structure for living longer healthier lives far into the future iraq once boasted one of the most educated female populations in the middle east under saddam husseins iron fist they fell to near perfect illiteracy working together we have helped the iraqis provide for 2 800 rehabilitated schools and 8 7 million math and science textbooks and young girls can look forward to careers as engineers and scientists instead of looking forward to legalized honor killings the preamble of the iraqi constitution reads we the people of iraq are determined to respect the rule of law reject the policy of aggression pay attention to women and their rights the elderly and their cares the children and their affairs spread the culture of diversity and defuse terrorism this is a statement rarely seen in the history of middle eastern nations iraqi legislators are determined to create a free society on par with our own the future of iraq is one in which men and women are free to practice their religion and speak their mind without fear of imprisonment or death every one of us feels for the parents and loved ones of the brave men and women who are serving in iraq every one of us wants to see those young heroes quickly and safely return home i would like to read from a message i received from one of those brave young men who is serving in iraq he said there is a tough war going on here but we can either fight the enemy here or back at home if we
