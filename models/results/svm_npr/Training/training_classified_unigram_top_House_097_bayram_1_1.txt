greater legitimacy and established a firm basis for their right to exist these small countries when grouped together occupy about the same amount of territory as new england yet they have given the world much through their culture and knowledge and will continue to do so in the future when the baltic states first became independent they were constantly under pressure from their two powerful and

oppressed by colonial overlords however with some assistance from friendly nations we carried through a revolution and established our freedom as the united states of america thus it is incumbent on us to vocally support those people whose nations have been forcibly invaded and occupied the inhumane actions of the soviet union cannot be legitimized simply by waiting for the nations of the west to forget all about the baltic states for that reason we have introduced a resolution in the house house resolution 526 which reaffirms the unitedstates recognition of the baltic states in 1922 fortyfour members of the house have cosponsored this resolution and i am confident that many more will do so in the near future when this measure is passed by the house of representatives it will send a strong

1940 the soviet union forcibly and unlawfully incorporated latvia within its domain and set out systematically to destroy the countrys national cultural linguistic and religious integrity to accomplish this they practiced every tactic of terrorism imprisonment exile torture and murder it is out of outrage for this barbarous injustice that the united states along with other great western powers steadfastly maintains a policy of nonrecognition of the forcible annexation of latvia a national independence day is supposed to be a time of celebration so what do we have to celebrate latvia is still a captive nation the baltic freedom fighters who for years waged guerrilla warfare in the face of impossible odds have finally been crushed all dissident activities have been driven underground and the people of latvia are daily denied the elemental rights of human beings so what do we have to celebrate we have the fact that despite unrelenting oppression the latvians fierce love

members of congress that a balanced budget is needed then maybe the realization that washington now spends 22 000 every second of the day will convince those members who do not favor a balancedbudget amendment the very fact that the amount of federal spending per average household increased 46 percent during the 4 years of the carter administrationfrom 5 026 in fiscal year 1976 to 7 329 in fiscal 1980 is alarming and not acceptable to the american taxpayer ii18319 without a spending limitation members of congress can accommodate one spending interest and gain political capital without reducing other spending programs and facing political disadvantages the political costs of excessive spending are deferred resulting in high inflation huge deficits and higher taxes while the political benefits of the spending are immediately appreciated by those affected by the program and the congessmen who support it a similar process and economic growth automatically generate more revenue without the need for a potentially unpopular tax increase taxpayers are the losers under the present system unlike the pressure groups the taxpayers are woefully unorganized and have varying interests when programs are examined on an individual basis the cost to each taxpayer is barely noticeable but when the costs of all the programs are added the impact is severe the requirements of balancing the budget and limiting the growth in spending will give the taxpayers an qual opportunity to influence spending discussions through the ballot box under the balancedbudget amendment congressmen will be forced to remain aware of public opinion because the votes for deficit spending and tax increases will be voted directly on those issues this should result in an examination of priorities when programs are considered the spending limitation will force congress to make choices which should lead to more efficient government the american people are demanding that congress balance the budget today we have the opportunity to carry out the will of the people and this is one congressman who will be voting to support the people of this country it is clear that the american budget process is seriously deficient it is also apparent that the public is concerned about federal spending and is willing to use the constitutional means to change the system in a september 1981 gallup poll 67 percent of those surveyed favored a constitutional amendment to balance the budget and restrict spending only 19 percent were opposed this support cut across traditional political lines the ultimate question then is not whether a constitutional amendment should 1 t ed but whether this is the best one possible house joint resolution 350 possesses economic and political virtues vital to the health of the american system the elimination or sharp reduction in deficit spending and the limitation on spending will reduce inflationary monetary policies and allocate more financial resources to the private sector the provisions that would force open votes he congress on deficit spending and tax increases will significantly reduce the budget process bias toward spending by increasing individual

lithuania and latvia into the international arena from that moment in 1922 these new nations achieved even greater legitimacy and established a firm basis for their right to exist these small countries when grouped together occupy about the same amount of territory as new england yet they have given the world much through their culture and knowledge and will continue to do so in the future when the baltic states first became independent they were constantly under pressure from their two powerful and aggressive neighbors germany and russia estonia lithuania and latvia were the object of many political quarrels between the two huge countries nearby who fought over the natural resources available in the area eventually as everyone here tonight knows the russians entered the baltic states and took control of the governments at that time the many balts who protested were arrested sent out ot the country or killed here in the united states it is difficult to realize how hard the struggle for freedom has been for the baltic people but we cannot forget that not long ago we americans were oppressed by colonial overlords however with some assistance from friendly nations we carried through a revolution and established our freedom as the united states of america thus it is incumbent on us to vocally support those people whose nations have been forcibly invaded and occupied the inhumane actions of the soviet union cannot be legitimized simply by waiting for the nations of the west to forget all about the baltic states for that reason we have introduced a resolution in the house house resolution 526 which reaffirms the unitedstates recognition of the baltic states in 1922 fortyfour members of the house have cosponsored this resolution and i am confident that many more will do so in the near future when this measure is passed by the house of representatives it will send a strong signal to the soviet union that we have not forgotten the plight of the baltic nations i would like to enter the text of the resolution into the record"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "63 years ago today the people of latvia proudly announced to the world their existence as a free and independent nation in doing so they exercised one of the most basic of human rights the right to an identity as a people their freedom however lasted barely over two decades what happened to them is the history of all nonrussian states within the unitedstatess r a history of brutal expansionism and tyranical oppression in 1940 the soviet union forcibly and unlawfully incorporated latvia within its domain and set out systematically to destroy the countrys national cultural linguistic and religious integrity to accomplish this they practiced every tactic of terrorism imprisonment exile torture and murder it is out of outrage for this barbarous injustice that the united states along with other great western powers steadfastly maintains a policy of nonrecognition of the forcible annexation of latvia a national independence day is supposed to be a time of celebration so what do we have to celebrate latvia is still a captive nation the baltic freedom fighters who for years waged guerrilla warfare in the face of impossible odds have finally been crushed all dissident activities have been driven underground and the people of latvia are daily denied the elemental rights of human beings so what do we have to celebrate we have the fact that despite unrelenting oppression the latvians fierce love of liberty and commitment to national identity has not diminished by one jot their experience should remind us how privileged we are to live in the free world and should spur us to help people everywhere who are struggling against persecution i am honored therefore to join with latvians around the world in celebrating their independence day and i join them too in working and praying for the day when latvia will once again be free in fact as

federal spending of 14 031 per day during each day of his presidency abraham lincoln spent an average of 2 4 million per day during his wartime presidency among 20thcentury presidents theodore roosevelt spent 1 7 million franklin roosevelt spent 82 7 million john kennedy spent 210 5 million and jimmy carter spent 1 3 billion it took 186 years to raise the annual federal spending to a level of 100 billion it then took only 9 more years to double that figure to 200 billion four yeexs later federal spending reached 300 billion and in just 2 more years it reached the 400 billion mark federal outlays exceeded 500 billion in fiscal year 1980 600 billion in fiscal year 1981 and are projected to exceed 700 billion in fiscal year 1982 if this is not enough to convince the members of congress that a balanced budget is needed then maybe the realization that washington now spends 22 000 every second of the day will convince those members who do not favor a balancedbudget amendment the very fact that the amount of federal spending per average household increased 46 percent during the 4 years of the carter administrationfrom 5 026 in fiscal year 1976 to 7 329 in fiscal 1980 is alarming and not acceptable to the american taxpayer ii18319 without a spending limitation members of congress can accommodate one spending interest and gain political capital without reducing other spending programs and facing political disadvantages the political costs of excessive spending are deferred resulting in high inflation huge deficits and higher taxes while the political benefits of the spending are immediately appreciated by those affected by the program and the congessmen who support it a similar process and economic growth automatically generate more revenue without the need for a potentially unpopular tax increase taxpayers are the losers under the present system unlike the pressure groups the taxpayers are woefully unorganized and have varying interests when programs are examined on an individual basis the cost to each taxpayer is barely noticeable but when the costs of all the programs are added the impact is severe the requirements of balancing the budget and limiting the growth in spending will give the taxpayers an qual opportunity to influence spending discussions through the ballot box under the balancedbudget amendment congressmen will be forced to remain aware of public opinion because the votes for deficit spending and tax increases will be voted directly on those issues this should result in an examination of priorities when programs are considered the spending limitation will force congress to make choices which should lead to more efficient government the american people are demanding that congress balance the budget today we have the opportunity to carry out the will of the people and this is one congressman who will be voting to support the people of this country it is clear that the american budget process is seriously deficient it is also apparent that the public is concerned about federal spending and is willing to use the constitutional means to change the system in a september 1981 gallup poll 67 percent of those surveyed favored a constitutional amendment to balance the budget and restrict spending only 19 percent were opposed this support cut across traditional political lines the ultimate question then is not whether a constitutional amendment should 1 t ed but whether this is the best one possible house joint resolution 350 possesses economic and political virtues vital to the health of the american system the elimination or sharp reduction in deficit spending and the limitation on spending will reduce inflationary monetary policies and allocate more financial resources to the private sector the provisions that would force open votes he congress on deficit spending and tax increases will significantly reduce the budget process bias toward spending by increasing individual accountability the amendment moreover provides enough flexibility to allow for the smooth running of government as well as political disincentives to prevent violation excessive federal spending and deficits have become so ingrained in government today that a constitutional amendment is necc ary to limit this spending the oppon ents of the balancedbudget amendment argue that it will hamstring the ability of government to function efficiently what will hamstring the ability of government to expand is the balancedbudget amendment and i will argue that this will help the government to operate more efficiently not less the american taxpayer deserves to be heard and the federal government needs imposed discipline the balancedbubget amendment house joint resolution 350 should be passed and those who are really for a strong america for jobs and reducing a runaway federal budget will vote for house joint resolution 350"]]}
