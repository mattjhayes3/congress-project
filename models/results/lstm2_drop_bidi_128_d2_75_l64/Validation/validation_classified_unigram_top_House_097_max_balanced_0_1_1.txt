man has become a symbol of the despair that farmers feel that man is wayne cryts of missouri who defies court orders to protect his property and was ordered to jail in russellville ark cryts has said with his actions by taking his grain from an elevator when that grain was considered the asset of the ele dtor in a bankruptcy case last year and by refusing to tell the court larl week who helped him remove that grain what many farmers are feeling throughout america and across this great land today that the circumstances facing farmers are frightening and uncertain and that the future is grim i respect the strength of this mans conviction cryts imprisonment is a symbol that the farmers are beginning what one newspaper has called a crusade of peaceful outrace it is sad that this mans personal sacrifice will be that which will awaken many to the hard times facing our farmers today just today the rural electric cooperatives met in the halls of congress and one of the pamphlets that they are handing out to members and to interested citizens is entitled aard times in rural america we are exploring many of the issues relating to the farm economy today limited time does not permit us to discuss each and every problem that need to be addressed i mentioned mr cryts as an illustration of the multitude of problems facing the agricultural community in every aspect of the agricultural scene there is a difference this yearin the grim tightlipped expressions of farmers as they watch expensive farm machinery pulverizing the earth for planting fear of the future is found on their faces and the faces of the farm community as well as all others outside the agricultural sector who realize the significance of what they are seeing most writeoff 1982 as a year in which they will be lucky to hold their own the farmer has always played against high odds of the weather and of other circumstances but this year the odds are greater stacked against them by the administrations policies that are keeping interest rates high therefore increasing the cost of pro duction and choking off exports by an overvaluation of the dollar which prices unitedstates farm products out of the world market farm income when adjusted to inflation is currently at its lowest level since 1932 the unitedstates department of agriculture estimates 1981 receipts at 147 7 billion 4 6 percent above 1980 but production expenses were estimated at 8 5 higher than 1980 over the past decade farm production costs have risen on the average about 21 2 times compared with an average increase in farm prices received for products of about 2v times the outlook for this year is that it will be worse than any single year since the great depression the good news is that some production costs are expected to moderate the bad news is that since cash receipts are flat even a modest increase will leave farm income lower net farm income is expected to fall to 14 billion in 1982 according to a snittker associates study as a further indication of the ills of the farm economy let me point out that 1980 and 1981 were the first years since 1933 and 1934 that there were back to back years when production costs were more than the farmer earned the administration continues to predict economic recovery economists say it will not come or will be short lived if interest rates remain high the farmer has no control over an economy that is stagnant because of the effects of high interest rates the administration does the major driving force behind the high interest rates is the current policy mix of extremely high and rising deficits and a very tight money policy i will go into some avenues of correction to control interest rates later but first let me mention some of the current situations facing farmers and the subsequent impact that high interest rates are having surplus crop supplies depressed commodity prices and ballooning federal deficits prompted the usda in january to request that farmers voluntarily restrict 1982 plantings of feed grains wheat cotton andfor the first timerice good weather and other incentives to produce grain have resulted in 198182 world grain being up over year ago levels last fall the increase in planting did not secn excessive because beginning reserves were low reduced crops elsewhere in the world provoked optimism for exports since the harvest however market prices for grain have reflected pessimism rather than optimism why first the persistence of high interest rates has caused the cost of holding grain to escalate if the farmer cannot sell the crop and pay off his loan interest costs build because of this buyers are delaying purchases until needed for useand the producer is the one stuck with footing the bill for storage second also storage costs lre being transferred to the unitedstates farmer y our traditional buyers who are having storage problems of their own due to the glut on the market an example is the current situation with south korea korea has not honored its commitment to buy 500 000 metric tons of rice this crop year and is forcing the american farmer and american taxpayer to pick up the tab for storage which by all rights it should be paying third there are other factors hurting our export trade economic problems in poland have affected the ability of other eastern european countries to obtain credit to finance grain imports and the unitedstates dollar has remained strong throughout much of the 198182 marketing year making unitedstates grain relatively expensive for importers chase econometrics reports in its annual unitedstates fo d and agriculture forecast and analy is total meat and poultry production rose 1 5 percent in 1981 a rate of increase which was too great to support livestock prices at 1980 levels in the face of weak consumer demand and inflating farm to retail marketing margins declining producer prices combined with sharply higher feed costs to cause livestock producers the most severe loss situation since the grain price runups of 197374 chase econometrics reports losses have been so unremitting that the inventory of cattle on feed was at its lowest in january of 1982 since 1975 the cattle industry risks entering into a liquidation and hog producers have cut herds by 9 percent there is not a viable option of borrowing to sustain operations until the situation improves interest rates are too high despite and outlook for sharply lowered feed prices in 1982 the continuing recession will make it another very difficult year for livestock producers as the recession limits prices profits and cash receipts large supplies of farm commodities and weak demand due to world recession will constrain any significant advance in farm prices and farm income in 1982 under these circumstances even ebbing inflation will cause farm income to fall again in 1982 unless action is taken to stem highinterest rates and to stimulate exportation total farm cash receipts are expected to approximate 144 billion this year less than 1 percent above 1981 not only will total 1982 cash receipts fall in constant dollars but even a small advance in production expenses will result in further decline in current net income analysts for chase econometrics say every 1percent increase in production expensesand remember production costs have risen 8 5 percent already in 1981will result in a decline of 1 5 billion in net farm income in addition to the 8 5percent increase in production costs for 1981 another increase of 3 to 4 percent is expected in 1982 realized net income is forecast by usda to fall to 14 billion this year the lowest since the depression the farmer is not sitting comfortably in the white house trying out new economic theory he is the bottom line he knows firsthand the results of highinterest ratesskyrocketing farm debt increased farm sales liquidations of assets to pay off loans bankruptcies and foreclosures the old saying he bought the farm is taking on almost a literal correlation to the figurative allusion to death the farm as we know it is approaching a death due to a bad case of reaganitis interest rates are so high many farmers cannot repay their debts here is what has happened the national rate of delinquency on farmers home administration loans was placed at 58 percent in a january quarterly report of the fmha

and work as follows it seems altogether right that the con gress should be setting aside time to taki note of the hundredth anniversary of fior ello la guardias birth as one who in writ ing a biography of the mayoral years ha lived in imagination with his deeds and per scnality i am glad of the opportunity of fered me by congressman bingham to pay brief tribute la~u rdias record as congressman wil undoubtedly be recalled by others by itsel it was sufficient to give him a place in histo ry but his twelve years in the office of nei yorks mayor carrying him through th crises of depression and war saw hir making an absolutely unique contributior he may be said to have been the first o modern mayors and to have made nei york during his time the first of moder cities when he came to office nine months after franklin roosevelts inauguration the city lay crushed by debt riddled with corruption and reeling under the burden of unemployment physically the city was still in the last stages of the nineteenth century its neighborhoods isolated from another its various boroughs aggressively independent and the whole lacking the centralizing force of social services or of advanced means of transportation by his dynamic energy and unchallengeable rectitude laguardia changed all this the new york he left behind him was largely the city of today with its highways its bridges and all the subtle forces of cohesion that make it one a throbbing and intensely alive place through his association with the leaders of the new dealan association assiduously cultivatedlaguardia brought new york into an unprecedentedly close relations with the national government roosevelt needed a laboratory where his social legislation could be made highly visible to all where his reforms could be administered honestly efficiently and with compassionate zeal la guardia for his part needed the cold cash which roosevelt ickes and hopkins could supply from these mutual needs a partnership was forged between new york and washington which has left its mark upon subsequent urban history no one today can think of national policy as being disassociated from the welfare of urban america laguardia had his troubles and suffered his defeats at the hands of washington roosevelt never concealed the fact that he would have preferred to have his new deal reforms introduced by a city administration that was not only honest but also under the control of a reliably democratic machine laguardia was a republican and a fusionist and he had not the slightest intention of yielding to the importunities of boss flynn yet as so often happens where men of conviction but also of good will are concerned the two sides surmounted their differences in the main if roosevelt never gave laguarldia the kind of post in the national administration he hungered for he did at least treat him benignly and receive his pleas with consideration the figure of la~uardia survives in popular imagery the small doughty fighter against organized crime the attender of countless fires the avuncular reader of comic strips over the radio he was spunky stubborn often unforgiving yet when he made one major mistake he could disarmingly admit it to have been a beaut he had his shortcomings he overbuild the city with parks and hospitals that could not be adequately maintained in subsequent years he never faced up to raising the fivecent fare and he left a threatening budgetary situation when all is accounted for he can be said to have possessed the true magic of politics he made public events seem impor tant to a wide and diverse constuency he somehow convinced the men and women of his time that in struggling for a better city in fighting the battle for decency day by s day they were not foredoomed to fail i would like to assoclate myself with mr heckschers words as well as those of my col 1 league mr biaggie f a mr anderson it gives me great pleasure to join my w good friend and colleague maric e biaggi in honoring the 100th anniver sary of the birth of fiorello la guar dia a former member of the house o w representatives and mayor of new n york city florello henry la guardia affectionately known to new yorkers as the little flower was unswerving in his commitment to honesty and to fairness to the underprivileged and to the elderly to the elimination of corruption and to the enhancement of his citys environment la guardia began his congressional career in 1916 and left congress in 1933 once in congress la guardia showed that his campaign pledges were not idle promises la guardia enlisted for military service in world war i as he had promised his constituents he would do after voting for war in president woodrow wilsons special session of congress i believe that this nation might indeed see better law come out of congress if the members who passed legislation would themselves directly face the consequences of their votes on the floor as did mr la guardia as mayor of new york city la guardias firstever threeterm rule was marked by his heroic leadership in eliminating graft and corruption and balancing the citys lludget while initiating lowcost housing and slumclearing programs in addition he led the citys beautification efforts and was instrumental in promoting major civic construction projects in short it gives me great pleasure to join my friend and colleague mario biaggi in paying this eminently justiflable tribute to forello la guardia yet as i enumerate the qualities that made fiorello la guardia such an outstanding public servant i cannot help but notice that the life and career of our esteemed colleague mario biaggi to a large degree parallels that of the man whose birth we honor today in particular let us take especial note of parts of the resolution we are endorsing today and i quote his vast energy fiery leadership and considerable wisdom contributed greatly to the betterment of our nation and the city of new york his public service career serves as a benchmark from which others are judged and his many accomplishments and the honesty and fairness which characterized his work continue to serve as an inspiration to all americans particularly those who share his italian heritage i would suggest and i am sure that my colleagues who have had the privilege of serving with him would agree that our

committee that does not mean however that all the members of the governmental affairs committee support mr stockmans nomination without reservation a number of my colleagues on the committee have serious and fundamental disagreements about some of the public policy positions that mr stockman will be recommending to the president take for example the issues of energy decontrol mr stockman is an advocate of total and immediate deregulation of crude oil and gasoline prices he contends that with deregulation we will conserve even more energy and provide further incentives for domestic energy production i do not doubt that we might see slightly more conservation and perhaps slightly more production as a result of decontrol but we should be mindful all the while of the role that rising energy prices have played in the inflationary spiral we find ourselves in we should ask ourselves the question is the price of a little more conservation in the field of energy is the price of perhaps a marginal increase in production worth the cost of giving our economy another inflationary boot in the seat of the pants as oil prices go up consider these statistics for a moment mr president if you will in 1979 all consumer prices rose at a level of about 12 7 percent while energy prices rose at a level of 36 5 percent and in 1980 we found that energy prices were increasing at a clip 50 percent above the rate of inflation generally now some say that we are past energy price shocks they say the price of energy is stabilizing so why not just go that one step further and decontrol all oil prices immediately we stand in daily peril of opec price increases and there is little inclination on the part of these nations to try to help us out of our energy crisis indeed they have been the chief culprit in putting us in that bad shape they quite frequently raise the nrice of oil just as we decontrol prices at home what is the result of price increases and decontrol the result is hyperinflation in energy prices thus the council of economic advisers has estimated that when we began the process of decontrol in june of 1979 combining this with opec price increases in oil through the better part of 1980 we saw a burst of price increases of almost 100 percent during the first 3 months of 1980 for the prices of all oil products we are advisedand mr stockman concursthat 1 e should speed the pace immediately and decontrol the price of oil forthwith something that i think will add considerably to the price of oil and gasoline which may trigger further opec price increases some economists are telling us that immediate decontrol of the remaining regulations dealing with oil and gasoline will result in a 15to 20cent immediate rise in gasoline prices mr stockman has shown

federal budget has now become an automatic coasttocoast soupline that dispenses remedial aid with almost reckless abandon and he described the trade adjustment assistance act as follows this thing is the most arbitrary inequltable costly policy that we have on the books today that has ballooned spending by 1 billion in 6 months and we ought to do something about it at the hearings in response to my question of what the country should do for laidoff workers if anything mr stockman replied to the coasttocoast soupline quote by saying that sometime my metaphors might not be quite as exact as they should be but mr stockman then stressed that what he was trying to emphasize was that the benefits that are provided to those in need when the economy sags are automatically triggered in the budget by events that occur in the economy without any vote or maybe even any expec tation in the congress i agree with that our big problem vith entitlements is that increases are built into some of them when the economy does sag and we do lose control of a significant portion of the budget he gave as examples of uncontrollables unemployment benefits higher debt service payments on the national debt and drawdowns on many loan programs what i meant by the soupline was simply that when the economy deteriorates unexpectedly there are all kinds of expenditures for businesses individuals unemployed workers and many others that are generated without our ability to anticipate or factor those into our overall budget plan now i do not disagree with that statement what i do disagree with mr president very strongly is having someone who will be one of our very highest government officials be so calloused in his statements about any assistance we are giving to many millions of people and passed by this congress and describing them as arbitrary inequitable and costly policies i think his past statements have shown a rather calloused disregard for a situation that has adversely affected millions on the subject of the investment tax credit which i happen to think is a good piece of legislationwe need recapitalization reindustrialization new capital formation in this countrymr

which focuses on a problem that many constituents of the fifth district of michigan have brought to my attention there is a strong need to correct the existing social security notch problem the 1977 amendments provided for a revised social security benefits structure that makes major modifications in the way benefits are figured a major feature of the new benefit structure is that a workers actual dollar earnings are indexed to take into account changes in average wages in the economy during his working years this assures that a workers benefits are based on earnings levels that prevail just prior to age 62 although special provisions were inceluded to help smooth the transition from the old system to the new wageindexed system certain workers retiring at age 65 in 1982 will get lower benefits than those who retire at age 65 in 1981 all other things being equal there are several reasons why this situation will occur the principal reason is that workers reaching age 62 before 1979 age 65 before 1982 continue to get benefits under old law which overcompensates for inflation while workers reaching age 62 in 1979 age 65 in 1982 get benefits under new law which eliminates the overcompensation in addition under the new law the congress eliminated some of the unintended rise in benefits that had occurred under old law since 1972 and that added to the cost of the program the result is that in general benefits are lower under the new system both over the short and long range than they would have been under the old system to help smooth the transition house concurrent resolution 222 is asking that the commissioner of social security and the secretary of health and human services conduct an immediate study to report steps which can be taken to rectify this

commerce committee in favor of the provision in the bill as reported by that committee the committee considered very carefully in the process of extensive debate the issues involved in which agency should make the frequency selection for radio marti the committee decided that the national telecommunications and information administration was the appropriate agency to handle this responsibility and i urge the house not to overturn this decision and the reasoning on which it was based the ntia is a part of the unitedstates department of commerce which has the responsibility for managing the governments share of the frequency spectrum it is appropriate that ntia continue to fulfill this role for radio marti giving authority for frequency selection to the fcc would not dnly be ir appropriate but it would also guarantee a much lengthier procedure which would insure that radio marti would never see the light of day the fcc must follow established rules and procedures which are necessarily more timeconsuming than those followed by ntia any departure by the fcc from such procedures in an effort to expedite the establishment of radio marti could provide grounds for judicial review independent of review on the merits of the frequency selected it is not necessary to give this authority to the fcc in order to insure that the interests of unitedstates radio broadcasters are protected such interests can be considered and protected at ntia just as well as at the fcc the bill provides that in selecting a fre quency for radio marti ntia must receive public comment it also specifies certain factors which must be considered such as interference from cuban countermeasures and significant loss of listening area or substantial economic harm the provisions of the bill itself provide these protections and it is not necessary to go to the fcc to obtain them i think members will be interested to know that during a hearing in the senate foreign relations committee a question was asked to a panel of broadcasters whether they favored giving authority to select the frequency for radio marti to the fcc without exception the witnesses including representatives from the

the fact that american agriculture is a basic element in the welfare of every one of our citizens when agriculture is efficient progressive and productiveas ours has beenall of our citizens are better off when the 3 percent of the population which supplies our food and fiber suffers from economic distress however it is a warning signal of potential problems for all the rest of us in the future we are celebrating agriculture day at an appropriate time in our house agriculture committee we are currently at work on a major farm bill we hope that legislation will be developed on a bipartisan basis and will point the wat to an economically healthy profitable agriculture in the future it is not surprising that many of our citizens do not think much about the role which agriculture plays in their lives people normally do not think much about water until the well runs dry we have a habit of taking for granted many of the things on which we depend for comfort for convenience and for life itself we take food for granted because american farmers and farmworkers have made sure that we have plenty of it when we do that we are making a mistake when we take things for granted we may ignore the fact that if we want to guarantee an adequate supply of food and fiber in the future we will need to assure the continuation of progress in agriculture the meaning of this day goes far beyond our own borders american food is a vital element in the lives of millions of people in all parts of the world the importance of our food in preventing world hunger is very great now and we know that it will be even greater in the future with less than 7 percent of the worlds land the united states is producing about 43 percent of the worlds corn and about 60 percent of the worlds soybeans this country supplies neary half of the worlds wheat exports and an amazing 71 percent of the corn and other coarse grains which flow into world trade these are numbers and numbers are sometimes not exciting what i think we should do today is to look at what these numbers mean the simple fact is that if american farmers and their workers were not so amazingly efficient and productive millions of people would be faced today with malnutrition and even starvation the fact is that the rest of our economy would be in far worse shape than it is our agricultural exports brought in some 40 billion in receipts last year when you consider the number of dollars we have been sending abroad to pay for imported oil and other products you must realize that the american dollar would be in sad shape without the dollars which flow back to pay for our farm products our farmers amount to less than 3 percent of our population today but that is not the total of the impact of agriculture on our domestic economy overall more than 15 million amerlcans today have jobs in some phase of agriculture nearly 4v million people work on farms and up to about 10 million more men and women are working in processing storing transporting and merchandising our food and fiber when you add it up some form of agriculture or agriculturerelated industry accounts for about one of every five jobs in our econoy for consumers there is good reason to celebrate agriculture day as a second national day of thanksgiving american agriculture has given us the worlds best diet at by and large a very low cost food prices have risen in recent years but when we complain about that let us take time to realize that the average americans food bill has not gone up as fast as his earning power the average factory worker for example can buy about 50 percent more bread with 1 hours labor these days than he could 30 years ago facts like that may be blurred at times in concern about todays inflation problemsbut they are facts which demonstrate that the american farmer has done his share and more for the welfare of his fellow citizens i was glad to be among the sponsors last year of house joint resolution 560 which designated today as agriculture day 1981 and which authorized the president to issue a formal proclamation of the day the proclamation was issued by president reagan on february 13 and agriculture day

work of the bureau of standards this is one of the most signiflcant and important bureaus in the unitedstates government and in the department of commerce and it has played a leading role for many many years in a quiet and relatively unnoticed way in developing the efficiency of american industry what i am concerned about of course is the question about the relative level of support which has been raised by the distinguished gentleman from kansas and will be raised by the amendment of the gentleman from pennsylvania which we understand he will offer there was some hint or indication that the committee had acted in an indiscriminate way in suggesting a modest increase in the authorizing level for the bureau of standards i know this will be discussed in connection with the debate on the amendment but i would just like to point out that the increases recommended by the subcommittee and the full committee with which i fully concur were not indiscriminate amendments aimed at blanket increases in programs but they were amendments aimed at restoring cuts which had been suggested by the administration for two vitally important areas one of these was the institute for computer standards i think we all understand the importance of the computer revolution which is taking place in this country today there are at least three separate programs seminars or hearings going on today with regard to the impact of computers on american society right here in the house of representatives and we anticipate that the greatest improvement in industrial productivity available in the next generation will stem from the maintenance of americas leadership in the computer field computers will impact upon the operations of the congress they will impact upon the operations of amercan agriculture which is the subject of a 2day seminar going on right now it will impact upon the operations of the metalworking industry the automobile industry upon all of the industries of this country in the face of that for this administration to propose a 50percent reduction from last years level in the operations of this vitally important institute in the bureau of standards is in my opinion shortsightedness of the highest order it is therefore not an indiscriminate or careless act to attempt to preserve this program at least at the some level actually the level is still below last year even with the restoration suggested by the committee the other major increase dealt with other aspects of industrial productiv ity and innovation actually the greatest problems facing our economy today i hesitate to broaden the discussion but we have been acting in this house as if the whole answer to american productivity losses lay in the budget process at the risk of disillusioning some of my associates in the house i would like to tell them that even with the best of budgets even with a budget which is at or near balance we face serious problems with american industrial productivity in this country which will not be resolved unless we take serious steps to address them we have a small almost a minute program in the department of commerce to encourage productivity improvement and it is this program that the adminstration is proposing to practically eliminate the administrations recommendations are not because of any merit or lack of merit in the program they are based upon philosophical reasons basically the philosophical postion of this adminstration is that the government of this great country has no business trying to improve the innovation or productivity of american industry this flies in the face of reality this flies in the face of what our competitors are doing and doing very well which is assisting in developing cooperative programs between government and industry to overcome mutual problems which have to be faced now i resist the philosophy that says there is no role for government cooperation in helping to improve the performance oi american industy and it is at this very point that the amendment of the gentleman from pennsylvania is aimed he has an honest feeling that there is no role for government in helping to improve the productivity of the industry of this country he defends this view with logic and eloquence but i think he so wrong i believe that we will find out that even if we do the greatest job in the world of balancing the budget that if we have failed to take the steps necessary to improve the productivity of american industry we will still be facing some serious economic problems which we will not be able to overcome it is for this reason that i urge the members to support the very modest recommendations which the committee on science and technology has made not to increase these programs but to
