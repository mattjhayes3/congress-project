this bill is a comprehensive positive program to address the great and growing problems of the housing industry of those who depend on it and those millions of americans who cannot now afford to buy or rent a decent home this program speaks not only to the needs of urban dwellers but to those who live in rural areas as well the reagan budget program would actually cause a reduction of 46 000 housing units that are now planned and for which funding is available the reagan program is a wholesale abandonment of efforts to provide affordable housing for the majority who are shut out of the housing market today the bill my colleagues and i are offering today will provide about 250 000 new assisted housing units in fiscal year 1983 under the programs of the department of housing and urban development and it will also provide 57 000 new assisted housing units in the rural areas served by the farmers home administration the cost of our program is modestno more than is available for the current fiscal year for housing assistance which in turn is much less than was available last year modest as it is however our bill is critically needed and is a positive program as against the reagan program of wholesale iandonment and retreat the housing act of 1982 will provide assistance for homebuyers who have modest incomes these are people who could if interest rates were anything like reasonable afford homes without assistance the bill would make available up to 100 000 homes under the section 235 q program and buyers whose incomes are up to 130 percent of area median income could qualify the subsidy would be used to reduce interest payments to a rate of 9 percentsteep by historic terms usurious by my own standards but still affordable by people who have modest incomes the subsidy provided in this program would be limited to 10 yearson the belief that as incomes rise people will be able to eliminate their need for the subsidy moreover there is provision in the bill for a recapture of the subsidy payments additionally our bill will create a new program to replace the existing section 8 multifamily housing program under our bill local government agencies could work with private developers to develop affordable rental housing the subsidy payment would be extremely flexible so that the maximum incentive will exist to create efficient and effective financing plans the subsidy could be in the form of an outright capital grant it coul8a be in the form of a loan a rent subsidy or even a loan for purchase of land it could be any reasonable device that would make the project financially feasible and at the same time modest in cost to the federal government additionally the bill encourages local units of government to do their part by contributions in kind or in cash toward project development this encouragement comes through a preference to project applications that show local participation in the development cost again flexibility is the keythe kind of flexibility that made the urban development action grant the efficient effective program that it has been the bill continues the current level of effort with respect to lowcost public housing development and rehabilitation and provides for adequate operating subsidies as well we recognize that there is an urgent need for lowrent public housing that there is a need to maintain the existing stock and that adequate operating funds are essential to prevent the financial failure of numerous housing agencies we provide in this bill for a full range of rural housing programs at least maintaining existing levels of effort the amount of substandard housing in rural america is disproportionate and our program does not turn its back on the need for better housing in small towns and on farms our bill also recognizes the ravages of unemployment with the resulting rise in mortgage foreclosures we do not believe that the involuntary victims of the nations economic distress should have their misery compounded through the loss of hardearned home equity accordingly the bill provides for an emergency homeowners assistance program one that makes loans available to people who are faced with foreclosures because of involuntary and temporary economic distress the bill extends the various insuring and secondary credit market authori ties all of which are vital tools for the financing and production of homes all of which have proved their worth and all of which have earned the support of everyone who is concerned with housing we recognize that the depression of the housing industry will not end until the economy is set straight but we also recognize that doing nothing is worse than nothing doing nothing will only accelerate the growing crisis among those who seek affordable housing only deepen the depression of the housing industry and worst of all constitute a retreat from our historic commitment to decent and affordable housing for this nation the administration is not offering a housing program it is offering an antimarch 4 1989 housing programan attempt to dis mantle and discard programs that an needed that work ahd that make positive contribution not only to thi

ele dtor in a bankruptcy case last year and by refusing to tell the court larl week who helped him remove that grain what many farmers are feeling throughout america and across this great land today that the circumstances facing farmers are frightening and uncertain and that the future is grim i respect the strength of this mans conviction cryts imprisonment is a symbol that the farmers are beginning what one newspaper has called a crusade of peaceful outrace it is sad that this mans personal sacrifice will be that which will awaken many to the hard times facing our farmers today just today the rural electric cooperatives met in the halls of congress and one of the pamphlets that they are handing out to members and to interested citizens is entitled aard times in rural america we are exploring many of the issues relating to the farm economy today limited time does not permit us to discuss each and every problem that need to be addressed i mentioned mr cryts as an illustration of the multitude of problems facing the agricultural community in every aspect of the agricultural scene there is a difference this yearin the grim tightlipped expressions of farmers as they watch expensive farm machinery pulverizing the earth for planting fear of the future is found on their faces and the faces of the farm community as well as all others outside the agricultural sector who realize the significance of what they are seeing most writeoff 1982 as a year in which they will be lucky to hold their own the farmer has always played against high odds of the weather and of other circumstances but this year the odds are greater stacked against them by the administrations policies that are keeping interest rates high therefore increasing the cost of pro duction and choking off exports by an overvaluation of the dollar which prices unitedstates farm products out of the world market farm income when adjusted to inflation is currently at its lowest level since 1932 the unitedstates department of agriculture estimates 1981 receipts at 147 7 billion 4 6 percent above 1980 but production expenses were estimated at 8 5 higher than 1980 over the past decade farm production costs have risen on the average about 21 2 times compared with an average increase in farm prices received for products of about 2v times the outlook for this year is that it will be worse than any single year since the great depression the good news is that some production costs are expected to moderate the bad news is that since cash receipts are flat even a modest increase will leave farm income lower net farm income is expected to fall to 14 billion in 1982 according to a snittker associates study as a further indication of the ills of the farm economy let me point out that 1980 and 1981 were the first years since 1933 and 1934 that there were back to back years when production costs were more than the farmer earned the administration continues to predict economic recovery economists say it will not come or will be short lived if interest rates remain high the farmer has no control over an economy that is stagnant because of the effects of high interest rates the administration does the major driving force behind the high interest rates is the current policy mix of extremely high and rising deficits and a very tight money policy i will go into some avenues of correction to control interest rates later but first let me mention some of the current situations facing farmers and the subsequent impact that high interest rates are having surplus crop supplies depressed commodity prices and ballooning federal deficits prompted the usda in january to request that farmers voluntarily restrict 1982 plantings of feed grains wheat cotton andfor the first timerice good weather and other incentives to produce grain have resulted in 198182 world grain being up over year ago levels last fall the increase in planting did not secn excessive because beginning reserves were low reduced crops elsewhere in the world provoked optimism for exports since the harvest however market prices for grain have reflected pessimism rather than optimism why first the persistence of high interest rates has caused the cost of holding grain to escalate if the farmer cannot sell the crop and pay off his loan interest costs build because of this buyers are delaying purchases until needed for useand the producer is the one stuck with footing the bill for storage second also storage costs lre being transferred to the unitedstates farmer y our traditional buyers who are having storage problems of their own due to the glut on the market an example is the current situation with south korea korea has not honored its commitment to buy 500 000 metric tons of rice this crop year and is forcing the american farmer and american taxpayer to pick up the tab for storage which by all rights it should be paying third there are other factors hurting our export trade economic problems in poland have affected the ability of other eastern european countries to obtain credit to finance grain imports and the unitedstates dollar has remained strong throughout much of the 198182 marketing year making unitedstates grain relatively expensive for importers chase econometrics reports in its annual unitedstates fo d and agriculture forecast and analy is total meat and poultry production rose 1 5 percent in 1981 a rate of increase which was too great to support livestock prices at 1980 levels in the face of weak consumer demand and inflating farm to retail marketing margins declining producer prices combined with sharply higher feed costs to cause livestock producers the most severe loss situation since the grain price runups of 197374 chase econometrics reports losses have been so unremitting that the inventory of cattle on feed was at its lowest in january of 1982 since 1975 the cattle industry risks entering into a liquidation and hog producers have cut herds by 9 percent there is not a viable option of borrowing to sustain operations until the situation improves interest rates are too high despite and outlook for sharply lowered feed prices in 1982 the continuing recession will make it another very difficult year for livestock producers as the recession limits prices profits and cash receipts large supplies of farm commodities and weak demand due to world recession will constrain any significant advance in farm prices and farm income in 1982 under these circumstances even ebbing inflation will cause farm income to fall again in 1982 unless action is taken to stem highinterest rates and to stimulate exportation total farm cash receipts are expected to approximate 144 billion this year less than 1 percent above 1981 not only will total 1982 cash receipts fall in constant dollars but even a small advance in production expenses will result in further decline in current net income analysts for chase econometrics say every 1percent increase in production expensesand remember production costs have risen 8 5 percent already in 1981will result in a decline of 1 5 billion in net farm income in addition to the 8 5percent increase in production costs for 1981 another increase of 3 to 4 percent is expected in 1982 realized net income is forecast by usda to fall to 14 billion this year the lowest since the depression the farmer is not sitting comfortably in the white house trying out new economic theory he is the bottom line he knows firsthand the results of highinterest ratesskyrocketing farm debt increased farm sales liquidations of assets to pay off loans bankruptcies and foreclosures the old saying he bought the farm is taking on almost a literal correlation to the figurative allusion to death the farm as we know it is approaching a death due to a bad case of reaganitis interest rates are so high many farmers cannot repay their debts here is what has happened the national rate of delinquency on farmers home administration loans was placed at 58 percent in a january quarterly report of the fmha it has since been revised downwardly to 33 percent to include payments made in the month of january but that still reflects a significant increase over the figure of 24 percent delinquent during the same time period a year earlier the delinquency rate is as high as 80 percent in texas in arkansas it

conserve even more energy and provide further incentives for domestic energy production i do not doubt that we might see slightly more conservation and perhaps slightly more production as a result of decontrol but we should be mindful all the while of the role that rising energy prices have played in the inflationary spiral we find ourselves in we should ask ourselves the question is the price of a little more conservation in the field of energy is the price of perhaps a marginal increase in production worth the cost of giving our economy another inflationary boot in the seat of the pants as oil prices go up consider these statistics for a moment mr president if you will in 1979 all consumer prices rose at a level of about 12 7 percent while energy prices rose at a level of 36 5 percent and in 1980 we found that energy prices were increasing at a clip 50 percent above the rate of inflation generally now some say that we are past energy price shocks they say the price of energy is stabilizing so why not just go that one step further and decontrol all oil prices immediately we stand in daily peril of opec price increases and there is little inclination on the part of these nations to try to help us out of our energy crisis indeed they have been the chief culprit in putting us in that bad shape they quite frequently raise the nrice of oil just as we decontrol prices at home what is the result of price increases and decontrol the result is hyperinflation in energy prices thus the council of economic advisers has estimated that when we began the process of decontrol in june of 1979 combining this with opec price increases in oil through the better part of 1980 we saw a burst of price increases of almost 100 percent during the first 3 months of 1980 for the prices of all oil products we are advisedand mr stockman concursthat 1 e should speed the pace immediately and decontrol the price of oil forthwith something that i think will add considerably to the price

the 1980 act for refugee resettlement activities in the united states your subcommittee during the past 15 months has visited the acute prob lem areas of high refugee impact in the united states and the sending countries abroad extensive hearings brought us the message of the need to reform refugee resettlement policy refugees arriving in the united states with a strong motivation to adjust rapidly to our society far too often fall victim to the enticements of the public welfare system all witnesses before your subcommittee agree that selfsufficiency should be our goal but that present policies are inhibiting a program that could be less expensive and far more effective we learned of the high percentage of refugees on cash and medi cal assistance municipal county and state officials told us of the growing cost of resettlementan uneven burden borne primarily by 10 states and 40 counties our refugee place ment policy needs to be redirected to reduce the phenomenon of secondary migration our efforts should be to move refugees quickly into the work force to accomplish this language training and job counseling are essential cuts in such social services would not be costeffective as they are the means to avoid the cycle of welfare dependency we recognize the need for greater cooperation in administering refugee policycooperation among voluntary agencies the federal government and local and state officials these are the areas this legislation addresses a clear distinction needs to be drawn between legal and illegal flows to the united states ref ugee admissions are determined annually on the basis of consultation with the congress and represents only a fraction of the hundreds of thousands of persons coming to the united states illegally each year the appropriate agenda for the congress is not to devise ways of abandoning americas role in providing hope opportunity and freedom for persecuted people but rather to continue this tradition while asserting control over our borders and coasts your subcommittee has reported out the simpsonmazzoli immigration reform and control act a comparison measure has cleared the senate judiciary committee and is awaiting the floor action in the other body congress during this session will have the opportunity to adopt strong meas ures to discourage the flow of illegal emigrants to the united states american acceptance of refugees promotes important humanitarian and foreign policy goals the efficacy of our present refugee admissions policy however is not the subject addressed by this bill other provisions of the immigration and nationality act define the term refugee and establish the process for annual admissions this bill does not relate to these provisions the issue presented by h r 5879 is whether we will respond to the needs of refugees in the united states members of congress regardless of individual reservations about aspects of our admissions program can unite in the recognition of the necessity to assist refugees who are here failure to fund this program would increase the burden on state and local governments and detract from our capacity to provide refugees with the tools to function independently and productively in american communities refugee resettlement efforts in recent years have been plagued by unacceptably high levels of welfare dependency i am pleased to observe based on testimony at recent immigra tion subcommittee hearings that the administration voluntary resettlement agencies and state and local governments all support the objective of helping refugees to become selfsupporting and contributing members of their communities a number of provisions of this legislation promote this pnportant objec tive a clear statement of congression al intent emphasizes job placement as soon as possible after a refugees 3irrival in the united states the b 11 authorizes a feasibility study an report to congress on concepts strongly advocated by voluntary resettlement agencies basically this involves utilization of mechanisms other tt in welfare for provision of first int im support to refugees who are not employment ready and second medical assistance to refugees who do not require cash assistance we need to explore and implement innovative solutions to meet the legitimate transitional needs of our refugee population and at the same time guard against the lure of the welfare system voluntary agencies and welfare of fices under h r 5879 must share cartain information critical to refugee selfsufficiency voluntary agencies are to notify welfare offices when they learn that a refugee is offered employment this hiformation will assist welfare offices to terminate assistance for individuals who no longer qualify the bill specifically provides for the termination of cash assistance if a refugee refuses an appropriate employment offer the resettlement agency must be no tified promptly whenevcr a refugee applies for cash or medical assistance this notification will afford the resettlement agency an opportunity to work with the refugee during this critical period before the refugee be comes dependent on welfare the cycle of welfare dependency is hard to break once it is initiated knowledge that a refugee has applied for assistance is essential information for a voluntary agency seeking to promote selfsufficiency another section of h r 5879 emphasizes the importance on initial placement decisions resettlement policies under the mandate in this bill generally must avoid placements in highly impacted areas certain close relatives of persons already residing in an area are the exception efforts to separate families are counterproductive because they lead to feelings of estrangement and promote unplanned secondary migration such secondary migration in turn tends to subvert efforts by voluntary agencies to plan with refugees for selfsufficiency the disproprotionate impact of refugees on a relatively few highly impacted communities can exacerbate tensions and detract from the capacity of local governments to meet the needs of longterm residents we can attempt to discourage excessive refugee concentrations in the future through our placement policiesbut we must address the problems resulting from past initial placements and secondary migration any increase in populationwhether consisting of refugees or other individualsis bound to result in increased public outlays the other half of the equation however is the positive impact on new groups moving into a community to consider only the out lays of funds and not the inflow of new revenues would present an unbalanced view of refugee impacts impact aid is a commendable concept that recognizes the central role of the federal government in the admission of refugees the implementation of an impact aid program however requires further study and this is called for we must approach the problem in a feasible way and avoid duplicating impact aid provisions of current law after the director of the office of refugee resettlement conducts a study of impact aidin accordance with the mandate of this legislationwe will be in a position to fashion an assistance package that addresses a variety of concerns the critical point is that we need not choose between unacceptable levels of public expenditures and an abandonment of our refugee program we have the human resources in this country to resettle refugees at less public expense than in the past and at the samz time perform the resettlement task more effectively the authorization in the subcommittee amendment in contrast to h r 5879 as introduced and in contrast to the original authorization in the refugee act of 1980 is for only a single year h r 5879 and the refugee act of 1980 provided 3year authorization periods sufficient to allow longrange planning a reauthorization for 1 year in my judgement is insufficient to allow full implementation of new initiatives in the resettlement field a 1year authorization would require the subcommittee and the administrationin the immediate futureto begin the process of considering next years authorizationa timeconsuming endeavor that will distract the unitedstates coordinator and the director of orr from the important task we have given themto reduce welfare dependency and promote quicker selfsufficiency the approach of a 3year authorizationwhich the committee followed in the past and the administration advocated this year or at least a 2year authorizationis far preferable i congratulate congressman row no mazzoli chairman of the immigration subcommittee for his diligent efforts in conducting detailed hearings on refugee mattersthis at the same time that we have been in the midst of thorough consideration of major immigration reform and control legislation the mandates of h r 5879 and the studies called for should enable us not only to do a better job of resettling refugees at less cost but also to alleviate the excessive burdens some communities have experienced i urge my colleagues to support adoption of this bill because our country has much to gain from facilitating the successful

problem that many constituents of the fifth district of michigan have brought to my attention there is a strong need to correct the existing social security notch problem the 1977 amendments provided for a revised social security benefits structure that makes major modifications in the way benefits are figured a major feature of the new benefit structure is that a workers actual dollar earnings are indexed to take into account changes in average wages in the economy during his working years this assures that a workers benefits are based on earnings levels that prevail just prior to age 62 although special provisions were inceluded to help smooth the transition from the old system to the new wageindexed system certain workers retiring at age 65 in 1982 will get lower benefits than those who retire at age 65 in 1981 all other things being equal there are several reasons why this situation will occur the principal reason is that workers reaching age 62 before 1979 age 65 before 1982 continue to get benefits under old law which overcompensates for inflation while workers reaching age 62 in 1979 age 65 in 1982 get benefits under new law which eliminates the overcompensation in addition under the new law the congress eliminated some of the unintended rise in benefits that had occurred under old law since 1972 and that added to the cost of the program the result is that in general benefits are lower under the new system both over the short and long range than they would have been under the old system to help smooth the transition house concurrent resolution 222 is

thank the gentleman for yielding i rise in strong support of h r 6113 the ocean dumping amendments act of 1982 i want to thank the chairmen and the members of the committees on merchant marine and fisheries and public works and transportation for their support of this legislation this bill reauthorizes title i of the marine protection research and sanctuaries act for fiscal year 1983 and provides several strengthening amendments to title i the marine protection research and sanctuaries act commonly known as the ocean dumping act was enacted in 1972 as a result of concern over the effects of unregulated ocean dumping the act seeks to prohibit or strictly limit the ocean dumping of materials harmful to humans or the marine environment title i prohibits the dumping of certain materials and establishes a permit system by which the environmental protection agency and the corps of engineers regulate dumping of all other materials in ocean waters h r 6113 reauthorizes title i of the act at level funding of 4 213 million for fiscal year 1983 in addition the bill addresses several current ocean dumping problems first the environmental protection agency hasbeen extremely negligent in completing the studies that are needed for evaluating whether historically used dump sites are suitable for continued dumping instead the environmental protection agency has extended interim site designations for such a long period of time that interim sites have become de facto permanent sites to insure that designation procedures for these sites move forward in an expeditious manner the bill requires the environmental protection agency to establish a schedule for completing site designations a mandamus provision has also been added to the bill to permit legal action to be instituted to compel the administrator to meet the designation schedules that the environmental protection agency has published in the federal register presented in testimony and committed to under court order to avoid unnecessary delays while the designation procedures are completed existing interim sites can continue to be used the site designation procedures provide important protection for the ocean by requiring that new ocean dumping sites are adequately studied before final designation that materials are dumped at appropriate ocean locations that dumping and its effects are monitored when appropriate and that dumping can be restricted or eliminated if a site is no longer suitable for dumping second during the 97th congress we have learned that the environmental protection agency is attempting to reverse a longstanding policy of not allowing the ocean dumping of radioactive wastes this policy is being reversed despite the fact that past records are inaccurate and incomplete that past dumping contained inad equate safeguards to insure protection of human health and the marine environment and that the environmental protection agency is reluctant to initiate the studies and programs that are needed to determine the effects of past dumping until we have sufficient information it is foolhardy to proceed with plans to reopen the ocean for radioactive waste disposal h r 6113 will put a halt to this policy shift by emplacing a 2year moratorium on the issuance of permits for lowlevel radioactive wastes highlevel wastes are prohibited from being dumped by existing legislation the moratorium will insure that the congress will have the opportunity to review the environmental protection agencys forthcoming regulations its programs for assessing the impact of past dumping and its plans for monitoring future radioactive waste dumping the moratorium will also give the congress the opportunity to review proposals to dump radioactively contaminated soils from the manhattan project and to scuttle decommissioned unitedstates navy nuclear submarines in the ocean i have serious reserva tions about using the ocean to dump societys wastes because of the too easy convenience of ocean dumping as a commonaccess resource the ocean is not protected by the same economic and political forces that protect private property dumpers are not forced to pay for the use of the ocean and thus do not have to pay for the immediate or longterm damage they cause unlike land disposal there is no nearby effected group of concerned citizens to protest the resulting hazards that might be created thus ocean dumping is economically and politically convenient it is up to the members of congress to provide a voice for the ocean and to insure that the ocean has sufficient
