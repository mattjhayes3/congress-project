contributions to president clintons 1996 reelection campaign and how the clinton administration either intentionally or through incompetence has irreparably damaged and compromised the security of every man woman and child in the united states last summer during president clintons trip to china jiang zemin the president of china told him that he had no involvement in campaign fundraising in the united states and president clinton took his word for it in that july 2 1998 press conference president clinton said they looked into that and he was obviously certain and i do believe him that he had not ordered or authorized or approved such a thing and that he could find no evidence that anybody in governmental authority had done that giving illegal campaign contributions to the democratic national committee or the presidents reelection committee why would president clinton say that mr speaker the new york times reported in may that johnny chung was given 300 000 by ms liu chaoying a chinese aerospace executive who is a lieutenant colonel in the peoples liberation army in communist army and her father at one time was the head of the chinese peoples liberation army in april of 1996 27 months before president clintons meeting with president jiang of china sandy berger the head of the national security council was briefed that china had stolen w88 nuclear warhead designs neutron bomb data and that a spy might still be passing secrets to china at los alamos one of our nuclear research facilities now the w88 nuclear warhead design is a miniaturized nuclear warhead and you can put as many as 10 of them on one missile so you can hit 10 cities with one missile launched from china thereby endangering as many as 50 or 60 million americans and the neutron bomb data that kind of information would allow an enemy of the united states communist china to launch a missile at the united states with a neutron bomb warhead and when it explodes kills everybodyin the city but it does not destroy the infrastructure the roads the bridges or the buildings now sandy berger the head of the nsc would have had to have told the president about this why would president clinton say thatc lie beieved president jiang of china on april 8 1999 at a joint press conference with president clinton when communist chinas prime minister zhu rongji was here hp was asked about chinas theft of unitedstates nuclear secrets and prime minister zhu said i have no knowledge whatsoever of any charge of any allegation of espionage or the theft of nuclear technology and i do not believe such story and president clinton responded china is a big country with a big government and i can only say that america is a big country with a big government and occasionally things happen in this country and in this government that i do not know anything about and he was indicating that the stealing of this technology and the illegal campaign contributions thatwere authorized by the leaders of the communist chinese government could have happened without their knowledge if that happens in communist china they either shoot them or put them in prison so it is disingenuous for the president to say that he believed him when he knew full well that this was taking place in july of 1997 a year before his meeting with president jiang and 27 months before his meeting with prime minister zhu the administration acknowledges that nsc director sandy berger briefed the president told him about weaknesses in our nuclear laboratories and about chinas spying so when president clinton met with president jiang and prime minister zhu he had already been briefed by nsc director berger sometime before about the possibility of spying and espionage taking place at our nuclear facilities before the president met with zhu the l a times reported that johnny chung had testified under oath that he was directed to make illegal campaign contributions to the presidents reelection campaign by general ji shengde who met with him three times and ordered that 300 000 be directed to chung for political contributions and that there were other conduits other people that they were working with to get money into the presidents reelection campaign and to the democratic national committee now johnny chung was a friend of the president he was in the white house 50 times he brought other people in communist leaders to meet with the president and he was one of the major conduits of bringing illegal campaign contributions into this country general ji shengde was the head of the chinese communist military intelligence the equivalent of our defense intelligence agency in this country and he was the one that was giving the order to funnel these illegal campaign contributions from communist china into the presidents reelection campaign and into the democrat national committee now why would president clinton suggest that maybe the chinese leadership did not know about the spying at los alamos why would he say that when they do something in china as i said before they either shoot them or throw them in jail now regarding chinese espionage in april of 1996 27 months before president clinton accepted president jiangs denial and 3 years before he suggested that chinas spying might be the fault of big government the department of energys chief of intelligence notra trulock told national security advisor sandy berger the head of the nsc that china had stolen both w88 nuclear warhead designs that is the miniature nuclear warhead that they can put 10 of them on one missile and neutron bomb data that a spy might still be passing those secrets to china from los alamos our nuclear research facility according to energy officials who took part in the meeting and read highly classified materials used to prepare for it sandy berger was also told how the stolen technology could fit int o beijings overall nuclear strategy and how the w88 technology could be used as part of a plan to rely on the mobility of trucklaunched missiles with small warheads to better survive a counternuclear attack by the united states according to the new york times energy officials said the briefing was a culmination of a 5month interagency study of the w88 theft and related issues and it was pretty was a pretty specific briefing one american official who was present said that sandy berger was even told that investigators had identified a prime suspect at los alamos in the theft and would shortly turn their information over to the fbi for a formal criminal inquiry why did sandy berger the head of the nsc appearing on nbcs meet the press last month say the information he was told about 3 years ago was very general and very preliminary why did he say we did not have a suspect in the theft of the w88 technology why did he say that we did not know who we did not really know how and we did not really know what we know at the end of the briefing that i just talked about according to officials that were present notra trulock referred to a report from a chinese source which had been provided to the department of energy by the fbi in march of 1996 over 3 years ago the chinese source indicated that officials inside chinas intelligence service were boasting about how they had just stolen secrets from the uwnited states and had used themto improve beijings neutron bomb the source further suggested that chinese agents solved a 1988 design problem by coming back to the united states in 1995 to steal more secrets the source who in the past has drovided reliable inforirao o ever detailed how the information was transferred from the united states to communist china according to one official the intelligence about the neutron bomb was hot off the press and it was included in the briefing to warn the white house of the possibility of continuing chinese espionage in november of 1996 almost 1 years after first suspecting the theft of nuclear secret from los alamos charles b curtis the deputy secretary for energy ordered a series of security measures to be carried out on a straight timetable during the next several months none of these measures were carried out until september of 1998 almost 2 years later and there was a threat and a strong indication that espionage had taken place and our top secrets were being stolen by the communist chinese why did we wait 2 years why did they not implement those series of security measures in march of 1997 4 months before president clinton was scheduled to visit china the energy departments acting secretary for defense programs victor reis and the acting director for nonproliferation kenneth baker prevented notra trulock when he saw further evidence that the chinese had other ongoing spy operations at the weapons lab and he asked to meet with secretary of energy federico pefia they kept him from briefing secretary pefia for 4 months why in april of 1997 when the fbi requested a wiretap to be put on the phone of the conversations of wen ho lee the chief suspect in the theft of americas w88 miniaturized warhead technology the nuclear technology they were turned down by the justice department why would the justice department turn down this request for electronic technology to be put on this gentlemans phone when they thought and highly suspected and even knew that he was giving top secret nuclear technology to the chinese communists that endangered every man woman and child in this country why would the justice department not allow electronic technology and wiretaps to be put on his phone why and who at the justice department turned down this request this guy was accused of stealing americas most advanced nuclear technology why was this request turned down why in august of 1997 fbi director louis freeh told energy department officials that the bureau did not have enough evidence to arrest wen ho lee but that mr lee could now be removed from his position without harming their investigation and that doe was to determine whether or not to keep lee on since the case was not as important as what damage he might do or continue to do by accessing additional information why did the department of energy keep lee on with fbi approval retaining his security clearances until december of 1998 about 2 years later when he was moved to a nonclassified area and took a lie detector test for the first time why again in 1997 in july a year before his meeting with president jiang and 21 months before his meeting with prime minister zhu sandy berger the head of the nsc received a second detailed briefing about chinas spying and soon after told president clinton about weaknesses at the laboratories and about chinas spying in august of 1997 gary samore the senior national security council official assigned to the china spy case asked now get this asked the cia director to seek an alternative analysis on how china developed its smaller warheads in other words he did not want to talk about them being stolen from los alamos through espionage he wanted to find out an alternative analysis from the cia on how they might have gotten this technology immediately after he gotthis briefing from notra trulock in august of 1997 why when presented with such overwhelming evidence of chinese espionage did gary samore at the national security council seek to downplay the significance of the information asking the cia to come up with another explanation about chinas advances why in may of 1998 notra trulock energy departments director of intelligence was demoted to acting deputy director of intelligence after he made a third report to the energy department inspector general about a steady pattern of suppression of counterintelligence issues somebody was trying to keep a lid on all this mr speaker in july 1998 the same month that president clinton was meeting with chinas president jiang when the house intelligence committee requested an update on the spy case from notra trulock trulock testified that acting energy secretary elizabeth moler ordered him not to go to the panel for fear that the information would be used to attack president clintons china policy why did elizabeth moler do this the chinese thefts of unitedstates nuclear secrets according to paul redmund the cias chief spy hunter were quote far more damaging to national security than aldrich ameshe is the spy who is now in jailand the spying would turn out to be as bad as the rosenbergs now you recall the rosenbergs were the ones who gave nuclear secrets to the russians and the soviet union back during and after world war 11 both of them were executed for giving that nuclear technology to the soviets so that they could build their nuclear missiles that were directed at the united states and he said this mr redmund that this spying would turn out to be as bad or worse or as bad as the rosenberg case you can see how really bad this is at the same time that china was conducting its highly successful espionage operations against the united states the committee on government reform which i chair for 2 years has known about and tracked millions of dollars that were given to the democrat party and the presidents reelection committee that can be directly traced to hong kong macao indonesia south america and communist china long before president clinton met with president jiang and long before he met with prime minister zhu we knew for a long time that chinas head of military intelligence general ji shengde had been pulling the strings for a massive conglomerate called china resources which unitedstates intelligence agencies have said operates fronts for the peoples liberation army in hong kong and worldwide for a long time we have known that china resources has joint ventures with the indonesiabased international firm called the lippo group we have also known that the lippo group is run by mochtar and james riady we have known that the ethnic chinese james riady is a close friend of the presidents and has frequently visited him at the white house he was also instrumental in getting john huang appointed to a very important position at the commerce department and later at the democrat national committee we have known that james riadys chief adviser on political donations was john huang who is a former employee of the lippo group and who accepted this job at the commerce department and then left the commerce department to work at the democrat national committee where with the help of james riady and the lippo group and mochtar he collected nearly 3 million in illegal campaign contributions for the democrat party and the presidents reelection committee we have in our possession checks copies of checks which represent illegal contributions to the democrat party drawn from accounts in the lippo bank which is controlled by the riady family it is now being reported that johnny chung who gave more than 360 000 to the democrat party has told a grand jury that some of the money he contributed to the democrat party came from chinas head of military intelligence the very same people that wanted this nuclear technology general ji shengde general ji is the man in the chinese military most likely to be directing chinas spy operations and most likely to be interested in americas nuclear secrets it now appears that general ji was the mastermind behind chinas efforts to get the clintongore team reelected johnny chung has reportedly told a grand jury he was coordinating efforts to funnel money into the campaign along with others according to general ji is it possible that he was working with john huang and charlie trie as well johnny chung john huang and charlie trie together raised over 3 million in illegal donations that we know of that have been linked to the bank of china it is important to repeat that on july 2 1998 during president clintons trip to china when he was asked to comment on his discussions with president jiang zemin about chinas involvement in campaign fundraising in the united states president clinton said they looked into that and he was obviously certain and i do believe him that he had not ordered or authorized or approved such a thing the illegal contributions and that he could find no evidence that anybody in governmental authority had done that the president said he believed that president clinton at his own press conference on march 19 1998 in response to the question can you assure us the american people that under your watch no valuable secrets were lost and he said quote can i tell you there has been no espionage at the lab since i have been president i can tell you that no one has reported to me they suspect such a thing has occurred on april 8 1999 at a joint press conference with president clinton when chinas prime minister zhu rongji was asked about chinas theft of nuclear secrets zhu said i have no knowledge whatsoever of any charge of any allegation of espionage or the theft of nuclear technology and i dont believe such a story this is the prime minister of china president clinton responded china is a big country with a big government and i can only say that america is a big country with a big government and occasionally things happen in this government that i do not know anything about how could president clinton who knew at least 1 year before meeting with president jiang and probably as early as april of 1996 about chinese spying and had all this information about illegal chinese efforts to funnel money into the 1996 clintongore reelection efforts say i do believe president jiang it is just almost disingenuous it is inconceivable that president clinton did not know about chinas espionage and chinas funneling of illegal contributions into this reelection campaign when he met with prime minister zhu how could the president who had been briefed by sandy berger in july of 1997 and probably as early as april of 1996 about chinese spying suggest that maybe chinas spying was the result of big government and that maybe chinas leadership did not know about their spying at los alamos wen ho lee we know had not only been involved in that spying at least that is what we believe now and he has already taken some lie detector tests and is still under investigation we also know that he called convicted spy peter lee at the livermore laboratories where a neutron bomb was being researched some time ago how could the president say that this was a result of big government it is impossible that the chinese leadership did not know about this spying you get shot in china when you do something like that without telling the leadership on march 7 1997 president clinton said i dont believe you can find any evidence of the fact that i had changed government policy solely because of a contribution in february of 1998 5 months before he met president jiang and 14 months before he met prime minister zhu president clinton ignored strenuous objections from the department of justice which was investigating the loral corporation for an unauthorized technology transfer to china and granted loral a waiver for official transfers of essentially the same missile technology to china that loral was being criminally investigated for giving to china without authorization in 1996 bernard schwartz the chairman of loral corporation contributed over 1 365 million to various democratic accounts including the reelection of the president in a march interview with cnns wolf blitzer when questioned about chinas spying at los alamos vice president gore said the law enforcement agencies pursued it aggressively with our full support on march 14 1999 sandy berger asserted that upon learning of chinas nuclear espionage the administration quote imposed and enforced the strictest controls on china of any country except those for which we have embargoes such as libya end quote if the vice president and nsc director sandy berger are right why after showing deceptive answers in his first lie detector test in december of 1998 did it take the clinton administration another 2 months to give mr lee a second test after failing that second test why did it take them another month to get rid of him why did elizabeth moler who ordered notra trulock not to brief the house intelligence committee say that she could not recall being told about trulocks request for a briefing even when a memorandum from mr trulock concerning the briefing request was found in the safe in her office after she left her job at the energy department if what the vice president and sandy berger say is true why within 2 months after becoming energy secretary in january of 1993 when keith fultz assistant comptroller general with the general accounting office briefed hazel oleary and strongly recommended that the department of energy improve controls over foreign visitors to doe weapons laboratories and urged oleary to seek a further briefing about espionage at doe laboratories from unitedstates intelligence agencies did fultz say that oleary say she did not seem very interested in the matter why according to the washington times did a former contractor for one of the department of energys three nuclear weapons laboratories recall that oleary quote decided in her infinite wisdom to lessen security at the labs nuclear technology is being stolen and she lessened security at the labs the cold war is over the contractor says that she indicated and in mrs olearys mind it was not necessary to have so much money spent on security we did away with the people in actual security guard forces security clearances were deemed virtually unnecessary in all but a very few areas former secure areas were opened up and many documents and files were allowed to be seen which at one time were of a secret or classified nature why according to the washington times did the white house originally tell the cox committee that the president was not told about chinese espionage until 1998 we know he must have knownback as far as 1997 or 1996 when his nsc director sandy berger found out about it why did david leavy spokesman for the national security council explain this discrepancy by saying well after the cox committee process weve remembered more on april 7 1998 speaking at a unitedstates institute for peace event president clinton implied that anyone critical of china was using quote caricatures and exaggerating the chinese threat let me share a portion of the presidents speech according to the record now we hear that china is a country to be feared a growing number of people say that it is the next great threat to our security and our wellbeing they claim it is building up its military machine for aggression and using the profits of our trade to pay for it they urge us therefore to contain china to deny it access to our markets our technology our investment and to bolster the strength of our allies in asia to counter the threat a strong china will pose in the 21st century what about that scenario clearly if it chooses to do so china could pursue such a course pouring much more of its wealth into military might and into traditional great power geopolitics this would rob it of much of its future prosperity and it is far from inevitable that china will choose this path therefore i would argue that we should not make it more likely that china choose this path by acting as if that decision has already been made we have to follow a different course we cannot afford caricatures well the president knew that they had been stealing nuclear secrets from our laboratories our nuclear laboratories neutron bomb technology w88 technology mrving technology for warheads and it had been given to them by a person who worked for the laboratory the president had to know this as far back as early 1997 and yet they kept the man on there for over 2 more years and the president said we do not need to worry about that why is china taking this additional nuclear technology if they do not really need it if they do not have any intentions of using it just a couple of years ago they fired some missiles into the sea of china next to taiwan one of the leading military people in china said that he did not think the united states would worry too much about that because if we got involved we would be much more concerned about los angeles than we would about taiwan the implication was that there might be a threat that they would do something like launching a missile at los angeles if we stuck our nose into the taiwanese issue on march 29 1999 one week before president clintons press conference with chinese prime minister zhu newsweek reported that when the cia recently showed data obtained from its sources on china to a team of nuclear weapons experts they practically fainted these are our nuclear weapons experts and when the cia recently showed that data that was obtained from its sources about chinas stealing of that technology our nuclear weapons guys almost fainted the data much of it written in chinese and never read had been stored in cia computers and forgotten until now it showed that chinese scientists were routinely using phrases descriptions and concepts that came straight out of unitedstates weapons laboratories like los alamos the chinese penetration is total said one official close to the investigation they are deep deep into the labs black programs and black programs are our most sensitive nuclear technology security issues and they are deep deep into them according to our experts newsweek even reported that china may have even recently acquired two unitedstates cruise missiles that failed to detonate during last falls unitedstates attack on terrorist osama bin laden and may be attempting to copy their sophisticated guidance and avoidance avionics technology how can the president say that anyone who is critical of china and the threat are using caricatures over the last 2 years my committee has been conducting an investigation into illegal fundraising including illegal efforts by the chinese to influence our elections we have had 121 people nothing like this in the history of the country 121 people have either taken the fifth amendment or fled the country a number of the most important people on this list are now in communist china when my staff attempted to travel to china to interview some of these people the chinese government denied us visas and said they would arrest anybody we sent over there to investigate this we asked the bank of china to provide us with bank records that would show the origins of millions of dollars in foreign money that was funneled into the presidents reelection committee and the democrat national committee the bank of china has turned us down flat the clinton administration has refused to do anything to help us get this important information when so many people take the fifth amendment or flee the country it is obvious that a lot of laws have been broken the clinton administration failure to investigate chinas funneling of illegal contributions into the clintongore reelection campaign and chinas theft of americas most advanced nuclear secrets are absolute tragedies either intentionally or through its own incompetence the clinton administration has caused irreparable damage to americas national security it has compromised the security of every man woman and child in this country this has to be investigated the american public has a right to know what is going on regarding these illegal campaign contributions and the thefts of our nuclear technology and whether or not there is any connection between the two we can no longer accept the compromise of this nations national security and we intend to pursue it as hard as we possibly can but we need the help of the justice department which has been stonewalling us and we need the administration to give us some assistance as well"], [0.01305333897471428, 0.01305333897471428, 0, "here it is about 11 30 in washington and our families will be happy to know that we are here on the floor taking care of the countrys business i wish to speak for the remainder of this evening about managed care reform one of these days we are going to pass this and my friend from new jersey and i will maybe have to stop passing like ships in the middle of the night coming to the floor to speak about this issue but it has become i think commonplace knowledge that we have problems with managed care in this country that is recognized by a lot of the humor that we see in the country several years ago a joke started going around the country about the three doctors who died and went to heaven the first doctor was a neurosurgeon st peter asked him what did you do for a living he said i took care of victims of automobile crashes who had injured their heads and tried to get them back to a normal life st peter said enter my son and enjoy heaven the next doctor who came up to the pearly gates was asked by st peter what he did he said i was a heart surgeon and i took care of people who were having heart attacks and managed to prolong their lives so that they could spend them with their families st peter said enter my daughter and enjoy heaven the third doctor who came up to the pearly gates was asked by st peter what did you do he said well i was an hmo manager st peter kind of stroked his beard and he said son you may enter but only for 3 days now everyone has heard that joke why is that funny well number one because there is a kernel of truth in it and there is a twist all of us who have had to deal with managed care and as a physician i certainly have in advocating for my patients knows that managed care has put severe time limits on whether patients can stay in the hospital we will talk about some of those examples so now it is sort of funny that this hmo manager is going to get his comeuppance i think that is part of the humor the humor of hmos in order for something to be humorous people have to understand the underlying point so let us just look for example at some of the cartoons that we have seen around the country here is one we see a doctor sitting at a desk he is reading a paper behind him is an eye chart that says enough is enough and the doctor is saying your best option is cremation 359 fully covered the patient sort of nonplussed is sitting there saying this is one of those hmo gag rules isnt it doctor now this is a little harder to see for my colleagues here in the audience tonight i will have to read this to you here is a physician sitting behind his desk he is talking to a patient the physician is saying i will have to check my contract before i answer that question now what is the point of this cartoon well about 3 years ago it became known that hmos were writing contracts that required the doctor to check with the hmo before they told the patient all their treatment options now think about that let us say that one is a woman one has a lump in ones breast one goes in to see ones doctor ones doctor takes ones history does ones physical exam and then says ahhah excuse me and steps outside gets on the phone to the hmo and says mrs soandso has a lump in her breast she has got three treatment options one is more expensive than the other is it okay if i tell her what her three options are i mean that is awful as a practicing physician in solo practice for 10 years after medical school and residency i can tell my colleagues that the doctorpatient relationship will not stand that type of restriction on communication patients have to trust their physician to be able to tell them thewhole story it may be that the hmo is not going to cover part of the treatment or one of the options but the patient has every right to know what all the options are at a minimum then we start to get into some things that are a little less than funny on an issue like this here is a headline from the new york post what his parents did not know about hmos may have killed this baby now here is an infant that died possibly because his hmo prevented his physician from communicating to his parents the entire story it is not so funny anymore let us go to the case of a lady whose story was covered in time magazine a couple years ago well documented this lady is no longer alive her hmo made a medical decision to try to limit her and her family her husband from knowing all of her treatment options they put a lot of pressure on the medical center to prevent and actually change their opinion on what kind of treatment this patient should have this lady could be alive today as a mother to her children and a wife to her husband had not that hmo made a medical decision that limited the information that she got not so funny anymore so what happened well i and the gentleman from massachusetts in a bipartisan fashion reached across the aisle and we got about 285 cosponsors to sign a bill called the patient right to know act this was about 3 years ago now 285 bipartisan cosponsors we discussed some suspension bills here tonight just with the cosponsors alone we could have brought that to the floor and passed it under suspension not to be i could not get my leadership to allow that limited bill with such widespread bipartisan support to handle the problem that hmos were limiting communications between the doctors and their patients i could not get the leadership to allow that to be voted on and debated on the floor well let us go back to some of the humor that has gone on about hmos remember the movie as good as it gets i went with my wife to this movie in des moines iowa and something happened i had never seen before when helen hunt was describing the care that her hmo gave in the movie to her asthmatic son she expressed a rather strong expletive about her hmo and the treatment she was getting for her son it elicited a lot of laughs in the audience but something else happened that i had never seen in a comedy in a movie theater some people stood up and clapped they actually started clapping for her strong statement of disapproval about the way her son was being treated now that does not happen humor like that is not effective if it is not understood and if it doesnt strike a nerve and a cord but it sure didin that movie now she was having problems with her son getting care and was frequently having to take him to emergency rooms here is another cartoon sort of that i saw here is a nurse on the phone i think this is from an old tv show this picture she is saying chest pains well let me find the emergency room preapproval forms what is one of the other problems that we have seen with hmos well it happens to be that a lot of hmos a few have refused to pay for emergency room visits let us say a patient gets a chest pain severe crushing chest pain the american heart association says this is a sign one could be having a heart attack ones wife takes one to the emergency room they do the ekg but it is normal they find out that instead one has severe inflammation of ones esophagus and ones stomach instead afterwards what does the hmo do they say see your ekg was normal you were not having a heart attack you did not need to go to the emergency room we are not going to pay for it what is the lessen that people start learning from that gee maybe if the hmo is not going to cover these things that the common layperson would say is an emergency maybe i should just take my time a little bit except that we know when that happens a certain number of people die before they get to the hospital now there certainly is such a thing as black humor and this cartoon has some of the blackest humor i have seen what we have here is a medical reviewer at an hmo and i am going to read this for my colleagues she is speaking on the telephone she says cuddly care hmo my name is bambi how may i help you she continues speaking on the phone oh you are at the emergency room and your husband needs approval for treatment he is gasping writhing eyes rolled back in his head it does not sound all that serious to me she says far side she says clutching his throat turning purple uhhuh have you tried an inhaler oh he is dead well then he certainly does not need treatment does he her last comment is people are always trying to rip us off pretty black humor but let us talk about a real case let us talk about this young woman who about a year and a half ago was hiking in the appalachian mountains she fell off a 40foot cliff she was lying at the bottom of that cliff with a broken skull a broken arm a broken pelvis semicomatose almost drowning in a pool of water fortunately her boyfriend was able to get an air ambulance in they took her to the hospital here she is all bundled up on the stretcher going to airlift her to the hospital she makes it to the hospital emergency room she is stabilized she is treated she is in the hospital for a month or so in the icu for a couple of weeks she is on a morphine drip those are pretty painful problems that she had plus she has broken her head she has got a fractured skull what happens to this young woman her limo refuses to pay the bill now why is that well the hmo said that she did not call ahead for prior authorization i mean think of that she was supposed to know that she was going to fall off this cliff maybe when she is lying at the bottom of the cliff with the broken skull a broken arm and a broken pelvis she is supposed to reach into her coat pocket with her nonbroken arm pull out a cellular phone dial a 1800 number and say bambi at that hmo i have a broken skull i need to go to the emergency room is that okay i mean that is the type of thing that we do not need to see that we need to fix and we need to fix it because congress passed a law about 25 years ago called erisa and what it did for employer plans was it took them out of state oversight state insurance commissioners and state legislatures they do not have much to say about plans that are offered by employers we talk a lot as republicans about devolving power back to the states but i have not seen my leadership too much interested in making sure that the states can provide proper oversight for health plans and so we have this law that congress created that basically left a vacuum state insurance commissioners cannot tell a plan like that woman who fell off the cliff they cannot tell her plan if she is in an employer plan that they have to cover her services those plans have been exempted from state oversight congress made that problem congress needs to fix it let us look at a few other cartoons that have been in the press here is one called the hmo bedside manner and we have an individual lying there with broken arms in traction and on the wall is the hmo bedside manner and it says time is money bed space is loss turnover is profit and then we have a physician at the bedside saying after consulting my colleagues in accounting we have concluded youre well enough now go home or how about this one remember the good old days when we took refresher courses in medical procedures this doctor is saying to a colleague now they are going into the hmo medical school and the course directory for the hmo medical school is first floor basic bookkeeping and accounting second floor advanced bookkeeping and accounting third floor graduate bookkeeping and accounting now here we have another example of the hmo emphasis on bottom line profits versus taking care of the patient this is the hmo claims department and we have a claims reviewer saying into her telephone no we dont authorize that specialist then she goes on no we dont cover that operation then she says no we dont pay for that medication then apparently the person on the other end of the line says something where she kind of jerks and she says no we dont consider this assisted suicide how about this cartoon that appeared in the boston globe we have an hmo doctor here and the patient is saying do you i ke more money if you give patients lass care the hmo employee says thats absurd crazy delusiona the patient comes back and says are you saying im paranoid the hmo employee says yes but we can treat it in three visits now my colleagues may think that this is kind of funny but as a plastic and reconstructive surgeon i took care of a lot of patients with this type of defect this is a little child born with a cleft lip and a cleft palate now the standard treatment for correction of this childs cleft palate is a surgical repair that gets the roof of the mouth together so that this child can learn to speak normally it also keeps food and liquids from going out his nose that is standard treatment do my colleagues know what some hmos are doing now they are writing into their contract language a definition of medical necessity that says we will only authorize payment for the cheapest least expensive care under federal law they can do that and nobody can challenge it because that is written into their contract so what does that mean for a little baby that is born with this type of defect it means that that hmo under federal law could tell the parents that they are not going to cover surgery that they are just going to provide their child with a little piece of plastic to kind of shove up into the roof of his mouth that will kind of fill in that hole of course if baby spits it out that does not matter if baby chokes on it i guess that could be a problem and of course the baby will not be able to learn to speak normally and eventually will continue to have problems with food coming out of his nose but under current federal law the current employee retirement income security act law that imo can write that medical definition any way they want not exactly the best way to take care of patients and one of the reasons why we need to do something to fix that now i just read this this is from the albany times union here is another emergency room story and this is about a lady by the name of elsa goldstein she had a medical emergency one night she went to the hospital emergency room she was given a medication in the hospital by the emergency room doctor she was supposed to take the medicine twice a day so she went to the local pharmacy where she has coverage through her hmo but the pharmacy would not provide her the medicine they wanted to charge her 109 for the medication so she said why is that i mean my insurance company is supposed to pay for this is it not and she was told yes but only if the hmo doctor writes the prescription she said well wait a minute i was in the emergency room this was an emergency room doctor who wrote me the prescription my hmo doctors office is closed it is in the middle of the night and i need that medication the response was sorry you cannot have it you can pay for it yourself and then she got on the phone with an imo representative who said oh just take this medication this overthecounter medication funny thing about this though this elsa goldstein happened to be a physician herself and the medication that this hmo bureaucrat was prescribing over the telephone she knew would have been detrimental to her health this is the type of stuff that goes on all of the time here is another one of these costcutting mechanisms what did that hmo try to do they tried to just dun this patient if they do it enough enough people will just give in they will just buy it on their own and then the hmo just makes more money now what did the hmos come up with as a great idea a few years ago remember this remember when they were saying oh people can just go to the hospital and go home right away in fact we are going to mandate those sort of drivethrough deliveries so here we have a picture of the maternity hospital and we have here the drivethrough window now only 6minute stays for new moms congratulations would you like fries with that and you have this as far as the woman in the car holding her newborn baby ready to drive through and drive out by the way this was the result of one of those milleman and robertson guidelines that the hmos like to use that they like to flaunt as their solutions how about dr welby now maybe he would be saying she had her baby 45 minutes ago discharge her once again we are getting into a little bit more black humor because here we have the operating room we have the doctors here and the doctor is saying scalpel and the hmo bean counter says pocket knife and then the doctor says suture and the hmo bean counter says bandaid and the doctor says let us get him into intensive care and the hmo bentonite says call a cab but here is a real story front page headlines new york post hmos cruel rules leave her dying for the doc she needs all of a sudden it is not so funny anymore because now we have a picture of a person who has probably lost her life because of an hmo medical decision which by the way under federal law an employer plan is not liable for the consequences of their medical decisions other than providing the cost of care not delivered and if the patient happens to die early then they are not responsible for anything well mr speaker it is getting kind of late so i want to talk about two more patients i want to talk about a conversation i had about a year ago with a pediatrician who worked in the washington d c area she is now doing research at one of the national labs i asked her why she left the practice of medicine she was a pediatric specialist in a pediatric icu and she said well i just got past the point of being able to deal with those hmos anymore but the straw that really broke my back was one day we had come into the intensive care unit a 5 or 6yearold boy who had been drowning he was still alive but just barely we had him hooked up to the ventilator we had him plugged into the iv we were giving him all the medicine that we could to try to save his life we were standing around the bedside it was not looking good but we were expending every effort to try to save this childs life and the phone rings in the icu and it is some hmo reviewer a thousand miles away wanting to know about the case probably looking at a computer screen and an algorithm and the questioning went sort of like this well tell me about this young patient oh he is on the ventilator well what is his prognosis the doctor says well it is not too good we are trying to do everything to save his life he has only been here an hour or so this hmo reviewer from a thousand miles away never having seen this patient then says this incredible thing probably looking at that computer screen on the ventilator poor prognosis next suggestion from the hmo one of these hmo guidelines well if his prognosis is so bad why do you not just send him home on a home ventilator now for anyone who has any medical experience on this that would make the hair on the back of their head stand up if that little child is going to survive he is going to need every ounce of expertise and skill from a whole team of nurses and doctors and for this medical reviewer to say send him home on a home ventilator is a death sentence what is the motivation behind it to save a few bucks i am going to close with one story this is a story about this little boy right here you see him tugging at his sisters sleeve when he was about 2 months old about 3 in the morning he was pretty sick he had a temperature of 104 and as mothers can tell he needed to go to the emergency room so his parents lived south of atlanta georgia his mother does the thing that the hmo says phones the 1800 number gets a distant voice from somebody who has never seen this little boy he says well i will let you go to an emergency room but i am only going to let you go to this one emergency room which is more than 65 miles away that is all i will authorize that is the only one we have a contract with to save money so mom and dad they are not health professionals they wrap up little jimmy in a blanket they get in the car dad starts driving they are halfway there and they pass three other hospital emergency rooms they could have stopped jimmy at but they do not have authorization they are not health care professionals but they do know if they stop unauthorized they will be stuck with potentially a very large bill so they follow the medical decision that that hmo reviewer made and push on except that before they get to the hospital that jimmy is supposed to go to he has a cardiac arrest his eyes roll back in his head he stops breathing his heart stops and his mom tries to keep him alive they pull into the emergency room mom leaps out of the car with this little baby screaming save my baby save my baby a nurse comes out gives him mouthtomouth resuscitation they bring the crash cart out they start the ivs they give him the medicine and they manage to get him going again they manage to save his life unfortunately they do not manage to save everything on jimmy because of that cardiac arrest from that decision that that hmo made jimmy ends up with gangrene of both hands and both feet and the doctors have to am putate both hands and both feet here is a picture of little jimmy today in order to save as much length on his arms and his legs they put skin grafts on after they amputated his hands and his feet i talked to his mom about a month ago jimmy is now learning to put on his biliteral leg prosthesis but he still needs a lot of help on getting on his bilateral hook prosthesis this little boy will never play basketball i will tell the speaker of the house that that little boy will never wrestle when this littleboy grows up and marries the woman that he loves he will never be able to caress her cheek with his hand do my colleagues know what the opponents of this patient protection legislation say they say this is just an anecdote we should not legislate on the basis of anecdotes i would say to them this little anecdote if he had a finger and you pricked it it would bleed and do my colleagues know that under federal law that hmo which made that medical decision is liable for nothing is that justice is that fair we need to change that law to encourage hmos not to cut corners like this so that we do not end up having to cut off hands and feet a judge reviewed this case and the hmos decision and came to the determination that that hmos margin of safety was razor thin i would add to that as razor thin as the scalpel that had to amputate little jimmys hands and feet my colleagues as my colleague from new jersey pointed out for years now we have been trying to get this to the floor for a fair debate we had a rigged debate last year with a fig leaf bill i am telling my friends on both sides of the aisle that there are republicans and there are democrats that have come together and we are working on a

devastating toll on colorados agriculture industry farm income has fallen dramatically over the past 2 years and it is difficult to predict how soon it might rebound while congress recently helped stave off disaster in rural america with an emergency assistance package it is evident gaping holes exist in federal crop insurance as a viable safety net in 1996 congress passed the freedom to farm act allowing producers the flexibility to adjust crop acreage in response to both economic and agronomic factors while providing farms a safety net through market transition payments loan rates and crop insurance recently some have suggested congress return to the old system of deficiency payments and production quotas and take action to increase loan rates and extended loan maturities in order to improve low commodity prices but because the international marketplace has grown so rapidly and because american exports of any particular commodity represent such a small percentage of world production reducing acreage in the united states no longer has much effect on world market prices unitedstates wheat exports for example only account for approximately 5 percent of global production the future of colorados farm profits does lie outside unitedstates borders i will continue my work in congress to guarantee fair and abundant trading opportunities overseas for our producers and their commodities as this progresses however we must also ensure a viable safety net exists for farmers and ranchers in countering the effects of unexpected market disruptions and natural disasters i am working alongside the chairman and other members of the house committee on agriculture to develop a better more comprehensive risk management program which will provide incentives for farmers to participate while protecting against losses and low market prices this plan will allow the market to work without artificially raising consumer prices without pricing us out of the export market

natural disasters but also encourage and reward the production of the harvesting of crops reforming the current risk management system will take a lot of hard work and the interaction between colorado

consume i rise in support of the bill as my friend the gentleman from florida indicated this bill is very simple it does nothing more than to confer upon a state the right to go to federal court to stop someone from outside the state from violating its liquor laws it is nothing more it is nothing less it in no way changes substantive law at the state or federal level the bill is necessary not only to prevent illegal shipments to minors but to enable states to police licensing standards track sales and collect taxes on those sales last year illegal alcohol shipments cost states some 600 million in lost revenues state taxes on alcohol are an important source of support for state programs and protecting that funding stream is a legitimate state objective some who are opposed to this legislation argue that it would impede the development of electronic commerce by taxing the internet or chilling direct sales of wine and spirits over the internet well whatever the merits of chilled wine are there is no merit whatsoever to these arguments as my friend the gentleman from florida pointed out lawful sales of alcohol over the internet are thriving such online enterprises as wineshopper com sendwine com and virtualvineyard com generated hundreds of millions of dollars in lawful online sales last year alone just last month geerlings wade of massachusetts which has endorsed this bill and is the nations largest direct marketer of wines announced another new website called winebins com which will sell thousands of labels in the 27 states in which the company is operating is licensed to operate no doubt it will continue to add new labels let us be clear the bill would impose no new taxes on any of these electronic transactions nor would it make them illegal the state laws we seek to defend were put into place to regulate alcohol sales after the failure of prohibition in effect they were the instrument by which an illegal enterprise bootlegging was turned into a lawful and regulated activity some will argue that now these laws are an anachronism well maybe they are correct maybe there is a better way for states to protect minors track sales ensure quality control and to raise taxes but that is an argument better addressed by state legislatures which have the power to rewrite those laws until they do so they have a right to expect that the laws on the books will be enforced that is really what the legislation is all about if we permit states to pass laws but deny them a remedy when those laws are broken we encourage disrespect for the law it is

remarkable contributions to humanity pope john paul ii has touched the lives of many and continues to be a powerful and enduring force in fostering peace among nations and in reconciling the three great religious faiths of the children of abraham christianity judaism and islam i am honored to stand before this house today joining catholics from my district the unitedstates the rest of the world and people of all faiths in recognizing this remarkable mans monumental contributions to humanity karol joseph wojtyla was born 80 years ago in an industrial town near cracow in poland in fact the holy father just celebrated his 80th birthday this past thursday may 18th during which he celebrated mass ate lobster with senior clergy in the vatican and sang songs with polish compatriots as a teenager during the second world war karol wojtyla experienced firsthand the horrors of nazism the holocaust and soon thereafter communist totalitarianism i have carried with me the history culture experience and language of poland said the pope once having lived in a country that had to fight for its existence in the face of the aggressions of its neighbors i have understood what exploitation is i put myself immediately on the side of the poor the disinherited the oppressed the marginalized and the defenseless said the pope after considering a career as an actor and even petitioning three times to become a catholic monk he was persuaded by the thenarchbishop of cracowwho recognized his charisma oratorical talents and potential to help people directlyto pursue the priesthood he was ordained as a catholic priest in 1946 became archbishop of cracow in 1958 cardinal in 1967 and was elected pope by the vaticans college of cardinals in 1978 at the age of 58the first nonitalian pope since the holy pontiff by his own description is a moral leader who believes in the sanctity of the human being over the years he has denounced the excesses and affronts to human dignity of the two major competing social systems of the 20th century communism and capitalism he has condemned the atheistic and dehumanizing forces of communism which he experienced in poland and he has denounced the more unsavory aspects of modem capitalism such as greed abject poverty selfishness and secular atheism according to his spokesman the holy pontiffs goal is to establish a mode of christian thinking to serve as a meaningful alternative to the humanist philosophies of the 20th century such as marxism and postmodernism his moral philosophy and its impact on world affairs eamed him the honor of time magazine man of the year of 1994 which described him as the most tireless moral voice of a secular age pope john paul iis moral philosophy has brought much needed attention to the plight of the worlds poor in this vein the pope has called for substantial reduction or outright cancellation of the international debt that seriously threatens the future of many of the poorest nations inspired in part by the popes example we are proud to have contributed to the enactment of international debt relief legislation last year which was facilitated by the jubilee 2000 movementthrough which the holy father has nurtured meaningful ecumenical cooperation pope john paul ii has already left us a substantial body of written work that will nourish future generations with the wisdom and benevolence of this moral philosophy in fact his writings fill nearly 150 volumes through his encyclicals homilies letters and other writings this pope of letters has inspired the world to embrace universal principles of human dignity and human rights in 1994 his popular volume of philosophical and moral ruminations crossing the threshold of hope became an immediate bestseller in 12 countries the most traveled pope in history pope john paul ii has brought his message of peace and reconciliation to 117 countries in his most recent visit to israel for example the holy father prayed at the western wall one of judaisms holiest sites his prayer an unprecedented act of contrition on behalf of catholic christians read as follows we are deeply saddened by the behavior of those who in the course of history have caused these children of yours to suffer and asking your forgiveness we wish to commit ourselves to genuine brotherhood with the people of the covenant and how can we forget his groundbreaking trip to cuba in 1998 on that papal visit he condemned the dehumanizing and immoral aspects of both cuban communism and the outdatedand senselessunitedstates trade embargo as customary his words echoed in the farthest corners of the world pope john paul ii understands one of the most fundamental christian principles that has become a hallmark for fostering reconciliation forgiveness in one of the most remarkable acts of forgiveness ever witnessed publicly the holy father confronted the man that attempted to assassinate him and forgave him for his grave sin the holy fathers acts of compassion stem from his inherently benevolent nature his compassion charisma and moral authority are celebrated by leaders of other faiths for instance the dalai lama the spiritual leader of the worlds buddhists has said of the pope he really has a will and a determination to help humanity through spirituality that is marvelous that is good i know how difficult it is for leaders on these issues rev billy graham a spiritual adviser to many unitedstates presidents has also said about the pope hell go down in history as the greatest of our modern popes hes been the strong conscience of the whole christian world when pope john paul speaks whether to those gathered at st peters square at the vatican or in a mass delivered in the backwaters of cuba the world listens the world listens because he is the most powerful moral force in our lifetimes an apostle for social justice a champion of the poor and a harbinger of peace i urge the congress to move swiftly on this legislation so

hatreds in this century we have seen too many expressions of extreme racial religious and ethnic statements leading to actions of persecution and discrimination and ultimately to genocide not to be painfully aware of the significance of statements of hate and violence being uttered in halls of parliament we clearly cannot ignore the antisemitic statements emanating from some quarters of the russian duma words are powerful and they have consequences they can incite action words are usually the first step in a chain of events leading ultimately to genocide the words that we have heard from some duma members should outrage every civilized person in this country and elsewhere our action must be to condemn such outrageous statements as our resolution does but our resolution should also commend those in russia including president yeltsin and some members of the duma who have spoken out against statements of hate i might mention parenthetically that one of the most courageous human rights advocates of the duma a courageous woman parliamentarian was killed in cold blood in her apartment house just because she has spoken out against incitement to hatred and murder as russia struggles through a very difficult economic period russian leaders must be particularly cautious and careful not to promote scapegoating in their society it is therefore very heartening that some russian leaders particularly president yeltsin have spoken out against incitement to hatred persecution and ultimately murder it shows that there are some russian leaders who clearly recognize that racism and antisemitism have no place in the modern russian society this issue is very high on the agenda of our administration secretary albright raised the matter during her recent trip to moscow

involvement in the arts the question is how much money let me take a try at explaining why we should be putting more money into these organizations at this time the national endowment for the arts has been treated unkindly by this body for too long since the early 1990s the nea for example has seen its funding reduced from 162 million in 1995 to 99 million in 1996 to 97 6 million last year so even if we adopt this amendment the nea budget would still fall short of the presidents budget request to the credit of the nea it is continuing to do more with less even with the shrinking budget over the last 5 years nea has provided a greater number of grants to more communities across the entire country unfortunately simple math will tell us while the number of grants has risen the average grant amount has dropped by 45 percent we must stop starving the national endowment for the arts we have won the fight i hope for the existence of the nea and the neh and library services but every year it seems we have to fight to raise it above starvation whether it is the kennedy centers touring company in manalapan or the boy choir school or the mccarter theater all of those in my district or a nonprofit group in tuscaloosa alabama or in lake placid new york funding for the nea touches all of our constituents bringing them arts cultural events and educational opportunities visual and

flexibility when they administer federal education programs but we also believe that flexibility should be coupled with accountability to ensure that our teachers students and parents receive the

prevention and victim protection act of 1999 the bill was introduced by the gentlewoman from new york and this bill has been the result of 4 years of hard labor on behalf of the gentlewoman from new york she recognized that presently we have over 1 million women in this country that are being stalked we have about 400 000 men and we have hundreds of thousands of children that are now being stalked because of the internet the full committee on the judiciary favorably reported the bill as amended by voice vote the goals of the bill are to expand the reach of the federal stalking statute to prosecute cyberstalkers who are currently beyond the reach of federal law enforcement but are deserving of federal prosecution and to better protect stalking victims by authorizing pretrial detention for alleged stalkers and mandating the issuing of a civil protection order against convicted stalkers these goals are worthwhile and these goals will give federal prosecutors the tools they need to prosecute stalkers who might otherwise not be prosecuted at the state and local level that said let me emphasize that the vast majority of stalking cases are and even after this legislation passes will be prosecuted at the state and local level this legislation does not in any way seek to federalize stalking crimes what it does do is that it will help federal prosecutors respond to predatory stalking behavior that under current law is beyond the reach of state and local officials because of cyberstalking the bill would make several significant changes or additions to current law i would like to go over those at this time first it wolld reach stalkers who use the mail or any facility in interstate or foreign commerce to stalk their victims a lot of times that is the internet under current law federal jurisdiction over stalking crimes is triggered only when a stalker actually crosses state lines physically with the intent to injure or harass a person and his conduct places that person in reasonable fear of death or bodily injury so members can see from that definition it would not include someone stalking by use of the mail or the internet because they would not physically cross a state line this bill actually just brings us into the electronic age and is long overdue the physical travel requirements preclude the federal prosecution of stalkers who use other means of interstate communication such as mail or the internet to threaten or harass their victims with the explosive growth of the internet and other telecommunication technologies there is evidence of cyberstalking stalking using advanced communication technologies is becoming a serious problem i am sure the gentlewoman from new york will speak further to that the second thing this bill does it will require that a federal court when sentencing a defendant convicted of stalking that it issue a protective order to protect the victim from further stalking prior to the trial unfortunately some stalkers remain interested in their targets for years even after they have been prosecuted convicted and incarcerated for stalking a civil protection order would permit a federal court to maintain jurisdiction over the convicted stalker after the completion of the sentence imposed by the crime both to reduce the threat of future stalking by the defendant and to provide an enforcement mechanism should the order be violated that is the probation order in most cases or the protective order the suspension document presently before the house contains a modification to the protection order language specifically to paragraph c of what will be the new 18 unitedstates code section 2261 a concern was expressed with the reported version of the bill that protective orders might continue in force in perpetuity long after any need for them the suspension document addresses that problem by assuring that a federal court will have the discretion to craft a protective order to fit the circumstances of each case the new language reads that such an order shall remain in effect for such time as the court deems necessary and may be modified extended or terminated at any time after notice to the victim and an opportunity for a hearing third the bill would permit a federal court to order the detention of an alleged stalking defendant pending trial in order to assure the safety of the victim and the community as well as the defendants appearance at trial this is because of one simple fact this is that fact that stalking victims run a higher risk of being assaulted or even killed by a stalker immediately after the criminal justice system intervenes that is just after the stalker is arrested and then released on bond prior to trial it wag only 9 years ago that the first antistalking statute was passed in california since that time all 50 states have enacted stalking statutes in one form or another congress passed the first federal stalking statute in 1996 this bill would be the first amendment to that statute since it was enacted i believe that this bill will give federal prosecutors better tools to more effectively prosecute interstate stalking in cyberstalking cases and to better protect the victims of those crimes and the community i urge all my colleagues to support the bill as amended i am pleased to manage this bill on behalf of my friend and

express my strong opposition to the boehlert amendment and urge my colleagues to oppose any efforts to delete provisions which provide access to the federal courts for property owners pursuing takings claims against local governments currently property owners do not have the option of directly pursuing a fifth amendment claim in federal court they must exhaust all possible state and local administrative remedies first which is an expensive and time consuming process that may leave owners in administrative limbo for years on average it takes 8 to 10 years for property owners to get a hearing on facts of their cases that is just not right i am a strong advocate of the traditional and historic rights and responsibilities of state and local governments i support the position that decisions affecting local communities are best made at the local level however individual private property owners seem to have no recourse in landuse disputes currently federal involvement is outlined in h r 2372 and constitutionally is needed to protect their rights i want to make sure individual property owners are heard regardless of whether there disagreement is with local state or federal governments the boehlert amendment would gut significant protections when the taking was made by state and local governments the base bill should be left intact to remedy this situation by defining issue when a governments agency decision is final so that owners do not encounter an infinite cycle of appeals the bill does not change the way local state or federal agencies resolve disputes with property owners h r 2372 is not targeted at local government nor does it take away control of local zoning decisions from local officials if anything it is targeted at federal courts for wasting time and money by delaying consideration of these very important cases by simply providing clearer language for federal courts on when a final agency action has taken place the courts have no reason not to hear the case on its merits furthermore h r 2372 does not permit federal courts to get involved in the land use decisionmaking process nor does it change the way agencies resolve disputes property owners can get into federal court only after local government has reached afinal decision a final decision is reached only after the property owner makes a series of applications and appeals through the local planning and zoning process the legislation requires a property owner to pursue only federal constitutional issues in federal court a function our federal court system has always performed h r 2372 does not give the federal judiciary any more or less power than it currently has the federal contract now has and always has had theresponsibility to review the constitutionality of actions taken by all levels of government property owners do not want centralized authority over landuse decisions indeed that is more often the position of those opposed to property rights legislation h r
