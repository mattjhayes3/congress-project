this plan whether they are young middle class families middle class federal employees or middle class eldery the middle class will be hit by the btu tax which will cost the average family approximately 500 in additional taxes they will be hit with fewer jobs an estimated 400 000 to 600 000 fewer jobs throughout the country including approximately 1 600 jobs lost in my district along according to the national taxpayers union every worker and every business throughout my state and throughout this country will be hit with this new tax big this will in turn hurt our competitiveness abroad as we raise the price of doing business for every employer and producer in the united states this btu tax penalizes lower and middleincome families hurt schools and hospitals and increases our dependence on foreign oil under this tax hospitals will have to spend more or energy and less on healing schools will have to spend more money on transporting kids to school and less on educating them parents will have to spend more money getting back and forth to work less on supporting their families adding tens of thousands of dollars to school and hospital budgets will have a devastating impact on local economies and dramatically harm the physical and educational welfare of millions of individuals the affordable energy alliance estimates that had this proposed btu tax been fully implemented in 1990 virginia residents and businesses would have paid 701 4 million in additional energy taxes a tax burden this large would hit virginias economy particularly hard at a time when we have defense cutbacks hitting our area disproportionately along with millions of federal employees who will be subject to a wage freeze the national association of counties has noted that these increased federal taxes will reduce local revenues and result in the need for local governments to increase property taxes sales taxes and service fees at a time when local governments are still experiencing the adverse effects of the recession again the middle class will be hit the hardest the elderly on fixed incomes are also hit hard under this clinton plan the democrat plan promises to raise taxes on seniors making as late as 25 000 and while the energy tax is indexed the income level at which social security benefits will be taxed at a higher level is not indexed so millions of seniors will graduate into this new tax bracket each year and this increased tax in a breach of trust with the american people will not be returned to the social security trust fund but will instead be diverted into the general revenue fund for increased government spending no country in the world has this kind of tax this tax will be very difficult to administer and will require all kinds of new regulations and regulators to enforce it this bill reserves for the treasury department the power to unilaterally change new energy tax rates expand or contract the products subject to the tax and the power to exempt certain taxpayers this means the rules on this tax can continue to be changed and businesses will be subject to ever changing rules again this will hurt competitiveness and is not fair the republican alternative to the democratic tax plan is superior in many respects and i will support it because it achieves considerable deficit reduction without the burdensome taxes which i have just described my republican colleagues who helped fashion this plan did so under considerable time restrictions and have made many tough decisions in crafting this plan the kasich plan will reduce the budget deficit by 352 billion yet does not increase taxes or touch social security benefits while the clinton plan places a disproportionate burden on federal and military employees and retirees the republican plan eases this heavy burden i believe the men and women who serve in the civil service and milltary should be treated fairly it is important to consider the longterm benefits of having a qualified and effective federal and military workforce and be cautious in producing shortterm savings at their expense unlike the clinton plan the republican substitute wont delay federal retirees cost of living adjustments and it wont put limits on federal employees colas or locality pay also it does not delay military retirees colas and it does not freeze military pay the way the democrat plan would do coupled with the tax increases federal and military employees and retirees would suffer more than any other segment of the population under the clinton plan the republican plan is a dramatic improvement over the tax and spend democrat budget however the republican plan has some aspects i am concerned about under the republican substitute federal employees retirement age would be increased from age 55 to 62 and nondisabled military retirees would have their colas delayed until they reach age 62 federal employees have relied to their detriment on certain promises made by their employer the federal government and these promises should be respecied no other nongovernmental entity can unilaterally alter the terms of an employment contract its illegal and wrong while the congress can change the terms of an employees employment or retirement legally it is still unfair i reiterate that the republican substitute is substantially more equitable to federal and military employees and retirees than the democrat version however if i had the opportunity to amend either version which i dont because the rules committee gagged every member of this body by only allowing one amendment on the floor today i would offer additional spending cuts to make up the difference in maintaining the federal and military employee and retirees benefits what could we possibly cut to make up the difference i suggest and many would agree that we cut funding for the superconducting super collider others concerned could find other cuts if given the opportunity under the rules plagued with dramatic cost overruns management problems and no foreign contnbutions to the projects as was promised i believe this is a project that we cant currently afford given our budget defict yesterday mr victor s rezendes director of energy and science issues resources community and economic development dmsion of the unitedstates general accounting office testified that the total estimated cost of the scc is not yet known but the projects total cost will exceed 11 billion this 11 billion is more than enough to keep our commitment to federal and military employees and retirees if this plan passes the house i would work to restore these benefits by cutting the scc all americans have a deep concern about the deficit which i share and want us to cut the deficit so our children and grandchildren dont bear the burden of our ex cess the clinton plan increases taxes increases spending and as a result the deficit will not be reduced in order to cut the deficit americans want us to cut spending

merits and which could be debated on the issue of whether we should vote today to instruct that we cut spending or whether we should vote to increase spending i thought that was a fair and a legitimate and a straightforward question everywhere america is at and that those who wanted to raise taxes and to raise spending would be able to vote no against the gentleman from ohio but those who wanted to cut spending and therefore lower the need to raise taxes could vote yes i thought that we would have a debate on the principle i have heard as i understand it two of my colleagues democrats come to the floor and explain that they have been totally irresponsible that even though their party has run the house since 1955 january 1955 when samuel rayburn was sworn in as speaker and has been speaker and i was i must confess only 11 at the time old by the standards of some of our freshmen but 11 and from the time i was 11 until this year when i had my 50th birthday the democratic leadership has been in charge they have been in charge of the speakers chair they have been in charge of every committee every committee they set up the ratio in the committee on rules to always get the rule they want except for the most rare occasion they get the big offices the big staffs they get the majority leader positions of enormous power they set the schedule every bill under our constitution which spends money comes out of the congress every tax bill which raises taxes comes out of the house and the democrats have controlled this house since 1954 and they are proud of it a few of them have the courage to actually applaud and i assume would actually take responsibility for the size of the deficit the size of the taxes and the failure of the welfare state which has been part of that legacy but my good friends came over today and they say that oh for the last 12 years the republicans have been in charge now this is not a parliamentary democracy under our constitution senator mrrchell and the distinguished powerful members of the other body can do much to obstruct the president and certainly under our constitution speakers oneill wright and foley all democrats could do much to obstruct the president to say with a straight face that ronald reagan got his program through with his changes and his reforms that we had the entitlement reforms reagan would have wanted everyone here knows that if reagan like thatcher had had a parliamentary system if he could have won a straight vote in this house and i think that this is an important and legitimate intellectual debate about whether at this moment america should raise taxes in order to raise spending which is the democratic party leadership position or whether america should cut spending first which is what the gentleman from ohio is going to try to offer in a minute but i think that that should be debated on the merits i as a history teacher want to stay on this one theme for a minute under our constitution the congress is very powerful if you read the federalist papers the founding fathers said that in peacetime the congress would be more powerful than the president and that the house would be the more powerful because it is the more numerous of the bodies i would simply say to my democratic friends that it demeans your own partys proud history of running this place since 1954 it demeans the constitution and it demeans the factual history of the house to suggest that ronald reagan got what he wanted as somebody who has served with president bush and was the whip on the republican side i can assure you that he did not get what he wanted i can assure you that he only agreed to taxes in 1990 the biggest mistake of his career because the democratic leadership said if you do not cave in and break your word we will walk out of the budget summit i can assure you that if bob dole had been the majority leader and bob michel would have been the speaker we would have passed a 1990 budget deal built like the kasich budget around spending cuts not around tax increases i will be glad if you get time from your side to answer questions or to comment all i will say is that any person who gets up here and suggests that in the last 12 years the reaganbush programs were passed intact is in fact not being accurate that is not historically correct that is not how it hapened as i saidearlier ronald reagan was not margaret thatcher and he could not pass his program by a parliamentary vote so all i would say is that why do we not spend the rest of this debate on the focus of todays motion should we cut spending first or as the democratic leadership wants should we defeat kasich so we can raise taxes in order to raise spending i understand and if i were the democratic leadership with the current polls in this country with the country by 77 to 6 favoring spending cuts with the country by a clear plurality opposed to the economic tax increase package with the country worried about bigger taxes leading to recession i would try to go back and offer an alternative vision of the past too but f challenge the democrats for the rest of this debate stay on the question should we cut spending first or should we raise taxes in order to raise spending and if your side has time i will stay here and answer questions i am not afraid to debate i just do not want

make it very clear right up front what we intend to do on this rule right now this is virtually a gag rule permitting just on republican substitute but no separate votes on three critical areas i am therefore urging members to defeat the previous question so that i can offer an amendment to the rule that makes in order just three additional amendments subject to 1hour of debate each first the michelsnowe amendment to strike the btu middle class energy tax and replace it with real spending cuts second an archer amendment to strike the tax increase on seniors social security benefits and third a stenholm substitute amendment for title xvi to provide entitlement caps with a real hammer enforcement mechanism that is all my amendment would do as much as we would like to make in order all of the amendment presented to the rules committee i think it is far better that we keep this previous question vote as simple as possible so that there is no mistake what your vote means to quote from this mornings wall street journal editorial the point is that members shouldnt be able to claim they opposed parts of the tax bill but were helpless to amend it a vote for the closed rule is a vote for the largest tax increase in american history if you told the average constituent in my district that this week we are voting on a reconciliation bill you would probably draw a blank look that is insidethebeltway budgetary jargon but if you tell that same constituent that we are considering the presidents tax billthe largest tax increase in historythere would be a look of instant recognition shock and outrage when the president first unveiled his tax program i thought the president might just get away with the socalled btu tax because it was beyond the comprehension of most of the btu might as well have stood for beyond taxpayer understanding but the public didnt take long to catch on to the btu tax in my district the people know it is going to hit them in the pocketbook at every turnfrom the gas station to the supermarket to state and local taxes to the home today btu is well understood to stand for bleed taxpayers unconscious it is a middle class tax increase plain and simple the same goes for the presidents senior citizen tax increase try as the president may to depict this as a tax on upper income individuals the senlors in my district who make 25 000 a year as individuals or 532 000 a year as couples hardly consider themselves wealthy its another tax on middle clas taxpayers only in this case on those who are retired on fixed incomes the purpose of a reconciliation bill is supposedly to bring our actual spending decisions into line with what we can affordto reconcile our appetites with our incomes the problem is as everyone knows that the government has a voracious appetite that can never be satisfied and so instead of curbing our appetite to match our income we are being asked to increase that income to feed that government appetite for more and more spending and more and more government programs unfortunately the government is not a selfsupporting creature that has any incomeproducing earning capacity it must therefore depend on the incomes of others to satisfy its insatiable appetites and the others it must depend on most heavily are the great mass of middle income workers who are barely getting by now on what they earn yet they are being told by the president that they must sacrifice more for the good of their government it is hard to believe that this is the same president who a few short months ago promised middle class taxpayers a tax out not a tax increase you may recall this little campaign book put out by governor clinton and senator gors entitled putting people first how we can all change america on page 15 of that book there is a paragraph entitled middle class tax fairness in which coauthors clinton and gore promised and i quote we will lower the tax burden on middleclass americans by asking the very wealthy to pay their fair share and it goes on middleclass taxpayers will have a choice between a childrens tax credit or a significant reduction in their income tax rate in the interests of truth in political advertising and labeling i think the president and vice president should publish a revised edition of their campaign book that reconciles their campaign promises with the reality of their record this book should be entitled putting taxes first how we will shortchange america that is just what is happening in this socalled reconciliation bill instead of getting a tax break middle class americans are getting shortchanged well that is not the kind of change my constituents voted for they did not send us here to raise their taxes they sent us here to cut government spending and that is why it is so important for us to change this unfair gag rule and make in order amendments that will do just thattake out the taxes on the middle class and replace them with deeper spending cuts they want us to be able to offer amendments to strike the middleclass energy tax and the middleclass seniors tax and replace them with spending cuts and yet the democrat majority leadership through its wholly owned subsidiary the rules committee has said no to the american people and to these amendments once again they have shut the people out of their own house for the sake of cramming the presidents tax increases down the throats of middleclass taxpayers the time has come for this house to do the right thing and say no to this antidemocratic and antimiddle class rule i urge my

spending cuts for them vote down the previous question and for a rule that will allow us to offer responsible alternatives that will take the tax burden off the backs of the middle class and put the

those members who have been planning to speak on the unfunded mandate portion of the evening this is it if they are out there and they want to come over we would love to have them this is a special order and it is an important special order it is important because it deals with the most pressing issue facing states and local governments today that is beginning the issue of unfunded mandates as many of us know today has been designated as national unfunded mandate day a day in which local officials across the country were to begin educating the public of the devastating consequences of unfunded federal mandates i was told by the unitedstates conference of mayors which was the primary sponsor of the national unfunded mandate day that over 1 000 local officials around the nation held events in which they singled out unfunded federal mandates as the biggest problem they face in these communities the message to the congress was clear stop approving legislation that imposes requirements on local governments without containing the resources necessary to carry out that mandate this august i and a number of members of congress have formed the congressional caucus on unfunded mandates in order to bring together members of congress who agree that this body must honestly address this issue since august we have 84 members of the congress who have joined the caucus on unfunded mandates as anybody who knows me can attest i am not a frequent participant in special orders however i feel that this issue is so important to our nation that it deserves the topic of discussion on the house floor in addition i feel that a special order devoted solely to unfunded federal mandates is appropriate activity for national unfunded mandate day i am proud to join with my colleagues and local government across this country to try to educate congress and the american people about unfunded mandates unfunded mandates is what we call in the business feel good legislation that is where we in congress get to feel good and pass the cost on to local governments we have got to put a stop to that there are a group of members of congress who have come together to try to find a bipartisan solution this is a bipartisan issue democrats and republicans have come together to try to come to a consensus about how we deal with the unfunded federal mandate issue and we do have limited time this evening i would like to share with my colleagues some profiles of cities that are being adversely affected by unfunded federal mandates for instance the city of phoenix az could provide substantially lower water and sewer rates to its citizens if they did not have to commit much of their local revenue to unfunded mandates in fresno ca the city estimated the costs of closing a landfill without federal mandates to be 10 to 12 million however because the landfill is included as a supedund site the cost of closing the facility will range from 35 to 60 million you should note that all of the costs will be borne by the citys solid waste rate payers in los angeles unfunded mandates will have a detrimental impact on the citys ability to provide essential swvices mayor richard riordan has told me that he could put many more cops on the streets if the city did not have to comply with so many unfunded federal mandates in philadelphia an environmental protection agency requirement that the city develop an advanced wastewater treatment system to inprove the oxygen levels for fish in the delaware water basin will cost philadelphia upwards of 500 million the mayor of philadelphia ed rendell has told me that he will not comply with this mandate because there is no way that he can justify this expenditure to the citizens of philadelphia merced ca located in my congressional district will incur 1 4 million in unfunded federal mandates in 199394 in order to balance this years budget merced had to cut over 30 staff positions remember merced only has a population of 53 000 people and it is suffering in the worst sort of way because of unfunded federal mandates in modesto ca also in my congressional district the city will spend 5 8 million on nine federal mandates over the next 6 years this money could be used to hire 150 police officers in stockton ca the san joaquin county district attorney was contemplating laying off onequarter of his prosecutors because of unfunded mandates however a temporary extension of the 1cent sales tax surcharge allowed the county to retain its prosecutors nevertheless if a permanent solution is not found the da will be forced to let these prosecutors go thus leaving the citizens of san joaquin county unprotected from crime in california the classic example of an unfunded federal mandate is immigration our immigration policy is solely the province of the federal government congress and the administration determine who may enter this country and to a great extent they determine where these immigrants reside however the state of california and its counties are responsible for the education health and welfare of these people for this year governor wilson has stated that providing social services to these people will cost the state at least 1 4 billion it should be clear to those listening to this debate that unfunded federal mandates are a problem what can we do in congress to mitigate the problems of unfunded federal mandates well we can prevent future unfunded federal mandates from being enacted since last year i have tried to offer floor amendments to any legislation considered by the house that contains unfunded mandates last congress the house considered the voting rights language assistance act of 1992 this legislation mandated that states and local jurisdictions containing large minorty populations print voting materials in the native language of those groups this mandate will no doubt increase the normal costs of running elections when the voting rights language assistance act of 1992 was considered on the house floor i offered an amendment that would have required the federal government to reimburse local governments for the increased costs due to this mandate unfortunately my amendment was defeated by two votes this congress i wanted to offer a similar amendment to the national voter registration act more commonly referred to as motorvoter it was estimated that motorvoter would cost my state of califomia 26 million a year the congressional budget office estimated the cost of compliance for all of the states to be 200 million unfortunately the rules committee did not allow my amendment to be offered and the congress went ahead and pushed another unfunded mandate onto the states last week i along with congressman goodling offered an amendment to the education goals 2000 that clarified that the bill would not become an unfunded mandate on states and school districts i am proud that our amendment was unanimously approved by the full house it is my full intention to continue offering these sorts of amendments to unfunded mandates that make their way to th house floor i would appreciate the assistance of my colleagues in this endeavor besides offering floor amendments i believe that this body needs to consider specific mandate relief legislation to that end i dave introduced h r 140 the federal mandate relief act of 1993 my bill is very simple it merely states that compliance with or implementation of an unfunded federal mandate is voluntary for states and localities until the federal govemiment provides the funding needed to pay for the mandated requirements the bill is not retroactive and would only apply to mandates which take effect on or after the date of enactment by requiring the federal government to put up the money before it can enforce any future mandates my bill accomplishes exactly what local governments are requesting that is why h r 140 has been endorsed by the unitedstates conference of mayors the national association of counties the national league of cites the national association of towns and townships the national conference of state legislatures the council of state governments and the

an abdication of the leadership we were elected to provide i believe the combination of the budget resolution and the stimulus package beat fulfills our dual obligation to cut the deficit substantially and create good jobs balance is the key and while i respect the credible bills my republican colleagues have put forward we need the job creation tools provided in the presidents plan this legislation does two vital things it provides real deficit reduction and spending cuts before any revenue increases many feared that the congress would not find the courage to make the spending reductions that president clinton proposed this is a proud day for the congress because not only do we meet the presidents goals we exceed them by 63 billion and we provide real job creation this is not a plan to create makework government jobs it is designed primarily to stimulate the private sector to provide the manufacturing and hightechnology jobs our future prosperity depends upon privatesector job creation is integral to economic recovery and it is totally absent from the republican proposals while this budget resolution is not perfect i douht that a perfect plan exists i support this plan because it best addresses the concerns i heard from my constituents and because it fairly balances the benefits and the burdens for all of us i am also hopeful that at a later stage

some of the big ticket science programs jon hokanson of palos verdes estates said the space station is now a luxury we cant afford it i favor stopping all funding on it until we have two consecutive years of the balanced budget the supercollider is also in the same category and should be cut unless the national laboratories can redefine their roles to be committed in a meaningful way to increasing economic competitiveness their budgets should be drastically reduced i favor increased funding to catch tax fraud i favor increased taxation of foreign companies business activities in the unitedstates also strict term limits for all federal elect ed officials similar to californias term limits mary hakanson of palos verdes estates said cancel supercollider stop tobacco subsidies enforce repayment of student loans enforce child support payments nationally cut all congressional perkslobster dinners for 4 25 cheap haircuts drugs limousines and travel r support term limits and

could be eased by immediate vigorous attention to the conversion of skills in the aerospace industry to peacetime uses jane freidkin of el segundo said change the way agencies receiving taxpayers dollars are funded each year i e in 1974 a local state funded child care center had to spend 7000 before the end of the year in order to be refunded the following year so the center bussed their preschoolers and elementary students to sea world and disneyland that same year i had worked all year 1213 hours per day 5 days a week and my net profit for working all year was 7000 the director told

benefits 15k equipment facility and overhead these are my guesses but does maybe a 1 reduction in any given time period to juvenile crime an after school program of any kind would probably not cost as much as one officer or special services juvenile detective but probably still reduce juvenile and adult crime between 2 and 95 depending upon the population of kids being helped richard and carol nash

towns grow transportation companies would need to expand into these new markets new services would be needed markets drycleaners department stores etc it has been demonstrated that inner city youth respond very well to strict military disciplineif this were combined to break the welfare chain we could alleviate much of the inner citys problems create a new infrastructure and give poor people a real stake in their own community edward mcfarlane of manhattan beach said i suggest income tax indexing where the rates which define wealthy are set proportionally to the cost of living in the area of the country i e perhaps 36 rate in arkansas could kick in at 100 000 income and here in south bay at 5300 000 income timothy woodward of redondo said if we re to be taxed use a national pay index to equalize pay scales 100 000 made in little rock is a very large figure compared to the same amount made in l a nor is a 300 000 house anywhere close to equal in size or quality in the geographic location many major companies who have employees in multiple states have sampler of national pay index to help with salary control and to allow for adjustment when transfers are requested these same indexes should be applied to the gross income to adjust incomes to take into account the cost of living for the different geographic and metropolitan areas william woodall of manhattan beach said i am

colleague chairman dan rostenkowski the retirement protection act of 1993 this bill is the administrations proposal to reform the pension benefit guanty corporation to strengthen and insure the pension benefit seurity for mlons of workers and retrs in underfunded defined benefit pension plane i applaud te adminisraion the secretaries of labor commerce and treasury and their stafts for their efforts to produce this product the congress has expressed growing concem over the perceived risk to the pbgc of several large unfund plane the administration on takin the reigns of government asked for time to review pension benefit security and the longterm stability of the pbgc to project the extent of its exposure and to recommend a thoughtful solution i needed the adrnlnistration has met its timetable and the bill reflects several months of hard work by the interagency task force the proposal provides for a number of reforms to increase pension fudn for certain underfunded plans attaining fl ft of nonforfeltable benefits within 15 years it is expected that these reforms will stabize the financal condition of the p6gc for the long rn the administration further projects that the pbgc deficit will be eliminated within 10 years the bill would also enhance the pbgc compliance tools so as to assure that employers remain responsible for their plans of particular importance to workers and retirsea is the requirement that participants in underfunded plans be given an annual pwnlanguage explanation of their plwne furding status as well as the emits on the pbgcs guarantes i include at the conclusion of my remarks a brief explanatory statement prepared by the pbgc that outlines the bills major provislons while i introduced this bill by requea i want my colleagues to know that i an committed to ensuring the longterm financlal soundness of this program when we passed the employee retirement income securty act of 1974 we promised our workers that their pensions would be secure and available upon retirement securing the financial soundness of the pbgc will reaffirm that promise we can do no less for our workers and retirses i wish as well to express my hope that as we approach this very cornplicated area of the law that we proceed with gre care to measure the effects that these funding requirements will have on particular sectors of our economy surely we do not want in the name of reform to destroy jobs or threaten the well being of whole industries we need to proceed with caution and with the help of the companies that have underfunded plans and we need always to remember our erisa promise to our workers and retirees prmnx t pr~sorwl act of9im as a whole the defined benefit pension system insured by the pension benefit guaranty corporation pboc is strong and wellfunded there is however persistent pension underfunding in some singleemployer plans underfunding in singleemployer vian grew from 327 billion in 19f7 to 38 billion in 1991 and is expected to grow much more for 1992 at the end of 1991 about s12 billion in underfunding was in plans sponsored by troubled companies the pbg0 is in no immediate danger and will be able to pay benefits well into the foreseeable future but there are substantial longterm risks to participants the pbgc and the retirement plan system which must be squarely addressed now given the current funding rules the level of underfunding in plans of troubled companies and the pbgcs 2 7 billion deficit in the singleemployer program are likely to increase in the coming years the legislation has four major areas of reform plan funding rules compliance premiums and participant services funding the bill strengthens the funding requirements for underfunded plans the deficit reduction contribution drc which was enacted in 1967 to increase funding of underfunded plans has not accomplished its goal the drc was flawed in several ways the legislation will correct these flaws by eliminating the double counting of gains that significantly weaken the drc under current law specifying interest and mortality assumptions and requiring ira approval of changes in other assumptions in certain underfunded plans and accelerating the drc funding schedule under the accelerated funding schedule new liability would be amortized at 30 per year if the plans funding ratio is 0d or less versus a 35 or les funding ratio under current law plans that are fully funded for current benefit promises would not be affected by these rules further for plan years beginning after 1994 the bill requires sponsors to begin funding immediately for negotiated benefit increases that will become effective in the future as an extra safeguard plans at risk of not being able to pay benefits in the short term are required to have on hand enough liquid assets to cover three years benefit payments the provision is designed to reduce the possibility that these plans will run out of money the bill includes a transition rule to ease the impact of the new funding requirements under the transition rule funding percentages would increase in a measured way by 2s percentage points per year for the first five years and slightly higher percentages in the next two years the bill also deals with three issues of concern to employers that want to fund their pension plans or that have wellfunded plane the bill repeals the quarterly contribution requirement for fully funded plans the bill eliminates the current 10 excise tax on certain nondeductible contributions for combined contributions to a companys defined benefit and defined contribution plans that exceed 25 of payroll it also eliminates the 10 excise tax on nondeductible contributions for plans with fewer than 100 participants that fully fund all benefit liabilities upon plan termination plans with more than 100 participants may deduct this contribution under current law deductibility rules would not change compliance certain corporate transactions such as break up of a controlled group threaten funding of pension plans and increase the risk that participants in an underfunded plan will lose benefits the only current remedy is for the pbgc to petition the court to terminate the plan before the transaction other remedies are needed because plan termination can have harsh effects on plan participants and their employers the bill would enable pbgo to seek judicial relief short of plan termination such as a court order requiring that departing controlled group members remain responsible for pension underfunding for a period of time or provide security for part of the pension liabilities controlled groups with over 50 million in their underfunded plans outstanding liens for missed contributions or outstanding funding waivers of more than 1 million would be required to give pb30 30 days advance notice of certain events other compliance changes would require sponsors with over 50 million in underfunding or outstanding liens or funding waivers to provide pbg with better actuarial and financial information grant ongoing plans a claim for pension underfunding against liquidating sponsors or controlled group members prohibit employers from increasing benefits in underfunded plans during bankruptcy proceedings and give pbgc concurrent authority with the department of labor to enforce minimum funding requirements when missed contributions exceed 31 million premiums the bill increases for plans that pose the greatest risk by phasing out the s53 per participant cap on the variable rate premium the premium cap will be phased out over three years starting with plan years beginning on or after july 1 199420 the first year 60 the second year and 100 the third year because of the cap plans with the greatest amount of underfunding pay no additional premiums for increased underfunding in fact plans at the cap account for 80 of all singleemployer plan underfunding but pay only about 25 of pbgcs total premium revenues the flat rate premium of 319 per participant paid by all plans is not changed participant protection in addition to protections provided by the enhanced funding and compliance the bill contains other important participant protections too often workers and retirees do not know the risks to their benefits posed by underfunding until after their pension plan has been terminated the bill requires employers to provide participants in underfunded plans a simplified understandable explanation of the plans underfunded status and the limits of pbgcs guarantee the pbgc will provide a model notice for use by employers the bill also contains provisions to protect participants who are missing when their fully funded plans terminate employers would be required to transfer adequate assets to pb0 to pay for missing participants pb0c would pay the benefit to the particlpant when the participant contacts pbg0 or is otherwise located other changes the bill specifies the interest rate and mortality assumptions that may be used to calculate a lump sum distribution provides rounding rules for certain tax code costofliving increases that affect benefit plans and eliminates ageweighted profitsharing plans and similar crosstested defined contribution plans effect of reforms the administration expects the reforms to eliminate pbg0s deftcit within 10 years and based on an initial analysis to improve funding of underfunded plans from the current average of 55 to 90 of all benefits and from an average of 60 to 100 of vested benefits within 15 years the legislative package is budget neutral"],

for a second on what is special about this debate on the bartontauzin amendment this debate today focuses not necessarily on whether or not one supports the concept of a balanced budget amendment i believe agreat majority of this house does this debate focuses on how we are going to achieve that balanced budget amendment this amendment the bartontauzin amendment is very much like the stenholm amendment the only difference in the balanced budget features of this amendment and the stenholm amendment is the year 2000 date for the accomplishment of the balanced budget goal but the major difference the thing we ought to be focusing on today is the feature of the bartontauzin amendment that provides for some restraint on tax increases as a vehicle for achieving balanced budgets now what restraint is in here the restraint that is in here is a simple provision that says in achieving the balanced budget that all of us or a great majority of us i think want to achieve that we ought to do it without raising taxes any higher than any greater than the income of americans is growing at the time we raise taxes in other words government should not grow faster than the pocketbooks of americans americans individually and american businesses it says in effect that we can raise taxes if we need to in short the amendment we debate today says that while the government of the united states may in fact have to raise taxes it ought not do it except with a supermajority any faster than the rate of growth of income in american pocketbooks and businesses in short it says balance the budget over the term allotted principally by reducing spending wherever you can if we were to poll americans across the width and breadth of this country today i think they would agree with that principle so we are debating an amendment today that really incorporates the stenholm balanced budget amendment with the addition that the balanced budget amendment ought to be achieved with as little as possible in tax increases and as much as possible in spending cuts if members agree with that principle they will want to vote for this version of the balanced budget amendment those who have said they are concerned about this version ought to be concerned because this is a real amendment if we really want to achieve a balanced budget for america we ought to be concerned that this amendment will do it and other amendments may not do it so if we have a concern about the effect of the unitedstates constitution commanding those of us representing this nation in this body to abide by responsible spending limits then we ought to be concerned abut this amendment it will require this congress and this nation to put our fiscal house order without unnecessarily raising taxes again on the american public people have asked us why should we do this at all let me give the members an illustration of the most important reason why i think it is important for congress to enact not only the balanced budget amendment but this version of it with a limitation on tax increases it is incumbent because we need to examine the reason the mandate is normally sent to washington in town meetings across my district folks ask why do you guys keep spending money over and above the income of this government why do you keep putting us in debt why do you keep crowding out money we could be using for useful purposes in america by paying all this interest on the debt conservatives and liberals make this same request why dont you put your house in order quit paying all this interest and spend the money we send you on projects that are good for america instead of paying interest on debt to countries all over the world who buy our tbills the answer is that most congressmen come to washington with a simple mandate the mandate is go to washington get as many of those federal dollars we send you backinto your district and spend them at home the truth is that we all carry out that mandate pretty doggone good the truth is that most of us end up bringing more money home than our folks have sent up here that is why we are out of balance we carry out the mandate pretty good i think what americans want to do in this balanced budget debate is to ask us to give them a chance in voting for a constitutional amendment that would send a new mandate to all of us who come up here and the mandate would be very simple do what you can about bringing projects home do what you can about carrying out the necessary spending in government but dont spend more money than we send you each year at some point stop this crazy borrowing trend that is crowding out the funds we need to carry on a progressive and good economy for our country in short i think the message americans have been sending us in town hall meetings in our mail and in messages to members of congress is that while we want you to do a good job in making sure that projects come home and federal programs are still carried out we also want you to carry out a new mandate and the mandate is dont spend more money than we have sent you and quit raising taxes on us in order to accomplish the purpose of a balanced budget amendment the bartontauzin amendment is the only one that carries out those two mandates of urging americans to live in this government within our means and second to stop raising taxes unnecessarily

this education the elimination of this pro time when you read the amendment that was put into the bill by the committee on rules you begin to understand why we have a process around here that scrubs down these bills and these amendments so that we do not bring things to the floor that are embarrassing this particular one has some real problem in it for example the gentleman from indiana had mentioned the increase in the age well you know if you are going to say that the increase in the age is because people up to age 30 are unemployed people up to age 65 are unemployed and we could in fact say that 60yearolds are teenagers for the purposes of this bill i am even more worried about some of the rest of the language in here without definition we say that what we are going to do is allow the stipends that are to be paid to be used for transportation does that mean that the money can be used to go out and buy an old car and it is fully justifiable it says it is going to be used for food the food is undefined so i went to the dictionary and found the word food and found out for instance that it includes things like beer wine grain alcohol vodka it could be used for any kinds of things that are perfectly definable under the dictionary that way and that would be under here grooming is the next thing and if you check in the dictionary what you find out is that one of the definitions for grooming is taking care of a pet having a pet washed and so on is this meant to have the taxpayers paying money so that people can go out and have their pets washed combed and so on at the local salon i mean it is not defined in the bill what does it mean then it goes on and says other basic necessities what are those other basic necessities i mean you could have a whole host of things that fall under that these stipends are going to be paid for totally undefined terms by people up to age 30 and we also have another provision here that says for example that youa re only allowed to work 20 hours a week but you have to be paid at least 100 so we have already defined now in the bill that it has to be at least 5 an hour that you are paying for the job so you axe paying 5 an hour for stlpends to people who are going to use the money for perhaps buying beer perhaps grooming their pets or perhaps for anything else under the sun"], [0.9824607893824577,

critically important information first as we used to say when i took debate in high school let us define terms a merber of congress recently had a town meeting and a lady held up her hand and said i am opposed to universal coverage the congressman said why she said because congressman we cant afford to take care of the people in the united states let alone everybody in the world let me assure everyone listening that the universal coverage that we are discussing this evening refers strictly to the united states of america and to make sure that every person and every family has the peace of mind knowing that they have health care insurance this debate has been going on for about 2 years it would be an interesting book for someone to write and to plot the course of it and how it has changed and to note the difference in approach between the two political parties in discussing universal care it is almost as if we are reading different sections of the bible or different sections of moral teaching some might say that the poor will always bewith us and democrats have gotten carried away with this universal health care in the belief that we can somehow give this peace of mind to every american some others might take a look at the same book and say wait a minute if i understood the sermon on the mount we do have a responsibility to everyone to make sure everybody and every brother and sister has that peace of mind in knowing that they have health insurance but it turns out as the gentlewoman from connecticut has pointed out what we are talking about here is not some moralistic debate as to how far our obligations go to our fellow man and woman but we are talking about dollars and cents and how to on the most costeffective basis change americas health care system for the better myself and many others believe that universal health care is central to health care reform not just because of some moral obligation because economically we believe it is essential i have felt this from the beginning now we have a study that has been referred to the lewin vhi study to the catholic health association that analyzed this concept and said what if you did only part of this what if you sat down congress and just tried to take those pieces of the system that appear the most outrageous and the most unfair and change those alone when it is all said and done are we better off as a nation or worse off and you hear the argument yourself i think from time to time some of our neighbors will say why do they want to change the whole thing whydo they not just take care of the problems and the problems they are referring to as have been noted this evening the fact that we are discriminated against if we have preexisting conditions if you have had a back surgery a heart problem diabetes cancer in your family a child born to your family that has a difficulty all of a sudden the insurance companies say we may not want you your employer says you have become a big risk for us that preexistingcondition exclusion worries every one of us each one of us is only an illness away from falling in that category and 81 million americans a third of our population are already there already being discriminated against so some of the folks who just want to do a little tinkering here and there say get rid of that preexistingcondition exclusion and you have done something good congress and you can go home what this study shows and shows clearly is that if you just do that and you do not address the underlying difficulty of getting every american insured you create more problems than you solve and that is the bottom line the bottom line here is if people can wait until they get sick to buy insurance enough healthy people will not be in the insurance pools to keep the premiums at a reasonable level what the gentlewoman from connecticut has said this evening in her special order and what has been said by the study is that if you take a look at really addressing health care reform really bringing down costs and helping working families who are going to bear the brunt of paying these health insurance premiums you have got to bring everybody in the tent you have got to make sure every american has the peace of mind and assurance of health care protection then you can address the reforms then you can spread the risk"], [0.9822480175644159,

already exist that forbid convicted felons from owning firearms laws also exist that govern when a gun may be used and how it may be carded the only true militarystyle assault weapons are fully automatic and have been stringently controlled since 1934 this legislation will have no effect on the sale or ownership of automatic firearms which fire multiple rounds with one pull of the trigger this legislation deals with the semiautomatic firearm which fires one shot with one pull of the trigger just like any other firearm there is no difference in the action of a semiautomatic hunting rifle and the action of a semiautomatic rifle that would be banned except for the outward appearance of military hardware such as a folding stock or bayonet lug with these items it is considered an assault weapon and without these items it is a sporting rifle the firearm will still use the same bullets fire at the same speed and hit the same target but those simple bosmetic changes are the difference between a legal and illegal weapon while gun control advocates label the assault weapon as the weapon of choice for criminals it is important to note that assault rifles were used in less than 1 percent of all homicides if we really want to help protect police officers we need to fight crimenot infringe upon the rights of lawabiding citizens"], [0.9818398170173168,

again as we do every year at this time we are here to commemorate a very sad historic occasion it has been 20 years since turkish troops first invaded the northern part of the mediterranean island nation of cyprus leaving a trail of death destruction and hundreds of thousands of refugees in the two decades since this shocking breach of international law turkey has maintained and solidified its occupation of more than onethird of the territory of cyprus with an estimated 35 000 troops turkey has continued this illegal occupation in complete defiance of the international community spuming u n resolutions and the entreaties of nato countries both here and in europe seeking a turkish withdrawal indeed far from bowing to the international pressure turkey has gone in the other direction having declared in 1983 the socalled turkish republic of northern cyprus recognized by no other country but turkey recently turkey has increased the size of its occupation forces by adding 8 000 additional troops and new tanks and armored vehicles a may 30 1994 report by u n secretary general boutros boutrosghali has termed cyprus one of the worlds most highly militarized areas in terms of the ratio between the numbers of troops and the civilian population perhaps the saddest aspect of this military occupation has been the growing mistrust and hostility between the greek and turkish communities on the island who had lived in harmony for so many years as fellow cypriots but who now are separated into what are in effect warring camps we commemorate this human tragedy with the pins attached to a piece of barbed wire that many supporters of a free and peaceful cyprus will wear at events tomorrow commemorating this tragic anniversary in addition to the barbed wire pins many people tomorrow will be wearing yellow ribbons to express their solidarity and sympathy for the 1 614 greek cypriots who have been missing in cyprus since the invasion among the missing are five united states citizens whose disappearances in turkishheld areas have never been accounted for and whose fate and whereabouts are still unknown these people were arrested by turkish forces some were transported to turkey and kept as prisoners in turkish jails since 1974 turkeycontrary to international law and human rights conventions refuses to provide any information about their fate the turkish government notwithstanding the recent change in leadership has not changed the policy of denying that there are any greek cypriots being held and still professes no knowledge about the whereabouts of the missing there is a great deal of evidence that casts doubt on the truthfulness of the turkish denials the international red cross and amnesty international have compiled lists of the missing persons compiled during visits to turkish detention centers in fact some of the evidence about missing persons being in turkish custody comes from the turkish news media we can be proud that this congress has supported foreign assistance to cyprus to encourage an alleviation of tensions every year we allocate 15 million in aid to cyprus for projects aimed at improving health education and the environmentfor the benefit of both cypriot communities the legitimate government of cyprus has also done a great deal to promote reconciliation between the two communities president clerides has proposed to the united nations a program for the demilitarization of the island to be monitored by a u n peacekeeping force so far his bold and courageous proposal has not been met by any constructive response from the turkish side i will continue along with many of my colleagues here today to insist that in exchange for the aid and military cooperation that we provide to turkey the turkish government move from a stance of recalcitrance and belligerence to a spirit of cooperation and confidence building with regard to cyprus it is my hope that we will not have to go on commemorating this anniversary year after year it is my hope that cyprus will be returned to the cypriot people and that this beautiful and historic land will once again be a place of peace"], [0.0010608434677124023,

noticed me and they recognized me for the officer program i worked hard in the officer program and they elected me to go to pilot training he is now a young pilot many of the young men and women that

you will use today i think when you cut the military you also cut the minority programs last week two of our democratic senators from the state of california stood up and said we dont want any of our bases to be closed it impacts our economy too much but those same two senators 3 days ago voted to cut 127 billion from the defense programs you cannot have it both ways what we need to take a look at i think is a balanced defense program that not only aids the military but defends this country and at the same time provides those programs for the inner city i want to remind the gentleman from the other side that the 29th of march is the anniversary of the los angeles riots if we really want to do something we need to come up and get some programs that affect those areas"]]}
