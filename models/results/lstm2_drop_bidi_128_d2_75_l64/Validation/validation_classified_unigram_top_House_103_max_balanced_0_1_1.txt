who have been planning to speak on the unfunded mandate portion of the evening this is it if they are out there and they want to come over we would love to have them this is a special order and it is an important special order it is important because it deals with the most pressing issue facing states and local governments today that is beginning the issue of unfunded mandates as many of us know today has been designated as national unfunded mandate day a day in which local officials across the country were to begin educating the public of the devastating consequences of unfunded federal mandates i was told by the unitedstates conference of mayors which was the primary sponsor of the national unfunded mandate day that over 1 000 local officials around the nation held events in which they singled out unfunded federal mandates as the biggest problem they face in these communities the message to the congress was clear stop approving legislation that imposes requirements on local governments without containing the resources necessary to carry out that mandate this august i and a number of members of congress have formed the congressional caucus on unfunded mandates in order to bring together members of congress who agree that this body must honestly address this issue since august we have 84 members of the congress who have joined the caucus on unfunded mandates as anybody who knows me can attest i am not a frequent participant in special orders however i feel that this issue is so important to our nation that it deserves the topic of discussion on the house floor in addition i feel that a special order devoted solely to unfunded federal mandates is appropriate activity for national unfunded mandate day i am proud to join with my colleagues and local government across this country to try to educate congress and the american people about unfunded mandates unfunded mandates is what we call in the business feel good legislation that is where we in congress get to feel good and pass the cost on to local governments we have got to put a stop to that there are a group of members of congress who have come together to try to find a bipartisan solution this is a bipartisan issue democrats and republicans have come together to try to come to a consensus about how we deal with the unfunded federal mandate issue and we do have limited time this evening i would like to share with my colleagues some profiles of cities that are being adversely affected by unfunded federal mandates for instance the city of phoenix az could provide substantially lower water and sewer rates to its citizens if they did not have to commit much of their local revenue to unfunded mandates in fresno ca the city estimated the costs of closing a landfill without federal mandates to be 10 to 12 million however because the landfill is included as a supedund site the cost of closing the facility will range from 35 to 60 million you should note that all of the costs will be borne by the citys solid waste rate payers in los angeles unfunded mandates will have a detrimental impact on the citys ability to provide essential swvices mayor richard riordan has told me that he could put many more cops on the streets if the city did not have to comply with so many unfunded federal mandates in philadelphia an environmental protection agency requirement that the city develop an advanced wastewater treatment system to inprove the oxygen levels for fish in the delaware water basin will cost philadelphia upwards of 500 million the mayor of philadelphia ed rendell has told me that he will not comply with this mandate because there is no way that he can justify this expenditure to the citizens of philadelphia merced ca located in my congressional district will incur 1 4 million in unfunded federal mandates in 199394 in order to balance this years budget merced had to cut over 30 staff positions remember merced only has a population of 53 000 people and it is suffering in the worst sort of way because of unfunded federal mandates in modesto ca also in my congressional district the city will spend 5 8 million on nine federal mandates over the next 6 years this money could be used to hire 150 police officers in stockton ca the san joaquin county district attorney was contemplating laying off onequarter of his prosecutors because of unfunded mandates however a temporary extension of the 1cent sales tax surcharge allowed the county to retain its prosecutors nevertheless if a permanent solution is not found the da will be forced to let these prosecutors go thus leaving the citizens of san joaquin county unprotected from crime in california the classic example of an unfunded federal mandate is immigration our immigration policy is solely the province of the federal government congress and the administration determine who may enter this country and to a great extent they determine where these immigrants reside however the state of california and its counties are responsible for the education health and welfare of these people for this year governor wilson has stated that providing social services to these people will cost the state at least 1 4 billion it should be clear to those listening to this debate that unfunded federal mandates are a problem what can we do in congress to mitigate the problems of unfunded federal mandates well we can prevent future unfunded federal mandates from being enacted since last year i have tried to offer floor amendments to any legislation considered by the house that contains unfunded mandates last congress the house considered the voting rights language assistance act of 1992 this legislation mandated that states and local jurisdictions containing large minorty populations print voting materials in the native language of those groups this mandate will no doubt increase the normal costs of running elections when the voting rights language assistance act of 1992 was considered on the house floor i offered an amendment that would have required the federal government to reimburse local governments for the increased costs due to this mandate unfortunately my amendment was defeated by two votes this congress i wanted to offer a similar amendment to the national voter registration act more commonly referred to as motorvoter it was estimated that motorvoter would cost my state of califomia 26 million a year the congressional budget office estimated the cost of compliance for all of the states to be 200 million unfortunately the rules committee did not allow my amendment to be offered and the congress went ahead and pushed another unfunded mandate onto the states last week i along with congressman goodling offered an amendment to the education goals 2000 that clarified that the bill would not become an unfunded mandate on states and school districts i am proud that our amendment was unanimously approved by the full house it is my full intention to continue offering these sorts of amendments to unfunded mandates that make their way to th house floor i would appreciate the assistance of my colleagues in this endeavor besides offering floor amendments i believe that this body needs to consider specific mandate relief legislation to that end i dave introduced h r 140 the federal mandate relief act of 1993 my bill is very simple it merely states that compliance with or implementation of an unfunded federal mandate is voluntary for states and localities until the federal govemiment provides the funding needed to pay for the mandated requirements the bill is not retroactive and would only apply to mandates which take effect on or after the date of enactment by requiring the federal government to put up the money before it can enforce any future mandates my bill accomplishes exactly what local governments are requesting that is why h r 140 has been endorsed by the unitedstates conference of mayors the national association of counties the national league of cites the national association of towns and townships the national conference of state legislatures the council of state governments and the national taxpayers union currently h r 140 enjoys the

international financial system and the lack of a coordinated international approach to dealing with issues that affect the worlds financial system new communications technology the growth of exotic financial instruments the increasing number of global corporations expanding trade and a worldwide recognition of the benefits of free markets have resulted in a rapidly expanding and increasingly integrated world financial system but on the flip side of unprecedented opportunity is unprecedented risk and the responsibility of governments is to keep risk within acceptable limits while the volume of transactions occurring in the international financial system is growing exponentially regulatory bodies in developed and developing nations alike strapped by spending limitations have struggled to keep pace with all this innovation in addition while ongoing efforts to coordinate international financial policies exist these initiatives are tentative fragmented exclusive and they are insufficient to deal with the potential systemic risks facing the world financial system a recent congressional research service report supports my position capital markets around the globe have become so interdependent that there is a possible series of disruptive events which has the formidable potential of rapid transmittal placing and entire financial structure at risk of severe distribution or even failure authorities recognize this interdependence but in spite of the perceived danger of systemic risk central banks and other regulators have been slow to move preventative measures beyond the talking stage the primary reason i am introducing this legislation is to ensure that the united states takes a leadership role in promoting sound international financial regulation and supervision of financial services it is long past time that this topic was elevated to the highest levels of government it is imperative that all the nations that reap the benefits of

substantially and create good jobs balance is the key and while i respect the credible bills my republican colleagues have put forward we need the job creation tools provided in the presidents plan this legislation does two vital things it provides real deficit reduction and spending cuts before any revenue increases many feared that the congress would not find the courage to make the spending reductions that president clinton proposed this is a proud day for the congress because not only do we meet the presidents goals we exceed them by 63 billion and we provide real job creation this is

will have moved one step closer to having a crime bill which in this congressmans opinion will help make our communities our hones and our families safer from crime it is their efforts that have brought us to this point it is their frustration and fear that have guided this process we must never forget that the american people wanted this bill and today they will get it what we can do at the federal government to reduce crime in this country is still subject to much debate we have a nation where states carry much of the burden and most of the responsibility in fighting crime in the streets the american people must understand precisely what this congress and this president can accomplish by passing a crime bill the benefits are far too significant to be dismissed the consequences too devastating if we fail will 100 000 more cops help only time will tell but it certainly wont hurt will death penalty for drug kingpins stop the drug problem in this country not entirely but it will send the message that this country will no longer tolerate such activities will building more prisons put every single person who has committed a crime in jail and keep them there probably not but it will ensure that we have more space to keep those individuals who deserve to be in prisonin prison rather than letting them go as we do now will money allocated for prevention programs be well

the member of congress representing the area with the most cases of lyme disease in the country i am delighted that the house is considering legislation that will designate the weeks of june 6 1993 and june 5 1994 as lyme disease awareness week the senate approved identical legislation introduced by senator joseph lieberman of connecticut on march 26 1993 i appreciate this opportunity to provide my colleagues with some background on this disease and why the designation of this week is so important lyme disease is a bacterial infection that is spread by the deer tick which is slightly smaller than the dog tick although lyme disease was first officially reported lust 18 years ago in lyme connecticut it has fast become the most common tickbome disease and one of the fastest spreading infectious diseases in the united states once considered to be a regional problem found in the northeast 49 of the 50 states have now reported cases of lyme disease the deer tick lives in grasses along the shore in fields and at the edge of woodlands many people on eastern long island have expressed concern about going to the beach taking a walk in the woods or sitting in their own backyard for fear of getting this debilitating disease many people never even know that they have been bitten by a tick the parasite can attach itself feed detach itself and lay its eggs all without the hosts knowledge in addition due to its ability to mimic the symptoms of other ailments a person may be left clueless as to the cause of his or her ailment lyme disease is often mistaken for other illnesses such as ringworm influenza arthritis or heart disease however if left untreated lyme disease can cause partial facial paralysis meningitis encephalitis and abnormal slowing of the heartbeat severe headaches and depression destructive arthritis memory loss and chronic fatigue as early treatment of lyme disease is the key to warding off its worst effects and as there is currently no vaccine for lyme disease the best defense against it is prevention that is why education is vital if we are to minimize the effects of this painful disease the american public must know what to look for if they are to take precaution against this disease symptoms of lyme disease in its eariy stages include a characteristic rash at the site of the tick bite headaches fever pains in joints and swollen glands however a person might not develop the telltale rash at the site of the tickbite leaving the person puzzled as to the cause of such a rash moreover standard blood tests often do not reveal the presence of lyme disease the key words in combating lyme disease are protect and check protect meaning to protect yourself by wearing protective clothing and repellents and check meaning check yourself your children and your pets as soon as you get home checking is important because most experts believe the tick must be attached for more than 24 hours to transmit the disease in addition i am pleased to announce that a permethrlnbased repellent which has been approved by the environmental protection agency epa is now available to the public this spray must be used only on clothing not on the skin the spray used in combination with a longacting deetbased lotion on the skin can provide very effective protection against the tick and lyme disease mr speaker the prevention of lyme disease depends upon public awareness i want to thank my colleagues for their support in bringing this disease to the attention of the american public it is my hope that the designation of the weeks of june 6 1993 and june 5 1994 as lyre disease awareness week will help to make the general public and health care professionals more knowledgeable about lyme disease and it symptoms"],

cleanup if we want to avoid revisiting the problem although i fully support passage of the legislation before us today i believe that its approach to the saif is seriously flawed and must be corrected in conference without a correction this legislation will not be the final chapter in the story of the cleanup but the prologue to the next crisis since enactment of firrea in 1989 strong and solvent thrifts have frontloaded a great deal of cash that has been required to resolve failed institutions they have taken this money from a diversion of all premiums since 1989 additional surcharges on the insurance premiums transfer of the 3 billion surpluses of the industryowned federal home loan bank system and an additional 300 million in mandatory annual contributions from the system through 2029 further until 2019 saif institutions must shoulder an 800 million annual obligation to fund fico bond indebtedness had saif received saif member premiums since 1989 it now would have over 6 billion instead of the approximately 800 million with which it will begin operation firrea anticipated such a problem and authorized the appropriation of money to cover postrtc losses as well as help recapitalize the fund on a sound basis firrea recognized that healthy surviving institutions simply could not afford to pay for the sins of the past while simultaneously handling new problems building up the fund to a prudent level and raising the industrys own net worth to firreamandated levels overwhelming these institutions with the crushing financial burden of such high insurance premiums would not just be unfair but counterproductive perpetuating the s l crisis and leading to additional failures unfortunately this bill turns its back on a realistic and sensible course charted for saif in firrea the bill establishes what strikes me as an impenetrable roadblock to timely use of any saif loss funds the bill states that the 1989 federal commitment to appropriated funds can only be used if the industry is in such bad shape that raising premiums would cause failures in other words the bill tells the financial regulatory agencies to raise the industrys premiums to the point where it will almost but not quite drive institutions into insolvency only then can these appropriated funds be spent until such time as the fdic can make the requisite deathbed certification to cove losses once its own very limited resources are depleted saif will have to borrow funds from the federal deposit insurance improvement act of 199ts line of credit this requirement will force thrift insurance premiums to a point higher than what banks pay banks currently pay an average of 24 basis points for insurance while thrifts pay an average of 25 basis points this premium differential will widen even more dramatically in 1998 when banks are expected to recapitalize the bank insurance fund after 1998 banks premiums could fall to 8 or 10 basis points according to most analysts from a competitive standpoint a large and enduring premium differential would be a suffocating handicap for the thrift industry the market for financial services is quite competitive in the united states in this environment saif institutions would be unable to pass their higher insurance costs along to their customers inevitably their ability to price deposit accounts and other products competitively would be impaired depositors would seek higher yields elsewhere shrinking the industrys deposit base and putting additional upward pressure on premiums earnings would decline impairing the ability to build capital internally outside capital of course would shun an industry suffering from such a congressionally imposed cost disadvantage ironically firrea recognized that assuring a strong capital base for depository institutions is the best protection for the fdics insurance funds personally i very much want to put the thrift crisis behindus and enjoy the benefits of a strengthened more stable financial system enactment of appropriate rtcisaif funding legislation is central to achieving that goal but adjusting the saif funding mechanism in conference is of vital importanoe if we want the

mentioned the increase in the age well you know if you are going to say that the increase in the age is because people up to age 30 are unemployed people up to age 65 are unemployed and we could in fact say that 60yearolds are teenagers for the purposes of this bill i am even more worried about some of the rest of the language in here without definition we say that what we are going to do is allow the stipends that are to be paid to be used for transportation does that mean that the money can be used to go out and buy an old car and it is fully justifiable it says it is going to be used for food the food is undefined so i went to the dictionary and found the word food and found out for instance that it includes things like beer wine grain alcohol vodka it could be used for any kinds of things that are perfectly definable under the dictionary that way and that would be under here grooming is the next thing and if you check in the dictionary what you find out is that one of the definitions for grooming is taking care of a pet having a pet washed and so on is this meant to have the taxpayers paying money so that people can go out and have their pets washed combed and so on at the local salon i mean it is not defined in the bill what does it mean then it goes on and says other basic necessities what are those other basic necessities i mean you could have a whole host of things that fall under that these stipends are going to be paid for totally undefined terms by people up to age 30 and we also have another provision here that says for example that youa re only allowed to work 20 hours a week but you have to be paid at least 100 so we have already defined now in the bill that it has to be at least 5 an hour that you are paying for the job so you axe paying 5

becomes particularly poignant to think of the murder of james chaney and andrew goodman and michael schwerner because we were all about the same age 30 years ago we all had the same kind of motivation as i look at my colleagues who were leaders then and are leaders now i wonder if people of the dedication of those three who were and let us remember they were murdered they were murdered with the participation of law enforcement officials of the state of mississippi they were murdered brutally with the federal government standing idly by at the time the question naturally arises what further contribution would these three people have made it is very important to contrast where we were in 1964 and where we are today we have a long way to go in making our constitutional principles realities for everyone but we have accomplished very significant progress the fact for instance that we stand on this floor today with a colleague from mississippi mr bennie thompson who will be joining us and others indicates that we are capable of significant improvement in 1964 as the gentleman from georgia has pointed out the vast majority of africanamericans in mississippi might as well have lived in south africa for all the rights that they had as individuals there was a degree of deprivation of individual rights within the united states 30 yearsago that was unimaginable to people outside i saw that because i went to mississippi from massachusetts and it was while i thought of myself as wellread and wellinformed as extraordinary revelation to understand how little black people in that state could enjoy the rights that i had taken for granted all my life we continue to make that fight it is important both that we remember that progress has been made and that we remember that a good deal of progress has yet to be made in particular i was pleased that my colleagues who spoke before me noted that by accident it could have been a different combination but chaney schwerner and goodman happened to be one black and two jewish americans there was any conceivable combination that you could have put together out of that but that is important because we are at a time now when there are people who would try to inflame relations in this country even as we move to diminish the prejudices that have plagued us there are people who would like to fan new ones who would like to expand old ones i was very proud to be in mississippi in 1964 and i felt i was there as an american fighting hard for the principles of our constitution i also felt being jewish that i was fulfilling an important part of the tradition i had been born into and cherish the jewish tradition both as a matter of selfinterest because a society in which minorities are mistreated is one in which jews will not do well and as a matter of commitment to broader principles that both as an american and as a jew i had been brought up to treasure and i am very pleased to join again today with my colleague from georgia and others to reaffirm all aspects of that to reaffirm first of all our solemn duty as americans to make the constitution real for everybody to make that glorious statement of principle a glorious reality we are coming closer and closer but we cannot slack off and i also want to have the chance to celebrate the working together of the africanamerican and jewish communities as part of the broader american community as we work with others stressing those things which we have in common with each other as well as those things which all of us as americans have a commitment to thirty years has seen a lot of progress we have a ways to go it is important for us on occasibns such as this to rededicate ourselves to making that progress this is a nation which is capable of even more greatness than we have achieved this is a nation capable of genuinely fulfilling the promise we have made and have been carrying forward we in particular in this body are especially lucky because we have been given a particular opportunity to carry that out being able to serve in the democratically elected legislative body of the greatest representative government that has ever been known in the
