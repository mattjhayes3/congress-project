discussion in my view this bill can and should be adopted with dispatch and without deep division not that it is perfectit is not we have not been able to do everything that i think our security demands and our worldwide commitments require but the important thing is that we have tried to write a responsible consensus bill and i think we succeeded as evidence of thisi cant think of another subcommittee or committee in the congress that features the diversity of opinion and views that we have on the defense subcommittee believe me there is always wide ranging discussion when we mark up however after many hours and days of effort we bring before you a bill which enjoys the unanimous support of the subcommittee and which was agreed to without controversy by the full appropriations committee ume 21 1988 this is a consensus product which as the chairman indicated reflects both the position of the house and more importantly an effort to get the most defense out of every defense dollar this is the result of a great deal of work and cooperation by all members of the defense subcommittee on both sides of the aisle and i want to commend all the members also we have been fortunate to have the services of our tremendous committee staff and i want to acknowledge their efforts and support to me and the members on this side i would like to express my gratitude to the chairman of our subcommittee the distinguished gentleman from florida bill chappell for his evenhandness and his leadership throughout our deliberations hes done an excellent job as we all are aware last years budget summit set this years funding level for defense i can assure the membership that this bill complies with the summit agreement we track the budget resolution and we are about as close to our 302 b allocation as one could imagine 1 million under for both budget authority and outlays it has been easier in some ways to write this bill because of the summitfrom the first day of hearings we knew how much money we would have to work with and this helped expedite the process despite this relative certainty however writing this bill has not been an uncomplicated task by any means i am compelled to remind all members that even though we comply with the summit this is the fourth straight year that defense appropriations will decline in real terms in this bill we provide roughly 10 percent less after inflation than we did in 1985 and for this fiscal year alone to comply with the summit the department of defense had to cut its planned budget by nearly 33 billion a 10percent reduction this forced the administration to confront many difficult tradeoffs i think all members will concede that under frank carlucci the department not only considered these tradeoffs but stepped up and made some hard choices as a result the budget we were sent in february had a number of stark recommendations an active duty troop reduction of 27 000 the drawdown of 16 navy frigates over 600 army helicopters and two air force fighter wings from existing force structure and the cancellation of over a dozen weapons programs secretary carlucci has been up front about how he regards these proposalsmaking it clear that these cuts were proposed only because of fiscal constraintsnot because of any change in commitments or security needs but cuts had to be made and they were what the dod did do was forward a budget organized around three principlesin the words of secretary carlucci these are people readiness and efficient acquisition i think it is safe to the congress in general has agreed with these priorities and our subcommittee has worked hard to produce a bill that funds this approach for example if the 1970s taught us anything about defense priorities it is that good people and combat readiness can be lost faster than anything else and take the most effort and money to restore the pentagon appears to have recognized this in its request the only areas that show significant growth over last year are indeed the personnel and readiness accounts our subcommittee supports this emphasis and in fact in both the military personnel and operations and maintenance accounts we have not only fully funded but have recommended increases over the administrations request military personnel accounts receive an increase of 2 25 billion over last year including a 4percent military pay raise and increases in housing allowances in operations and maintenance we recommend an overall increase of 5 4 billion from last year nearly 7 percent growth this includes a civilian pay raise of 2 percent within this area we have protected the repair and maintenance activities carried out in army depots navy ship repair facilities and air force logistics centers we have not neglected quality of life issues either for example we have added 229 million over the budget to improve military medical care and staffing levels people and readinessthese are part of the real success stories of the 1980s in defense and i believe we have done a lot in this bill to ensure we dont squander the aprovements made since the late 1970s this bill a7so follows through on the departments third priority trying to make more efficient and productive choices in procurement of equipment we have made every effort to avoid costly production stretchouts and where it made sense and where we could find the funds we have increased procurement rates and looked to multiyear contracting i can point to examples of this in nearly every procurement account look at the armywe have increased funding and approved multiyear procurement of its two premier weapons systemsthe m1 tank and the apache attack helicopter these sorts of recommendations are throughout the bill in keeping with our emphasis on readiness we have protected and in some cases added funds over the request for some of the less glamorous procurement programs such as ammunition for the army and marine corps airtoair missiles for the navy i could go on and on there are a lot of success stories and good things in the bill and report before you i cant be honest and say i am comfortable or satisfied with everything we have recommended but on balance i believe we have put together a credible measure recognizing that we dont have the money to do everything it hasnt been easy we have had the same frustration and problems as all members and committees have faced in trying to address valid national needs in the face of fiscal constraints and while this bill certainly has more than its share of hard choices they are only the first steps of what promises to be a very difficult and prolonged process over the next few years for those who are upset with some of this years decisionsbe it a weapons cancellation or manpower cuts affecting an installation some where in the countrylet me tell you it is going to get tougher the pentagon realizes it has to take into account the overall deficit problem and it is perhaps belatedly coming to grips with decisions which must be considered in the face of limited resources i dont know which direction this will take usbe it more manpower cuts program terminations shifts in force structurebut i can only hope we all agree that the congress has to work with the defense department to try and fashion a steady and predictable effort stability is the surest way to save money in defense and if we want to make informed sensible decisions to save money then we have to be prepared to eliminate the rollercoaster up and down defense spending syndrome as we look forward to the next administration this bill provides a sound basis for beginning this process it deserves and i ask for and overwhelming vote of support from the house"],

the reason i raise this to my colleagues and to those that are here in this chamber is not because i am interested in selling tickets or commercialize a movie that obviously highlights my state but mainly to urge as many of my colleagues and as many around the country to recognize the spirit behind this movie the milagro beanfield war on many occasions i am sure representatives from new mexico have the battle with the rest of the country and the rest of the congress to demonstrate that new mexico is in fact a state we sometimes have many different jokes on us that we need a passport to come into our state our name identification is not that strong but those that know new mexico know it to be a land of beauty and know the strength of its people and the land the reason i raise this is because the milagro beanfield war for those colleagues of mine that are constantly kidding us about changing legislation so that northern new mexico when it comes to small farmer issues irrigation ditches or water issues water disputes that they too recognize the importance that northern new mexico and its residents place on their land and their culture and their water the milagro beanfield war is directed by robert redford it has many stars in it that have done an excellent job of portraying life in northern new mexico the film is about this classic struggle a struggle that occurs a lot in the west between those that want to preserve their land and the heritage and those that want to build and develop and bring additional changes in lifestyle to many communities the film is about the struggle of a farmer joe mondragon who is basically trying to keep his way of life intact a huge developer is trying to build a golf course in a small rural village milagro nm but really truchas nm the film talks about how there is a fight to keep the developers out and how this joe mondragon plants a bean field irrigated with water which in essence signals the determination of the townspeople to keep the developers out or at least to have a voice in the decision the film shows the strong family traditions of northern new mexico it shows the beauty of the land it shows the importance of water of preserving a way of life that for many may not be the most modern the most plush but a way of life where culture is preserved where tradition is preserved john nichols wrote the milagro beanfield war in 1972 what we have then is a celebration of spirit of a mtate that for many years perhaps on the scale of being per capita is one of the poorest of the country and is a state that has a tremendous strength in its people the potential for human involvement and development is evident you will see men and women from northern new mexico that have pride in their work pride in their traditions so i raise this with my colleagues not once again to urge that everyone attend the premier of this film or see it on the movie screens around the country but if they should choose to see it to recognize that it is a celebration of spirit a celebration of the land of culture of the american dream of northern new mexicans that came to this country 300 years ago descendents from spain and are determined to preserve the rural lifestyle i want my colleagues to know that the preservation of culture is so important in my state that sante fe nm is the only capital in this country that does not allow an airport you cannot fly in there unless you have a small plane that is because there is a strength in wanting to preserve what we have so in raising this issue with my colleagues i just want them to recognize that when they hear a representative from new mexico asking for certain things for their district for their state that you try to see this movie and see how important it is that we deal with these problems that are mostly of preservation and strengthening of family of religion of culture but most importantly of land and a way of life i include at the end of my remarks newspaper articles as follows the milaaro beamruild war by dan ouerrero john nichols wrote the milagro beanfield war in 1972 it took just five weeks to create the story of joe mondragon a chicano handyman in the tiny fictitious town of milagro new mexico who starts a political revolution by illegally irrigating his parched beanfield with water earmarked for a housing development the novel was published in 1974 toin the authors words a resounding clunk miracles however do happen fifteen years after joe first came to life on paper he leaps to the big screen in a 10 millionplus feature from universal pictures starring ruben blades and sonia braga and directed by robert redford in his first directing chore since the 1980 oscarwinning ordinary people scheduled for release this month in english spanishdubbed and spanish subtitled versions milagro is universals heavyweight entry in hollywoods push to top the growing hispanic market with films that have crossover appeal the feisty mondrag6ns journey to the screen is a story as complex and colorful as nichols original creation the reallife account features a muchhonored chicano filmmaker a movie starturneddirector dropped options grabbed options big studios big bucks casting controversies lawsuits angry townspeople and an angrier mother nature as mondragon himself might say ay chihuahua los angeles producer moctesuma esparza the ballad of gregorio coriez was among the books early fans the filmmaker and chicano activist recalls that when he read the novel i fell in love with it it was one of the few experiences where i read something that presented social and political issues simultaneously 1 would fall off my chair laughing at its tremendous humor esparzaa man with a 1973 emmy award for the documentary cinco vidas and an oscar nomination for the 1977 documentary short aqueda martlinezwas not the only filmmaker to admire milagro and its colorful cast of characters other producers acquired temporary rights to the novel but in 1978 esparza met with author nichols in new mexico to discuss rights to the book should they become available during the meeting esparza discovered we had a mutual empathy in terms of our histories and our visions he acquired the rights in december of 1979 on the very day the other producers dropped their option however another reader of milagro thought the story of interwoven social cultural and political issues would make a stunning movie blond allamerican screen star robert redford represented mainstream funding and clout when he phoned esparza shortly after the latino had won the rights redford was in postproduction with ordinary people his directorial debut when he learned esparza has beaten him to milagro by only days it has been widely reported that redford intended to buy the option outright and produce the film himself not true esparza says to redfords credit he never proposed i sell the rights he never sought to buy me out we discussed the film he interviewed me and i interviewed him when redford told me he wanted to direct the piece not act in it i said bob i admire your work as an actor and as a producer but i dont know who you are as a director i was not inclined to give him the project just because he said he wanted to direct it redford however persuaded esparza to see a rough cut of ordinary people i was blown over speechless recalls esparza the next day i went over and said bob what do you want the cornerstone for the bicultural project had been set the chicano producer and the mainstream movie star would coproduce with redford directing the venture the arduous task of transferring the 630page book to a 120page screenplay began much of the films early work was done by the producing duo at redfords sundance institute beginning in 1980 high in the mountains outside provo utah the institute is dedicated to the development of american film with a special eye to unitedstates cultures according to redford the institute is a way of putting back into an industry that has been good to me more importantly its an opportunity for stories to be told by groups in this country that have historical roots the milogro story did not come easy it wasnt until 1985 that david s ward came up with a workable script after several failed attempts by other writers including author nichols ward had penned redfords 1973 hit the sting and had a long association with the actor the rest of the creative staff began to assemble with many who were like ward part of redfords professional family that included longtime partners gary hendler and andy meyer brought on as executive producers this triggered talk within hollywoods latino community that the longawaited chicano project was fast becoming a redford project with little participation from hispanics esparza responded that he never envisioned the film as an allchicano production but as a bridge between latino filmmakers and the hollywood mainstream he pointed out that production designer joe aubel construction coordinator bill maldonado and production manager david wisnlevitz are all latinos fanning that controversy were the protracted casting process and the final choice of a marginal latino in a leading role we had open calls esparza says of the yearlong auditions open calls allow anyone to walk in and be seen for a film i must have seen 2 000 people in los angeles and redford must have seen several hundred in new york esparza insists that the use of names in leading roles for boxoffice appeal was unimportant in casting the 53 available roles in fact ruben blades went to an open casting call in new york and i was predisposed against him when i first heard about it a salsa singer but when i saw the audition tape i agreed with redford blades was wonderful the actors ultimately cast reflect the broad spectrum of the latino acting communitypanamas ruben blades brazils sonia braga mexicos great comic actor carlos riquelme in his englishlanguage film debut mexican americans freddy fender trinidad silva and mike o6mez and the very mixed julie carmen as mondrag6ns hottempered wife my ethnic background makes for a long list carmen states flatly at the very center of the casting storm was chick vennera in the pivotal role of joe mondrag6n my family came from italy via south america he says they settled in argentina and brazil to some critics that was not hispanic enough vennera disagrees this is a latino film so it should be a mix a real mix i dont th nk theres any controversy within the community if there is im surprised to hear it and there were chicano actors mike o6mez zoot suit heartbreak ridge who plays an auto shop worker in the film admits that there was obviously discussion in actors circles about it my understanding is that venneras got spanish in his background the casting decision was redfords and his alone he went with the man he felt fit the role julie carmen has stronger words theres been all kinds of jealous remarks in the press about well theres a panamanian a brazilian and a cuban thats not the point we are actors playing out this tiny sociological thing that has a bunch of funny colorful characters the people of milagro are direct descendants of the spaniards who settled in new mexico in the small towns between santa fe and truchas some of their culture and accents and family names go directly back to spain and them mix with the indians they are a different group than the ones who went to mexico and then came to the states likewhat we call in l a the chicanos so historically everything is unique even the way the people speak vennera calls milagro a people film its about the way people are trying to keep a certain way of life the way we all are throughout the country with the pollution problems and land development problems and the disregard for the environment you see these people these farmers fighting together they had a cause and they rose and went for it the setting for the film was as important as the cast which includes james gammon melanie griffith daniel stern and christopher walken in the major nonlatino roles there was never a question that the cameras would roll on the books original new mexico locations but again controversy tiny picturesque clhlmayo 20 miles north of santa fe with a town square dating to the 1730s was redfords first choice the townspeople however were strongly divided between those eager for big bucks and excitement and those anxious to retain their tranquil way of life lengthy negotiations delayed the start of production finally the film company pulled out building its own historic town square in nearby truchas principal photography began at long last on august 6 1986 without a finished script the shoot was to end in late october but record rainfall and snowstorms caused costly delays and stretched the shoot until late december just how costly is still no ones favorite subject esparza will only say that the film went modestly over budget and still within the realm of standard typical hollywood films this particular hollywood film however returned to its location nearly a year after the original shoot and after months in the editing room following rumors that the film was in trouble redforda reputed perfectionistreturned his crew to new mexico last october a month short of the films original release date actor mike 06mez found redford open to any suggestions we had about anything hispanic i felt he was very open toward our culture he was familiar with it and appreciated it very much it seemed a natural thing for him redford it should be noted grew up in a mexican american neighborhood in the sawtelle section of santa monica california those close to the production report thatwhile his spanish might not rival ricardo montalbanshis longtime affection for the culture colors every frame of the film even as controversies waned and mother nature regained her composure another storm commenced in the form of a federal lawsuit brought by one reies lopez tijerna the former new mexico resident filed the suit in los angeles claiming his story belonged to producer robert cano and that nichols based his book on that story lez tijerina spent 30 months in prison for the attempted 1966 takeover of governmentowned land he said belonged to the descendants of 16thcentury spanish settlers nichols has said the genesis of his book dates to his days with the new mexico review when he wrote investigative articles about land and water problems later he says he incorporated all he learned in the milagro beanfield war there is no relationship between lpez tijerinas life story and this book none esparza says of the lawsuit milagro will be closely watched big studios anticipate big profits in the hispanic market especially after the success of la bamba and born in east l a right now there is a parade of hispanictheme projects in varying stages of production edward james olmos stars in stand and deliver fui buth theatrical and tv release moon over parador will star ratfl julia and sonia braga the penitent teams julia with julie carmen jane fonda is busy filming mexican novelist carlos fuentes the old gringo television meanwhile is offering the situation comedy trial and error with eddie velex and paul rodriguez its rare to have so may latino projects at the same time smiles g~mez producers realize we have a lot of money as a community we spend a lot and are loyal consumers its the same thing with television programs carmen expresses some concern with the trend milagro is a whole new level of looking at the hispanic in a much less exploitstive way what frightens me is that if too much political heat comes at redford because of this film well be cutting our own throats remember what happened with the black exploitation genre after shaft there were a lot of black exploitation films and there was a lot of heat over how blacks were being represented in cinema if people begin jumping up and complaining this detail or that detail isnt perfect and if redford gets a lot of flak the studios may feel the hispanic culture has become untouchable that could really damage us the film she predicts is going to be bounced around like a political pingpong ball with jealousy and accusations however she has seen 99 9 percent support and love for the project from everyone involved with the film to carmen and the rest of hollywoods hispanic community the artistic and financial success of a true crossethnic film is a mtilagro long overdue history sets chicano paoducers path by dan guerrero los angelesborn moctesuma espara has a clear picture of what heexpects from the milagro beanfield war and from himself to be a professional producer in hollywood and to develop those projects that motivate and inspire me its a path familiar to esparza who produced bilingual films for tvs sesame street while still a graduate student at the university of california in los angeles his masters thesis cineo vidasa 1973 documentary about people living in the barrios of east los angelesearned him an emmy award later esparza produced the pbs childrens series villa alegre and won the john f kennedy journalism award for a series of documentaries for the mcgrawhill series la raze his first feature only once in a lifetime was made in 1977 a documentary portrait of an old woman in northern new mexico aqueda martinez brought him an oscar nomination that same year through many of those years especially during the chicano movement of the late 1960s the politically aware esparza was involved in antiwar and civil rights activities many of us made a great many sacrifices 20 years ago he says we were arrested and went to jail often i was indicted twice by a grand jury for organizing strikes the ballad of gregorio cortez with edward james olmos in 1982 was esparzas big screen break the milagro beanfield war may confirm his place in mainstream moviemaking milagro is part of a series of films i was developing with the national council of la raza esparza explains ballad was the first in the series developed in cosponsorship with the national council via a grant from the endowment for the humanities several other projects were picked at that time important in presenting to a mass au dience our historical contribution to this country in a new light we present ourselves as part of the american fabric not as inmigrantswhich of course we arebut as a part of the population that has founded and developed this country after all the united states came to us in the southwest as hispanics we had been part of the southwest long before the united states existed with longtime partner robert katz esparza has formed a new production company that will not necessarily focus on hispanic projects their east los angelesbased saints and sinners productions is currently developing a documentary about the chicano movement of 20 years ago a subject close to esparza it will look at why 10 000 students walked out of east l a high schools and how there has been relatively no change since in the education system the dropout rate is worse today esparza is also working on a film on tomas rivera the late chancellor of the university of california at riverside i will continue to work in educationoriented documentaries says the producer but this is not the main thrust of my career right now i think the myth that latino or chicano themes cant be successes has already been exploded by la bamba and im very happy we are following in its footsteps what im hoping for is to further cement our reality as part of the american cultural landscape"], [0.000573575496673584, 0.5005735754966736, 0, "pardon me garden grove that is why i said it correctly i was

year will update certain provisions of the public buildings act of 1959including increasing for the first time in 10 years the prospectus threshold for leasing construction and repair and alteration

compliance with nationally recognized model building codes and consideration of other local requirements local officials would be consulted during the planning process and allowed to make
