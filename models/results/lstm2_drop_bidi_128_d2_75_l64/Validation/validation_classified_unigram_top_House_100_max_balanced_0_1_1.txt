chairwoman of the maryland commission on physical fitness this year the state of maryland marks the 25th anniversary of the creation of the maryland commission on physical fitness in addition this is the eighth year in which congresswoman byron has served as the chairwoman of the commission i am grateful that my friend bev byron has given me an opportunity to speak today on behalf of my constituents the citizens of prince georges county i want to extend to you our congratulations and our best wishes on the commissions anniversary maryland i am quite pleased to note was the first state to establish a state commission to address the physical fitness and physical wellbeing of its residents the creation of the maryland commission was a direct outgrowth of president john f kennedys interest in fully implementing the goals of the presidents council on physical fitness and sports an organization established by president dwight d eisenhower in 1956 the basic goals of the commission in the early 1960s and its goals today in the late 1980s remain similar to work with the maryland state department of education to promote physical fitness for all schoolchildren in addition the commission has been active in encouraging adult physical fitness programs including programs that are focused directly on teenagers young adults the middle aged senior citizens and the handicapped much has been accomplished but much more remains to be done american athletes continue to receive an impressive number of gold silver and bronze awards at international sporting events but the health and physical fitness of the average american is of continuing concern to us all most americans even after years of public service announcements of physicians warnings of appalling rates of heart disease and other infirmities of disconcerting medical warnings still continue to smoke to eat too much to drink too much and unfortunately to exercise too little to its credit the maryland commission on physical fitness has taken the lead in arguing that good health vitality and fitness are things for which we all should work throughout our lives good health and physical fitness are just as important for preschoolers as for senior citizens for the young as for the old through the efforts of the maryland commission on physical fitness was well as the endeavors of other state commissions physical fitness is no longer viewed as a passing trend or something only for the young physical fitness should not be viewed as a fad or as a passing fancy physical fitness is much more than the purchase of expensive running shoes or the joining of exclusive exercise clubs much as the ancient greeks and romans we should always view a fit physique as just as important as an educated mind juvenal the roman poet in his tenth satire wrote mens sana in copore sano which has been translated as a sound mind and a sound body juvenal was describing a body not wracked by illness and disease and a mind not corrupted by mental decline and sickness today we also realize the important role played by physical fitness in the prevention of physical as well as mental diseases and problems avoiding physical and mental decomposition leads necessarily to a lifelong commitment to physical and mental conditioning we should all pursue a life of physical fitness and wellbeing for its work in this regard we should applaud the work of the maryland commission on physical fitness in closing i would again like to compliment congresswoman byron for her efforts as chairwoman of the maryland commission on physical fitness again i extend my heartiest congratulations to the maryland commission on physical fitness on its 25th anniversary"], [0.00042825937271118164,

secrecy prevents the united states from leaming information of much interest while american openness continues to facilitate soviet acquisition of united states advances in science and technology the soviets have identified numerous american universities as targets for the collection of technology known soviet collectors at the united states universities include members of soviet intelligence

case of deep ocean drilling this case involves top secret information and i really cannot talk about it here but i can say that the unitedstates government was forced into the embarrassing position of having to withdraw a previous invitation to the soviets to participate in the exchange when we realized that security concerns had not been reviewed this is an example of how the failure to provide for comprehensive review of these agreements can have a direct impact on american foreign policy again let me restate the intent of this amendment this amendment requires the general accounting office

be adopted with dispatch and without deep division not that it is perfectit is not we have not been able to do everything that i think our security demands and our worldwide commitments require but the important thing is that we have tried to write a responsible consensus bill and i think we succeeded as evidence of thisi cant think of another subcommittee or committee in the congress that features the diversity of opinion and views that we have on the defense subcommittee believe me there is always wide ranging discussion when we mark up however after many hours and days of effort we bring before you a bill which enjoys the unanimous support of the subcommittee and which was agreed to without controversy by the full appropriations committee ume 21 1988 this is a consensus product which as the chairman indicated reflects both the position of the house and more importantly an effort to get the most defense out of every defense dollar this is the result of a great deal of work and cooperation by all members of the defense subcommittee on both sides of the aisle and i want to commend all the members also we have been fortunate to have the services of our tremendous committee staff and i want to acknowledge their efforts and support to me and the members on this side i would like to express my gratitude to the chairman of our subcommittee the distinguished gentleman from florida bill chappell for his evenhandness and his leadership throughout our deliberations hes done an excellent job as we all are aware last years budget summit set this years funding level for defense i can assure the membership that this bill complies with the summit agreement we track the budget resolution and we are about as close to our 302 b allocation as one could imagine 1 million under for both budget authority and outlays it has been easier in some ways to write this bill because of the summitfrom the first day of hearings we knew how much money we would have to work with and this helped expedite the process despite this relative certainty however writing this bill has not been an uncomplicated task by any means i am compelled to remind all members that even though we comply with the summit this is the fourth straight year that defense appropriations will decline in real terms in this bill we provide roughly 10 percent less after inflation than we did in 1985 and for this fiscal year alone to comply with the summit the department of defense had to cut its planned budget by nearly 33 billion a 10percent reduction this forced the administration to confront many difficult tradeoffs i think all members will concede that under frank carlucci the department not only considered these tradeoffs but stepped up and made some hard choices as a result the budget we were sent in february had a number of stark recommendations an active duty troop reduction of 27 000 the drawdown of 16 navy frigates over 600 army helicopters and two air force fighter wings from existing force structure and the cancellation of over a dozen weapons programs secretary carlucci has been up front about how he regards these proposalsmaking it clear that these cuts were proposed only because of fiscal constraintsnot because of any change in commitments or security needs but cuts had to be made and they were what the dod did do was forward a budget organized around three principlesin the words of secretary carlucci these are people readiness and efficient acquisition i think it is safe to the congress in general has agreed with these priorities and our subcommittee has worked hard to produce a bill that funds this approach for example if the 1970s taught us anything about defense priorities it is that good people and combat readiness can be lost faster than anything else and take the most effort and money to restore the pentagon appears to have recognized this in its request the only areas that show significant growth over last year are indeed the personnel and readiness accounts our subcommittee supports this emphasis and in fact in both the military personnel and operations and maintenance accounts we have not only fully funded but have recommended increases over the administrations request military personnel accounts receive an increase of 2 25 billion over last year including a 4percent military pay raise and increases in housing allowances in operations and maintenance we recommend an overall increase of 5 4 billion from last year nearly 7 percent growth this includes a civilian pay raise of 2 percent within this area we have protected the repair and maintenance activities carried out in army depots navy ship repair facilities and air force logistics centers we have not neglected quality of life issues either for example we have added 229 million over the budget to improve military medical care and staffing levels people and readinessthese are part of the real success stories of the 1980s in defense and i believe we have done a lot in this bill to ensure we dont squander the aprovements made since the late 1970s this bill a7so follows through on the departments third priority trying to make more efficient and productive choices in procurement of equipment we have made every effort to avoid costly production stretchouts and where it made sense and where we could find the funds we have increased procurement rates and looked to multiyear contracting i can point to examples of this in nearly every procurement account look at the armywe have increased funding and approved multiyear procurement of its two premier weapons systemsthe m1 tank and the apache attack helicopter these sorts of recommendations are throughout the bill in keeping with our emphasis on readiness we have protected and in some cases added funds over the request for some of the less glamorous procurement programs such as ammunition for the army and marine corps airtoair missiles for the navy i could go on and on there are a lot of success stories and good things in the bill and report before you i cant be honest and say i am comfortable or satisfied with everything we have recommended but on balance i believe we have put together a credible measure recognizing that we dont have the money to do everything it hasnt been easy we have had the same frustration and problems as all members and committees have faced in trying to address valid national needs in the face of fiscal constraints and while this bill certainly has more than its share of hard choices they are only the first steps of what promises to be a very difficult and prolonged process over the next few years for those who are upset with some of this years decisionsbe it a weapons cancellation or manpower cuts affecting an installation some where in the countrylet me tell you it is going to get tougher the pentagon realizes it has to take into account the overall deficit problem and it is perhaps belatedly coming to grips with decisions which must be considered in the face of limited resources i dont know which direction this will take usbe it more manpower cuts program terminations shifts in force structurebut i can only hope we all agree that the congress has to work with the defense department to try and fashion a steady and predictable effort stability is the surest way to save money in defense and if we want to make informed sensible decisions to save money then we have to be prepared to eliminate the rollercoaster up and down defense spending syndrome as we look forward to the next administration this bill provides a sound basis for beginning this process it deserves and i ask for and overwhelming vote of support from the house"], [0.9993595480918884, 0.9993595480918884, 0, "continuing on it is also significant

nicaragua is basically a gatling gun it has the ability to spray a football field every square foot of a football field in one pass with a round of ammunition on every square foot imagine now the ability that that particular weapon gives to the communists in nicaragua when they are confronting guerrilla troops when they can fly over and spray an area the size of a football field and cover every square foot with one round of ammunition the other aspect that i think we must focus on is this year alone the sovietbloc countries including libya have already pumped into nicaragua 300 million just in the first 6 months the significance of that is that is far more than the entire amount of money that the united states has given to the contras since 1980 in fact we have given a total of less than 200 million 100 million for military assistance a mere 27 million for humanitarian assistance and the balance in covert action my point is the only way that we can deal with that particular sophisticated weapon and incidentally we have nothing in our arsenals that compare with it because the sophistication is in the armament they have been able to take in essence a flying tank which is fortified by titanium underneath which is impenetrable by anything other than a guidedmissile system with stingers we could knock out and i say we because like the president i consider myself a freedom fighter we could knock out those 12 60 million cumulative investments of the soviet union into central america and suddenly you would see the entire equation change in central america let me point out the undergirth here is totally fortified by titanium light enough to fly but strong enough to repel anything short of a guided missile that means that while they hover over any type of guerrilla formation they can spray that area with a round of artillery and basically not be concerned at all about being hit because it will essentially withstand anything except a stinger"]],

earthquake safety built into them enables them to do wonderfully well even under great stress sanford university that i graduated from just threw its president out of the presidents house and emptied one of the dorms in that university because the buildings were not earthquake sound ej 1230 it is important that we have the awareness to build these things into our communities from now on so that if we are lucky enough that we have a cycle time before the next major earthquake hits we will then have protected our population in advance so i want to commend this bill strongly to the house it is a good compromise between several committees each of which has a piece of the action and it shows to me that we can work together among the various committees of the house and the senate and come out with a good program in the public interest i thank the committee chairman for yielding this time to me"], [0.0009565949440002441, 0.5009565949440002, 0, "that is wonderful i thank my friend the

emergency hunger relief act introduced by the gentleman from california the distinguished chairman of the agriculture subcommittee on domestic marketing consumer relations and nutrition mr panetta and supported by the distinguished chairman of the agriculture committee the gentleman from texas the ranking minority member of the select committee on hunger the gentleman from missouri as the primary sponsor of legislation which established the house select committee on hunger i would like to commend the gentlemen as well as all the hunger select committee members who through their diligent efforts have attempted to provide for the nutritional requirements of needy citizens as an original cosponsor of h r 4060 legislation aimed to provide small but significant improvements in federal food programs i am pleased that the congress is finally acknowledging the vital role played by domestic nutritional assistance it is long past time for congress to recognize that programs such as tefap school lunch wic and food stamps are not mere discretionary expenditures but rather represent the legltimate entitlement of starving people to the right to be fed pacing the blight of hunger and malnutrition at home it is nearly impossible for us to focus on our broader goal of ending hunger throughout the world my support for h r 4060 is a testament to the fundamental need to raise the problem of worldwide and domestic starvation on the national conscience critics have attempted to paint the era of fiscal restraint as a argument against the continuance of worthy programs such as tefap while we all recognize the need to restore fiscal sanity to the federal budget the problem ofhunger is a moral imperative of the utmost urgency which has too long gone ignored while i am pleased that the house stands upon the verge of enacting h r 4060 i was disappointed that committee negotiations resulted in scaling down the original intent of the bill which i cosponsored in its current form h r 4060 attempts to accomplish two of our most basic original objectives first it will reauthorize and continue the badly needed temporary emergency food assistance program by providing a 1 year reauthorization of 50 million for fiscal year 1989 second it will increase food stamp benefit levels to 103 percent of the value of usdas model thrifty food plan this will result in an increase of approximately 3 per month for the average recipients fortunately i understand that some of the many beneficial child nutrition provisions may be restored during conference consideration this agreement testifies to the willingness of congress to ensure adequate federal funding for continued hunger relief the quesiton of what qualifies as adequate may separate me from some of my colleagues on this issue but i am pleased that congress has proven willing to take some form of limited assistance i feel confident that we will revisit this topic in the future in the interim i urge my colleagues to vote for h r 4060 and take the first positive step of enacting this important legislation"], [0.0023723244667053223, 0.5023723244667053, 1, "i urge my colleagues to accept h r 4419 the federal fire

systems for the 21 million hearing impaired individuals in the united states this senate provision is identical to the language that is in the committee on science space and technologys report on h r 4419house report 100589 we simply must support these programs each year 6 000 citizens die from fire and more than 9 6 billion worth of property is lost as a result of fire reauthorizing the fire activities for fiscal years 198991 as presented in h r 4419 as amended by the senate is a small price to pay to continue programs which have a proven success rate of reducing human and property losses
