professional in 1961 which happens to be from the same state that the speaker john boehner is from as a family man he remains committed to the core values of providing for his family respecting the game and serving as a true inspiration for others upon marrying his wife barbara in july of 1960 and the birth of their first son jack jr in 1961 he decided the best way to provide for his family was to become a professional golfer his drive and his passion for the game is an example of sportsmanship of the highest caliber like most of us amateurs who love the game of golf however i ask that jack nicklaus be awarded the congressional gold medal for his leadership as an american and as a positive role model yes jack nicklaus won 118 national and international championships yes jack nicklaus

1942 he married the love of his life naomi opal gourley and together they raised two loving daughters dorothy jane and kathy jean after the war bolt returned to fowler and was appointed the postmaster a position he held for 27 years known for his dedication and friendly demeanor many times he would personally deliver packages and not just during the christmas season but throughout the year because of course everybody knew cecil his decades of public service extended far beyond the walls of the post office which centered as a hub of activity for the community cecil volunteered every day for more

served as a sunday school teacher and a kids club volunteer for his service he received fowlers citizen of the year award in 1969 and the silent servant of the year award in 2004 sadly after years and

teachers is a unique program that provides veterans with a 5 000 stipend to help cover the costs of obtaining a teaching certification in exchange for three years service in an eligible school an additional bonus of 5 000 is available for teaching in a high need school this structure has proven very effective in transitioning qualified retiring military personnel into second careers in teaching indeed troops participants fill several critical needs among educators eighty percent are male over onethird are ethnic minorities and a majority bring an expertise in science and math to the classroom furthermore these troops also bring valuable life experience and character traits that are uncommon in our nations classroom however the success of this program is in jeopardy without the needed changes that are included in the courtney petri matsui amendment when the program was transferred to the education department a simple drafting error in the 2002 no child left behind act resulted in a education department ruling restricting the number of school districts in which veterans can fulfill their teaching requirement since the implementation of this ruling in september 2005 retiring military have found the number of schools at which they would be eligible to teach drastically reduced the departments new interpretation locks out schools in many rural areas and small communities this is a shame especially given the success of this program and its ability to meet some of our nations greatest teaching needs in my own state of wisconsin only 11 out of 395 school districts qualify for participants to fulfill their teaching requirements a 2006 government accountability report gao of the program found that the 2005 ruling had reduced interest and participation in the program as schools in regions where troops lived were no longer considered eligible our amendment would correct this ruling and ensure that veterans participating in the troops to teachers program receive a 5 000 stipend for teaching three years in any school that is in a district receiving title 1 funds this would more than double the number of schools eligible under the program the amendment does not change the criteria for the additional 5 000 bonus maintaining the incentive for troops to teach in the highest need schools the amendment also makes the troops to teachers program more accessible by reducing the length of service requirements for active military the makeup of our military has drastically changed since this program was first authorized sixteen years ago many of our young men and women returning from service in iraq and afghanistan who would like to pursue teaching careers are currently ineligible for the program third to ensure continued success of the

of information but our interest should be in protecting the rights of consumers protecting them from having this kind of private informationi would think since the original video protection act was about protecting the privacy of judge robert bork and people going into his records to review his video viewing privacy that my colleagues on the opposite side of the aisle would be the most vigorous in trying to protect this but here we are giving in to the interests that will make money out of this and exposing our children and our own viewing habits to this kind of intrusive action on our part and we are doing it without the benefit of any testimony at a hearing to talk about this we should simply not be doing this i would like to submit for the record a letter dated december 5 2012 from the electronic privacy information center in which they aggressively oppose this legislation they say they are a nonpartisan public interest research organization the video privacy protection act was passed in 1988 following disclosure of the private video rental records of a supreme court nominee by a video rental store to a news organization there was broadbased support for passage and the act was signed by president ronald reagan this act is considered a model privacy act in many respects it is technology neutral and this bill undermines this video privacy act that was the model act that was designed to protect a republican nominee to the supreme court and was signed into law by a republican president and here we are in this congress getting ready to send a bill over to the senatewhich hopefully they wont act on they will save us from our own ineptitudewhich would undermine the key provision of the video protection act which is the right of users to give meaningful consent to the disclosure of their personal information this blanket consent according to the electronic privacy information centerand i agree with them wholeheartedly the blanket consent provisions transfer control from the individual user to the company in possession of the data and diminish the control that netflix customers would have in the use and disclosure of their personal information while we recognize that other companies routinely report on the activities of their customers we note that facebook users have never been particularly happy about this the history of beacon is well knownand also that the routine disclosure of video viewing activities is not something that most facebook users are clamoring for in fact facebook as we just indicated just entered into a settlement of a privacy lawsuit and here we are on the floor of the house saying that we value the business interests more than we value the personal privacy interests of individual citizens this is a bad idea it shouldnt be here on the suspension calendar as if its a noncontroversial clarification of the law this is a dramatic undermining of the video privacy protection act we are doing a disservice to our constituents by giving this authority they already have the authority to do it on a case bycase bycase basis it may be inconvenient to the companies to get the authority given to them that way but thats the way it should be given to them not in some blanket authority that just allows the companies to go in and use this information willynilly and without regard to the privacy i thank the gentleman for yielding again and i may ask him to yield again depending on what happensoh he says hes not going to yield to me anymore i just think my colleagues should vote against this bill defeat it on suspension and lets at least debate it under regular order on the floor of the house or send it back to the committee so we can have some hearings about the privacy implications so we can get this done"], [0.001314699649810791, 0.4986853003501892, 0, "dc president and ceo i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.0013869106769561768, 0.4986130893230438, 1, "i seek to claim the time in
