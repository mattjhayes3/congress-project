is just too much evidence mounted against them that is transparent and apparent to the american people that they see it every single day all anyone has to do is turn on the news any channel any hour that the news is on to see that things arent going so well and stay the course all stay the course amounts to is a slogan not a strategy if stay the course is their strategy then i feel incredibly confident about what will happen 54 days from now everywhere i go and i have been all over the country so have you in recent weeks and months people even the most conservative individuals who i have had an opportunity to talk to are dumbfounded that the republicans have led us down this path and are trying to lead people in america to believe that they are moving us in the right direction on protecting our homeland monday was the 5year anniversary as you mentioned of september 11 i was home and i mentioned the last couple of nights that i was home with our first responders commemorating that tragic set of events one of the most disturbing things what we did was we actually did a roundtable with our first responders and sat down and asked them where are we 5 years later are all the things that we said and identified that were problems in the aftermath of 9 11 have they been addressed are we working on them what do you still need we really have to listen that is our job because we need to listen to our first responders and find out from them what is really going on the ground i remember i am sure you do too that one of the most significant problems that was identified that has been talked about across this country is the interoperability which is a word that is difficult to understand that means the inability for the first responders on 9 11 to communicate with each other while the event was unfolding that was one of the major major recommendations of the bipartisan 9 11 commission that we had to fund and improve the interoperability so that across all of the jurisdiction all of the intelligence and law enforcement jurisdictions that there could be communication the fbi couldnt talk to the firefighters couldnt talk to the police officers and today 5 years later that is still not in place even though it was a recommendation of the 9 11 commission and it boils down to funding you have to fund it there is no way around it there is no other way to accomplish it but what are we doing instead what are we spending our money on lets look at what the war in iraq currently costs currently we are spending 8 4 billion with a b a month we are spending 1 9 billion per week in iraq on this war 275 million per day 11 5 million per hour"], [0.9928152756765485, 0.007184724323451519, 1, "absolutely correct and as we cannot talk about accountability we cannot talk about the budget financial responsibility national security without examining where we are in iraq at this time and we cannot do it for the obvious reason that the american people are expecting us now to ask the questions and to finally stand up as a congres and do what the constitution and the founding fathers laid out the congress to do they laid out the congress to do two essential things one was to determine how our tax dollars are appropriated all of that starts here and the other is oversight and we have not done a good job of oversight that is one of the reasons why the american people in many ways are very frustrated we have not asked the tough questions some of us have asked the tough questions but not enough of us and i am so thankful for the dubai incident because that opened up everybodys eyes to really see when that dubai incident happened and all of the sudden we were going to turn over port security to the united arab emirates a country in which we knew from our intelligence that terrorist financing was emanating from a country that owned dubai that owned the company which we know was sending nuclear fusion material into iran and that did have direct financial relationships through their connecting financial centers in terrorist financing with al qaeda all of this came to our attention when the administration said we are going to turn our port security over to a company owned by this country it woke us all up and finally in a bipartisan way we stood up and we rejected that to me was a turning moment when congress stood up and said let us be the congress so i think that congress has a responsibility definitely under the constitution to conduct oversight of the executive branch we failed to conduct meaningful investigations of allegations of serious waste fraud and abuse much of what you talked about with halliburton and the people are expecting us to do this now in the situation in iraq and let me just digress for just one moment because i agree with you president bush is very good at saying well if you do not agree with me you are weak on national security or you do not care about the war on terror nobody there is not a congressman in this place that stands stronger for national security defense and support of our military than you and me and our blue dog coalition our record speaks for itself i have been to iraq i have been to afghanistan we all have been there to see about our soldiers we know and we care but the question has to be asked now what are we doing there what is the mission i mean when we decided to go in i was not here to cast that vote i was the first class of congress to come in after it was decided but the decision was made to go because we had evidence that came to us colin powell went before national television and went before all of us and laid it out we took them at their word we took them at their word that saddam hussein had the capacity and i demonstrated evidence of having weapons of massdestruction that there was evidence that there was a direct link i and relationship between al qaeda it was there it would have been foolhardy for anybody to stand up and say i you do not care about security to ignore that we took the administration at the value of truth and we supported that to go in we sent our troops into harms way we discovered there were no weapons of mass destruction okay job done should have been complete fine let us head on out of here we have done the mission but then the mission changed on the dime it then became we have got to get saddam hussein well our soldiers went to work did a remarkable job found him in a hole and pulled him out mission accomplished we were there then the mission changes again we have got to rebuild the country we have got put democracy in place we have got to have free elections well our soldiers went to work they did not go over there to nationbuild they went over there to find weapons of mass destruction but they become nationbuilders we got in there now all of the sudden we are into a civil war we are into a situation there terribly trying to climb out we have got to solve this situation but congress has got to roll up its sleeves and play a clearer role and a more definitive role in how the american taxpayers dollars how we are being good stewards of their tax dollars in national security and financial security and all that we do i want to just comment on if i may for a moment on the responsibility in terms of getting fraud and abuse and mismanagement of the taxpayer dollars out in the open i just want to share a couple of points here one is in fiscal year 2005 auditors of 19 of 24 federal agencies could not routinely produce reliable useful and timely financial audit information

expected to help the service reduce its debt to the treasury by approximately 3 billion each year and to keep rates stable until 2006 it also created an escrow account designed to ensure that the postal service uses these savings wisely the bill before us today releases that escrow account and will help us to keep our rates stable earlier this year the postal service filed a request with the rate commission for yet another increase of 5 4 percent it would be the fourth increase since 2001 and it is critical that we release these monies in the escrow to delay this rate increase this

time we are on the floor today because the representation has been made to the american people and to our colleagues that this legislation is legislation that relates and responds to the crisis in the war on terror we all are united in that war but this is an immigration bill and i do believe we should do immigration in a bipartisan manner let me make it very clear the 9 11 terrorists would not have been thwarted by this legislation in fact all 19 of the 9 11 hijackers had documents to enter the country legally and under this particular legislation the terrorists would not have been prevented from using these documents to obtain drivers licenses i think the real crux is as was quoted in the words of governor jeb bush what do you do with them illegal aliens who are working in our hotels and factories who are working every day in our states and our cities and our counties the last thing mr chairman do we remember bosnia and kosovo these were people seeking asylum i think we have to judge ourselves by reason and reasonable policy i join my colleagues in working together to secure the homeland but in this instance this does not follow the 9 11 recommendations this commission did in fact say that they wanted secure documents and identification should begin in the united states it did not document or indicate in which manner we should be able to do that i would have hoped that h r 620 the security measures feasibility act which would ask the hard questions of how and what is the best vehicle in order to be able to establish these secure documents would have been the better approach now we undermine the states ability for safety and security in their own states and we undermine the very principles of this nation which are to open the doors for those fleeing persecution both in terms of religious and political persecution what about the cubans what about the haitians the liberians the sudanese the bosnians what about those fleeing as my colleague has indicated our jewish individuals who were fleeing persecution i simply say that we have a better way of doing this i wish we could do it together i hope my colleagues will oppose this bill so we might do this effort in a bipartisan manner i rise in opposition to h r 418 the real id act the real id act is an attempt to breathe life into immigration provisions that were stripped from the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act these provisions were viewed as controversial then and they are no less controversial now the real id act should have been subjected to hearings and markups before being brought to the floor the supporters of the h r 418 are afraid that terrorists are using our asylum laws as a means of entering and remaining in the united states this fear has to be put into perspective terrorists are statutorily barred from asylum eligibility and it is not apparent why they would choose such a complicated time consuming method for entering and remaining in the united states in any event the 9 11 hijackers entered and remained in the united states as nonimmigrant visitors visitors visas only require a twominute interview with an american consulate officer the applicant just has to establish that he will return to his country at the end of the authorized period of stay this is much easier than the steps required for obtaining asylum which among other things require the applicant to establish a wellfounded fear of persecution on account of race religion nationality membership in a particular social group or political opinion the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act established a study to find out the extent to which terrorists are attempting to use our asylum laws to enter and remain in the united states and what weaknesses they are exploiting we need to wait for that information before we consider any bills on revising our asylum laws changes should be designed to deal specifically with weaknesses that we know are being exploited the approach in the real id act is to raise the bar on the burden of proof which would result in a denial of relief to bona fide asylum seekers without any assurance that the changes would discourage terrorists from seeking asylum for instance in addition to showing that the alleged persecution would be on account of one of the enumerated grounds the applicant would have to establish that the persecution was or will be a central reason for persecuting the applicant in effect the asylum applicant would have to establish what was in the mind of the persecutor it is not apparent how this would discourage terrorists from fabricating asylum claims the only certainty is that it would make it more difficult for bona fide asylum seekers to meet their burden of proof the unfairness of this approach is illustrated by a comment that the honorable sandra day oconnor made recently about the asylum laws of our country she said the united states offers protection in the form of asylum to individuals fleeing persecution in other nations in most cases however asylum seekers find themselves alone destitute and facing deportation asylum law is governed by a labyrinth of statutes

yielding me the time it is a new year a new congress and new presidential term we have heard new commitments to work across party lines and calls for civility and camaraderie in the halls of the capitol we have heard the president speak of a more civilized washington and a bipartisan approach to the legislative process then and now congress starts its work the rhetoric starts reality sets in we are not even 2 full weeks into the house legislative calendar and it is starting to sound like the same old song and dance any way we look at it process or policy the house is off to a bad start it is the first day of normal legislative business in the 109th congress and the house is already considering a restrictive rule for a bill that has not gone through proper house procedures new congress members just coming from parliamentary procedure training session must be doing a doubletake they just spent a week in a refresher course on how a bill becomes a law then all of the sudden that process has not been followed on one of their first votes i guess i was confused too and what i can say to them is welcome to washington the proponents of the underlying legislation will try to argue that it is not a new bill because it was first introduced in the 108th congress while that might be true the committee on financial services did not act on the bill in the 108th congress and it has not acted on it in this year i ask why is the full house considering a relatively controversial piece of legislation without any committee action why the rush why set such a precedent for the 109th congress beginning the committee on financial services the committee of jurisdiction for the underlying legislation will not even organize itself until next week let alone hold a hearing or markup on my good friends and he is my good friend the gentleman from delawares bill think about it this way the first bill that the house is considering in the 109th congress under normal rules actually makes it harder to pass legislation and create laws honoring our countrys greatest heroes just like social security some of my republican friends are trying to create a problem where one does not exist as

measures to address the problem of underage drinking underage drinking is a serious problem in our country that has serious consequences it is estimated that nearly onethird of children and adolescents between the ages of 12 and 20 use alcohol which is a higher percentage than those who use tobacco or illicit drugs alcolol is a leading contributor to death and injury among adolescents over 5 000 young people die every year as a result of injuries that involve drinking not only does underage drinking cause accidents injuries and death but it can have a lasting impact on a young persons physical development studies have shown that the human brain conr tinues to develop into a young persons early 20s and that exposure of the developing brain to alcohol may have longlasting effects on intellectual capabilities and increase the likelihood of alcohol addiction the legislation before us today will take several steps to address the problem of underage drinking at the national level it would also assist states localities and institutions of higher learning in their efforts to prevent underage drinking the bill would create a nationwide media campaign to educate youth and parents on the dangers of underage drinking it would also as sist states in collecting data on underage drinking laws and their enforcement around the country so that states can collaborate and learn from each other about which strategies are most effective at combating this problem the bill also calls for research to be conducted on the influences and pressures that entice youth to

crew commander john w young and pilot robert l crippen it is hard to believe now but 25 years have passed since the space shuttle columbia took off on its maiden voyage onapril 12 1981 the space shuttle was the first and remains the only reusable crewed orbital spacecraft in the world and its design rcresented a dramatic step towards human space flight parenthetically i might say i was talking to some of my younger staff today and we who have been around for a while remember that flight well but when you try to explain to young people or to anybody for that matter that these people were landing in this enormous and weighty bird that had never been tested and it had no power never been tested in this kind of conditions and it had no power you understand the undertaking that these courageous crew members had set themselves up for this vehicle of course had the capacity to carry twice the crew members of its predecessors to launch large scientific instruments such as the hubble space telescope the compton gamma ray observatory as well as interplanetary probes like galileo and ulysses on that same subject i must say that personally i believe the deep space image of hubble is something that struck me as powerful as the first images we saw of earth in the early apollo days when that telescope looked off into the heavens at a tiny speck and saw thousands of galaxies it is an awe inspiring sight that i think the entire world should perhaps contemplate what it means to us more recently of course the shuttle has served as a workhorse for the assembly of the international space station and on april 12 1981 those accomplishments were still in the future on that day as the space shuttle crew carried two intrepid astronauts john young and robert crippen into the heavens on that courageous journey we all held our breath because therein lay the future of manned space flight and womaned spaced flight as we would later see on shuttles we should not underestimate the magnitude of that task sts was not the first time that the space shuttle would carry a crew of astronauts it was the first time the space shuttle would be flown into space period the willingness of these brave commanders to accept this mission shows that they certainly had the right stuff and it is entirely fitting that this congress commemorate their accomplishments on this the 25th anniversary of the first flight of the space shuttle i think it is also appropriate to express our appreciation to all of the individuals whether civil servants or contractors who have worked so hard over the many years on the space shuttle program and over particularly the last quarter century i urge my colleagues to support the adoption of h con res 366 i hope that action will be followed by speedy adoption in the other body i reserve the balance of my time"]]}
