will give him an a for creativity because this is the same bill five times under four different guises first it was for west nile okay then it was the pest management and fire suppression flexibility act so when we had west nile they called it a west nile bill when we were having a bad fire year they called it a fire suppression flexibility act then they were honest and they said it is the reducing regulatory burdens act the piece of paper the report you have to file after you apply the pesticides so at least that was from their side honest but then now it is the zika vector control act renamed 2 weeks ago zika is a serious problem of course on their side they are refusing to put forward an adequate budget to partner with communities who want to do mosquito reduction and control efforts but that is a story for another day and it is a different committee but that would be a real thing we could do here are a couple of points zika is very bad for pregnant women and is also implicated in guillainbarre syndrome in both males and females and other potential links to other diseases really really bad stuff we have to get ahead of it we also know that pesticides and herbicides are bad for pregnant women so is the current state of affairs such that vector control districts cant go out right now today and apply pesticides to deal with a potential zika with tiger mosquitoes and aedes aegypti no actually they can under the law they can go out and apply whatever they think would be effective they just need within 30 days to send a forma form a piece of paperavailable online to the epa saying what they applied and where they applied it now why would we care about that well because we are worried about loading up drinking water with stuff that is harmful to pregnant women and to babies and to other living things just like the 90 000 steelhead that were killed in my district all we are saying is we would like to keep track and then when we see certain concentrations in certain areas we will actually test the water your local water authority does not routinely testfor the most part very fewfor pesticides and herbicides but if they knew a bunch had been dumped upstream they might want to do that or the epa might want to follow up and do some testing so what we are saying is we dont want to know we dont want to know what where how this stuff was applied now the horrible burden of submitting an online form this horrible horrible horrible burden has led to no well we heard last time there may have been an aerial applicator who didnt apply something because of this regulatory burden or maybe because they had misapplied it or maybe the wind was blowing too hard who knows we dont know that was one anecdotal report but from the 50
