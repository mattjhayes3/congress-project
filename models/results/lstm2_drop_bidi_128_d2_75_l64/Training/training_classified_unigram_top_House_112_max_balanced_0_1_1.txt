reed mentioned earlier this isnt a democrat or a republican issue this is a bipartisan issue because its about economic opportunity for all of our regions i am joining my colleagues to discuss the significant economic potential that the marcellus shale natural gas play has for our country as you may know the marcellus shale is the largest unconventional natural gas formation in the united states the shale is estimated to hold almost 500 trillion cubic feet of extractable natural gas currently valued at nearly 2 trillion as with most economic activity the impacts of the natural gas affect more than just specific firms directly involved in the industry there are also important employment and income effects on local businesses who supply the industry such as oilfield service companies restaurants retailers and hotels in addition to effects that result from employees spending their wages locally in pennsylvania 75 percent of the natural gas it uses every day is imported currently this is just pennsylvania the marcellus shale formation that runs along the appalachian mountainsso it goes up into new york comes down through pennsylvania into virginia and west virginia as g t thompson mr thompson from pennsylvania mentioned earlier goes into eastern ohio and down through the appalachian mountainsis really an opportunity for this country because as mr thompson mentioned as we watch the unstableness in the middle east were talking about the natural gas industry which is just booming in our region of the world its sort of interesting because in a conversation with some of the folks from industry about a decade ago the natural gas industry was told that theyd better start building processing plants at ports and on the shorelines because there was going to be a need for this country to import natural gas well now that equation has flipped and this country is really on the verge of producing so much natural gas just through the marcellus shale that we will exceed the needs of this country and we actually could be on the verge of becoming an exporter of natural gas to foreign economies its incredible the highpaying jobs available today in the marcellus shale gas industry are expected to multiply in the future meeting the needs of gas companies efforts to increase drilling and production across the region in pennsylvania alone it is estimated that more than 110 000 new jobs have been created because of the development of this shale"], [0.9915872132405639, 0.00841278675943613, 1, "and mr hoyerall those in charge of the democrat

that when im harvesting my crops in the combine that im going to stir up some dust whether i am planting tiling or transferring crop to the grain bin i cannot control the fact that there will be dust a one size fits all approach to regulating particulate matter does not take into consideration that there are many sources of dust this legislation allows the flexibility for our states and municipalities to manage dust in rural areas so that local residents and workers can determine which types may be harmful and what is simply the result of hardworking americans of doing their jobs our farmers ranchers and rural business leaders are facing the same economic uncertainties as the rest of the country and they cannot afford additional costly regulations on dust particularly those producers who are in areas where natural disasters have created new challenges for tilling soil that has been harmed by drought fire and flood for these individuals many of the challenges remain unknown additional regulations will only increase their burdens and limit their ability to return to their job and contribute to the economy of rural america i know that administrator jackson has stated that the agency plans to maintain current standards i thank her for that i appreciate her intention to work with congress and our farmers and ranchers however her statement alone does not protect the farm operations across our nation and it does not prevent this body from legislating on behalf of our producers this legislation provides the protections needed for rural americans to
