allow the epa to move forward and finalize its flawed rule expansion under federal jurisdiction of the clean water act regardless of the consequences if the epa determines entirely of its own discretion that the rule was consistent with the supreme court decisions and other factors listed in the amendment the rule would be finalized this amendment gives the epa the authority to nullify the supreme court decisions which reined in the epas expansive claims to federal jurisdiction under the clean water act and legally reinterpreted those decisions to be as broad and expansive as it would like the epa has already stated that it believes its proposed rule is consistent with the supreme court decisions and with other factors listed in this amendment therefore the effect of this amendment is to allow the epa to finalize its flawed rule that many believe is not consistent with the supreme court decisions and the other listed factors this amendment will put the epa solely in charge of americas waters and would undermine the federalstate partnership that h r 1732 seeks to preserve it would allow the epa to finalize and implement its flawed rule without consultation with the states there has been a lot of debate and discussion today and i want to just kind of address some of that because it goes to this amendment too once they gut the bill there was a lot of talk about the amendment that was included in the energy and water appropriations bill that was really a backstop to stop them from moving forward on the current proposed rule and they cannot repropose the same rule but if this bill is passed into law they could move forward and do what h r 1732 directs them to do administrator mccarthy said they dont need to put anything out because there are no new changes or major changes that is why they dont need to put out a supplemental to the proposed rule that is the problem that is why we have this bill here today and that is why i am against the gentlewomans amendment because they are not being open or transparent about what changes they made i have a letter from the executive office of the president office of management and budget talking about the administration policy in regard to h r 1732 and it talks about that they believe that this bill passed into law would constrain the agencys discretion that is the problem we cant have a bunch of bureaucrats running around the country and deciding what are going to be waters of the united states and what are not going to be waters of the united states we have to be clear about that and give clarity all that h r 1732 says is for the epa and the corps to go back to the states and stakeholders and work out a rule to satisfy the supreme court decisions and that brings clarity and certainty and allows for economic expansion and protects waters at the same time but if you open it up to having bureaucrats"], [0.0008653252152726054, 0.0008653252152726054, 0, "i thank you dr yoho and i think you laid out the chronology of the long timetable of the deceit that iran has been dealing with in terms of their nuclear program i thank all of my colleagues who joined tonights special order to discuss irans nuclear negotiations that are going on in vienna as we speak after missing deadline after deadline and allowing for extension after extension we are now hearing that these negotiations may be openended it is our job in congress to conduct proper oversight on any proposed deal and to reject any deal that is not in the best interests of our national security or the security and stability of the entire region as current law stipulates if a deal is submitted for congressional review before tomorrow then congress only has a 30day review period however if this deal is submitted after tomorrow we will have 60 days to review the terms of the agreement why should the administration fear an additional 30 days of review if this deal is so good as the administration keeps telling us then it should be strong enough to stand up to congressional review and congressional scrutiny but the administration knows just how weak this deal will be lets review as my colleagues have done how far back we have slid from conditions that we placed on iran when we started and how much the p5 1 countries have caved through its concessions to this rogue and dangerous regime lets start with this there are six united nations security council resolutions against iran and its nuclear program each one of those resolutions puts restrictions on iran and calls for a complete stop on uranium enrichment a complete stop the supreme leader argued that it had a right to enrich under the nonproliferation treaty the npt to which it is a signatory but of course all of these alleged rights should have been forfeited once it was discovered that iran had been in violation of the nonproliferation treaty and other international obligations for decades because it has been operating a covert nuclear program yet the p5 1 countries inexplicably ceded the socalled right to iran in fact in 2009 the president clearly stated iran must comply with u n security council resolutions and make clear it is willing to meet its responsibilities as a member of the community of nations that ended up not being true as the president has caved on that commitment the president has repeatedly stated in the past that iran doesnt need to have a fortified underground facility in fordo a heavy water reactor in arak or some of the other advanced centrifuges that they currently possess in order to have a peaceful nuclear program yet where are we now well iran will maintain fordo and its capacity to produce and store heavy water while continuing to not just operate advanced centrifuges but to also test and conduct research and development on them as wellhow far we have moved those goalposts there is also a serious and dangerous issue of the possible military dimensions pmd and irans past nuclear activity just 3 weeks ago secretary kerry confirmed what we long suspected that disclosure of past nuclear activity is no longer a musthave for this administration in this nuclear deal how would any agreement that doesnt demand that iran at least come clean about the extent of its program going to be a good deal mr speaker dont forget that the supreme leader has also repeatedly stated that irans military sites would not be accessible to international inspectors lets not forget one of the most important things here the ultimate gift we have given iran this deal will help legitimize this rogue regime that will not only allow iran to be viewed as a responsible nation but it is no longer going to be the pariah state we are going to say it is a trusted member of the international community and we have done that we have granted that legitimacy with these conversations also the reports indicateand i dont hear any words to the contrarythat iran may receive a 50 billion signing bonus as if this is the nfl draft a signing bonus which it will then use to support terror which it will use to foment instability which it will use to stoke sectarian tensions which it will use to continue to threaten israel which it will continue to undermine unitedstates national security interests that is what their signing bonus will do that is what sanctions relief will do if the united states is willing to overlook all of these transgressions all of these crimes and negotiate a deal with iran without pressing for changes in its actions then it will be seen as an endorsement of those actions we have every indication that we are not going to get what any of us would remotely consider to be even a halfway good deal the requirements for a good deal went out the window when the negotiators allowed iran to maintain its entire nuclear infrastructure and continue to enrich uranium it is our obligation then to conduct our proper oversight and review and reject any nuclear deal that we feel is not in the best interests of our unitedstates national security if we do that we must move swiftly to reimpose any sanctions that have been suspended any sanctions that have been waived against the regime and to ensure that all sanctions are fully and vigorously enforced then we must move to enact additional sanctions on the regime until it meets its international obligations and abandons its pursuit of an illicit nuclear weapons program once upon a time that was the goal from the very beginning i have been saying that iran is following the north korean playbook offering to negotiate in return for concessions but never delivering on anything tangible only to break off when they no longer need what we have been giving them i wrote this oped on october 19 2012 roslehtinen obama still trying to sweettalk iran out of building the bomb and i was talking about the north korea deal and how that dovetails with the iranian deal i wrote of the dangers of the obama administrations naive view that if we keep talking if we keep engaging with this rogue regime then iran will stop its drive for nuclear capability i stated then and i believe now that this is what we are witnessing today that the iranians will give the impression that a deal will be likely only to then pull away that iran benefits from dragging out the negotiations as long as possible because as"],

decisions that actually came down from the supreme courti believe it was a week ago last thursday and friday on thursday there was a decision from the supreme court on obamacare the king v burwell case where the majority decision of the supreme court concluded that the law as passed by the united states congress doesnt mean what it says it means instead according to the majority of the supreme court what they think the president would have liked to have had it said if he had actually been dictating the language there but we have to vote on the language that is in the bill not the language that should have been in the head of the president and the speaker of the house at the time that is why we have had a supreme court who over the last generation has been textualist this has emerged from the rehnquist court and should have survived and been enhanced under the roberts court that the law means what it says and the constitution means what it says and furthermore it needs to mean what it was understood to mean at the time of ratification we do have a language that moves and changes and morphs along the way and the language that is written into the constitution into the various amendments that are there and written into our laws we cant simply say that because we have a different way we utilize language today that somehow the people who ratified it had a meaning that conformed to the morphed language of the modern world and i would have thought that chief justice roberts would have been one of those who would have adhered to that i can think of times when the court has said to this congress you may have intended one thing but the language in the bill that you passed and was signed into law actually means something different so you can either live with the decision of the court or you can set about changing the language so that the language actually does what you intended it to do it is a simple understanding of simple construction under the law in the constitution an example would be the ban on partial birth abortion that passed here in this congress in the nineties it went before three federal courts and then was appealed to the supreme court and the supreme court concluded that the ban on partial birth abortion that congress had first passed was vague in its description of the act itself and that congress didnt have findings that partial birth abortion was not necessary to save the life of the mother so it was struck down by the supreme court and that means they sent it back to us they said congress fix that and i got involved in that i want to tip my hat to congressmen steve chabot of ohio who was the chairman of the constitution subcommittee at the time and jim sensenbrenner the chair of the full judiciary committee we held hearing after hearing we rewrote the definition of partial birth abortion so that it was precise and clear and understandable and we complied with the courts directive in those hearings we brought witnesses that put into the congressional record a mass of evidence that concluded that a partial birth abortion was never necessary to save the life of the mother we did those things to conform to the directive of the supreme court because they read the text of the law but today we have a supreme court that concludes thatwell the text may say one thing but we think the president would have preferred it to say something else and so did most of the people maybe that voted to pass obamacare that very partisan piece of legislation maybe they intended for it to say something else too but it didnt so the supreme court inserted the words or federal government into the statute that said an exchange established by the state the supreme court essentially wrote into that by state or federal government alleging that the language was vague that is appalling to me to think that in the united states of america a country ruled by the rule of law that we could have a supreme court whono one has a higher charge to read the language to understand it to call the balls and strikes as the chief justice has said i think he forgot to say that you are supposed to also call whether it is fair or foul well i think it is foul it is a foul ball for the supreme court to think that they can change the language of the law if they sent it back here congress then had an obligation to adjust the policy to our intent from now maybe not the intent at the time that it was passed because those years have moved then subsequent to that the very next day fridaya week ago last friday as i recallthe supreme court came with a decision a decision on same sex marriage i have some experience with this and it falls along this line in 2009 the iowa supreme court in reading the mirror of our 14th amendment which is in our united states constitutionand the mirror of it is written into the iowa state constitutionthey concluded that samesex marriage was the law of the land in iowa and their conclusion was that it fell underneath the equal protection and due process clauses of the 14th amendmentthe mirrored component of the 14th amendment that was in our iowa constitution there are 63 pages in the varnum v brien decision in the iowa case i read that decision i read all 63 pages but not only that i poked through it i read it i looked at the ceiling i contemplated i looked back down at the words i tried to absorb the kind of legal rationale that would get you to the point where you could conclude that under equal protection or due process that marriage really was between one adult and another entity whatever sex or gender that entity might be and they wrote that under the protection of the 14th amendment the equal protection clause and due process that quote homosexuals have a right to public affirmation closed quote i know of no place in law i know of no place in society i know of no place in history where there is an individual let alone a group of people a selflabeled group of people that have any claim to public affirmation public approval conferred by the court but that was the key to understanding this litigation that has moved forward since 2009 it brings us into 2015 and we have a decision in the supreme court that commands all states if they are going to recognize any marriage to recognize same sex marriage and for all states to also provide the reciprocity of recognizing marriages that take place in other states as those individuals may come through or move into their states that is that right of reciprocity it is in the constitution reciprocity but for the supreme court to essentially create a new right a right to same sex marriage manufactured out of the 14th amendment of the constitution of the united states that was ratified in 1868and by the way it ties into this dialogue about the confederate flag and all the rhetoric that we have had in this congress all week long it ties into it in this way the 13th and 14th amendments to the constitution were ratified in the aftermath of the civil war they were established first the 13th amendment to free the slaves because the people in the legislature at the time didnt believe that a clear statute that freed the slaves was going to actually have the impact that a constitutional amendment would so they passed the 13th amendment to establish that there will be no slavery in the united states anywhere ever the second was the 14th amendment the equal protection clause and the due process clause and the clause says that all persons born in the united states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof shall be american citizens all of that to ensure not only that the freed slaves would be free and they would have equal access to all their rights of citizenship but that their children would also be citizens and that they would have equal protection under the law that was the essence of the 14th amendment we are asked to believe that somehow those who wrote and ratified the 14th amendment in 1868 had secretly put some subtle language into it that they somehow knew we would discover in 2015 that says there shall be same sex marriage in all of america and the supreme court will find it and they will impose it upon the rest of the country because they are the enlightened five of nine in black robes well the supreme court has had a terrible record a terrible record on dealing with large domestic issues in 1857 dred scott they thought they could resolve the slavery issue the supreme court was stacked in favor of the south five from the south and one from pennsylvania that was sympathetic to slavery they had a 63 operation going on and they essentially declared that blacks could not be citizens and they could not be free they could not be citizens and they could not be freed by states and that if a slave owner owned a slave they owned that slave in any state that that individual might go that was the decision of dred scott they thought they had put the issue away it came back to haunt this country over and over again and it was part of the conflict that began in the next decade within 1862 and that brought about the death of 600 000 americans and split this country apart and it has taken years to put us back together the dred scott decision fast forward 100 years they took prayer out of the public schools we honored that decision we stopped praying at least openly in our public schools now the question is can a football team without the coach kneel on the grass and pray before a ball game we are a first amendment country freedom of religion and we are dealing with this kind of assault on free religion because the supreme court in murray v curlett in 1963 dumped that on us 1973 roe v wade and doe v bolton then you have the lawrence v texas decision and it goes on and on and on up to this point the domestic life of america has been dramatically transformed by order of the supreme court the people least connected to the will of the people when they separate themselves from the text of the statute and the text in the understanding of the constitution we are in a place where the supreme court then has put themselves above the law above the constitution and above the will of the people one of the people that understands that as well as anybody in this united states congress is my friend from texas mr

his assistance and collaboration our defense subcommittee conducted 11 formal hearings and had numerous briefings to help shape this legislation these meetings allowed us to look in great detail into our national defense posture and the capabilities of our adversaries and our partners and we are very concerned by what we see over the past several years we have largely focused on the dangers posed by islamic terrorist organizationsal qaeda barbaric isis alnusrah and others they remain a clear and present danger but in recent years new threats have emerged a more aggressive and capable russia an expansionist china emboldened states like iran and rogue nations like north korea at the same time we are dealing with fiscal constraints imposed by sequestration and budget caps so looking today at our department of defense and intelligence community we note that our readiness levels are alarmingly low for our soldiers marines sailors and airmen our decisive technological edge over our adversaries is eroding and our adversaries resolve and their capability are only growing the bill before you begins to reverse these trends by providing more money for national security this measure includes a total of 575 8 billion for the department of defense for functions under our subcommittees jurisdiction and 58 6 billion for overseas contingency operations global war on terrorism funding our recommendation mirrors the funding structure that the house armed services committee and this house approved a few weeks ago and shifts roughly 16 billion from the presidents request for oco operations into critical investments in our personnel training and equipment while providing a bridge fund for our overseas operations through the end of april of 2017 by that time our new commander in chief will be able to assess our defense posture reevaluate readiness levels and recapitalization efforts and request a targeted supplemental to support our troops congress did a similar maneuver in 2008 i am confident that members of this house will work in a bipartisan way to ensure that this essential supplemental appropriations legislation is passed when that time comes rest assured that we will never let our troops down by providing a bridge fund to next april our bill is able to make targeted investments in additional manning for the army marines and air force more training as well as the equipment they rely uponall designed to repair the worrisome readiness gaps we see across our armed forces we currently have the lowest manning level in the army since before world war ii and this legislation boosts army and marine corps end strength despite the secretarys assurances that we are on our way to a 300ship navy we now have 273 in our fleet which is smaller than at any time since before world war i this bill funds a significant increase in shipbuilding our air force is flying the oldest planes in its entire history and the bill before you boosts the modernization of our fighters bombers tankers and other aircraft we are also able to increase funding by 9 6 billion for equipment the service chiefs have requested in their unmet needs list our investments will allow our military services to fully meet critical training requirements such as flying hours steaming days depot maintenance ground training facilities improvement and base operations i also want to note that our legislation again includes 500 million to continue improvements for intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance for our combatant commanders they need it they will welcome it as i close i want to make an observation about this years debate the presidents spokesman and secretary of defense were quick to criticize the funding structure of the national defense authorization bill and indeed this proposal and issued a veto threat against our bill this morning the white house and secretary carter have suggested we are in their own words gambling with our troops mission in the middle east and that our approach is somehow irresponsible or in their own words dangerous but what was really gambling irresponsible and dangerous was the administrations decision to pull all of our troops out of iraq and afghanistanagainst the advice of our military leadershipand not anticipate that the resulting vacuum would be filled by isis the taliban and other terrorist groups what was gambling irresponsible and dangerous wasand isthe constant changing of the military rules of engagement to meet political objectives what was gambling and irresponsible was ousting qadhafi in libya without any plan whatsoever for the aftermath indeed it is gambling irresponsible and dangerous to believe that iran would not violate any aspects of the geneva agreement and surely it was a gamble to believe that the american people would ignore the capture and provocative treatment of 10 american sailors seized by the iranian regime last january and surely it was a gamble that the american people would not pay attention to increased military operations in syria and iraq and yes the tragic deaths of american service personnel if the president refused to call them combat operations there is more happening in the middle east today than the airstrikes against isis and we need to thank those warfighters on the ground that are there as we gather here this afternoon they are risking their lives right nowevery dayand their families are dispirited because their sons and daughters are in combat and do sustain injuries while the administration hides behind semantics of no boots on the ground there are boots on the ground further it was gambling and dangerous to establish a poorly thoughtout and poorly executed train and equip scheme in syria or to conclude that russia and china would not cease their aggressive challenges to american superiority around the world my friends one thing we can all agree upon is that the last 2 years of budget cuts constant deployments and new crises have only eroded our militarys readiness and capabilities the bill before you does not gamble it is highly responsible rather our proposal wisely invests more money for our troops more training for our

immigration and border security subcommittee this is the type of hearing that i have listened to too many times it was one of the hardest hearings i have sat through in my time here in this congress this was a hearing that had witnesses such as sheriff jenkins from frederick county maryland who has been enforcing immigration law and standing up for the rule of law he has been prudently using the legal and justifiable evidence that he had before him and he has been criticized for his effectiveness by the people that dont want to enforce the law he is a good witness sheriff jenkins additionally

schoolhe was about a sophomore in high school or soand hauled outside of town where he was beaten mercilessly and bludgeoned and finally murdered the perpetrator an illegal alien who law enforcement had encountered and released onto the streets of america who had no business being in america in the first place and who law enforcement already had picked up at least oncethis illegal alien beat this boy to death then he went and bought gasoline and burned his body he hauled his body out and poured gasoline on it and burned joshua wilkersons body then he went and took a shower and went to a movie as if it was just another day in the life of well it was another day in the life of america and americans it was another life lost to an illegal criminal alien who was unlawfully present in america and who had no business to be here one who had been encountered by law enforcement officers in the past one whom i believe ice declined to pick up and place into removal proceedings this happens every day in this country it happens hundreds of times in this country each year these incidents of illegal aliens that are arrested and turned loose on the street because the president has this idea of prioritization or prosecutorial discretion are costing lives in america they are costing in the end thousands of lives in america it was a sad sad story told by laura wilkerson yesterday she had the courage and the heart to come here and share her story with us and to place that awful brutal ghastly memory again into her minds eye and pour that forth into the congressional record so that some of us will soak that up and be mobilized to do something more to do something more to resist the presidents policy of amnesty de facto amnesty amnesty by executive edict that has been part and parcel of the obama policy since the beginning of his time here in office and it has been getting worse and worse every month i thank god for laura wilkerson i ask god to bless the life and the memory and the soul of joshua wilkerson who has paid a tremendously high price because we have an ideological president who i would say to the other side of the aisle is not doing his job in fact he is ordering law enforcement officers not to do their job federal law requires that when immigration law enforcement officers encounter an individual who is unlawfully present in the united states he shall be placed in removal proceedings that is the law our border patrol officers are told that if you are here to enforce the law and you are determined to do so you better get yourself another job they have become the welcome wagon on the southern border now most anybody that crosses that border and makes it across the rio grande river or across the land border that stretches from texas all the way across through new mexico arizona california to the pacific ocean knows if you just claim asylum you can be a refugee and this federal government will roll out the welcome wagon former member of congress michele bachmann and i stood on the banks of the rio grande river at roma texas here a summer and a half or so ago and watched as they inflated a raft on the other side of the river two coyotes it was a fairly good size raft they helped a lady into that raft on a sunday afternoon in broad daylight exactly at the shift change for the border patrol they helped a pregnant lady into the raft she had two little bags of her property they brought that raft across the river brought it up to the shoreline under the eyes of the city police and the border patrol but it was shift change one of the coyotes got out of the raft while the other one stabilized it they helped the pregnant lady out of the raft and onto unitedstates shores and then handed her two little ditty bags he then got back into the raft the two coyotes went back across the river deflated the raft folded it up put it in the trunk of their car it was a car that we had watched go around and around over there knowing that it was a coyote car because they recognized it from the unitedstates side of the river the lady stood there she and her unborn baby and her two ditty bags were waiting for the border patrol to show up it takes a little longer during the shift change but they show up no doubt i didnt follow this case any further and they would have preferred that i didnt here is what i will predict happened she applied for asylum the baby is now born and the baby is an american citizen she is the parent of an anchor baby well that is the kind of person that barack obama has granted a de facto at least a temporary amnesty to for the deferred action for parents ofi keep wanting to tell you what that word means to me but the parents of americans is what the president would like to call itdeferred action for parents of americans dapa well i watched one of those parents of americansa parent nowcome across the border in an inflatable raft with two coyotes they got paid something to do that i dont know how much now the president has issued the edict that we grant this de facto permit this amnesty for the parents of anchor babies to be staying free in the united states that suspends the rule of law it defies the rule of law it defies the very law the specified law itself that case was heard before the supreme court this week the question is does the president have prosecutorial authority prosecutorial discretion well the precedents along prosecutorial discretionand i dont know that the supreme court has ever heard and ruled on a case of prosecutorial discretion i believe they have not but the precedents that are out there in the lower courts and the practice has been that if a chief executive officer can project his policy through his subordinates they have to pick and choose which cases they will prosecute well when they do that that is called prosecutorial discretion it has to be on an individual basis only and that is by the words of the former secretary of homeland security janet napolitano who testified before the judiciary committee to that extent in the first morton memo that brought out this prosecutorial discretion it creates four different categories or groups of people so they are utilizing categories or groups of people declaring it to be prosecutorial discretion when in fact it is not prosecutorial discretion because it applies to groups of people it created four different groups of people that is the story of joshua wilkerson the witness sitting next to laura wilkerson is michelle root of modale iowa michelle root is the grieving mother of a 21yearold daughter who was a 4 0 student at bellevue university she wanted to become a law enforcement investigator she had the best grades that you could possibly have living and loving life she had

a 4 0 student with the world ahead of her wanting to contribute to this country to life to society living and loving life her life was abruptly ended by a criminal alien who had been encountered by

ice sent out a letter a yearandahalf ago or so that said ice detainers are a recommendation they are no longer mandatory congress passed a law and directed the department of homeland security to establish the rule that would have the force and effect of law that ice detainers are mandatory they wrote the rule that ice detainers are mandatory and dan ragsdale the interim director of ice issued a letter that said to all local law enforcement no it is a recommendation it is not mandatory now we have in this confused jumbledup mess of the refusal to enforce the law to take care that the laws are faithfully executedwe have the deaths of our childrenour childrenjoshua wilkerson sarah root and while sarah roots mother is in transit to come here to testifyby the way this drunk driving illegal alien homicidal accident that killed sarah root the 4 0 student happenedi keep hearing about the valedictorians that come across the river sarah was very close to being the valedictorian of her college class she didnt get a chance to live and love life beyond 1 day after her graduation while her mother is here with tears in her eyes flying from omaha where this tragedy took place to testify before the united states congress there is another incident in omaha this time a very similar incident another illegal alien who had been incarcerated before or picked up before and released again this illegal alien killed margarito navaluna a 34 or 35yearold man who was walking down the streets of omaha this driver this illegal had three times the blood alcohol content as well as was the driver who killed sarah root now every one of these are preventable they are preventable whether they are a willful homicide or whether they are preventable but these are the cities where the obama administration has released these criminals into they have released over 30 000 of them these are where their reoffenses have taken place in multiple cities around obviously california and on up along the pacific coast where there is a lot of illegal immigration that is where you see a lot of the recidivism crime here is arizona here is texas you have got it in the heart of the heartland though that is colorado over along the east coast something has happened in most of the states and this is because of the prosecutorial discretion this president his administration has released over 30 000 criminals criminal aliens onto the streets of america and of those that they released there have been at least 124 of them who have been charged with homicide for 135 murders that is 135 dead americans who would be alive today if the president didnt have the policy of releasing criminal aliens onto the streets those are the ones we know of those are the ones that are the recidivism within a 5year window of time whose names we know whose incidents we know but that doesnt include anywhere near all of them this is the locale this is the face of one of these perpetrators mauricio hernandez what did he do mauricio hernandez a sexual predator who impregnated the 13yearold daughter of his livein girlfriend and repeatedly had sexual relations with her in ways that i wont repeat here on the floor took her off to soccer games where he also gave her an abortioninducing drug and she went into a portapotty and had a baby who was alive he went in and saw that baby and this girl was then hauled home the baby was left to die that baby died mauricio hernandez was the perpetrator he is another illegal alien another one who had been encountered by law another one who had been granted this de facto amnesty because of the presidents policy i can stand here every night i could come here and give you these stories and i can give you the data on the thousands of americans who are dead at the hands of the criminal aliens who have been incarcerated for a temporary period of time and released by multiple jurisdictions across this country and every american who dies at their hands is a life that could be saved if we just followed our laws that is what is at stake here but we are going to have to personalize it because people over on this side of the aisle have their fingers in their ears on data but when they see the faces when they hear the anguish in the voices especially of the mothersi will conclude with this mr speakeror the voice of the father scott root who said when they arrested this perpetrator who killed his daughter he was out before they could bury his daughter he was out on 5 000 bail which was less than it cost him to bury his daughter and that individual absconded back out of the united states now not to be reached again by the arm of the law which is not long enough because they put him out on bail i dont want to see any more bail to criminal aliens i want to see law enforcement i want an expectation that when the law is broken in the united states that there is going to be an enforcement that it be applied equally without regard to any of these categories that the president encourages us to be members of that being one of gods children is good enough to be protected by the law but everybody treated equally secure our borders restore the respect for the rule of law save these lives send these people into prison and when they are done send them back to the country that they can live in legally for the rest of their lives if they dont stay in our prisons for the rest of their lives this is an infuriating topic that america needs to know a lot more about i would ask that this country keep the families of these victims in their prayers every day until such time as we restore the respect for the rule of law again in america i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.0009268139256164432, 0.0009268139256164432, 0, "it was in the

its flawed waters of the united states regulatory expansion however this week the senate will finally consider rejecting this regulatory overreach while the administration describes their plan as a minor clarification it is in fact the most sweeping expansion of federal regulatory authority in our nations history this map of my home state of california demonstrates exactly how far the epas proposal would reach fully 95 percent of california depicted in black would fall under epas jurisdiction though you will notice that the city of san francisco in white does not that is because san francisco the source of so much of this excessive regulatory mindset long ago paved over every waterway in the city and who knows what is in the runoff rainwater flowing off the streets of that city it isnt just farms that would be hurt by the epas plan virtually every business and homeowner in the state would be faced with regulation at the whim of federal bureaucrats under a rule written to ensure that the epa has any jurisdiction anytime it wants do we really believe the federal government should play a role in local land use decisions even down to whether individual homes could be expanded this is exactly the power the epa claims that it needs dry streambeds manmade ditches even temporary puddles which exist only during rainstorms are all locations over which the epa wishes to claim jurisdiction even imperial county a desert with virtually no natural waterways would fall under the epas control with this plan perhaps the most concerning isnt just that the epa is seeking to expand its authority that is the nature of any bureaucracy and it is to be expected from this administration most concerning is that we cant even trust the epa with authority to regulate navigable waterways it already has or to respect exemptions included in the clean water act in my northern california district residents have experienced regulatory actions so ludicrous that we cant make them up in tehama county a farmer was fined for planting wheat in a manner that the government claimed damaged socalled navigable waters which begs the question anyway what is or what should be determined to be a navigable waterway is it a puddle or is it something you can actually run a boat up and down never mind that the farm i mentioned has been recognized as a wheat allotment by the usda for decades or that the farmer had simply been continuing to farm the land exactly as it has been farmed for generations instead government bureaucrats wanted this activity stopped and they used their power to prevent this farming activity in another instance the government used the clean water act to attack a family farm for shifting to a more efficient irrigation systemyes for shifting to more efficient irrigation system one might think that is a laudable goal especially during a drought period in california in the west but the government claimed this activity would negatively impact the sacramento river which is a full 7 miles away from this farm and unconnected to that farm by any waterway of course in both of these instances the government sanctioned farmers for activities that are clearly exempt under the clean water act as specified by congress who makes the laws even in the epas only early draft they exempted mud puddles but they just couldnt quite leave them out they had to include them as well in their regulation the ongoing efforts of the administration to ignore exemptions for normal farming activities like planting crops and maintaining irrigation systems are in clear violation of the clean water act as written by congress in fact language i sponsored to defund this sort of regulation of exempt activities was passed by both houses last year and signed into law in december yet the epa persists in its illegal activities when congress cant trust federal agencies to judiciously use authority they already hold when we cant trust agencies to follow clear congressional direction how can we possibly consider granting or allowing them even more power it is time the senate joined the house in rolling back this proposal and remind this administration that

would like to commend all of the individuals from the obama administration and their counterparts across the globe for their tireless work in this agreement since the iranian revolution in 1979 this is as close as our country and the international community have come to signing a peace agreement that progress did not come without significant sacrifice of personal and professional time unfortunately i cannot support the joint comprehensive plan of action while i commend all those involved and recognize the importance of a comprehensive nuclear agreement i do not believe in what we are getting over the past 30 years the international community has been subjected to iranian threats and bully behaviors the international community has also had to tolerate irans constant threats to destroy our nation and the state of israel our staunch ally for too long the community of nations has dealt with irans funding of terrorism throughout the middle east and the world i am unable to support a deal that would allow the iranian regime to continue to perpetrate these actions without repercussions it is important to mention that these are not just my beliefs since the announcement in july my office has received hundreds of contacts from constituents opposing the iran agreement in the month of august i held town halls hosted meetings and conducted constituent visits the majority of those interactions affirmed the people in our district do not trust iran the state of israel should not have to worry about more threats and potentially expanded attacks funded by iranian petrodollars the united states shouldnt have to provide relief to a regime that continues to call for our destruction and those of our allies i believe the delay and dismantlement of irans nuclear program is a laudable goal perhaps one of the most important in the world i also believe that we should work to alleviate the pressures and foster the goals of the iranian people the young people in iran are being held accountable for the actions of an autocratic religiouslymotivated panel of leaders however we cannot ignore 30 years of unrelenting threats and condemnable behavior for a decade or less of nuclear concessions in texas perception is often reality and if you are perceived as a bully then youll be treated as one we spent too many years bringing iran to the table through sanctions and
