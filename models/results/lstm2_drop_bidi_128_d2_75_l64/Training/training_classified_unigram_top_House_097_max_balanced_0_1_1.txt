bridge in and over fort point channel in boston mass i would like to thank the distinguished chairman of the water resources subcommittee and the distinguished ranking minority member of the water resources subcommittee for their consideration and efforts on this legislation i have introduced this legislation at the request of the city of boston and since have received letters of support from the mayor of boston the boston redevelopment authority the massachusetts port authority the boston fisheries association the police fire and traffic and parking departments of the city of boston the economic development and industrial corp of boston the massachusetts executive office of transportation and construction and the massachusetts department of public works the fort point channel area is experiencing substantial development pressures i recently read in a boston periodical nothing short of a crippling recession or an atomic war will stop development of the fort point channel much to the credit of the public officils and businesses involved we will see greatly expanded activity in the channel area with projects such as massports third containerport the boston marine industrial park the white fuel depot ther reuse of the boston army base and expansion at the existing containerport it is estimated that with this increase in activity the projected average daily traffic flow will grow from 17 000 vehicles at the present time to an estimated 33 000 in the year 2000 to accommodate this increased commerical traffic and help trucks bypass the south boston residential community the city of boston plans on building a new wide roadway to connect directly with interstate highways crucial to any new connecting road is a new northern avenue bridge the present bridge built in 1907 is in a rapidly deteriorating state and maintenance costs to the city of boston run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars for temporary repairs in addition to the cost of operating a movable span i have also been informed that the bridge must be replaced because of basic engineering facts about the old structure a new fixedspan northern avenue bridge is being requested because if a movable bridge were to be allowed to remain open much of the time truckers and other commercial traffic needing to move their cargo in a timely fashion will continue to avoid the bridge and to find alternative routes going by or through the residential community of south boston the proposed new bridge would have a 15foot clearance at high tide and a 25foot clearance at low tide the great majority of motor boats barges and lobster boats will thus belable to navigate the bridge larger sailboats will not be able to go under at full mast one business the mckie lighter co will be displaced by a new bridge i would like to state that i fully expect the city of boston to accommodate this commercial concern in its effort to relocate to build the bridge and accompanying new road no other business will be displaced as presently proposed the bridge will be constructed on the western shore of a currently unused parcel of land between the hook lobster co and the harborplace office building both of which will remain on the eastern shore the road will go between the neptune lobster co and the victoria station restaurantboth structures will remain the new road will be located on unused land formerly owned by the penn central railroad with this plan both lobster companies which are now located inside of the bridge will be located on the seaside of the bridge i would like to address now how the rest of the channel will be affected i can remember when i was growing up in south boston that fort point channel was active in commercial transportation but asa history of fort point channel by the boston redevelopmenit authority shows the last freighter to use the channel was when the large sugar refining plant located on its banks moved to charlestown in the mid1950s some of the once busy boston wharf company warehouses were razed and made into parking lots and as trucking and air freight out paced rail and shipping the fort point channels advantages as an intermodel distribution i believe the fort point paint was lost channel is a great usable urban relocally other factors contributed source and i also believe that in meetadditionally to the channels decline ing the escalating transportation the mass turnpike and southeast ex needs of this commercially active area pressway made trucking cheaper in it can remain to be so a fixedspan the boston area than rail

this morning to prepare my thoughts a little bit i think i want to get theta in the record this is an opportunity that does not come very often in the house and unfortunately it is a rare opportunity the gentleman from california correctly said this is probably the most important odcasion that we have experienced in many years in this house he and i have been through the battles to get us out of the war in vietnam we went through the impeachment investigation together on the judiciary committee we have dealt with many momentous issues but certainly none are as momentous as this one there have been some brilliant and eloquent statements in this house it is certainly on the most crucial issue ever to face mankind i want to talk about some of the things the facts that have brought us to this point what is the plain stark simple fact behind all of the stockpiles of nuclear warheads the talk of deterrence bargaining chips counterforce first strike capability launch on warn ing window vulnerability nuclear balance megatons war fighting and winning and so forth and so forth what it all adds up to the bottom line is that russia and the united states each has the means in its hands today to destroy all life on this planet it is the only planet we have the only one we know that can sustain life for us and our children and the only one that our children are likely to ever have everything that we and the soviets have done in the last 35 years of mutual deterrence has brought us to this point the people of this country of europe and of the entire world are waking up to the fact that there is something radically wrong with an approach to national security that has produced the greatest insecurity the human race has ever know and the realization is sinking in that merely offering more of the same is not the way out of this nightmare leaving aside the fact that each round of escalation in the arms race brings us and the soviets a quantum leap closer to economic collapse each round also produces a counterresponse by the other side each bargaining chip raises the atte of destructive power each ceiling becomes a floor the situation was aptly summarized recently in a letter to the editor of the washington post which i will read it is short former under secretary of the navy r james woolsey asked if you agree to freeze something before persuading the soviets to reduce what do you use to encourage them to agree to reductions answer you use an offer to reduce of course we will freeze if you will freeze we will reduce if you will reduce the position espoused by mr woolsey and by the current adminstration boils down to this if you will reduce we will freeze if the flaw in this bargaining stance is not obvious one has only to look at what it has achieved thus far a spiraling nuclear arms race that treatens theextinction of humanity people are trying to tell us something and it is very simple it is time to stop more than that it is time to start getting rid of these things that is the simple cogent message behind the wave of popular support for the nuclear arms freeze the people have watched arms control experts negotiate for 20 years and in those years we have seen the development of icbms mirvs cruise missiles neutron warheads and the tenfold multiplication of the numbers of strategic warheads and a vast increase in their accuracy and destructive power in the 1970s the people had a similar simple message on the vietnam war the message was get out of vietnam it took the politicians 5 or 6 years to get the message and the loss of additional thousands of lives but we finally got out the dominoes did not fall and the rest of asia did not go communist indeed we have since been treated to the unedifying but illuminating spectacle of the communists in southeast asia fighting each other today the message the people are sending us on nuclear weapons is equally clear stop making them and start getting rid of them we can debate endlessly whether this or that resolution is the best form the fact is that congress cannot negotiate a weapons freeze or weapons reduction we can tell theexecutive branch however starting with the chief executive to get off his bureaucratic rear and start and we can tell them what goals we expect them to seek the nuclear freeze resolution and the bedell nuclear reduction resolution both do this that is not true however of all of the resolutions that have been put in to try to draw perhaps a red herring across this very issue the military of coiurse are not planning to stop making nuclear weapons quite the opposite they are even talking about making thousands more in the next two decades and are proposing to reprocess all of the wastes from nuclear powerplants to obtain sufficient plutonium to avoid what they foresee as a shortage of weapons grade fissionable materials developing before the end of the century can you believe it you had better believe it because it is going to happen unless somehow this mindless juggernaut is not stopped and dismantled the people believe it i have just received the results of tabulating 7 000 replies that i have received from con stituents who returned my annual questionnaire sent to every household in my district in response to the question do you favor a freeze on the production and testing of new nuclear weapons by the united states and the unitedstatess r 80 percent four out of every five respondents answered yes something is happening out there i would say to my colleagues you and i know it i suspect that it has even pen etrated the white house are those folks out there going to settle for some more rhetoric from the president saying that he is for strategic arms reduction i do not think so they heard him say that 6 months ago they now demand something more than talk something more than resolutions even they want negotiations and the want either results or convincing proof that no results are possible are people naive in thinking that negotiations with the soviets will produce any serious deescalation of the nuclear arms race clearly not until and unless negotiations have been tried and they have every reason to believe that the russian people have an interest in surviving equal to our own and that the soviet leaders have an interest in the survival of their people as well as themselves if i may slightly paraphrase some famous lines of shakespeares merchant of venice hath not a russian eyes hath not a russian hands organs dimensions senses afifections passions fed with the same food hurt with the same weapons subject to the same diseases healed by the same means warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as an american is if you prick them do they not bleed if you tickle them do they not laugh if you poison them do they not die what are some of the facts about nuclear warfare to which the soviet leadership and undoubtedly the soviet people have been exposed to let me start first with a few excerpts from an official unclassified unitedstates government study arms control and disarmament agency civil defense study report no 5 entitled an assessment of frequently neglected effects in nuclear attacks it is dated april 19 1978 let met just read the deterrent effect of a threatened unitedstates retaliation against the ussr depends on soviet leaders perception of the combined effects of our attack and not merely on fatalities military damage or industrial damage taken alone there are other consequences of nuclear attack that are scientifically well established even though our usual analyses do not attempt to quantify them these need to be taken into account in any realistic civil defense and economic recovery planning to the extent that these problems are known to soviet planners they are likely to add to the deterrent effects of the unitedstates strategic capability this paper provides a brief survey of some of the important ef march 310 1982 fi 1276 fects that are normally overlooked in damage assessment calculations the first item climatic changes and ultraviolet burning it is likely that a fullscale nuclear war in 1985 would result in severe ultraviolet burning in the northern hemisphere for several years after the war this burning would be due to depletion of the ozone layer longer lasting climatic changes are also possible we estimate that at its worst the burning would cause blistering burns after one hour of exposure in northern temperate latitudes with similarly severe damage to livestock and crops such levels of ultraviolet radiation could effectively prevent daytime outside work for several years and would destroy all but the most resistant crops and farm animals as a matter of factand this is an aside it is not in this reportbiologists have since stated that a 20percent increase in ultraviolet radiation will blind all exposed animals and insects which means they will all die and if all of the insects die there will be no pollination of the plants and if the plants die we will not eat in fact the report goes on as follows climatic changes which would upset agricultural patterns could occur and last beyond the 5 to 9 years of ultraviolet burning while a great deal of uncertainty exists in the estimation of effects of a major nuclear war on the ozone layer the consequences of ozone depletion are of such immense importance that they must be taken into account from the points of view of civil defense and nuclear deterrence and i might add that i have discussed this with the air force with people who are the experts on nuclear warfare and they confirm the accuracy of this study i am now going to read from one other part of the study the nas study points out that the worst case of 70 ozone decrease one year after the attack would cause blistering sunburn after 10 minutes exposure in temperate latitudes the more probable lowering of 50 as a result of a nuclear war with predicted 1985 unitedstates and soviet forces would cause blistering after about 1 hour of exposure this leads to the conclusion that outside daytime work in the northern hemisphere would require complete covering by protective clothing for about 3 years after the war and this is the entire northern hemisphere not just the united states or the soviet union it would be very difficult to grow many if any food crops and livestock would have to graze at dusk if there were any grass to eat even if the ozone depletion only reached the best expected case of 2530 reduction the effect on post war recovery operations is difficult to imagine the likelihood that ultraviolet burning of forests and grass lands would alter climatic patterns cannot be neglected if possible longterm worldwide temperature changes were also caused by the changes in the stratosphere new agricultural patterns would have to be developed in examining the problem the nas study group noted a 3 c cooling would shorten the growing season and move the northern limit of the corn belt to southern iowa a 1 c cooling would eliminate commercial wheat growing ir canada now the report goes on to talk a bout some other things that the oviet leaders would have to take into account the next heading is destruction of housing i am now reading destruction of housing the unitedstates retaliation in 1985 is estimated to destroy between 75 and 85 of soviet urban housing because of blast and fires which would spread over entire city blocks in most cases the fires could not be fought because of radioactivity lack of water because of damage to the water system and continuing attacks we do not expect fire storms to start this large loss of urban housing would make it difficult if not impossible for survivors to return to rebuild industrial areas for a substantial period the next item is medical care the shortage or unavailability of postattack medical care would result in a substantial increase in deaths over the usually estimated prompt fatalities and many survivors would be crippled or incapacitated for lack of prompt care about 80 to 90 of urban hospitals would be destroyed because they are located near industrial installations disease would increase but perhaps to a level much worse than in world war i they are speaking of russia of course i the next item food and water supplies this analysis indicates that at least 60 days supplies should be stored near or in shelters and camps because destruction and radioactive contamination of transportation centers would restrict movement of food after an attack this is more than many earlier studies recommend and would be an expensive and visible preparation for war the next item fallout shelter effectiveness when allowance is made for the eventual need of shelter occupants to leave and begin work outsidethat is after the attack of course only the best combinations of shelters and behavioral patterns are good enough to prevent illness in most urban areas and then only if they are well provided so occupants can stay inside for all of the first month from 20 to 30 of occupants of basement and improved basement shelters in rural areas will suffer sickness or worse the next item agriculture and food supplics avoidance of radioactive food and water contamination would require monitoring of supplies for decades and finally combination of effects analysis of the expected consequences of nuclear war such as fatalities industrial damage environmental damage destruction of housing transportation and agriculture does not express the consequences of combined effects as examples the destruction of buildings and housing combined with radioactive contamination and severe ultraviolet radiation would make reconstruction activity very difficult and dangerous the destruction of transport equipment electrical power and oil refineries combined with maldistribution of food supplies and the likelihood of crop failures for years after an attackand i would like to repeat that for years after an attack would make survival a fulltime occupation for most one can conclude from these analyses that while some civil defense activities such as evacuation could increase the number of people who would survive the immediate effects of an attack the long term benefits have not been established that has to be the most understated laid back conclusion from a truly devastating analysis and in the face of all that the administration has the audacity to propose a 4 billion program for evacuation of people from our urban centers and target areas in the event of an international crisis and i might add the emergency administration says 8 days notice would be required what those eacuees would go back to assuming they survived at all is a good question now the only trouble with this arms control and disarmament agency report is that it is too abstract being prepared by strategic planners dealing in statistical rather than human beings and it may well be too conservative let me read you a couple of excerpts from a recent article bydr helen caldicott president of the group known as physicians for social responsibility in boston the article is entitled the last epidemic i will just read a couple of excerpts from it first of all with respect to fallout she brings out the fact that survivors at a great distance from a blast will be exposed to continuing fallout averaging 100 rems in 96 hours she adds that an expert at mit henry kendall points out that in a 10 000 megaton nuclear warbear in mind that that is within the capability of the soviet union and the united statesin which 5 000 tons of bombs are dropped on each of the two superpowers as much as 90 percent of the american population could be dead in 30 days the proposed use of counterforce weapons would alter these radiological consequences by orders of magnitude a firststrike nuclear war could create sufficient fallout to kill every person on the planet within weeks to months she then goes on and discusses the public health aspects and the medical aspects of widespread destruction she says this and it is unpleasant but let us face it millions of rotting corpses particularly in hot wqather will cause radiationresistant strains of bacteria fungi and viruses to multiply and mutateeven to become more virulent insects such as cockroaches and flies which are thousands of times more resistant to radiation than humans also will multiply while their natural predators such as birds will perish the insect population will enlarge rapidly and spread swiftly into areas beyond the blast site eating crops and spreading uncontrollable infestation leading eventually to epidemics of such dis eases as plague hepatitis polio encephalitis typhoid and dysentery because most large medical facilities tend to be located in the centers of metropolitan areas the majority of medical personnel will be dead or injured those who manage mhrch 30 1982 co to escape unharmed will have no drugs or equipment to treat the injured since these will have been destroyed then she talks aliout the ecological effects she says it must be emphasized however that unlike the effects of a conventional war which can be ieversed to a large extent over a foreseeable period of reconstruction many of the effects of a nuclear war may remain irreversible for generrulons this is because they may set off a chain of ecological events that would be extremely difficult to control in the best of circumstances and prove nearly impossible to correct under the primitive conditions that would follow a nuclear conflict a national academy of sciences study conducted in 1975 estimates that if 10 percent of the superpowers nuclear arsenals were used 30 to 70 percent of the ozone layer in the northern hemisphere and 20 to 40 percent in the southern hemisphere would be depleted by the reaction of huge quantities of nitrous oxide generated by the explosions with stratospheric ozone well i have already read some of the other aspects of that and she merely repeats what was the arms control and disarmament agencys study and she ends in this manner she says in his essay in a dark time the final epidemic 1981 robert jay ufton a psychiatrist at yale university has noted a critical difference between thebombings of hiroshima and nagasaki and any presentday nuclear conflictone that goes beyond the oftremarkedupon fact that the bombs dropped in 1945 were only a fraction as pow erful as those that might be used today after those bombings and the initial horror what became crucial to the psychological as well as the physical survival of the citizens of those cities was the knowledge that a world existed outside the disaster area doctors medical supplies food clothing today given the sophisticated weaponry with which we have equipped ourselves and the inevitability that a smallscale conflagration would escalate into a massive holocaust nothing but an unanswering wasteland would remain that is the end of her article any of you who have met her in person or heard her speak can only testify to the eloquence and the conviction to which this doctor whose whole profession is saving lives and healing brings to this subject perhaps the entire situation was best summed up by a bumper sticker that our colleague the gentlewoman from colorado told mie she recently saw in colorado it said this if you have seen one nuclear war you have seen them all my friends and colleagues i would like to read three sentences from another article that dr caldicott read she says we will either live together or die together and if you look at it what is our responsibility toward evolution to continue this beautiful life process it is a beautiful planet maybe the only life in the whole universe and i refuse to believe we are silly enough to destroy it a couple of weekends ago the weekend of march 19 to 20 there were human survival conferences held in cleveland akron canton and youngstown ohio they attracted a tremendous interest i attended the one in akron one of the speakers a child guidance counselor joanna rogers macy said this every generation has lived with a certainty that other generations would follow them until our generation at that conference a group of talented young people in a church group presented an exceptionally creative musical a musical they themselves had written both the lyrics and the script and the music and it was about the fantastic world of the nuclear arms race and it was named quite appropriately as a parody of alice in wonderland it was called alice in blunderland i would like to read all of the lyrics but i will not i just want to read two stanzas of one of the songs entitled the last protest song it went like this in god we trust to guide the mechanics with our cars and we trust those men in government to have greater minds than ours and if we all play loud enough we wont hear the storm clouds call and we can leave them to our children if we leave a world at all in the race to armageddon the chaser is the chased when humanity stands naked on the earth he laid to waste of the cause and the victors perhaps someone will recall and leave the message to our children if there is a child at all"], [0.00016701221466064453, 0.9998329877853394, 1, "so i am asking if there is any compassion left in this rather

assigned to the committee on banking and therefore have served my entire period as a representative from the 20th district of texas as a member of the standing committee known now as the committee on banking finance and urban affairs but which historically had been known as the committee on banking and currency at this point i would like to kind of bring up something that is very timely because of the action yesterday in the approval of the tax bill the president urged and the leaders of the congress accepted the argument that this tax bill was absolutely necessary in order to prevent the catastrophe of a record deficit for the government and the people and that therefore it would be a necessary implementation to reduce interest rates we were told repeatedly all during yesterdays debate and before that through television radio through presidential lobbying through leadership of both parties lobbying that the adoption of the tax bill would lead to lower interest rates this is nothing but pure undiluted hokum interest rates started climbing before the tax bill and there were two basic reasons which i have ad nauseam repeated one business conditions economic conditions are simply horrible they are terrible second the federal reserve modified changed its policy i must recall to the members that i have said for years that i was completely demoralized by the lack of knowledge both on the congressional level as well as out generally the lack of perception on the part of the leading main economists that paraded before the committee as witnesses the lack of accountability and also the enshroudment in obfuscation double talk on the part of the federal reserve chairman and board members that have appeared through the course of these 201 years before the committee everyone acting as if it was an act of god why it is the profligate congresses the spenders that have brought us to this pass and that is why interest rates are high but all of a sudden they find this as the most plausible reason for high interest rates when all along they have said oh no there is nothing you can do about it nothing the fed can do about it nothing the government can do about it it is kind of like an act of god interestingly enough in a big lead article in the washington post in the outlook section of sunday last august 15 there is a lead article by the eminent economist james tobin and it is entitled stop volcker from killing the economy now when i said that for years i was labeled as sort of a kook or somebody that had a dagger out for the banking system and the federal reserve and all the time all i was trying to say was that such things as interest rates such things as monetary policy were not acts of god they were decisions made by men and problems created by men and therefore certainly susceptible to solutions made by men and women now comes this eminent economist and look at the words he uses for the first time they borrow a phrase i have been using for 20 years when i said interest rates are not an act of god and that is exactly what mr tobin says he says interest rates are not acts of god they are the direct result of the federal reserve monetary policy i would like to offer that article for the record at this point because i think it is unfortunately too late stop volcker from killing the econo"], [0.00017827749252319336,

some of mr washingtons reproach there a suggestion that more is necessary the administration has talked a lot about agricultural development under the plan but the journal found it a panamabased business consultant who concluded that the only way these nations have it of their current difficulties is to expand t~hrough assemblytype industriesalong the lines of taiwan they assemble everything from ships to chips in taiwan labor intensive capital intensive and in the united states unemployment intensive is one likely result the list of worthy exemptions according to what i read is growing so long that only these things will remain steel too should be exempt but i realize the concern of the committee is with appropriations on this i have opinions less equivocal than those i have just shared as i understood the administrations explanation of the initiative there is a call for 1 5 billion in direct economic assistance this year and next of this they want to spend 816 million on economic support funds economic support funds the administration said would be used primarily to finance private sector imports while facilitating increased domestic production and employment the administration wants this assistance to have the greatest possible impact on local production and employment were i a member of this committee i would move and vote for zero funding and i urge it but if you cannot do that put as many strings around this gift of american jobs as you can if they are going to import with our money and you feel they must be given the money give them also a provision that says the imports will come from the united states make no exemption from this except for things we do not sell this 816 million is a little over 10 percent of the nearly dead plan for private capital investment in the disintegrating american steel industry provide if possible that it cannot be used in connection with any enterprise sending steel here forbid using it in any venture that would send here a product made in the united states if imports of that product from other nations account for 10 percent more of the american market i chose 10 percent because it is the amount of the tithe prescribed for the church and all its good works choose another figure if you like but make it fair the theme in these suggestions is this where possible search for ways to set right and true and square any distortions that would attempt to transform the principle of comparative advantage into the idea of advantage any way you can get it if this were a domestic program it would be rightfully scorned and ridiculed as the most grossly bloated entitlement ever devised i think it is subject to more abuse than we have yet seen furthermore it gives these two dozen nations virtually all the economic rights ac corded to states of the union under the constitution and it gives the states unemployment yet some of these nations are hardly as large as big counties and congressional districts it mixes our politics with our commerce and it mixes them badly dangerously in a manner that is volatile all nations and 11 cultures have proverbs and i will submit to the committee a saying

nasa authorization bill h r 5890 i want to congratulate the honorable don fuqua of florida chairman of the committee on science and technology and the honorable ronnie flippo of alabama chairman of the subcommittee on space science and applications and the honorable dan glickman chairman of transportation aviation and materials subcommittee for bringing this bill to the floor i also want to thank the minority under the leadership of the honorable larry winn of kansas at the full committee level and the honorable harold hollenbeck of new jersey and barry goldwater of california at the subcommittee level for their assistance and cooperation in getting the best bill that we could under the circumstances what are these circumstances that make it so difficult to bring forward a very good bill as i see them they are first the lack of a coherent space policy which of course means a lack of leadership and second as everyone knows we are faced with a very restrictive very constrained budget situation in fact with respect to nasa and our space program the constrained budget situation is merely the other side of the coinour lack of a space policy when we do not have a space policy then the budget policy drives decisions and in this year the policy is to ut the budget having congratulated the committee leadership for bringing this bill forward i want to make it clear that personally i would very much like to have more resources in the fiscal year 1983 budget for nasa further if the administration does not intend to provide the kind of space policy and space leadership that has been evident in the pastthen it is up to the congress to move forward and c bitsh a policy i commend subcommnittee chairman ronnie flippo for holding hearings last fall on the future of our space p agram this was a first step toward developing a longrange policy much of the testimony presented in that hearing corroborated my belief that we need longterm goals if we are to have an efficient and effective program only when we have reviewed and reaffirmed our policies and have them cleari in mind can we decide the best course of action to achieve the progress which we all want now would like to describe a few specific ways in which the lack of a civilian space policy in the face of a constrained budget situation affects both programs and the resources needed to carry them out a prime example is the militarization of the space program it is clear that we are iacing a policy vatuum in the civilian areas and also a demand for greater and greater military capability because of these two factors the civilian space program is being taken over by the military for example the general accounting office has reported that 20 percent of nasas budget for fiscal year 1983 is in direct support of the military this is over 1 billion which should be counted as an addition to the military budget but which is being brought forward under the guise of supporting a civilian space program i want to assure the members that if this billion dollars were spent on truly civilian space programs we could fund a strong program of planetary exploration a strong program of astronomy and astrophysics and a strong program of aeronautics and space applications which we could expect to return economic and social dividends in the ery near future the planetary program provides an example of what could be done but is not there is only one planetary project in developmentthe galileo mission to jupiter which would send a spacecraft to that planet with an orbiter and a probe no other missions are in development which virtually guarantees u large gap in our planetary program in the future further although galileo development is funded2 in the budget submitted by the administration the science and engineering support provided to that project would be cut fortunately the bill before us today would add 23 million back to the planetary program and would restore among n er things some of the science and engineering support needed by galileo the planetary program was impacted severely by the cancellation of the venus orbiting imaging radar voir mission in the 1983 budget further cuts in the budget proposed by the administration would cause existing functioning spacecraft to be turned off in particular pioneers 6 7 8 and 9 which are in orbit around the sun and returning useful data would be turned off pioneers 10 and 11 which have gone past saturn and jupiter and are now speeding out of the solar system would be turned off the pioneer venus spacecraft still returning useful data in orbit around the planet venus would be turned off the mars viking lander would be turned off funds available to university researchers to analyze data would be reduced by about 50 percent the infrared telescope facility in hawaii would be shut down the lunar curatoral facility in texas would be shut down the supporting research program would be reduced by about 50 percent from all of this it should be clear that the budget submitted by the administration was basically a going out of business budget for the planetary program the 23 million that the committee would add back to this budget would mitigate these reductions and keep the planetary program alive unfortunately a great deal more money needs to be added to make the program truly vigorous as it has been in the past title ii of the bill would authorize the national oceanic and atmospheric administration to operate the landsat program and would authorize 15 millon for this purpose for fiscal year 1983 landsat which is a program of land remote sensing is the fruit of earlier nasa applications work now that the program is able to become operational it is being transferred to noaa the agency which has been running our weather satellite program for about 20 years the administration has proposed that the landsat program be transferred to the private sector as soon as possible despite the obvious lack of a market which would support a commercial operation at this time the problem is that there is simply no remote sensing industry to take over this system in other words the land remote sensing situation is not analogous to the communications satellite situation in that earlier case the governmentdeveloped satellite communication technology was handed off to private industry but there existed at the time a massive communications industry which took over and supported the communications satellite systems since there is clearly no possibility of commercialization of land remote sensing at the present it would appear that the transfer to the private sector is being pushed for purely budgetary and ideological reasons the landsat program represents a significant national capability and has the potential for contributing to our national wealth i am very concerned that this capability and potential may be lost through hasty actions inspired by shortterm budgetary considerations in the long term it is probably important to take advantage of the creativity and entrepreneurship of the private sector in order to maxiize the application of land remote sensing but this transfer must be done in such a way as to protect the overall national interest in other words it would require careful consideration of many factors taxpayers have put a great deal of money into developing this capability and i am sure that we do not want to throw it away just because we are in a tight budget year and because we lack a guiding space policy as a final example of how the lack of coherent policy makes for inefficiency and makes tight budget problems even worse let me mention the agency flipflop with respect to upper stages the inertial upper stage ius and the centaur have been offagain onagain as upper stages for the last 3 years at least the changes in preferred upper stage have caused changes and therefore significant major costs in the mission such as galileo and ispm that need to fly on these upper stages thus the lack of policy causes program impacts and once again we see an interaction between budget and policy considerations i want to reiterate that i support this bill even though i have pointed out a great many weaknesses that i see in the programs which it would fund i hope that we can do better in future years but for now we must move ahead as best we can"], [0.0001919865608215332, 0.9998080134391785, 1, "during the recess my home community of riverdale n y lost one of its most admired and beloved citizens david a stein the founder and for

much i extend to his wonderful helpmeet celia and to his two sons bernard and richard now copublishers of the riverdale press deepest sympathy david stein was born in cleveland ohio on june 23 1910 the son of russian jewish immigrants he decided at the age of 12 to be a newspaperman during a stint as a copy boy on the cleveland press growing up in poverty he overrode his fathers opposition to attend college supporting himself as an undergraduate at ohio university in athens ohio by slinging hash and playing drums in the orchestra of a fraternity brother sammy kaye at ohio university he edited the college newspaper it won an award as ohios best but when mr stein graduated in the midst of the depression he was unable to find a job as a newsman so he took a job selling classified advertising for the niles ohio daily times he said he learned the real craft of the journalist there and at the small oirard ohio news where he finally found work as a reporter editor advertising man and janitor he and one office worker put out the 12page weekly newspaper eventually he became managing editor of nea feature service of the scrippshoward organization in cleveland he was transferred in new york as managing editor of the headquarters bureau in 1944 and moved then to the riverdale apartment where he lived the rest of his life after leaving nea he headed his own public relations firm which coordinated publicity for hervert lehmans successful senatorial campaign against john foster dulles and for the mayors committee for new yorks golden anniversary to that period belonged

when he founded the riverdale press in 1979 he retired as publisher of the press turning the papers direction over to his sons but although a cardiac condition slowed him down he never stopped contributing to the paper mr stein was the recipient of countless awards and honors singly or together with his wife and copublisher celia in 1980 manhattan college conferred honorary doctor of law degrees on mr and mrs stein for their service to the community as publishers of the press in 1981 neighborhood house presented the steins with a special good neighbor award making them the only people in the organizations history to win the award twice when the united nations association gave mr stein that organizations award then secretarygeneral uthant made the presentation the riverdale community council honored mr and mrs stein as riverdalians of the year in 1968 he and the paper received citations from three mayors four borough presidents the new york city council and the state legislature as well as from numeroui community organizations and institutions that were helped by the press mr stein was a founding member of riverdale temple past president of the new york press association and founder and past presidnet of the riverdale kiwants club he was on the board of directors of the bronx chamber of commerce the bronx historical society and the bronx society of arts and letters and a leader in many other community organizations he was a member of sigma delta chi the professional journalism fraternity and interamerican press where he served on the freedom of

did and that was contagioushis caring strengthened the glue that holds riverdale together riverdale is sul generts it is a blessed habitat without a government of its own part of a crazy quilt pattern of county city state and federal voting constituencies what makes riverdale more than just a fancy mailing address is a weekly country newspaper that david and celia stein conceived three decades ago they made a difference riverdale fieldston kingsbridge marble hill spuyten duyvil often with diverse interest were stitched together not by some kind of political force but by a newspaper the riverdale press there is something uniquely american about country editors even when their beat is part of the greatest city in the world that sage from kansas william allen white the quintessential country editor of the emporia gazette believed that responsibility is a wine press that brings forth strange juices out of men in his first editorial white laid down a credo that could have been david steins the new editor hopes to live here until he is the old editor until some of his visions which rise above him as he dreams come true david stein was a poor boy from cleveland educated in athens ohio who came to gotham to work for the associated press he had dreams and visions of saving the magnificent craggy shoreline of the hudson river the verdant woods playing fields and lakes of van cortlandt park and the wooded enclaves of onefamily homes from being overwhelmed by what he called the developers of canyons of stone david stein launched a crusade to rid the henry hudson parkway of

elizabeth day and trustees kerryn king and sidney gamble in 1950 when there were only some 3 000 families in greater riverdale neighborhood house was experimenting with a monthly official house organ it was as good as amateurs could make it but its future was bleak kerryn king recruited stein to professionalize the neighborhood news from this grew the concept to found a regular riverdale weekly originally dave thought he could stay at the a p and as he phrased it run the paper with my left hand and the aid of volunteers well it didnt work out quite that way riverdale desperately needed its

honor of the 250th anniversary of george washingtons birth in 1982 i wish to commend my distinguished colleague the gentleman from georgia for originating the legislation the gentleman from georgia has been most helpful in passing this legislation through the subcommittee and the full committee he is a dedicated devoted and hardworking member of the banking committee i want to publicly express my appreciation to him for all of his outstanding cooperation on behalf of this legislation it is nearly beyond belief that this one man george washington performed so many crucial roles in founding this great nation as commander in chief he led our troops in the fight for independence as statesman he presided over the constitutional convention as the first president he organized the new government he did all of this out of a sense of duty and love for his country even though it worked great personal and finantal hardship upon him this bill would authorize the minting of up to 10 million 90 percent silver half dollars in his honor the coins would be sold to the public in 1982 and 1983 at a price equal to the cost of their manufacture and distribution plus a 20percent surcharge that surcharge would be used solely to repay the national debt this bill honors washington not only by its issuance of this coin but also because it is fiscally responsible as military commander and later as president washington faced and surmounted severe budgetary and financial problems he knew the necessity for fiscally sound programs by requiring that money from the sale of these coins be used to reduce the national debt these coins will follow washingtons example of fiscal responsibility while the purpose of this legislation is indeed to honor the father of our country who was a hero of the revolutionary war there is another aspect of the legislation that is also important i am today declaring war on the national debt because it has reached a point where interest on the national debt is rapidly approaching 10 percent of our annual budget in the 10 years from 1970 to 1980 the national debt has increased 139 percent and from 1975 to 1980 the debt increased by 68 percent in pocketbook talk that means that in the last 10 years american taxpayers have handed out more than 293 billion just to pay the interest on the national debt while i realize that the 10 to 15 million that will be realize from the sale of the washington silver half dollars is a small amount compared to the size of the national debt it is nevertheless a beginning there are substantial and immediate savings that can be made by reducing the national debt for example 90 million will be saved for every 1 billion reduction of the national debt and for every 10 billion that it is reduced there will be a 900 million savings these figures assumed an annual average interest rate of 9 percent and with interest rates currently on the rise a debt reduction could result in even a more substantial savings from now on every time there is a bill brought before this house that will result in income directly to the united states i will offer an amendment to require that such income be used in reducing the national debt in the present congress we have heard much talk about reducing government spending but nothing about reducing the size of the national debt if we pursue both courses together we can bring inflation under control in a far quicker manner for too long the national debt has been like the weathereverybody talks about it but nobody does anything about it we cannot change the weather but we certainly can change the size of the national debt and that is going to be my no 1 priority from now on the following chart indicates exactly how the national debt is the tail that wags our economic dog i am not going to stand here today and recite all of the figures in the chart but i would suggest that there is enough material in this chart to convince every member of this body that we have to do something to bring the national debt under control"], [0.9992051241570152, 0.0007948758429847658, 1, "i would like to talk about the budget and where we are and what we agree on and what we do not agree on i think it is pretty clear if you listen to the people who have spoken here today and i predict it will be true for those who speak here tomorrow and during the debate on the amendments that we all agree that something has got to be done about the deficit something has got to be done to reduce the amount of national income being absorbed by government something has go to be done to reduce interest rates by reducing the amount of money that the federal government borrows but i also assert that when you get beyond that basic agreement fundamental differences that divide this house and divide this country become very clear in the major budget substitutes that will be voted on next week there are clear differences as to how we achieve those goals i would like very briefly to take the budget which was reported by the house budget committee and compare it to the bipartisan recovery budget which will be offered by the gentleman from ohio on behalf of the republicans and the conservative democrats who seek to control the deficit by controling spending i would like also to compare based on tentative data the budget that will be offered by the gentleman from ohio on behalf of himself and conservative democrats to the socalled coalition budget which will be offered by the gentleman from wisconsin i think when you look at these comparisons you will see very clearly what the choices are before the house if you take the data contained in the vehicle reported by the house budget committee you can break the basic policy changes into five different areas what we do about nondefense discretionary what we do about targeted entitlements what we do about other spending reductions what we do about defense and what we do about taxes we are going to hear a lot of discussion in this budget debate about economic assumptions as we did in the last but what is relevant is not what we assume about the world but what we do about the realitics that we face i think in looking at what we do in these five functional categories you will clearly see the difference in the area of nondefense discretionary the bipartisan recovery budget cuts nondefense discretionary spending 72 percent more than the jones house budget committee vehicle over the period 1983 to 1985 in the area of targeted entitlements the only section other than revenues that will be reconciled that committees will be forced to make changes in under the reconciliation process the bipartisan recovery budget cuts targeted entitlements 139 percent more than the jones house budget committee budget over the 3year period in the area of other spending reductions the bipartisan recovery budget reduces other spending 489 percent more than the house budget committee in the area of defense the jones house budget committee budget cuts defense 69 percent more than the bipartisan recovery budget in the area of taxes the jones house budget committee budget raises taxes by 55 percent more than the bipartisan recovery budget and in the end achieves the same bottom line basically these differences are repeated when you compare the aspin coalition budget and the bipartisan recovery budget that will be offered here if we look at nondefense discretionary and other spending reductions the bipartisan recovery budget cuts nondefense discretionary spending 62 percent more than the aspin coalition budget over the 3 years that the budget is in force in targeted entitlements the bipartisan recovery budget cuts targeted entitlements 119 percent more than the aspin coalition substitute in defense excluding pay the aspin coalition budget cuts defense 83 percent more than the bipartisan recovery budget in the area of taxes the aspin coalition budget raises taxes by 42 percent more than the bipartisan recovery budget over 3 years o 1640 my point in making these comparisons is this the house next week is going to have to choose between two real options one option is embodied in the budget presented by the house budget committee and slightly modified in the coalition aspin substitute that option says let us raise taxes and slash defense so that we can continue spending as usual in washington the real alternative is the bipartisan recovery budget which says let us focus our attention on spend ing so that we can meet our legitimate defense needs and so that we can let the american people keep more of what they earn those are the options that we must choose between do we want to raise taxes and slash de fense to continue spending or do we want to control spending so that we can meet our legitimate defense needs and let the american people keep more money in their pockets to provide positive incentive for people to work save and invest those who have talked about how much trouble the economy is in would have ns deal with those economic problems be raising taxes and by increasing spendng i believe that those are the policies that brought us to this sorry state and i do not believe that going back to the policies of the 1960s and 1970s will solve our problems i think it is important that we pass a budget that gains control of spending and gains control of the deficit that puts strong downward pressure on interest rates but i think the focus has got to be on the problem and the problem is spending taxes were doubled over the last 6 years and yet the deficit grew every year our problem is not inadequate taxes our problem is excessive spending in the bipartisan recovery budget we have an opportunity to do something about that excessive spending so i hope that we will have a good debate in which everyone will look at the issues what do we do about domestic nondefense spending what do we do about meeting the legitimate defense needs of our nation how much burden do we place on the shoulders of the working men and women in america in those three areas the differences among these budgets will be very clear i would like to make one additional point and that is that we have heard and we will hear a lot of talk about equity are cuts fair do we treat entitlement and discretionary programs fairly in terms of choosing where to make reductions but i would submit to my colleagues that there is another issue of fairness and that issue has to do with taxes how much burden are we going to put on those who are pulling the wagon as well as the burden that we are going to put on those who are riding in the wagon and in the ultimate fairness test by controlling the growth of taxes and focusing revenue increases on reducing the deficit rather than increasing taxes to go on spending i believe the ultimate fairness issue is going to be settled on the side of the bipartisan recovery budget may 2l 1982 so i look forward to the debate and i believe when the american people look at the three choices when our colleagues look at these three areas of difference in defense in nondefense domestic spending and in taxes i believe

reason i am reading this statement is that i want to be sure that members have some awareness of the complications we face in pursuing the legislative process this year i am aware that there is a significant number of members without regard to party who are not the least bit interested in process but we are going to operate this year under a very difficult set of circumstances and this rule is a good illustration of how difficult those circumstances are and probably will be house resolution 461 is an unusual rule it is complex it is necessarily complex because it is structured to unravel a very difficult parliamentary situation so that the house may proceed to consider h r 5922 an urgent supplemental appropriations bill for fiscal year 1982 in something of an orderly fashion as my colleagues are aware house resolution 415 a rule making in order h r 5922 was adopted on thursday last that rule was brought up under a special provision of the house rules that allows any member of the committee on rules to call up a rule as a matter of privilege after it has been on the calendar for 7 legislative days that is a perfectly valid rule of the house those employing it however failed to take into account the changed circumstances with which the house was confronted the urgent supplemental bill was reported from the committee on appropriations on march 23 the rule was reported on march 30 the house did not take up the bill prior to the district work period because we were told that the other body would not consider the measure until after the recess during the work period and subsequently both houses of congress waited while their representatives attempted to reach a budget compromise with the president that effort failed but in the interim the clock continued to tick the need for urgent supplemental appropriations for some programs became critical others moved from a priority phase to urgent the administration too recognized this shift as attested to by a statement of administration policy issued on april 30 which indicated support for five items in the bill which the administration hart not previously supported totaling some 32 5 million with a request for a higher level of funding for the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms than the bill contained and an additional request for some 20 2 million for the cab for payments t0 air carriers which the bill did not address at all on the very day that the rule was called up and as a matter of fact on my way to the floor to respond to that action i discovered that the chairman of the committee on appropriations was urging by letter that the rules committee review house resolution 415 and grant additional waivers that had not been granted in that rule obviously circumstances had changed but again quite obviously not everyone was aware of that fact on thursday we were confronted with an attempt at to present the house with a fait accompli that would have allowed the house to get only halfway to where it needed to go it seemed the wiser course to pass house resolution 415 thus thwarting those who would distort the process further and giving time to assess the situation while perhaps cooler heads prevailed it was apparent however that some modification of house resolution 415 would be necessary house resolution 461 is that necessary modification of the earlier rule briefly let me explain the provisions of the rule the rule modifies certain provisions of house resolution 415 for instance the waiver of section 311 of the budget act against initial consideration of h r 5922 would stand but the first proviso would not apply that provision allowed points of order pursuant to section 311 to be made against specified paragraphs of h r 5922 and if such points of order were sustained the paragraph would be stricken from the bill this modification of the rule has the effect of retaining the waiver against the congideration of h r 5922 but eliminating the possibility of any point of order on a specific paragraph in other words if house resolution 461 is adopted no point of order pursuant to section 311 of the budget act can be made against the consideration of h r 5922 or any portion thereof as members will recall section 311 of the budget act prohibits consideration of any bill amendment or conference report providing new budget or spending authority for a fiscal year which exceeds the ceiling set in the most recently agreed to concurrent resolution of the budget house resolution 461 further provides additional waivers of clauses 2 and 6 rule xxi for paragraphs specified by page and line number these waivers are provided in addition to those already included in house reso lution 415 they are necessary because many of the items now to be protected by the section 311 waiver also need waivers under clauses 2 and 6 of rule xxi and without the waivers would only be partially protected clause 2 prohibits the inclusion of unaut horized appropriations and legislation in an apropriations bill clause 6 prohibits the inclusion of reappropriations there are only two items in the bill which need waivers and for which no waivers have been granted they are the international communications agency and restrictions on u n funding for the plo and cuba both of these items contain legislation or a reappropriation and thus would be subject to a point of order under clause 2 or 6 of rule xxi the waivers were not granted because the committee on rules received a letter from the chairman of the committee on foreign affairs asking that the waivers not be granted the rules committee simply honored that legislative prerogative additionally house resolution 461 makes in order two amendments which are required to be printed in the record of may 11 1982 the first of these to be offered by representative boland or in his absence representatives aucon or patterson provides some 1 billion for mortgage interest assistance to aid purchasers of singlefamily homes the second amendment to be offered by representative lowny provides some 23 million to reimburse states for refugee assistance both amendments are granted waivers of section 311 of the ludget act and of clause 2 of rule xxi briefly i would like to outline the parliamentary situation for consideration of h r 5922 if house resolution 461 is adopted the chairman of the committee on appropriations would call up the bill for consideration in the committee of the whole house and establish the time for general debat e once general debate is complieted ihe bill would be considered under the 5minute rule any germane amendmnt which did not otherwise violate a rule of the house would be in order without trying to predict the chairs ruling in any specific situation i would offer the following general guidelines on the amendment process due to the restrictions of section 311 of the budget ii12061 act amendments to add additional moneys or to increase outlays would not be in urder it would be in order to reduce those amounts in the bill or to strike them altogether generally language perfecting legislative language in the bill could be offered but new legislative language might be subject to a point of order amendments to reappropriate or to transfer previously appropriated funds would violate clause 6 rule xxi and thus would not be in order the same would hold true of the amendments made in order by the rule this is a complicated rule as i stated earlier its complexity arises out of necessity it allows the house to consider the urgent supplemental and the critical program funding involved in as rational and orderly a manner as we on the rules committee could devise i urge my colleagues to support the rule and adopt house resolution 461 so that we may proceed to the consideration of h r 5922"], [0.9760728031396866, 0.023927196860313416, 1, "i would like to point out that i agree in entirety with the committee chairman in his position that we should go back to

the commission on fine arts approved a memorial designed created by architectlawrence halperin just to give a bit of history about this matter since its creation in 1955 the franklin d roosevelt memorial commission has striven to erect a memorial to the former president that would be fitting to his great stature a total of three proposals have been designed and approved by the commission for serious development and presentation the first design approved by the commission in 1962 was opposed by the commission on fine arts and the roosevelt family a revised version failed to meet the approval of the roosevelt family and was subsequently abandoned in 1967 the franklin d roosevelt memorial commission presented a second design which was rejected by the commission on fine arts finally now to the gratification of all of us admirers and friends of president roosevelt the third design unveiled in 1978 was approved by the franklin d roosevelt memorial commission the commission on pine arts the national capital planning commission and the roosevelt family since that time legislation has been introduced in each congress to authorize construction of a proposed memorial to president roosevelt during hearings on the subject no opposition was expressed to the concept of erecting a memorial to president roosevelt misgivings have centered on the proposals for the 46 million alleged cost of the memorial now i shall show a little bit later that the estimated cost including some maintenance cost is 31 million i thoight it might be of interest to members to make a comparison between the estimated cost of the franklin d roosevelt memorial and the lincoln memorial the washington monument and the jefferson memorial the lincoln memorial erected in 1922 cost 3 045 000 in 1981 dollars that would have been 59 860 000 the washington monument constructed in 1884 cost 1 187 000 in 1981 dollars that would be 45 260 000 the jefferson memorial in 1944 cost 3 million in 1981 dollars it would be 37 960 000 house joint resolution 400 authorizes and directs the secretary of the interior subject to the supervision and approval of the franklin d roosevelt commission to construct a memorial in accordance with the general design approval in 1979 the qiemorial will consist of a landscaped garden with a series of garden spaces containing sculptured images and quotations the garden spaces are to be linked by a series of granite walls the joint resolution authorizes such sums as may be necessary to carry out its provisions let me emphasize this is only an authorizing measure it does not carry any appropriation let me state further that the joint resolution which we offer here today that is which this rule would authorize the house to consider has already been passed by the senate without opposition it passed over there as i understand it unanimously so it comes before the house with the unanimous approval of all those who are expected to have a voice in determining the kind of memorial that the president should have and we also have the concurrence of the other body the interior department estimates the cost of construction will be 28 625 000 this construction cost and the annual operating cost for the first 4 years will total some 31 million as i have pointed out already that is a smaller amount than either of the three memorials here in our national capital to our former great presidents cost in terms of 1981 dollars the annual maintenance and operation cost beginning in fiscal year1986 is estimated to be approximately 1 million it has taken 14 years to arrive at a consensus and fitting memorial to our great president franklin d roosevelt it is my hope that the house can proceed with rapid consideration of this measure so that this long desired and worthy memorial can be completed i know of no opposition to this rule let me just say in conclusion this is as all these memorials have been considered as a bipartisan resolution it passed the rules committee without any opposing votes i mentioned already that it passed the other body without anything but unanimity on the part of the senators we have unanimity from the fine arts commission the
