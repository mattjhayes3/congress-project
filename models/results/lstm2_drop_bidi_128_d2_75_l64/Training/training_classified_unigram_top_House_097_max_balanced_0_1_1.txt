this is an opportunity that does not come very often in the house and unfortunately it is a rare opportunity the gentleman from california correctly said this is probably the most important odcasion that we have experienced in many years in this house he and i have been through the battles to get us out of the war in vietnam we went through the impeachment investigation together on the judiciary committee we have dealt with many momentous issues but certainly none are as momentous as this one there have been some brilliant and eloquent statements in this house it is certainly on the most crucial issue ever to face mankind i want to talk about some of the things the facts that have brought us to this point what is the plain stark simple fact behind all of the stockpiles of nuclear warheads the talk of deterrence bargaining chips counterforce first strike capability launch on warn ing window vulnerability nuclear balance megatons war fighting and winning and so forth and so forth what it all adds up to the bottom line is that russia and the united states each has the means in its hands today to destroy all life on this planet it is the only planet we have the only one we know that can sustain life for us and our children and the only one that our children are likely to ever have everything that we and the soviets have done in the last 35 years of mutual deterrence has brought us to this point the people of this country of europe and of the entire world are waking up to the fact that there is something radically wrong with an approach to national security that has produced the greatest insecurity the human race has ever know and the realization is sinking in that merely offering more of the same is not the way out of this nightmare leaving aside the fact that each round of escalation in the arms race brings us and the soviets a quantum leap closer to economic collapse each round also produces a counterresponse by the other side each bargaining chip raises the atte of destructive power each ceiling becomes a floor the situation was aptly summarized recently in a letter to the editor of the washington post which i will read it is short former under secretary of the navy r james woolsey asked if you agree to freeze something before persuading the soviets to reduce what do you use to encourage them to agree to reductions answer you use an offer to reduce of course we will freeze if you will freeze we will reduce if you will reduce the position espoused by mr woolsey and by the current adminstration boils down to this if you will reduce we will freeze if the flaw in this bargaining stance is not obvious one has only to look at what it has achieved thus far a spiraling nuclear arms race that treatens theextinction of humanity people are trying to tell us something and it is very simple it is time to stop more than that it is time to start getting rid of these things that is the simple cogent message behind the wave of popular support for the nuclear arms freeze the people have watched arms control experts negotiate for 20 years and in those years we have seen the development of icbms mirvs cruise missiles neutron warheads and the tenfold multiplication of the numbers of strategic warheads and a vast increase in their accuracy and destructive power in the 1970s the people had a similar simple message on the vietnam war the message was get out of vietnam it took the politicians 5 or 6 years to get the message and the loss of additional thousands of lives but we finally got out the dominoes did not fall and the rest of asia did not go communist indeed we have since been treated to the unedifying but illuminating spectacle of the communists in southeast asia fighting each other today the message the people are sending us on nuclear weapons is equally clear stop making them and start getting rid of them we can debate endlessly whether this or that resolution is the best form the fact is that congress cannot negotiate a weapons freeze or weapons reduction we can tell theexecutive branch however starting with the chief executive to get off his bureaucratic rear and start and we can tell them what goals we expect them to seek the nuclear freeze resolution and the bedell nuclear reduction resolution both do this that is not true however of all of the resolutions that have been put in to try to draw perhaps a red herring across this very issue the military of coiurse are not planning to stop making nuclear weapons quite the opposite they are even talking about making thousands more in the next two decades and are proposing to reprocess all of the wastes from nuclear powerplants to obtain sufficient plutonium to avoid what they foresee as a shortage of weapons grade fissionable materials developing before the end of the century can you believe it you had better believe it because it is going to happen unless somehow this mindless juggernaut is not stopped and dismantled the people believe it i have just received the results of tabulating 7 000 replies that i have received from con stituents who returned my annual questionnaire sent to every household in my district in response to the question do you favor a freeze on the production and testing of new nuclear weapons by the united states and the unitedstatess r 80 percent four out of every five respondents answered yes something is happening out there i would say to my colleagues you and i know it i suspect that it has even pen etrated the white house are those folks out there going to settle for some more rhetoric from the president saying that he is for strategic arms reduction i do not think so they heard him say that 6 months ago they now demand something more than talk something more than resolutions even they want negotiations and the want either results or convincing proof that no results are possible are people naive in thinking that negotiations with the soviets will produce any serious deescalation of the nuclear arms race clearly not until and unless negotiations have been tried and they have every reason to believe that the russian people have an interest in surviving equal to our own and that the soviet leaders have an interest in the survival of their people as well as themselves if i may slightly paraphrase some famous lines of shakespeares merchant of venice hath not a russian eyes hath not a russian hands organs dimensions senses afifections passions fed with the same food hurt with the same weapons subject to the same diseases healed by the same means warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as an american is if you prick them do they not bleed if you tickle them do they not laugh if you poison them do they not die what are some of the facts about nuclear warfare to which the soviet leadership and undoubtedly the soviet people have been exposed to let me start first with a few excerpts from an official unclassified unitedstates government study arms control and disarmament agency civil defense study report no 5 entitled an assessment of frequently neglected effects in nuclear attacks it is dated april 19 1978 let met just read the deterrent effect of a threatened unitedstates retaliation against the ussr depends on soviet leaders perception of the combined effects of our attack and not merely on fatalities military damage or industrial damage taken alone there are other consequences of nuclear attack that are scientifically well established even though our usual analyses do not attempt to quantify them these need to be taken into account in any realistic civil defense and economic recovery planning to the extent that these problems are known to soviet planners they are likely to add to the deterrent effects of the unitedstates strategic capability this paper provides a brief survey of some of the important ef march 310 1982 fi 1276 fects that are normally overlooked in damage assessment calculations the first item climatic changes and ultraviolet burning it is likely that a fullscale nuclear war in 1985 would result in severe ultraviolet burning in the northern hemisphere for several years after the war this burning would be due to depletion of the ozone layer longer lasting climatic changes are also possible we estimate that at its worst the burning would cause blistering burns after one hour of exposure in northern temperate latitudes with similarly severe damage to livestock and crops such levels of ultraviolet radiation could effectively prevent daytime outside work for several years and would destroy all but the most resistant crops and farm animals as a matter of factand this is an aside it is not in this reportbiologists have since stated that a 20percent increase in ultraviolet radiation will blind all exposed animals and insects which means they will all die and if all of the insects die there will be no pollination of the plants and if the plants die we will not eat in fact the report goes on as follows climatic changes which would upset agricultural patterns could occur and last beyond the 5 to 9 years of ultraviolet burning while a great deal of uncertainty exists in the estimation of effects of a major nuclear war on the ozone layer the consequences of ozone depletion are of such immense importance that they must be taken into account from the points of view of civil defense and nuclear deterrence and i might add that i have discussed this with the air force with people who are the experts on nuclear warfare and they confirm the accuracy of this study i am now going to read from one other part of the study the nas study points out that the worst case of 70 ozone decrease one year after the attack would cause blistering sunburn after 10 minutes exposure in temperate latitudes the more probable lowering of 50 as a result of a nuclear war with predicted 1985 unitedstates and soviet forces would cause blistering after about 1 hour of exposure this leads to the conclusion that outside daytime work in the northern hemisphere would require complete covering by protective clothing for about 3 years after the war and this is the entire northern hemisphere not just the united states or the soviet union it would be very difficult to grow many if any food crops and livestock would have to graze at dusk if there were any grass to eat even if the ozone depletion only reached the best expected case of 2530 reduction the effect on post war recovery operations is difficult to imagine the likelihood that ultraviolet burning of forests and grass lands would alter climatic patterns cannot be neglected if possible longterm worldwide temperature changes were also caused by the changes in the stratosphere new agricultural patterns would have to be developed in examining the problem the nas study group noted a 3 c cooling would shorten the growing season and move the northern limit of the corn belt to southern iowa a 1 c cooling would eliminate commercial wheat growing ir canada now the report goes on to talk a bout some other things that the oviet leaders would have to take into account the next heading is destruction of housing i am now reading destruction of housing the unitedstates retaliation in 1985 is estimated to destroy between 75 and 85 of soviet urban housing because of blast and fires which would spread over entire city blocks in most cases the fires could not be fought because of radioactivity lack of water because of damage to the water system and continuing attacks we do not expect fire storms to start this large loss of urban housing would make it difficult if not impossible for survivors to return to rebuild industrial areas for a substantial period the next item is medical care the shortage or unavailability of postattack medical care would result in a substantial increase in deaths over the usually estimated prompt fatalities and many survivors would be crippled or incapacitated for lack of prompt care about 80 to 90 of urban hospitals would be destroyed because they are located near industrial installations disease would increase but perhaps to a level much worse than in world war i they are speaking of russia of course i the next item food and water supplies this analysis indicates that at least 60 days supplies should be stored near or in shelters and camps because destruction and radioactive contamination of transportation centers would restrict movement of food after an attack this is more than many earlier studies recommend and would be an expensive and visible preparation for war the next item fallout shelter effectiveness when allowance is made for the eventual need of shelter occupants to leave and begin work outsidethat is after the attack of course only the best combinations of shelters and behavioral patterns are good enough to prevent illness in most urban areas and then only if they are well provided so occupants can stay inside for all of the first month from 20 to 30 of occupants of basement and improved basement shelters in rural areas will suffer sickness or worse the next item agriculture and food supplics avoidance of radioactive food and water contamination would require monitoring of supplies for decades and finally combination of effects analysis of the expected consequences of nuclear war such as fatalities industrial damage environmental damage destruction of housing transportation and agriculture does not express the consequences of combined effects as examples the destruction of buildings and housing combined with radioactive contamination and severe ultraviolet radiation would make reconstruction activity very difficult and dangerous the destruction of transport equipment electrical power and oil refineries combined with maldistribution of food supplies and the likelihood of crop failures for years after an attackand i would like to repeat that for years after an attack would make survival a fulltime occupation for most one can conclude from these analyses that while some civil defense activities such as evacuation could increase the number of people who would survive the immediate effects of an attack the long term benefits have not been established that has to be the most understated laid back conclusion from a truly devastating analysis and in the face of all that the administration has the audacity to propose a 4 billion program for evacuation of people from our urban centers and target areas in the event of an international crisis and i might add the emergency administration says 8 days notice would be required what those eacuees would go back to assuming they survived at all is a good question now the only trouble with this arms control and disarmament agency report is that it is too abstract being prepared by strategic planners dealing in statistical rather than human beings and it may well be too conservative let me read you a couple of excerpts from a recent article bydr helen caldicott president of the group known as physicians for social responsibility in boston the article is entitled the last epidemic i will just read a couple of excerpts from it first of all with respect to fallout she brings out the fact that survivors at a great distance from a blast will be exposed to continuing fallout averaging 100 rems in 96 hours she adds that an expert at mit henry kendall points out that in a 10 000 megaton nuclear warbear in mind that that is within the capability of the soviet union and the united statesin which 5 000 tons of bombs are dropped on each of the two superpowers as much as 90 percent of the american population could be dead in 30 days the proposed use of counterforce weapons would alter these radiological consequences by orders of magnitude a firststrike nuclear war could create sufficient fallout to kill every person on the planet within weeks to months she then goes on and discusses the public health aspects and the medical aspects of widespread destruction she says this and it is unpleasant but let us face it millions of rotting corpses particularly in hot wqather will cause radiationresistant strains of bacteria fungi and viruses to multiply and mutateeven to become more virulent insects such as cockroaches and flies which are thousands of times more resistant to radiation than humans also will multiply while their natural predators such as birds will perish the insect population will enlarge rapidly and spread swiftly into areas beyond the blast site eating crops and spreading uncontrollable infestation leading eventually to epidemics of such dis eases as plague hepatitis polio encephalitis typhoid and dysentery because most large medical facilities tend to be located in the centers of metropolitan areas the majority of medical personnel will be dead or injured those who manage mhrch 30 1982 co to escape unharmed will have no drugs or equipment to treat the injured since these will have been destroyed then she talks aliout the ecological effects she says it must be emphasized however that unlike the effects of a conventional war which can be ieversed to a large extent over a foreseeable period of reconstruction many of the effects of a nuclear war may remain irreversible for generrulons this is because they may set off a chain of ecological events that would be extremely difficult to control in the best of circumstances and prove nearly impossible to correct under the primitive conditions that would follow a nuclear conflict a national academy of sciences study conducted in 1975 estimates that if 10 percent of the superpowers nuclear arsenals were used 30 to 70 percent of the ozone layer in the northern hemisphere and 20 to 40 percent in the southern hemisphere would be depleted by the reaction of huge quantities of nitrous oxide generated by the explosions with stratospheric ozone well i have already read some of the other aspects of that and she merely repeats what was the arms control and disarmament agencys study and she ends in this manner she says in his essay in a dark time the final epidemic 1981 robert jay ufton a psychiatrist at yale university has noted a critical difference between thebombings of hiroshima and nagasaki and any presentday nuclear conflictone that goes beyond the oftremarkedupon fact that the bombs dropped in 1945 were only a fraction as pow erful as those that might be used today after those bombings and the initial horror what became crucial to the psychological as well as the physical survival of the citizens of those cities was the knowledge that a world existed outside the disaster area doctors medical supplies food clothing today given the sophisticated weaponry with which we have equipped ourselves and the inevitability that a smallscale conflagration would escalate into a massive holocaust nothing but an unanswering wasteland would remain that is the end of her article any of you who have met her in person or heard her speak can only testify to the eloquence and the conviction to which this doctor whose whole profession is saving lives and healing brings to this subject perhaps the entire situation was best summed up by a bumper sticker that our colleague the gentlewoman from colorado told mie she recently saw in colorado it said this if you have seen one nuclear war you have seen them all my friends and colleagues i would like to read three sentences from another article that dr caldicott read she says we will either live together or die together and if you look at it what is our responsibility toward evolution to continue this beautiful life process it is a beautiful planet maybe the only life in the whole universe and i refuse to believe we are silly enough to destroy it a couple of weekends ago the weekend of march 19 to 20 there were human survival conferences held in cleveland akron canton and youngstown ohio they attracted a tremendous interest i attended the one in akron one of the speakers a child guidance counselor joanna rogers macy said this every generation has lived with a certainty that other generations would follow them until our generation at that conference a group of talented young people in a church group presented an exceptionally creative musical a musical they themselves had written both the lyrics and the script and the music and it was about the fantastic world of the nuclear arms race and it was named quite appropriately as a parody of alice in wonderland it was called alice in blunderland i would like to read all of the lyrics but i will not i just want to read two stanzas of one of the songs entitled the last protest song it went like this in god we trust to guide the mechanics with our cars and we trust those men in government to have greater minds than ours and if we all play loud enough we wont hear the storm clouds call and we can leave them to our children if we leave a world at all in the race to armageddon the chaser is the chased when humanity stands naked on the earth he laid to waste of the cause and the victors perhaps someone will recall and leave the message to our children if there is a child at all"],

1984 agregates for lire fauntroy subsitute are rot available observe that while outlays in the committee bill are slightly larger the deficits in all years are smaller the budget committee proposal has a budget deficit of 25 6 billion in 1982 the republican substitute has a deficit of 42 65 billion using the assumptions of the house budget cornmittee now the administration uses older figures than the house budget committee figures dating from january 1981 instead of march 1981 but no matter if you use the same assumptions the administration deficits are still larger for all fiscal years 198183 now in 1982 and 1983 the figures as to deficits are the same in billions of dollars fiscal year 1993 budget committee 1 250 latta substitute 50 100 fiscal year 1954 budget committee 25 8 latta substitute 58 650 the principal difference between the two proposals lies in the revenue loss anticipated by the kemproth tax bill which the administration insists be included as part of its budget plan and which causes an enormous deficit during the fiscal years 1983 and 1 will address this matter later as to the impact of this tax proposal on the economy suffice it to say the administration tax proposal cuts taxes more than it cuts expenditures even it you disregard the fact that balancing the republican substitute budget is accomplished by plug lines or large and unspecified cuts to be later made those unspecified reductions in expenditures total 23 55 billion in fiscal year 1983 and 39 7 billion in fiscal year 1984 it should be made clear no one really knows or will say where these cuts will be made will they be in defense social security in natural resources programs or energy or will they be made in health programs veterans benefits education programs for the young unemployment or will they be in agriculture science and research or in nutrition and food stamps we do not know nor will the administration or the sponsors of the republican substitute tell us where these cuts will occur the consequences of these republican deficits will be more inflation resulting in the government siphoning more money away from the financial markets which has the effect of raising interest rates to business industry and consumers all of this is counterproductive to our efforts to restore american industry to a competitive place in the world economy keeping these factors in mind it is very interesting that twvo assumptions of the republican proposal are that the interest rate next year will be less than 9 percent and that the inflation rate will be 8 3 percent the budget committee is more careful in its assumptions it makes these more realistic projections interest rate on 91 day treasury bills 12 percent in 1982 inflation 9 7 percent if the budget committee assumptions are correct and they appear to be realistic much more so than the wildly hopeful assumptions of the administration then the committee bill will assume a 1982 deficit of 25 billion and the republican proposal a deficit of about 50 billion obviously more careful and prudent assumptions are in order here if the administration is in error by predicting an inflation rate of 8 9 the universally accepted level of inflation is realized and deficits of billions of dollars will be added by reason of vastly larger interest payments on the national debt and by large generally inflationary impacts on expenditures in the federal budget the tax cut proposal of the chairman of the ways and means committee and the democratic leadership while smaller than the tax cut proposed by the administration is fairer to all classes in our society it will be for 1 year instead of 3 years in order that we can see what will happen in the economy next year then we can determine better what should be done obviously then the republican substitute is the most inflationary and the most economically irresponsible of all those before us interestingly if you use the assumptions and figures of the administration you get the following in 1982 administration proposal revenues 650 0 outlays 695 5 deficit 45 1 budget committee proposal revenues 671 0 outlays 693 3 deficit 22 5 note that the budget deficit in the republican proposal is greater than the budget committee proposal if you use the administrations own assumptions i would like now to address the kemproth tax proposal in addition to being inequitable and favoring select classes of our society the kemproth proposal has serious economic defects first it gives so much to private taxpayers mostly in the high tax brackets that little remains to provide needed incentives for modernization of unitedstates industry indeed under the administration tax proposals so little is left for stimulating american industry that stimulus to business investment is phased in over 5 years obviously when we have a high rate of inflation and there is no stimulus to industry industry cannot hope to be competitive at home and abroad and there are slim prospects ~for restoring our industry to a really competitive posture this problem is not mitigated by the administration tax proposal instead consumption is stimulated industrial investment and reinvigoration are delayed the consequences can only be stimulation of imports and long term loss of unitedstates and foreign markets to unitedstates industry obviously then the republican budget and tax proposals cause joy in the board roomsthe board rooms of japan not in the united states loss of markets of this sort is not short term rather it is long term and this results in longterm loss of jobs and prosperity to turn briefly to some consequences which have already been discussed i receive constantly from the government leaders of our state of michigan projections of what will happen under the republican proposal they tell me it will first cause large additions to unemployment by terminating programs which encourage the poor to get off welfare and to work second cause massive increases in state welfare expenditures by reducing trade adjustment assistance trade readjustment assistance and unemployment compensation expenditures third adversely affect programs for health resulting in even larger additional expenditures by the state of michigan fourth adversely affect educational programs at state and local levels in michigan resulting in larger additional expenditures by the state of michiganone consequence here may well be large tax increases at state and local levels to meet the shortf all in federal funding fifth reduce the effectiveness and even eliminate natural resources programs like air and water pollution cleanup the conseqences are again program reductions at the state level more pollution or increased state and local expenditures and increased state and local taxes and sixth impose hardships on the poor the young the sick the agedall through program cuts the cure for this at the state level is more program cuts more taxes or more state expenditures or some mix of the above what i have described here is a budget and tax proposal fraught with inequities and misguided assumptions if you vote for the republican budget proposal you vote for a plan which will impose impossible burdens on the people you vote for a plan which will cost our states billions of dollars you vote for a plan which does injustice to our basic industries you vote for a plan which is not in the best interest of our economy the people of michigan have grave interest in two other matters in the republican substitute under that proposal the funds for both conrail and amtrack would be cut so drastically as to virtually kill both these important transportation services both are vitally important to the industry of the entire northeast quadrant of the nation when penncentral was threatened with bankruptcy my office the offices of all of my colleagues and the press were deluged with promise that if that railroad went bankrupt that economic disaster was certain for the area served especially for michigan and our michigan industry if penncentral predecessor to conrail ceased service we were told that the steel industry would have ceased functioning in 7 days the auto industry would have closed in 3 weeks the electrical utility industrys ability to function would have been substantially impaired and the gross national product and economic activity of the nation grossly depressed if the republican substitute prevails all that will remain of these two essential services will be a northeast corridor for amtrak between washington d c new york and boston conrail will be compelled to go into bankruptcy or to sell off its assets piecemeal by yearend that kind of sale assures losses of massive proportions to the federal government which has invested successfully billions of dollars to restore conrail to solvency and profitable adequate service this kind of sell off means abandonment of many lines loss of service to many communities businesses and industries which have no other equivalent transportation service the consequences of this will be job losses and business closures in an area already in the throes of major unemployment and recession the financial markets and financial experts are now reacting adversely to the republican substitute the administration economic policy and to the kemproth tax package henry kaufman a respected wall street economist said recently that congress should not enact an acrosstheboard tax cut because the reagan administrations tax and spending policy is excessively expansionary and will lead to high interest rates and a continuance of inflation mr kaufman says that the administration policy is exceedingly expansionary does not pursue a course that fights inflation vigorously along the way and will place nearly all the antiinflation effort squarely on monetary policy what he was saying is that our only effort against inflation because of the massive deficits in the administration may 7 1981 co budget will be highinterest rates and a reduced money supply this means very little mortgage money constriction in money for business and industry and enormous financing

of his constituents who are affected by the disaster that is known as reaganomics second for taking this time to discuss the unemployment situation in northeastern ohio which is certainly the most serious problem facing our area in fact ohio is one of the hardest hit states in the nation and northeast ohio is the hardest hit region in the state in 1981 for example akron canton cleveland and youngstown and the areas around them suffered the greatest nonagricultural job losses of all cities in ohio the problems facing my district which is right next door to the gentlemans district are typified by the fate of the general tire plant in akron two years ago general tire was planning to build a new tire factory in akron on march 3 of this year i received an early morning phone call from the president of the company he advised me that not only was there to be no new plant in akron but the company had decided to close its only tire plant in akron i asked him in subsequent conversations if there was not something he could do to remedy this problem and he said no we have simply taken another look at the current market situation as well as the future demand and we see that the demand is not going to support this plant and will certainly not support a new plant the current demand is down so far that we have to do something and this is what they had to do now i received great howls from certain quarters when i pointed out that this was a clear case of reaganomics having caused that plant to be shut down at that time but it seems to me that there is no question about that because the company had been planning to build a new one and certainly the occasion for closing it this year was the depressed situation in the the industry which is one that is likely to continue for some time to come i too this last weekend talked to many of my constituents who are workers in various businesses or former workers one of them i talked to was a very angry person he happened to be a general tire employee and he was getting his final last 2 weeks in in the next 2 weeks and he was understandably bitter he happened to be an exmarine who was wounded in vietnam served two hitches in vietnam with a wife and two children he said i do not know what i am going to do he said i have never been unemployed or laid off in my life i have always been one of the workers who could always find a job he said now i find that there are no jobs he said i have no idea what i am going to do he was i might say particularly bitter at both the president and the congress at the president for proposing the programs which led to this situation and against the congress for having approved them he did not feel much more comforted when i told him that i was one of those who did not support those programs i said i know that is no comfort to you all i could say was that we were going to try to continue to do what we could to straighten this situation out but that is only one case that factory with its 1 265 employees and their families is but one of the tragedies inflicted by reaganomics upon our communities in ohio as well as in other parts of the country when that plant closes its doors a few weeks from now almost 35 million in direct payrolls will be permanently removed from the local economy economists estimate that each dollar paid to a production worker is spent 7 times over in the local economy meaning that the total loss of economic activity in the akron area from the close of the general tire plant will be a staggering qual ter billion dollars a year every production job loss means the loss of two more service jobs such as in retail stores gas stations and restaurants you can drive around the area now and you will see dozens of stores restaurants gas stations and other businesses closing down so the loss of generals 1 265 jobs would mean an ultimate job loss approaching 3 800 in our area unless we find some way of attracting new industry and encouraging local industry to expand one of the problems about doing that is that nobody wants to invest when interest rates are 15 percent 16 percent and 17 percent and when the business is so uncertain that they cannot be assured of a market for their products now in addition to that the closing of this one plant will mean that the city and the state will each lose about 650 000 annually in tax revenue local utilities will lose 5 5 million in sales and local charities will lose thousands of dollars in donationsat a time mind you when the federal aid for these kinds of projects and safety nets is drying up again because of the programs that the president asked the congress to adopt and the congress adopted 1 year ago today i do not want to take all of the gentlemans time but if the gentleman will yield further let me just point out that the loss of the general plant is a community tragedy which unfortunately is not an isolated one in fact the local paper the akron beacon journal has printed headline after headline over the last year announcing the deaths of scores of businesses let me just give you a few examples on april 14 two akron area plants are shutting down was the headline eliminating about 73 jobs the equipment in one plant has been moved to another plant the company owns in south carolina april 22 goodyear lays off 140 at metal products plant bringing to 775 the number of akron goodyear workers on indefinite layoffs now goodyear happens to be a good corporate citizen and they are building a new air spring plant just south of akron in my district they are building their world technical center spending 125 million to build their worldwide technical center in akron converting an old plant to that use the chairman of the board of goodyear told me 2 years ago that if it had not been for the fact that the udag program provided 11 5 million to redo the area around goodyear and enable them to acquire some additional plant they would not have made this investment and yet the president says we do not want government doing anything to help private industry government is part of the problem well i would like to get him out to akron and show him how the government has helped solve goodyears problem and without that we would not have had that tremendous investment which can make a big difference but let me go on with some of the negative news the april 22 paper also carried this story nobil closing akron headquarters move to cost most of firms 135 employees their jobs the company cited economic reasons for the shutdown nobil shoe co was founded in akron in 1904 and the founder picked akron because of its growth potential in may the national standard co a manufacturer of wire beads for tires announced that it was closing down immediately putting 170 employees out of work in 1981 mcneil akron co added workers expanded operations and secured a number of major contracts it committed 17 million in improvements in its akron location and incidentally was encouraged to do so by another udag grant the city of akron had begun to upgrade the area on the strength of mcneils commitment and using udag funds but on july 3 of this year the same paper announced the closing of mcneils akron plant eliminating about 400 hourly and salaried employees and the company cited canceled orders in the oil and tire industries as the reason for its closure and finally july 31 only last week babcock and wilcox closing canton plant idling 800 was the headline in the akron beacon journal this story says that state statistics show that the canton area lost 4 500 manufacturing jobs in the 12 months ending in may 1982 now canton does not happen to be in my congressional district it is in the next district to the south but the reason given for the closing was that the market for utility boiler sales has remained depressed for some time and its expected to continue that way for the foreseeable future asked if the plant would be reopened when the economy improves a spokesman said not by babcock and wilcox i do not want to take all of the gentlemans time but i could go on at some length"], [0.0004242062568664551, 0.9995757937431335, 1, "i thank the gentleman from california and in closing let me reiterate my deep respect for the members of this committee and emphasize again how reluctant i am to oppose them on an issue of this kind to recap i support the levitas amendment which would strike section 5 of h r 5203 and clarify the provisions of current law concerning public access to health and safety data section 5 of h r 5203 modifies current law by providing significant controls on the disclosure of health and safety data underlying pesticide registrations this provision sets forth new procedural restrictions governing the copying transfer use and publication of health and safety data by the public in addition this provision places sibstantial additional limitations on the disclosure of a new category of data classified as innovative methods of technology i believe that section 5 should be striken in its entirety and that congress should afford an opportunity to test the implementation of current provisions of law governing public access to health and safety data this approach is supported strongly in a letter which the energy and commerce committee has received from mr thomas 0 mcgarity professor of law at the university of texas in this letter mr mcgarity one of the leading legal authorities on health and safety data disclosure policies emphasizes that the 1978 amendments have not been implemented to date because of a series of court challenges he argues that the 1978 amendments provide an equitable balance between the goal of full disclosure of health and safety data and the goal of encouraging innovation in the pesticide industry therefore mr mcgarity concludes that it would seem inappropriate to amend the fifra statute once again before the original amendments have had a chance to work i am particularly concerned about the provisions of h r 5203 restricting disclosure of innovative methods or technology under section 5 scientific discussion of innovative methods and technology at open scientific conferences and publication of such information in scientific journals would be prohibited for a 5year period following the submission of such data the deficiencies of the innovative methodology provision are highlighted by an example based on the facts of the pbb tragedy in the pbb case a chemical company accidentally substituted polybrominated biphenyls pbbs for a cattle feed supplement in shipments to the michigan farm bureau before the mistake was discovered hundreds of thousands of livestock were contaminated and consumers had ingested large amounts of products contaminated with pbbs yet even after the mistake was discovered farmers and consumers were faced with substantial fears and uncertainty because little information existed concerning the health effects of pbbs and because test methods available for analyzing pbbs were limited if the pbb tragedy had involved the acbidental contamination of cattle feed with a pesticide instead of pbbs the provisions of h r 5203 would impair significantly the publics ability to obtain sound information concern"], [0.0004252791404724121, 0.9995747208595276, 1, "in recent years we should all have become aware of a national crisis in science and math education we have spent the last 3 years studying the problem we know that there was a 77percent decline in the number of qualified secondary school math teachers and a 65percent drop in the number of science teachers since 1971 we know that the number of college students earning precollege math and science degrees has decreased severely we know that the problem is eroding our technological leadership our national security and our industrial innovation and productivity we are nurturing a generation of young people who are becoming scientifically and mathematically illiterate in the technological age congress must act now the time for special studies and task forces manned by notable individuals is passed today i am introducing two bills designed to overcome americas critical shortage of qualified science and mathematics teachers senator glenn is introducing identical legislation today soon i will be approaching my colleagues for support on the precollege mathematics and science teacher assistance act and the math and science education act the future of america lies in our ability to develop and apply high technology i hope my good friends from michigan will forgive me but our future does not hinge on the number of automobiles we produce the united states of america is the worlds technological pioneer yet we do not have the science and math teachers necessary to train and prepare our young people for their roles in the increasingly complex technological society we are creating nationwide in 198182 50 percent of the math and science teachers in our high school classrooms were unqualified and were teaching with emergency certificates in my home state of oklahoma we found that there has been a 64percent drop over the last 10 years in the number of students completing mathematics teaching certificates and that 50 percent of our present science teachers are not qualified we have also found that morale among math and science teachers is extremely low and that one of the main causes of the teacher shortage is the salary differential with industry teachers can make 50 to 70 percent more working in the high technology industry naturally they are leaving the classroom for higher paying jobs the legislation we are introducing today will address the present teacher shortage and insure an adequate supply of qualified cience and math teachers in the fiture the precohlege mathematics and science teacher assistance act amends the higher education act of 1965 to establish a lowinterest direct student loan program for college students who pursue careers in precollege math and science teaching the loan program is patterned after the direct student loan program the loan would be forgiven if within 1 year of becoming a certified science or math teacher the student begins teaching math or science in a public school for a number of years that at least equals the number of years for which the student received the loan the bill does not authorize funds until fiscal year 1984 the congressional budget office estimates that the progiam will cost 12 million in the first year the math and science education act amends the internal revenue code to grant a 50percent tax credit to high technology firms that hire precollege math and science teachers during the summer months this summer employment will not only give teachers the salary boost they need but also provide them with handson experience in high technology which they can apply in the classroom to better prepare their students for future jobs this bill also grants a tax credit to those high tech firms which allow their employees holding math and science teaching certificates to teach part time in the local school districts this tax credit would increase the current pool of qualified science and math teachers in our schools i want to thank the national council of teachers of math and the national association of secondary school principals for their invaluable assistance in formulating this legislation i would also like to express my appreciation to the national science teachers association the national association of elementary school principals the national association of state boards of education and the american association for college teachers of education for their support our education system

kerryn king and sidney gamble in 1950 when there were only some 3 000 families in greater riverdale neighborhood house was experimenting with a monthly official house organ it was as good as amateurs could make it but its future was bleak kerryn king recruited stein to professionalize the neighborhood news from this grew the concept to found a regular riverdale weekly originally dave thought he could stay at the a p and as he phrased it run the paper with my left hand and the aid of volunteers well it didnt work out quite that way riverdale desperately needed its own weekly and the merchants needed a place to advertise in this burgeoning burg the press soon outgrew the stein living room with family and friends licking address labels dave was suddenly an exa p editor working fulltime as a

possible source of rev ueshould there be any sidney gamble b gued if the press loses money we should not be involved in any liability if its a success its profits should go to the steins who will be

worth their ink the press had its enemies a few of the gentry once organized a boycott against the infant newspaper but the readers stayed loyal and merchants responded by purchasing more space new york magazine and others in the big city media have taken occasional aim at the riverdale press but david stein always knew who he was and what he and his newspaper stood for it wasnt supposed to be the new york times or the village voice nor was it a va cuous shopping news that so many community papers have become it had and has integrity it covered its community its strengths and weaknesses david was always proud that the press had no free list you had to buy itor subscribe the riverdale press has won a multi tude of prizes and many of its peers have voted it the premier newspaper of its

the budget and where we are and what we agree on and what we do not agree on i think it is pretty clear if you listen to the people who have spoken here today and i predict it will be true for those who speak here tomorrow and during the debate on the amendments that we all agree that something has got to be done about the deficit something has got to be done to reduce the amount of national income being absorbed by government something has go to be done to reduce interest rates by reducing the amount of money that the federal government borrows but i also assert that when you get beyond that basic agreement fundamental differences that divide this house and divide this country become very clear in the major budget substitutes that will be voted on next week there are clear differences as to how we achieve those goals i would like very briefly to take the budget which was reported by the house budget committee and compare it to the bipartisan recovery budget which will be offered by the gentleman from ohio on behalf of the republicans and the conservative democrats who seek to control the deficit by controling spending i would like also to compare based on tentative data the budget that will be offered by the gentleman from ohio on behalf of himself and conservative democrats to the socalled coalition budget which will be offered by the gentleman from wisconsin i think when you look at these comparisons you will see very clearly what the choices are before the house if you take the data contained in the vehicle reported by the house budget committee you can break the basic policy changes into five different areas what we do about nondefense discretionary what we do about targeted entitlements what we do about other spending reductions what we do about defense and what we do about taxes we are going to hear a lot of discussion in this budget debate about economic assumptions as we did in the last but what is relevant is not what we assume about the world but what we do about the realitics that we face i think in looking at what we do in these five functional categories you will clearly see the difference in the area of nondefense discretionary the bipartisan recovery budget cuts nondefense discretionary spending 72 percent more than the jones house budget committee vehicle over the period 1983 to 1985 in the area of targeted entitlements the only section other than revenues that will be reconciled that committees will be forced to make changes in under the reconciliation process the bipartisan recovery budget cuts targeted entitlements 139 percent more than the jones house budget committee budget over the 3year period in the area of other spending reductions the bipartisan recovery budget reduces other spending 489 percent more than the house budget committee in the area of defense the jones house budget committee budget cuts defense 69 percent more than the bipartisan recovery budget in the area of taxes the jones house budget committee budget raises taxes by 55 percent more than the bipartisan recovery budget and in the end achieves the same bottom line basically these differences are repeated when you compare the aspin coalition budget and the bipartisan recovery budget that will be offered here if we look at nondefense discretionary and other spending reductions the bipartisan recovery budget cuts nondefense discretionary spending 62 percent more than the aspin coalition budget over the 3 years that the budget is in force in targeted entitlements the bipartisan recovery budget cuts targeted entitlements 119 percent more than the aspin coalition substitute in defense excluding pay the aspin coalition budget cuts defense 83 percent more than the bipartisan recovery budget in the area of taxes the aspin coalition budget raises taxes by 42 percent more than the bipartisan recovery budget over 3 years o 1640 my point in making these comparisons is this the house next week is going to have to choose between two real options one option is embodied in the budget presented by the house budget committee and slightly modified in the coalition aspin substitute that option says let us raise taxes and slash defense so that we can continue spending as usual in washington the real alternative is the bipartisan recovery budget which says let us focus our attention on spend ing so that we can meet our legitimate defense needs and so that we can let the american people keep more of what they earn those are the options that we must choose between do we want to raise taxes and slash de fense to continue spending or do we want to control spending so that we can meet our legitimate defense needs and let the american people keep more money in their pockets to provide positive incentive for people to work save and invest those who have talked about how much trouble the economy is in would have ns deal with those economic problems be raising taxes and by increasing spendng i believe that those are the policies that brought us to this sorry state and i do not believe that going back to the policies of the 1960s and 1970s will solve our problems i think it is important that we pass a budget that gains control of spending and gains control of the deficit that puts strong downward pressure on interest rates but i think the focus has got to be on the problem and the problem is spending taxes were doubled over the last 6 years and yet the deficit grew every year our problem is not inadequate taxes our problem is excessive spending in the bipartisan recovery budget we have an opportunity to do something about that excessive spending so i hope that we will have a good debate in which everyone will look at the issues what do we do about domestic nondefense spending what do we do about meeting the legitimate defense needs of our nation how much burden do we place on the shoulders of the working men and women in america in those three areas the differences among these budgets will be very clear i would like to make one additional point and that is that we have heard and we will hear a lot of talk about equity are cuts fair do we treat entitlement and discretionary programs fairly in terms of choosing where to make reductions but i would submit to my colleagues that there is another issue of fairness and that issue has to do with taxes how much burden are we going to put on those who are pulling the wagon as well as the burden that we are going to put on those who are riding in the wagon and in the ultimate fairness test by controlling the growth of taxes and focusing revenue increases on reducing the deficit rather than increasing taxes to go on spending i believe the ultimate fairness issue is going to be settled on the side of the bipartisan

the george washington commemorative coin act would authorize the minting of a silver half dollar in honor of the 250th anniversary of george washingtons birth in 1982 i wish to commend my distinguished colleague the gentleman from georgia for originating the legislation the gentleman from georgia has been most helpful in passing this legislation through the subcommittee and the full committee he is a dedicated devoted and hardworking member of the banking committee i want to publicly express my appreciation to him for all of his outstanding cooperation on behalf of this legislation it is nearly beyond belief that this one man george washington performed so many crucial roles in founding this great nation as commander in chief he led our troops in the fight for independence as statesman he presided over the constitutional convention as the first president he organized the new government he did all of this out of a sense of duty and love for his country even though it worked great personal and finantal hardship upon him this bill would authorize the minting of up to 10 million 90 percent silver half dollars in his honor the coins would be sold to the public in 1982 and 1983 at a price equal to the cost of their manufacture and distribution plus a 20percent surcharge that surcharge would be used solely to repay the national debt this bill honors washington not only by its issuance of this coin but also because it is fiscally responsible as military commander and later as president washington faced and surmounted severe budgetary and financial problems he knew the necessity for fiscally sound programs by requiring that money from the sale of these coins be used to reduce the national debt these coins will follow washingtons example of fiscal responsibility while the purpose of this legislation is indeed to honor the father of our country who was a hero of the revolutionary war there is another aspect of the legislation that is also important i am today declaring war on the national debt because it has reached a point where interest on the national debt is rapidly approaching 10 percent of our annual budget in the 10 years from 1970 to 1980 the national debt has increased 139 percent and from 1975 to 1980 the debt increased by 68 percent in pocketbook talk that means that in the last 10 years american taxpayers have handed out more than 293 billion just to pay the interest on the national debt while i realize that the 10 to 15 million that will be realize from the sale of the washington silver half dollars is a small amount compared to the size of the national debt it is nevertheless a beginning there are substantial and immediate savings that can be made by reducing the national debt for example 90 million will be saved for every 1 billion reduction of the national debt and for every 10 billion that it is reduced there will be a 900 million savings these figures assumed an annual average interest rate of 9 percent and with interest rates currently on the rise a debt reduction could result in even a more substantial savings from now on every time there is a bill brought before this house that will result in income directly to the united states i will offer an amendment to require that such income be used in reducing the national debt in the present congress we have heard much talk about reducing government spending but nothing about reducing the size of the national debt if we pursue both courses together we can bring inflation under control in a far quicker manner for too long the national debt has been like the weathereverybody talks about it but nobody does anything about it we cannot change the weather but we certainly can change the size of the national debt and that is going to be my no 1 priority from now on the following chart indicates exactly how the national debt is the tail that wags our economic dog i am not going to stand here today and recite all of the figures in the chart but i would suggest that there is enough material in this chart to convince every member of this body that we have to do something to bring the national debt under control"],

deal with a very tricky subject how do we deal with restraints on trade where the marketplace is not working where competition is being discouraged at the same time not letting a bureaucratic agency interfere in matters that are not legitimately within the concern of that agency the broybilldingelllentflorio amendmentand i associate myself with themcalls upon the congress to adopt a legitimate and very worthwhile compromise let me point out what is really at stake here americans spent 247 billion for health care in 1980 in 1981 that figure jumped 16 percent to 287 billion every year we have been seeing an increase in health care costs that far exceed the rate of inflation in our economy today there was a report that this administration is going to recommend that we cut public health programs by maybe as much as 20 percent well if we do something like that we are not going to be able to meet public health emergencies that may come about the food and drug administration may not be able to approve drugs or protect the public safety from drugs that may be dangerous to them every year we are faced with the entitlement programs of medicare ard medical i claiming a larger portion of our federal dollar those who are buying insurance through tj ir employers or some other w y re finding the increase in the insurance premium going up and up and up the reason for the increases in health care costs is that we do not have supply and demand deciding the price of health care services what the lukenlee amendment would do is to remove the little bit of protection that we have in the law now against monopolies preventing competition to hold down some of the costs for example if there was a pricefixing agreement where physicians agreed not to work below the usual rates no federal trade commission action would be permitted if the lukenlee amendment were adopted if all the doctors got together and said we dont want a health maintenance program competing with us and we would use our pressure as physicians with hospital privileges the lukenlee amendment would prevent the federal trade commission from getting involved in that issue if there were illegal kickbacks involving physicians in a major medical laboratory the lukenlee amendment would prevent that from coming under the commissions purview if there are boycotts of costcontainment programs designed by insurers industry and labor to hold down medical costs we would be powerless to deal with it if the lukenlee amendment were adopted the lukenlee amendment should b defeated and the broyhill amendment should be adopted the issue will be wrcther we adopt the broyhill amendmnent or not that is the vote before us i urge an aye vnte on the broyhill amendment we cannot afford to pay these escalating health care costs while we are trying to bring about more competition in health care we should not go backward and bring about a situation where there will be even less competition i know that this is an emotionally charged highly lobbied bill but if we do not do something to provide competition in health care what will be the alternative the government will have to come in with enormous bureaucratic restraints regulations to keep the controls on the health care system from exploding is that what members of congress want is that what the american people would want i do not believe so i think the only choice we have before us on this question is to adopt the broyhill amendment it is one that is backed by the leadership of the committee that by the way is called upon every year to figure out how to hold down costs in the programs for medicare and medicald do not make the job more difficult and do not make the cost of health care more expensive for the american people"]]}
