proposal sponsored by our fourth president james lonroethe monroe doctrineand its impact was sweeping that we would tot permit any foreign government to eatablish itself in our hemisphere we wanted only governments that were free as we in america the issue before this free american congress today is freedom itself the nicaraguan government as everybody knows has violated that monroe doctrine a

company the toshiba corp which was not a party to the diversion and had no knowledge of it these sanctions are questionable on three grounds first they are grossly extraterritorial they constitute

cooperate to stanch the floiv of technology to the soviet union and to eastern european countries if the unitedstates government is dissatisfied with the cooperation provided by any of our allies it should take vigorous steps through the proper channels to secure it yet we must remember that all the member countries of cocom are democracies the itegrity and effectiveness of the export regime which is multilateral and voluntary rests fundamentally on the support which it receives in each country for the cocom system if the people of any cocom memberstate come to the conclusion that the united states is attempting to run the export control regime in ways that are unilateral punitive and unfair that countrys support for cocom will naturally decline should the united states later make positive and constructive appeals for a real improvement in cocom our entreaties will surely fall on deaf ears threatening mandatory sanctions may have had the useful purpose of getting the attention

hit by the law it looks to me like we need to take another look at our tax law and see if were doing anything to match our actions with our rhetoric this tax law was purportedly one of the fairest and most progressive ever constructed it was supposed to end the pattern of burdening thepoor and close loopholes it was supposed to reward american values of hard work and family it was supposed to do a lot of things the only thing the marriage tax has succeeded in doing is propping up a false notion of the american family and offering a disincentive to two income couples it assumes that both partners in a marriage dont necessarily need to work the law as it is presently constructed places greater burdens on families where both partners work to make ends meet these couples will pay more tax than their single contemporaries while traditional families where the wife stays home to care for the children will receive a marriage subsidy even at high income levels we can interpret this in several ways either the tax law is stating that a single income is enough to keep all families goingand i dont think many of us really believe thator the law is saying that a womans place is in the home and not in the workplaceand i hope none of us believe that the marriage tax is short sighted inequitable and fails to match rhetoric with reality matter set in ths typeface indicates words

of the most important problems we face today the hunger projects 1985 publication entitled ending hunger reports that over 35 000 human beings die from hunger every day with threequarters of that staggering figure representing the deaths of children under the age of 5 this means that between 13 and 18 million lives are lost to hunger each year and futhermore there exist over 1 billion people who must remain in a chronic state of hunger and malnutrition these are numbers we cannot ignore and it is for this reason that it becomes imperative to preserve the select committee on hunger in order to continue studies and the subsequent development of effective approaches aimed at the elimination of hunger on an international level the problem of world hunger is not unsolvable hunger related deaths although still at intolerable levels have dropped by nearly 7 million annually since the late 1970s this encouraging change can be attributed in part to the increased efforts put forth by congress as well as by numerous private organizations for instance in 1985 1 personally had the pleasure of working with the select committee on hunger in spearheading the drive for passage of the africa supplemental bill which provided 800 million for famine and disaster relief i recently received a letter from catholic relief services which succinctly summarized the crucial role played by the committee during 1984 and 1985 this bipartisan body was of key importance in creating an understanding of the tragedy that threatened in africa and in helping to guide the generous american response this statement demonstrates the progress and success which have come with the committees assistance and moreover the importance that actual field groups such as catholic relief services have come to attribute to the unique role it performs unfortunately despite the improvements that have been made hunger is still a critical problem in many parts of the world including our own country in having made this acknowledgment it would be a crime not to continue our efforts to alleviate this unnecessary suffering the select committee on hunger has proven to be invaluable as it is devoted solely to the investigation of world hunger the promotion of combative measures within house committees and heightening general awareness on this crucial issue in addition to the african supplemental bill the committee has numerous other major accomplishments to its credit these include support on issues ranging from enhanced primary health care in developing countries worldwide child immunization school feeding programs in developing countries technological assistance to expand food production for family consumption and inexpensive vitamin a deficiency intervention programs which alone could prevent several hundred thousand children from incurring blindness or fatal complications in upholding our moral and humanitarian responsibilities as public servants we cannot allow this tragedy to continue
