supply of professional nurses is inadequate if enrollments in nursing schools continue to decline the shortage may threaten the quality of our healthcare system enrollment in undergraduate nursing programs has declined dramatically in recent years among incoming college freshman nursing has become a less attractive career than it was a decade ago we must do more to attract talented young people to this vital profession we must take steps to retain experienced nurses tempted to pursue more financially lucrative careers in teaching finance or medicine we must develop successful programs to provide additional opportunities for nurses aides and licensed practical nurses to improve their skills and become registered nurses it is as impossible to conceive of a hospital without nurses as it is to imagine a hospital without doctors but however vital nursing is to the quality of health care it has become increasingly clear that the profession of nursing has been taken for granted our healthcare system has failed to retain qualified nursing personnel and compensate them at a level commensurate with their skills we have also failed to assure an adequate supply of nursing students

responsible bill the committee has managed to draft a bill which meets the budget summit agreement of last fall and is less than the presidents request i would also like to thank the professional staff for their invaluable assistance as a member of the subcommittee on military construction i would like to take this opportunity to express my support on several issues which the committee addressed during the course of this fiscal year first this committee is committed to a more equitable distribution of our defense burden among our allies defense spending as a percentage of the gross national product in the united states is almost 7 percent which the nato allies average about 3 3 percent i understand that this figure does not recognize other nonnumerical contributions by our allies yet this is an indicator of the need for more fairness in providing mutual defense in these austere times second i share the committees concern about the lack of a strong physical plant revitalization program the average age of our buildings is 50 years there is a clear need to replace our existing facilities however the budget as proposed would equate to a facility replacement rate of more than 100 years i believe that without adequate funding our buildings will deteriorate beyond all repair thus impacting productivity and quality of lile the final issue i would like to bring to the attention of my colleagues is the need to replace the dilapidated world war ii vintage barracks almost 245 000 service members reside in these insufficient housing units at a time when recruitment and retention is a priority it is imperative that our service men and women live in quality housing thus encouraging reenlistment the appropriations committee has recommended 8 79 billion for fiscal year 1989 military construction and family housing the recommendations in this bill are consistent with the overall program level of the house authorization bill for military construction this bill is

to offer this amendment because it does mean depriving the haitian people of some needed assistance not the humanitarian assistance that goes to babies whose bout with diarrhea has caused them to be dehydrated not to those who have lost their homes not to those who are in need of food but it will deny the government of haiti development assistance that could help build that countrys economy up anything we take away from haiti is going to hurt the people of haiti but this is the only action we can take that means something to two groups of that country the government of haiti that ambushed democracy on sunday and the democratic forces in that country that are looking to the united states for some concrete clear action that says not just that we stand for democracy but that we are doing something to help get democracy back on track that is what this amendment will do i appreciate the support of many who labored so long to help bring this act about to bring about the process of democracy i thank the gentlemen who have already spoken plus our colleague the gentleman from the district of columbia who has given long hours of support to the process of democracy in haiti i think it is vitally important that we continue the process events in haiti have been moving quickly my amendment to the continuing resolultion was developed in response to thehorrlblevioh 10965lence in haiti surrounding last weekends elections which left many dead and wounded it is therefore necessary to take a moment to briefly explain the amendment the amendment enacts into law the administrations recent suspension of military and nonhumanitarian economic assistance to haiti it requires that as a condition for reinstatement of that assistance the government of haiti must begin to adhere to the constitutionally mandated election process including most importantly the reestablishment of the independent nongovernmental provisional electoral council composed of representation from various sectors of haitian society further the amendment urges the president to immediately suspend haitis eligibility for benefits under the caribbean basin initiative and seek an international cooperative effort to impose an international arms embargo and comprehensive trade and financial sanctions on the government of haiti unless they demonstrate a willingness to actively support the election process mandated by the haitian constitution ratified by the haitian people on i offer this amendment reluctantly but i believe it is necessary to send clear and unambiguous signals to the two most important participants in the drama unfolding in haiti to the cng a signal that the united states will respond forcefully to the violence perpetrated by duvalierist forces against the people of haiti and a requirement that they must exercise their power to support the election process protecting the innocent haitians who want desperately to vote to the members of the cep and to the people of haiti a sign of our willingness to not only talk about our commitment to the democratic process in haiti but to take concrete action to demonstrate that commitment in offering this amendment i am keenly aware that the people of haiti many of whom were victimized by the violence of last weekend must not be further victimized by the actions of the unitedstates government i have carefully constructed my amendment to ensure that it will not suspend humanitarian assistance to private voluntary and nongovernmental organizations but only assistance to the government of haiti for this fiscal year this provision suspends the following amounts of unitedstates assistance to the haitian government economic support funds 30 million public law 480 title iii 18 million development assistance 11 4 million section 416 sugar program 1 6 million military assistance 1 6 million for a total of 62 6 million in nonhumanitarian assistance in the term humanitarian assistance i intend that the provision would allow but not be limited to the following types of unitedstates assistance public law 480 title ii 7 8 million and development assistance 20 6 million for a total of 28 4 million in addition i intend to exempt from the suspension of aid projects currently underway in haiti including such hamanitarian projects as agroforestry outreach community water systems projects swine repopulation coffee cooperative programs mobilizing mothers for child survival the development finance corporation the crafts exports center the investment and export promotion program and other similar programs that are underway or that may be undertaken to address the economic or social development of the haitian poor the nation recoiled last weeked at the horrible violence of the antidemocratic duvalierist elements in haiti often with the acquiescence and ocassionally the complicity of haitian military personnel these violent attacks on electoral officials and facilities journalists international election observers and haitian citizens exercising their right to vote must be addressed by the unitedstates congress quickly and effectively my amendment meets that goal since the fall of the brutal duvalier dictatorship on february 7 1986 the people of haiti have consistently demonstrated their strong support for a democratic system the administration has made clear the unitedstates governments deep concern about the events of last weekend it is now time for the american people to make clear through their representative in the unitedstates congress their outrage over the recent violence and their support for the election process today the u s government speaks with one clear voice on the crisis in haiti the reinstatement of the electoral council and a guarantee of the personal safety of its members in an environment free of intimidation and violence is the minimum requirement for restoration of the democratic process finally id like to share with my colleagues an old creole saying deyes mornes gan mornes behind the mountains are more mountains today that can be rephrased deye problemes gans problemes behind the problems are more problems i have been deeply saddened by the events of the last few days in haiti especially as i recall the high hopes of the haitian people as they embarked 18 months ago on the path toward a new and democratic haiti the situation there today is dangerous and volatile and i do not harbor illusions about the prospects for a stable and peaceful outcome to the political dilemmas faced by the haitian government and by the electoral council i do know that by passage of this amendment we put the unitedstates congress clearly on the side of the democratic forces in haiti who long to cast their first vote in a free and fair election that is where we should be standing alongside the people of haiti in their struggle to overcome the weight of years of repression and poverty that characterized the duvalier era in conclusion i want to say that there is a novel written by a haitian writer entitled the pencil of god has no eraser the pencil of god indeed cannot erase what happened on sunday but we can help reestablish the process that was snuffed out and get democracy back on track with this amendment and the actions that it will engender i urge my colleagues to support my amendment"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.9991475343704224,

our telecommunications products that is only fair it is a reciprocal approach the language says that if these countries fail to open their markets to our telecommunications products then we can take steps to redress that situation and if worst comes to worst we can have some sort of reciprocal action foreclosing their products from coming in here but that is not the purpose of this section the

gentleman from montana in his article in the great falls tribune in which he says being granted the rule meant nothing but the wilderness bill was put to the head of the line by the democrat leadership of which mr williams my colleague from montana is a part i have had the bill less than 24 hours and i have hurdled it over all other pieces of legislation some of which have been waiting for weeks to get on to the floor of the house i am sure those who have been jumped over appreciate the efforts of my colleague from montana i would further quote from a montana newspaper an article in which my colleague said i am through making deals with the eastern district congressmen of montana on wilderness and will push the issue through congress regardless of marlences position by adopting this stance and driving this legislation through without opportunity for amendment my colleague has disenfranchised a broad segment of the state i object to the rule on the fact that it does not allow for the amendments to the montana wilderness bill which came from the senate this bill needs amending this bill has a 3 4 million appropriations which is added without so much as a hearing at a time when a great number of people are advocating the taking back of federal grant lands given by the taxpayers to the railroads this bill pays the largest railroad in the united states of america 3 4 million to obtain federal grant lands so that they may be put into wilderness study areas furthermore this bill and the rule circumvents the committee jurisdiction of the agriculture and the judiciary committees this bill authorizes new forest service policy in section 16 in section 16 it states it is the policy of congress that the forest service acquire and maintain reasonable public access to national forest system lands in the state of montana this is the agriculture committees jurisdiction it is new language that comes here from the senate and has never been the subject of a hearing policy is one thing law is another it would appear to me that this particular section section 16 erodes the private property rights by biasing any courts case where private property owners may wish to resist or fight a request for access the forest service the judge and or the jury have simple instruction of law not policy it is in fact the policy of the congress that the forest service acquire and maintain reasonable public access to forest system lands in the state of montana that is stated as law not as policy and it violates the jurisdiction of the judiciary committee never mind the right when we are talking about these private property rights that we have given the forest service and their agency the bureaucrats the right to condemn we have given them a license to steal never mind the irrigated meadows never mind the right to seclusion or aesthetic value of the property owners the great contradiction with the wilderness advocates and the liberals is that they are going to create these aesthetic values and these wilderness values on public lands but the hell with private ownership shame shame we have no opportunity to amend this legislation which circumvents the jurisdiction of several committees i would like to enter into the statement at this point opposition to this legislation by the national cattlemens association the national public lands council and the national wool growers i can outline under present law case after case of abuse and intimidation where the forest service has violated what exists in present law without giving any further right to appeal this rule should be opposed because it has a change of release language without so much as a hearing where users of our national forest normally have an opportunity to express their views well that is not quite correct the sierra club and the wilderness society had the opportunity to meet behind closed doors with the authors of the legislation to work out the changes that they want and now the rest of us are left with no opportunity to even amend the bill the sierra club and wilderness society have had the opportunity to change the bill the people of montana the public land users have not had the opportunity this bill further usurps committee jurisdiction by requiring an updated feasibility study of a dam and reservoir circumventing entirely the committee on public works and transportation in section 12 c of the legislation the bill requires the bia engage itself in engineering studies to accomplish the purposes of preparing a feasibility report not the bureau of reclamation not the corps of engineers but the bia this is ridiculous they do not have the engineering capability the rule is ludicrous the letter referred to follows dear member of congress thenational cattlemens association national wool growers association and public lands council urge you to oppose s 2751 the montana natural resources protection and utilization act of 1988 when it comes up for a vote on the floor of the unitedstates house of representatives we oppose this wilderness bill for a number of reasons one major problem is section 16 a which directs the forest service to acquire public access across private lands to national forest lands in the state of montana we are extremely concerned about the impact this will have on private property the fact that this is a new directive to the forest service that has never been subject to any public hearings the fact that it is a very broad directive with no criteria or agency guidance on how to implement it and the precedent it could set for other states as any private landowners in the city or country can understand we are concerned about any blanket government policy that could force public access across our private property many ranchers already provide public access to hunters fishermen recreationists and others to use their private property or in order to get to federal lands but many ranchers experience very serious vandalism littering property destruction trespass noise dust and potential liability problems from public use of their property as just one example a montana rancher had 500 trees on his private property chopped down stolen and sold as christmas trees cattle and the family dog shot dead livestock killed on the highway when trespassers left a pasture gate open and a meadow of pine seedlings destroyed by campers public access creates potential landowner liability problems can hurt the value of ones property or split it into parcels that are difficult or uneconomic to manage and can destroy fish and wildlife values in order to resolve these kinds rvf problems the forest service and blm have contracted with a colorado thinktank the keystone institute to bring together landowners recreation hunting government and other affected groups to discuss how to balance access needs and demands with private property rights after meeting for one year the eroup will be issuing its report and recommendations soon we think it is premature for congress to pass this legislation directing the forest service in vague broad language to acquire access to not only the wilderness areas covered in this bill but all national forest lands in montana in our minds we should hold off action on this matter until hearings are held the keystone institute issues its report and the public and congress have a chance to consider present and proposed policies in our minds this language raises more questions than it answers such as how much access is reasonable and needs to be acquired where funding will come from the extent to which the forest service can negotiate costs and other issues with landowners whether private lands will be condemned and others we are also concerned that the water provision while much improved over some versions in other wilderness bills still fails to include language expressly barring the establishment of any express or implied federal reserved water rights because of wilderness designations except in full compliance with state water law in addition to other problems with the bill we are concerned generally about the cumulative amount of land that we as a nation continue to set aside and preserve in wilderness or restrictive single use designations rather than manage for traditional multiple use purposes the recent devastating fires in yellowstone and across the west should point out to the american public that we need to manage our natural resources responsibly if man and nature are to coexist the montana stockgrowers association montana wool

bring about improvements in human rights conditions in romania were unsuccessful so my colleagues and i offered amendments to the trade bill to provide for a 6month suspension of mostfavorednation trade benefits for the ceausescu government these amendments which passed both the house and senate by substantial margins put the romanian government on notice that as a condition of continued trade benefits congress expected to see genuine improvements regarding a wide range of human rights abuses including religious restrictions labor and emigration problems and discrimination against ethnic minorities reflecting congressional concern state department officials stressed the unitedstates position on human rights issues in their dealings with the ceausescu government however at the initiative of the romanians mfn trade status was completely suspended effective as of july 3 1988 in effect the ceausescu government has indicated that it would rather not have mfn benefits if this means that it must comply with internationally accepted standards on emigration overall human rights religious liberties and the treatment of ethnic minorities the suspension of mfn has not ended congressional interest in the plight of the romanian people under the ceausescu regime indeed as a result of the controversy over mfn trade status human rights considerations are now acknowledged as a key element in united statesromanian relations this fact is certainly highlighted by house resolution 505 which i am pleased to cosponsor with the gentleman from california"], [0.9950593006797135,
