people caught in a very bad system congress has nibbled around the edges of reform and there are some congressional rule changes that may do the same but to help move toward real reform i am introducing a package of four bills dealing with the need for real limits on campaign spending as well as slamming shut the revolving door on lobbyists that allows too much foreigngenerated influence and money inside this legislative branch my proposals are as follows first a sense of congress resolution that recognizes that the supreme court erred and was not complete when in the case of buckley v valeo they stated that free speech equaled money that no matter how much you spent was okay because money was equated with free speech well if that is true the converse is true if you do not have the money you lack free speech and more and more americans are being shut out of the highest levels of lawmaking in this country because they simply do not have the money to compete my second bill is the constitutional amendment itself that would give congress and the states the power to limit the contributions and expenditures made by in support of candidates for federal state or local office that is a tough proposal but it is one that i think our children and grandchildren will thanks us for 0 1900 the third measure is the ethics in foreign lobbying act of 2006 which would prohibit contribution expenditures by foreignowned corporations and would establish within the federal elections commission a clearinghouse of public information regarding political activities of foreign principals and agents of foreign principals it was interesting that some major russian interests were involved with mr abramoff as this scandal unravels we are going to find some very interesting characters sitting at the bottom of that heap finally the fourth bill is the foreign agents compulsory ethics and trade act of 2006 which would impose a lifetime barf on highlevel government officials from representing aiding or advising foreign governments and foreign political parties it imposes a 5 year prohibition on representing aiding or advising foreign interests including commercialinterests before the government of the united states it is not enough just to shut the gym to former members who are lobbyists you have to get at the heart of the problem campaign finance

representative hyde served in the illinois general assembly beginning in 1966 which i note is the year that i was born so i dont quite remember that when henry first started serving the state legislature but he rose in the state legislature to the position of majority leader and he earned a reputation as an articulate debater when he was then elected to congress he brought his knowledge his skills and his passion to the house to serve our country in the house he has served on the select committee on intelligence he has chaired the committ6e on the judiciary and currently chairs the committee on international relations because of his work his tenure and his record the chicago tribune has called hyde one of the most respected members of congress and an eloquent and intellectual powerhouse now i remember back in 1983 my father had first been elected to the house i remember coming here and how thrilled i was to have the opportunity to meet henry hyde he was so well known everyone knew what an articulate man he was and how much passion he had how much knowledge he had and he was a true statesman and i really respected his position that he took inhis fight against the soviet union in the cold war that is something i really respected and because everybody no matter where they stood on any issue had so much respect for henry hyde it was a thrill back then to meet henry now i have had the privilege of serving for 2 years with henry in the house and i know i have heard through my 2 years stories from members and their experiences with henry over the years and i have talked with jim oberstar about the hyde amendment and how jim would talk with henry about this and how they worked together to bring forth the hyde amendment henry is willing to work together to reach consensus and to reach important goals for our country no matter what you thought about where he stood on issues you listened to henry hyde because you knew when he spoke he would be eloquent he would have good arguments and you should listen to him now i am very happy that i had this opportunity to serve with henry he has served our nation so well he has served the state of illinois so well and i know that his legacy will certainly reflect his commitment to illinois to his district and to our nation his insights his passion and his presence will deeply be missed he truly was also a man

support of this legislation the bill before the house does the right thing for the disaster victims of florida and louisiana but it does wrong truly wrong for the new york victims of the september 11 terrorist attacks i would like to appeal to my colleague on the other side of the aisle to join me in trying to reverse the unfair taxation on grants to the victims of 9 11 specifically the businesses as we go forward when thousands of lower manhattan small businesses were on the brink of complete failure as a result of september 11 and the terrorist attack against our country these businesses accepted federal recovery grants but were then told months later that those grants would be taxed and treated as income that in my opinion wrongful taxation was the straw that broke the back of many small businesses in new york after 9 11 and it continues to this day to be a burden on small businesses who were forced to take out loans to pay taxes on disaster recovery grants granted it was not a fema mitigation grant but it was a disaster recovery grant so it was in the same feeling or in the same purpose as the legislation before us what causes me so much concern today is that we have sought the same treatment the exact same treatment for 9 11 victims for more than 3 years that the members are seeking today for victims in their states along with the gentleman from new york and the bipartisan delegation of new york i have introduced legislation to reverse taxation on the 9 11 aid grants we have offered amendments to reverse this taxation with the active support of the gentleman from new york ways and means members and others from the new york delegation we have testified before the committee on rules made numerous speeches before this body sought hearings for the legislation and held countless events to seek action from house leaders to reverse this wrongful taxation on 9 11 aid grants we have been trying for more than 3 years to have the small business victims of 9 11 treated fairly but this body has not found a way as yet to advance that legislation again i am appealing to my colleagues from florida and louisiana to help our constituents as they are helping theirs today now today we are watching a bill sail to the floor for passage without a hearing without a markup in committee without any of the months and years of effort that the new york delegation and business leaders from new york city have put into seeking redress for 9 11 disaster victims that were treated unfairly and wrongly let me be absolutely clear that i find no fault with the repeal of wrongful taxation on the recovery grants for florida and louisiana victims of disaster i feel they are entitled the purpose of disaster relief is to relieve them to get that money back in the community to help them restore and be made whole not to tax it but i do find fault with the exclusion of 9 11 victims in this bill when we have fought so long and so hard to achieve the exact same fairness for them if the federal government should not collect taxes on aid to hurricane victims then it should not collect taxes on 9 11 relief grants which is truly the worst disaster that this country has ever suffered it is an act of war we are still suffering from that terrible terrible action against inhiocent people i again want to make clear that i am supporting the legislation i would like to place in the record a report from the joint committee on taxation where they estimated that approximately 268 million was sent back to washington in the form of taxes on the relief grants following 9 11 it is unfair to new york and to those who suffered the most from the terrorist attacks against our nation i call upon the authors of this legislation and the gentleman from florida"],
