economic plan certainly during that period of time we will have a broad overview but at this point i would like to just focus very narrowly on one aspect of the vice presidents plan my colleagues may recall that the vice president was one of many voices that urged the president of the united states to veto the marriage penalty tax relief that was passed by this congress and sent to the president soon after the president vetoed the marriage penalty tax relief the vice president announced that he would give marriage penalty relief by doubling the standard deduction i think it is probably worth our while to realize what this means exactly in terms of the vice presidents claim that it is marriage penalty tax relief certainly what it means by way of comparison with the marriage penalty tax relief that was granted by this congress and vetoed by the president the first thing my colleagues should realize is that in the congressional bill written by the republicans and passed on to the president vetoed by the president all married couples irrespective of their filing status received relief from the unfair marriage penalty the vice presidents proposal that he now outlines only gives relief to those people who do not itemize their taxes if a couple owns a home and decides to deduct their mortgage interest they will get no marriage penalty relief under the vice presidents plan if a couple gives to their church and deducts charitable contributions they get no marriage penalty relief under the vice presidents plan e0 1600 if you your spouse or your child is ill and you deduct your skyrocketing medical bills you get no marriage penalty relief under the vice presidents plan if you or your spouse work at home and deduct the cost of a home office you get no marriage penalty relief under the vice presidents plan and if you jump through hoops to become eligible for one of the new credits that the vice president has proposed complicating our tax code even further than it is now than the vice president will not give you relief from the unfair marriage penalty and that is wrong that is just the beginning of the serious concern i have with the details of the vice presidents plan let me say it is a commonplace observation in this town that the devil is in the details armeys axiom is if you make a deal with the devil you are the junior partner and i am about to demonstrate in this next hour that indeed the devil that we do not want to make a deal with is in the details of the vice presidents plan let us take a look at the big picture first the vice president would spend the onbudget surplus he would rob the social security trust fund and he would provide a measly tax cut designed to manipulate behavior instead of giving meaningful tax relief one of the things that we are very proud of in this congress one of the things that we have been able to do thanks primarily to the success of the american people in creating an enormous economic success story here in america and the revenues that have accrued to the government out of our economic success is that we have managed to stop the raid on social security not only do we set aside 100 percent of all social security tax dollars that people find in their payroll stubs as fica tax 100 percent of all medicare tax surpluses set aside by this congress thus ending the 40year raid on social security and medicare but we have even managed in this congress to set aside a large portion of the onbudget budget surplus what is the onbudget budget surplus that is the part of the budget surplus that accrues to the government from your social security taxes not from your medicare taxes but from your income taxes so that we are now setting 90 percent of all budget surplus aside for debt reduction the vice presidents plan would take all of that income tax surplus which we call onbudget surplus and he would spend it but worse than that he would renew the old practice a practice that should be forgotten of robbing from the social security trust fund for new risky spending schemes that we will talk about later at the same time he would provide a bureaucratic governmentrun prescription drug plan that is not guaranteed to bring the cost of drugs down indeed the vice presidents onesizefitsall youmustjointhegovernment plan threatens to force the price of prescription drugs up let us address his spending plans first according to vice president gores numbers he would increase federal spending by about 900 billion through the year 2010 however the senate budget committee shows a much highber price tag they added up the numbers and found that the vice president would spend 2 1 trillion of new spending and he would not stop there think of it this way the vice presidents plan is 191 pages that means that each page of his book would cost taxpayers an amazing 18 4 billion per page it means that for every dollar by which the vice president would cut taxes he would spend 6 75 if you look at the details we find that vice president gore dramatically underestimates the cost of his new retirement entitlement program built on top of the social security program that is not new this has been a part of our problem historically in the past with democrat congresses that created new mandatory spending programs and dramatically underestimated their cost the vice president says his new retirement program which is very similar to the clinton universal savings account which was a trial balloon which the clinton administration floated until it popped that this would cost 200 billion over 10 years but an analysis by dr john colgen of stanford university shows that if everyone eligible to participate in it it would cost 160 billion in the first year alone the vice president says his plan would cost 200 billion over 10 years professor colgen of stanford university says if everybody eligible participated it would be 160 billion for the first year alone the vice president mistakenly calls this brand new massive retirement spending program a tax cut true enough it would be run through the irs and that would give this agency still more power and control over the lives of americans but this is no tax cut instead the vice president would give government checks to people some of whom do not even pay taxes our budget rules would score it on the spending side not on the tax side other parts of this big government agenda include massive new spending on energy environment transportation and crime all important items on our policy agenda but to pay for this the vice president would rob the social security system we have stopped that raid on social security and i believe that the american people would agree with me there is no going back i see the gentleman from wisconsin one of our brighter and younger newer members of the republican caucus has joined me and i see he has some very interesting graphs there so i yield to professor ryan so that he can help us look into this case even further"], [0.01128681842237711, 0.01128681842237711, 0, "the forest fires in los alamos and nevada have highlighted what may have become a much bigger problem one of the subcommittees on which i serve is the subcommittee on forest and forest health of the committee on resources we heard testimony a few months ago that almost 40 million acres of federal land out west was in imminent danger of catastrophic forest fires this is because environmental extremists fanatically sometimes even violently oppose cutting any trees in our national forests forestry experts tell us that we have to cut some trees to have healthy forests yet some of these extremists oppose even the removal of dead and dying trees thus causing huge fuel buildups on the floors of these forests leading to forest fires the los alamos fire was a socalled controlled burn set by federal bureaucrats that simply got out of control of course we all know that no federal bureaucrat has ever made a mistake or at least one that they have been held accountable for the leading environmental extremist secretary babbitt said on television last week that our forests are now 100 times more dangerous than they were 100 years ago but it is because of the very policies that he has been advocating if we do not start cutting more trees in the national forests soon then in the very near future we are going to see forest fires that make the los alamos disaster look like peanuts in comparison yet some of these environmental extremists want the forests to be thinned only by forest fires because that is the natural way and the way it occurred before man started populating the earth and according to the extremists messed things up last year in the subcommittee we were told that the congress in the mid 1980s passed what was then proclaimed as a great proenvironment law that we would not allow cutting of more than 80 percent of the new growth in the national forests since then we have repeatedly reduced that percentage stopping it altogether in some places from the proenvironment law of 80 percent 15 or 16 years ago we now allow harvesting of less than oneseventh of the new growth in our national forests national forests have about 23 billion board feet of new growth each year today we cut less than 3 billion board feet or only about 12 or 13 percent of the new growth there are about 6 billion board feet of dead or dying trees in the national forests yet these extremists will not even permit the removal of these dead trees now we are cutting less than half of the dead and dying trees and unbelievably some people want it stopped altogether environmental extremists have had such an impact that many schoolchildren have almost been brainwashed about these things they never hear the other side if i went to any school in knoxville and told them i was against cutting any trees in the national forests they would probably think that was a really good thing they never stop to think that we have to cut trees if we want to build houses or furniture or have books newspapers toilet paper and many many other products also it we keep limiting and restricting where and how trees are cut it will drive the prices for homes and many other items much higher than they already are even now lumber dealers tell me they are having to import all kinds of canadian lumber because we have cut out or halted so much unitedstates lumber production when extremists get our lumber production in our national forests reduced so drastically it helps big businesses and other countries but it destroys jobs and drives up prices in this country the people it hurts the most are the lowerincome and working people in this country i know most of these environmental extremists come from very wealthy families and i know they are more or less insulated from the harm that they do but i think it is really sad that they destroy so many jobs and drive up prices for so many people who really cannot afford it i am not talking about cutting any trees in our 356 national parks i am talking about cutting trees in our national forests so they can grow and be healthy and keep lumber prices down our national forests cover 191 million acres i know when people look at a map of the united states on one page in the book the country looks small yet 191 million acres is equal to about 325 great smoky mountain national parks most people who go to the great smokies think it is huge yet i am talking about forests that cover more than 300 times the great smokies and this does not count any of the land in our national parks or the land the bureau of land management controls the federal government owns over 30 percent of the land in this nation today state and local governments and quasigovernmental agencies own another 20 percent half of the land is in some type of public ownership what is most disturbing though is how government at all levels has been taking over private land at such a rapid rate in the last 30 years and perhaps even more dangerous putting so many rules regulations restrictions and red tape on the shrinking amount of land that still remains in private lands today yet there are some of these environmental extremists who are not satisfied with half of the land and want even more there is something known as the wildlands project which i first read about in the washington post which advocates taking half the private land in the unitedstates and placing it in public ownership this may sound ok until some bureaucrat comes and takes your home or your property also we could not emphasize enough that private property is one of the main keys to our freedom and our prosperity it is one of the main things that has set us apart from countries like russia and cuba and other socialist or communist nations these national forests are not national monuments they are natural resources renewable resources whenever some of these extremists are confronted by loggers who have lost jobs or communities that have been devastated they always say just promote tourism well tourism is an industry filled with minimum or low wage jobs even more importantly it is just not possible to turn our whole country into tourist attractions or base our whole economy on tourism i know these environmental groups have to scare people and continually raise the bar so that their contributions will keep coming in i know too that many big companies and particularly big multinational corporations are helped by extreme environmental rules because they drive so many small and mediumnesses uu ooo ut ousinesso or force them to merge so many contributors for these groups come from these big companies often headquartered in other countries but if we want to continue having a strong economy with good jobs and halfway reasonable prices and especially if we want to have a free country we must use our natural resources in an environmentally balanced way we cannot stop cutting trees digging for coal and drilling for oil and continue to have the good life that we fortunately enjoy today"], [0.011525411158800125, 0.011525411158800125, 0, "every day politicians talk about a drugfree america

proposed on drugfighting efforts in colombia is good money thrown after bad lieutenant commander salcedo also said recently that the stated goal of the aid package that is to disrupt the production

population this veteran of the drug war is absolutely correct the lieutenant commanders stated goal to get us to focus on our own drug addiction problem here in america should be our goal as a congress and as a country as the lieutenant commander put it quote washington should spend its money not on helicopters and trainers but on prevention programs and treatment for addicts the cost of

by key measures of drug availability they are all going in the wrong direction he said the focus of antidrug efforts should be switched from interdiction and eradication to treatment of drug addicts

foreign aid combined in addition more than 80 percent of the 1 7 million prisoners in america are behind bars because of drug alcohol addiction how much evidence does congress need that we have a national epidemic of addiction an epidemic crying out for a solution that works not more cheap political rhetoric not more simplistic supplyside fixes that obviously are not working we must get to the root cause of addiction and treat it like other diseases the american medical association told congress and the nation in 1956 that alcoholism and drug addiction are a disease that requires treatment to recover yet today in america only 2 percent of the 16 million alcoholics and addicts covered by health plans are able to receive adequate treatment thats right only 2 percent of addicts and alcoholics covered by health insurance plans are receiving effective treatment for their chemical dependency notwithstanding the purported coverage of treatment by their health plans thats because of discriminatory caps artificially high deductibles and copayments limited treatment stays and other restrictions on chemical dependency treatment that are different from other diseases if we are really serious about reducing illegal drug use in america we must address the disease of addiction by putting chemical dependency treatment on par with treatment for other diseases providing equal access to chemical dependency treatment is not only the prescribed medical approach its also the costeffective approach as a recovering alcoholic myself i know firsthand the value of treatment as a recovering person of 18 years i am absolutely alarmed by the dwindling access to treatment for people who need it over half of the treatment beds are gone that were available 10 years ago even more alarming 60 percent of the adolescent treatment beds are gone we must act now to reverse this alarming trend we must act now to provide greater access to chemical dependency treatment thats why i have introduced the substance abuse treatment parity act the same bill that had the broad bipartisan support last year of 95 cosponsors this legislation would provide access to treatment by prohibiting discrimination against the disease of addiction the bill prohibits discriminatory caps higher deductibles and copayments limited treatment stays and other restrictions on chemical dependency treatment that are different from other diseases this is not another mandate because it does not require any health plan which does not already cover chemical dependency treatment to provide such coverage it merely says those which offer chemical dependency coverage cannot treat it differently from coverage for medical or surgical services for other diseases in addition the legislation waives the parity for substance abuse treatment if premiums increase by more than 1 percent and exempts small businesses with fewer than 50 employees its time to knock down the barriers to chemical dependency treatment its time to end the discrimination against people with addiction its time to provide access to treatment to deal with americas no 1 public health and public safety problem we can deal with this epidemic now or deal with it later but it will only get worse if we continue to allow discrimination against the disease of addiction and ignore the demand side we can build all the fences on our borders and all the prison cells money can buy we can hire thousands of new border guards and drug enforcement officers but dealing primarily with the supply side of this problem will never solve it thats because our nations supplyside strategy does not attack the underlying problem of addiction that causes people to crave and demand drugs we must get to the root cause of addiction and treat it like other diseases all the empirical data including extensive actuarial studies show that parity for chemical dependency treatment will save billions of dollars while not raising premiums more than 0 2 percent or 44 cents a month per insured according to a recent rand corp study that means under the worstcase scenario 16 million alcoholics and addicts could receive treatment for the price of a cup of coffee per month to the 113 million americans covered by health plans at the same time the american people would realize 5 4 billion in costsavings from treatment parity according to another recent study of course no dollar value can quantity the impact that greater access to treatment will have on the spouses children and families who have been affected by the ravages of addiction broken families shattered lives messedup kids ruined careers this is not just another policy issue this is a lifeordeath issue for 16 million americans who are chemically dependent covered by health insurance but unable to access treatment its also a lifeordeath issue for the other 10 million addicts and alcoholics without insurance this year congress should knock down the barriers to chemical dependency treatment and pass treatment parity legislation the american people cannot afford to wait any longer for congress to get real about addiction then someday we can realistically and honestly talk about

of us over the last several years have asked a very basic fundamental question that is is it right is it fair that under our tax code a married working couple where both a husband and wife are in the workforce that they pay higher taxes just because they are married is it right that 25 million married working couples 50 million taxpayers pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married we call that 1 400 the marriage tax penalty it affects married couples who because they have two incomes they are forced to file jointly they are pushed into a higher tax bracket and they pay higher taxes it is a marriage tax penalty and it is wrong let me introduce to the house some constituents of mine michelle and shad hallihan two public school teachers from a community of manhattan just south of joliet illinois shad is a teacher at joliet high school michelle at manhattan junior high their combined income is about 62 000 they are middleclass teachers they are homeowners of course since they were married they have since had a child little ben remember their family someone new in their lives and they are so proud of little ben here who is growing very quickly their marriage tax penalty is about 1 000 a year that they pay just because they are married i think it is a fair question is it right is it fair that shad and michelle hallihan two public school teachers who work very hard every day have a new little boy in their lives have to pay higher taxes send money to washington just because they are married i am proud to say this conference report before it eliminates the marriage tax penalty that good people hardworking middleclass people like shad and michelle hallihan pay every year because they are married under our conference report we help those who itemize their taxes as well as those who do not now my friends on the other side of the aisle say that if one is middle class and one itemizes ones taxes usually because one is a homeowner or one gives money to ones institutions of faith or church or synagogue or charity one is rich and one does not deserve marriage tax relief well republicans and fortunately 48 democrats believe we should help the middleclass homeowners who give money to charity they are not rich they work hard shad and michelle hallihan make 62 000 a year they itemize their taxes now we help those who do not itemize their taxes in this conference by doubling the standard deduction that is used by those who do not itemize their taxes we double that for joint filers to twice that as singles for those who are itemizers like michelle and shad hallihan and little ben who are homeowners so they are forced to itemize we widen the 15 percent bracket that is the basic tax bracket that affects everybody we widen that so joint filers married couples like shad and michelle with two incomes can earn twice as much as a single filer and be in the same tax bracket the same 15 percent tax bracket what i think is most exciting about this bill not only do we help middleclass families who are homeowners and give money to church and charity who itemize those taxes as well as those who do not is that it is effective this year when we pass this legislation and put it on the presidents desk today the president will have an opportunity if he signs it into law to help married couples 25 million married working couples this year because i would point out that doubling the standard deduction which helps those who do not itemize and widening the 15 percent tax bracket which helps those who do itemize such as homeowners and those that give money to church and charity that they will receive marriage tax relief this year because this legislation is effective january 1 of 2000 think about that when my friends on the other side of the aisle and bill clinton and al gore raised taxes in 1993 they made their tax increase retroactive which meant they went back in the tax year and took ones money well this year we have an opportunity to give marriage tax relief this year which means we go back to january 1 of this year if one is married one of 25 million married working couples who suffer the marriage tax penalty one is going to see marriage tax relief this year in tax year 2000 that is a great opportunity if one believes in fairness in the tax code as we do it is time to make the tax code more fair and more simple we want to eliminate the marriage tax penalty now my friends on the other side of the aisle have been making lots of excuses they really do not want to eliminate the marriage tax penalty because they would much rather spend shad and michelles money they believe it is better spent here in washington than shad and michelle hallihan can spend it back in joliet illinois think about it the average marriage tax penalty for good hardworking middleclass married couples like shad and michelle hallihan 1 400 1 400 is 1 years tuition at joliet community college our local community college it is 3 months of day care for little ben at a local child care center in joliet illinois it is a washer and dryer for their home it is 3 000 diapers for little ben the marriage tax penalty of 1 400 is really money for real people let us do the right thing let us pass this rule let us pass this legislation let us wipe out the marriage tax penalty for 25 million married working

republicans versus democrats they say the debates are about which party is for social security medicare education or the environment but we know that we are all committed to find the best solutions to these important issues the real debate on the floor of the house and the senate and in all of our committees is about who is going to control ones life one or the government there are some in washington who believe one is better off if many of the decisions about ones life and the lives of ones family members are made here in washington their intentions are good and many times their programs sound good but the evidence over the last 40 years is undeniable when washington takes our money and makes the important decisions about our lives we not only lose our freedom but we lose the security which comes from having control of our own lives the republicans in congress believe that one is most secure when one is most free that is why we call ourselves the gop the government of the people we believe our job is not to manage ones life but to provide a framework of freedom so one can manage ones own life and have equal access to all the opportunities this country has to offer we believe in securing the future for every american by returning dollars decisions and freedoms back to the people back to individuals families communities businesses and back to our states the gop believes just as my colleagues do that we can best secure the future for every child by returning dollars and decisions for education to parents and to local schools there are some here in washington that think we can run our schools better from the white house we tried that and our test scores and the quality of our schools declined since the federal role expanded in the 1960s today republicans in congress have passed legislation that allows states to use federal money without all the red tape and to decide how the money can best be used to help their schools we worked to give teachers and principals the flexibility to restore commonsense discipline in our childrens classrooms we are working to return 95 percent of all federal education dollars back to the classroom where the money belongs and is needed for new books supplies and school repairs we all know that our children get the best education when parents teachers and principals have the flexibility and resources they need we are making progress in education the gop believes that we can best secure the future for every family by letting americans keep more of what they earn it is not fair to ask both parents to work harder and longer and then to take up to half of everything they make high taxes create stress in our families and make it almost impossible to save for the future for new homes for education republicansin congress have already passed tax reductions that include child tax credits education savings accounts and less taxes on savings tomorrow the gop will pass legislation that will reduce the tax penalty on married couples eliminate the earnings limits on senior citizens lower capital gains tax eliminate the death tax and begin to lower taxes for everyone in addition to bringing tax fairness and relief we are going to make sure that taxpayers hardearned money is wisely used we know americans work hard for every penny that they earn and they should expect their government not to waste or abuse their money americans can be sure that we are making progress on tax relief and tax fairness the gop believes that we can secure the future for every senior citizen by not spending one dime of social security and medicare for other programs no matter how good these other programs sound taxpayers have worked hard to secure a retirement for themselves and they should expect their retirement money to be there when they retire to safeguard american taxpayers money republicans have created a lock box that will protect social security and medicare and guaranty the benefits and unlike some proposals that come out of washington we are going to stick to this pledge to the end and we are glad that the aarp and the president have endorsed our lock box plan but we also know that social security and medicare need repair we are working hard to make sure social security and medicare are there for future generations so all americans can rest easy in their retirement knowing they have more control of their retirement income and health care in 1994 the american taxpayer trusted the gop to lead congress and make progress towards a more free and secure america since then we have balanced the budget and reformed welfare putting over 4 million people to work we have repealed some taxes passed by the president passed tax credits and the largest tax relief package in 16 years we stopped the practice of spending social security and medicare funds we have given local schools the control and resources they need to succeed and we have begun to rebuild our military the american people and our economy have responded and while we still have much work to dowe are on the right path towards securing the future for every american in the months to come you will see us continue to return dollars decisions and freedoms back homeback to you your family your businesses and your communities back to where it belongs and where progress begins we are republicans the government of the

costs about 2 billion a year and occupies about 20 000 soldiers 200 aircraft and 25 ships the monitor also said the unitedstates air war has not loosened saddams grip on power and is being questioned by unitedstates lawmakers about 1 year ago the associated press ran a lengthy story describing our continued bombing of iraq as a forgotten war because most americans did not even realize we are still bombing they still do not here we are spending an average of almost 6 million a day regularly bombing iraq and most americans do not even realize this onesided war is even still going on what a waste what are we accomplishing probably just the opposite from what we should be trying to do probably the only thing our bombing has accomplished is to keep saddam hussein in power by making the unitedstates so unpopular in iraq these people were our allies in the 1980s they could be our friends once again if we would stop bombing them iraq is no threat whatsoever to the unitedstates unless we continue to bomb them for so long and so much that they are forced to send terrorists in here in acts of desperation the monitor article yesterday also said this but beyond britain washington lacks enthusiastic international support in its crusade against the iraqi leader baghdad claims that the unitedstatesled sanctions are leading to mass malnutrition and unusually high rates of infant mortality several reports have said that our sanctions over the last 10 years have caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of iraqi children how would we feel about a country that was doing this to us the top of the front pale of the washington post a couple of months ago had a headline which said under iraqi skies a canvas of death the subhead said town of villages reveals human cost of unitedstates led sorties in nofly zones the story a very long one told of several children who were named in the story who were killed in different unitedstates bombing raids the lead paragraphs told this story suddenly out of the clear blue sky the forgotten war being waged by the united states and britain over iraq visited its lethal routine on the shepherds and farmers of toq alghazalat about

boys summer vacation lay ahead that is when the missile landed without warning according to several youths standing nearby the device came crashing down in an open field 200 yards from the dozen houses of toq alghazalat a deafening explosion cracked across the silent land schrapnel flew in every direction four shepherds were wounded and omran the others recalled lay dead in the dirt most of his head torn off the white of his robe stained red he was only 13 years old but he was a good boy sobbed omrans father harbi jawair 61 i repeat what would we think about a country that was doing this to our children the post story said that a week of conversations with wounded iraqis and the families of those killed showed that civilian deaths and injuries are a regular part of this air war the monitor story quoted one man as saying iraq does not even have the means to pose a threat to its neighbors and it is certainly not a threat to us saddam hussein forced us to take action in 1991 because he had moved into kuwait and was threatening saudi arabia and the entire middle east but we now know that much of what he was doing was saber rattling his military strength was greatly exaggerated as we found when many of his best soldiers began surrendering to anyone they could even cnn television news saddam is a very bad man who has been responsible for horrible things happening to his people i am convinced that the only thing keeping him in power and keeping his people from revolting and throwing him out has been our continued bombing we should never send our troops to foreign battlefields and especially start bombing people unless there is a real and legitimate threat to our national security or a very vital unitedstates interest at stake this administration has deployed troops to other countries more than the six previous administrations put together this administration bombed a medicine factory in sudan and bombed afghanistan and kosovo and iraq the timing of the start of these bombings was usually at a time when the president was having serious personal problems or in iraqs case the eve of his impeachment they say that those who hate war the most are those who have actually been in one fighting on the front lines in a shooting war who have seen the horror of it and thus want to do everything possible to avoid it perhaps it is because almost no one in this administration has actually fought on the front lines of a shooting war that they have been so cavalier about or so quick to bomb people whatever the reason the situation is not the same as it was in 1991 we need to stop this 2 billion air war now"], [0.012220236472785473, 0.012220236472785473, 0, "i brought back tonight one of my charts to show the flow of illegal narcotics this is a pretty simple pattern before the president took office in 1993 colombia was really more of a transit country and drug processing country now since we have had such good results with president fujimori of peru who has also had a tough enforcement program and president hugo banzer in bolivia the production of cocaine and coca is down dramatically in those countries in the past 2 years the republican majority has helped those two countries in stopping drugs at the source cutting drug production through eradication policies and alternative crop policies now would you not know it but in 1993 again there was almost no coca produced in colombia it was almost all produced in bolivia and peru but this administration through its policy managed to make colombia the largest producer of cocaine in the world in 1993 there was almost no heroin produced in colombia most of our heroin came in from asia or through afghanistan and balkan routes this administration managed through its policy of stopping aid and assistance to colombia to make colombia the source of 75 percent of the heroin it is the largest heroin producer in the world today they managed to do all this since 1993 the way this heroin and cocaine is now coming up the colombians have formed cartels with the mexicans and then some is coming up through and past puerto rico and into the united states through these routes so the very direct policy despite letters despite pleas by the chairman of our committee on international relations by the chairman of the committee on government reform by numerous members of congress to get helicopters to get ammunition to get assistance and resources to colombia to stop this production and trafficking colombia now is the major producing area i will say that with some of those individuals i mentioned the gentleman from new york the gentleman from indiana we participated in a dedication and contract signing of six helicopters which are on their way to colombia these are black hawk helicopters to start in an eradication program now our other problem area and this is mexico and despite this administration giving nafta approval underwriting the finances of mexico mexico is the largest source of illegal narcotics coming into the united states through these routes again despite being a good ally a good friend mexico has turned almost into a narcoterrorist state as a result of the amount of trafficking so this is the pattern of illegal narcotics heroin cocaine and methamphetamine coming into the united states today what is disturbing about this pattern is that in spite of all of the assistance this congress and this administration has given to mexico mexico has really slapped the united states in the face when both of my colleagues who are on the floor were with me 2 years ago in march the house of representatives passed a resolution asking mexico to help in about five different areas first of all we asked mexico to extradite a major drug trafficker or major drug traffickers assist us in extraditing those who have been indicted in the united states mexican nationals and send them to the united states and what did we get in return this past week the new york times setback for mexico in 2 big drug cases major producer again we have helped mexico we are a good friend and ally of mexico what did they do let me read this mexico city may 19 efforts to prosecute the amezcua contreras brothers whom the american authorities say rank among the worlds largest producers of illegal methamphetamines appear to be collapsing they have in fact let these brothers who were part of this methamphetamine operation off the hook dropped the charges against them two of them i understand are still held in detention one has been set free even the mexicans who are corrupt from the bottom to the very top and i can prove what i am saying with those remarks are chagrined that even their judicial system has collapsed even their judicial system is corrupt and these decisions go as high as their supreme court in mexico so it is a very sad day when we have not one major mexican drug dealer extradited to date we have had one mexican national and that is only one and that was a minor player but not one major mexican drug dealer has been extradited to the united states and again this is in spite of the assistance that this congress has given that country in spite of financial aid nafta trade and other benefits that we have bestowed on mexico and part of it is because of the failed policy of this administration they made a charade out of the certification process rather than decertifying mexico and giving them a national interest waiver and holding them under the microscope of our law which says that we must certify whether a country is fully cooperating now i ask you is mexico fully cooperating when they let drug traffickers out is mexico fully cooperating when last year these statistics were provided us mexican drug seizures were down in 1998 opium was down the seizure of opium in mexico 56 percent the seizure of cocaine was down in mexico by 35 percent the seizure of vehicles and vessels involved in narcotic trafficking was down to top it off we held a hearing in our subcommittee to find out what was going on in mexico and i talked about corruption this is a march 16 article from the new york times this should absolutely frighten every member of congress every member and parliamentarian in any civilized legislative body to know that one country could be so corrupt from the bottom to the top and particularly one that is a close ally of the united states this article by tim golden details how our customs agents penetrated mexican military and other mexican high officials offices and discovered that the mexicans in this case a general and maybe as high as the minister of defense were attempting to launder 1 15 billion that is one individual was trying to launder 1 15 billion that is how high the corruption has

pretty basic fundamental question that is is it right is it fair that under our tax code married working couples pay more in taxes than an identical couple in an identical situation living together outside of marriage it is just wrong that under our tax code 28 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married is it right that under our tax code that couples are punished that they are penalized when they choose to participate in societys most basic institution that is the fact today i represent a diverse district on the south side of chicago in the south suburbs in cook and will counties in joliet and the bedroom and farm communities they all ask the same question they wonder why for 30 years now washington has punished marriage and no one has gone back to fix it i am pleased that under the leadership of the speaker of the house the gentleman from illinois this house has made it a top priority to eliminate and wipe out the marriage tax penalty suffered by 28 million married working couples the speaker has said that the elimination of the marriage tax penalty will be fast out of the box and on a fast track through the senate and to the president wiping out the marriage tax penalty and stopping the tax code from punishing marriage the marriage tax penalty really results from our very complicated tax code and unfortunately because we have a progressive tax code if couples get married they getpunished that is just wrong here is how the marriage tax penalty works here is how it ends up say there is a machinist and a school teacher in joliet illinois a machinist who works at caterpillar at the local plant the machinist makes that heavy equipment the big bulldozers and cranes and earthmoving equipment he makes 31 500 a year if he is single he pays taxes in the 15 percent tax bracket now if he meets a tenured public school teacher in the joliet public school system with an identical income as long as she is single she pays in the 15 percent tax bracket but if this school teacher and machinist choose to get married when they are married they file jointly and add together their income what happens then is their combined income is 63 000 and that pushes them into the 28 percent tax bracket and they are punished with an almost 1 400 marriage tax penalty if they chose to stay single and live together outside of marriage they would avoid that marriage tax penalty in this case because this machinist and school teacher chose to live in holy matrimony societys most basic institution they are punished under our tax code i find most americans whether they live in the city or the suburbs or the country think it is just wrong and they want congress and the president to do something about it that is why i am so pleased because i have a another couple from joliet illinois two public school teachers shad and michelle hallihan they came and told me they suffered a marriage tax penalty of 1 000 they just had a baby michelle told me congressman tell your colleagues in the congress that 1 000 average in marriage tax penalty is 3 000 diapers of course they point out that 1 400 the average marriage tax penalty is one years tuition in the local community college well house republicans are going to do something about this we are going to work to eliminate the marriage tax penalty and the speaker has put it on a fast track this wednesday tomorrow the house committee on ways and means will have committee action on legislation that will essentially wipe out the marriage tax penalty for a majority of those who suffer it we double the standard deduction for joint filers to twice that of singles which will not only help 3 million couples who will no longer have to itemize 9h91 printed on recycled paper their taxes but will essentially wipe out their marriage tax penalty for those who do not itemize of course many homeowners itemize in order to help homeowners and those who itemize from suffering the marriage tax penalty we widen the 15 percent bracket so that joint filers can earn twice as much as single filers and still pay in the 15 percent bracket and for lowincome families who benefit from the earned income tax credit we also provide marriage tax relief for poor families and lowincome families who suffer from the marriage tax penalty it is good commonsense legislation and deserves overwhelming bipartisan support there is no excuse to vote against legislation wiping out the marriage tax penalty the speaker of the house has also indicated that by valentines day that we are going to pass this through to help couples like shad and michelle hallihan who suffer the marriage tax penalty and what better valentines day gift to give 28 million married working couples than legislation which will eliminate the marriage tax penalty think in these terms 1 400 is a drop in the bucket here in washington it is chump change for the washington bureaucrats and the big spenders here in washington but back home in illinois a 1 400 marriage tax penalty is one years tuition at a local community college 3 months of day care for shad and michelle for their child it is several months worth of car payments it is most of the contribution to an ira for michelle it is real money for real people house republicans are making it a priority we invite the democrats to join with us let us make it a bipartisan effort to eliminate the marriage tax penalty what better valentines day gift to give 28 million married working couples i urge my colleagues to pass the legislation with bipartisan support and send it to the senate and send it on the president i rise today to highlight what is arguably the most unfair provision in the unitedstates tax code the marriage tax penalty i want to thank you for your long term interest in bringing parity to the tax burden imposed on working married couples compared to a couple living together outside of marriage this month president clinton gave his state of the union address outlining many of the things he will spend the budget surplus on house republicans want to preserve 100 of the social security surplus for social security and medicare and use the nonsocial security surplus for paying down the debt and to bring fairness to the taxcode a surplus provided by the bipartisan budget agreement which cut waste put americas fiscal house in order and held washingtons feet to the fire to balance the budget while president clinton parades a long list of new spending totaling 72 billion in new programswe believe that a top priority after saving social security and paying down thenational debt should be returning the budget surplus to americas families as additional middleclass tax relief this congress has given more tax relief to the middle class and working poor than any congress of the last half century i think the issue of the marriage penalty can best be framed by asking these questions do americans feel its fair that our tax code imposes a higher tax penalty on marriage do americans feel its fair that the average married working couple pays almost 1 400 more in taxes than a couple with almost idential income living together outside of marriage is it right that our tax code provides an incentive to get divorced in fact today the only form one can file to avoid the marriage tax penalty is paperwork for divorce and that is just wrong since 1969 our tax laws have punished married couples when both spouses work for no other reason than the decision to be joined in holy matrimony more than 21 million couples a year are penalized they pay more in taxes than they would if they were single not only is the marriage penalty unfair its wrong that our tax code punishes societys most basic institution the marriage tax penalty exacts a disproportionate toll on working women and lower income couples with children in many cases it is a working womens issue let me give you an example of how the marriage tax penalty unfairly affects middle class married working couples forexample a machinist at a caterpillar manufacturing plant in my home district of joliet makes 31 500 a year in salary his wife is a tenured elementary school teacher also bringing home 31 500 a year in salary if they would both file their taxes as singles as individuals they would pay 15"],

of america has lost a great senator georgia has lost a great leader and the republican party in georgia has lost the father of our party paul coverdell was the minority leader in the state senate he was the state republican party chairman he was the official georgia connection to the bush white house he was the director of the peace corps he was the united states senator and then also in the great bushcoverdell legacy the official contact for the george w bush campaign he put our party on the map and the reason i underscore that is i believe the state and its citizens are better for it i believe that having two parties gives our voters every day a choice and i believe i am a better republican because of democrat opposition i hope that our democrat counterparts and i am sure they will agree they would say they are better democrats because of republican opposition the state indeed is the winner paul coverdell was a great strategist i remember in 1974 my mother who is a great newspaper clipper sent me an article called the gospel according to paul and it was talking about this young guy running for the state senate in atlanta who was doing strange things like going door to door and having living room coffees and roadside sign wavings and he was struggling in an uphill battle in a democratcontrolled state to win but he did win i believe as the gentleman from georgia has already said there were only three republican members in the senate at the time i know by the time i got to the state house there were a whopping nine senators coverdell was the minority leader but while he did not have numerical superiority he did not let that keep him out of the ideas arena and he was very competitive on ideas at that time governor joe frank harris was introducing a number of dui laws the gentleman from georgia will remember coverdell passed and sponsored a bill in the senate that said you know it is not just enough to give somebody a heftier dui penalty what we have found through research is a lot of these people are addicted to alcohol we need to put in a component of mandatory assessment to see if they are addicted and then we cannot just leave them addicted to alcohol we need to have mandatory or at least optional treatment this was a solid idea i remember being on the motor vehicles committee as he pushed that paul coverdell was an ideas man he also had a great world view as director of the peace corps he did not just use this okay this is my political plumb for helping president bush along the campaign trail he used it to promote farming in third world countries economic growth and development medical help indeed he saw the formula for world prosperity meant world peace and it was great and important for the united states of america to be there leading the way paul coverdell was a sobbyeyed patriot in many ways i remember when he was running for the unitedstates senate and i had him in my living room for a coffee and at that time all of these people came and they were asking very lofty intellectual questions about the world situation paul was hanging in there with the best of them in the middle of this my small daughter ann 4 years old at the time had left the playground where all of these kids were came running into the living room crashed through the circle of adults to the middle of where this dignified unitedstates senatorial candidate was speaking and said daddy it was my turn in line to go down the slide and they pushed me down the slide and i fell down and hurt my heinie to which the whole audience starting laughing senator coverdell was there acknowledged the little girl and her plight and went on with his speech and i thought it was so cute because he did not lose control he kept that coverdell dignity through the whole thing and indeed he carried that dignity and that gentleman manner with him everywhere he went as the gentleman from georgia has already said he was a great organizer and a communicator i remember in the 1992 campaign during the runoff one day he was at georgia southern university all kinds of people there and he had done a tv and a radio interview and he turned on his watch and he said jack we have to go to this event i said paul the game has not started he said well we have got a schedule i said but paul all of these people are here he said well we really need to get to savannah and keep our schedule indeed we did leave and go to savannah i was totally amazed and a little bit irritated by this and only later did i realize the importance of him in terms of strategy it meant everything and that is why he could accomplish all of the things that he did accomplish in our area he fought as the gentleman from georgia said for the veterans the active soldiers at fort stewart but the veterans in our area agriculture we all know in south georgia good old senator cloverdale that is what the farmers would always call him well let us just go ask cloverdale and they loved mr cloverdale education if i go to talk to the teachers about educational savings acts they like that idea if i talk to seniors about social security and lockbox ideas they like that idea paul coverdell had the uncanny ability not just to have an opinion on every issue but have a thought on every issue and a consequential action he was a man of action his civility as the gentleman from georgia knows he worked with him very closely on passing the c b king courthouse in albany georgia i remember the gentleman from georgia knows he was friends of mr bond when mr bond left the state senate to run for the congressional seat which the gentleman was successful in obtaining paul coverdell was one of the men in the georgia senate who stood up and gave a great farewell speech for julian bond i remember watching that and saying here is a liberal democrat and the conservative republican leader of the state what is he doing i said there is a lesson here bipartisanship and civility is important and you should never let politics rule over policy a week ago he called me at my home on sunday we had an issue in our area with the federal law enforcement training center and we kind of got off path he said jack i think we are a little out of sync here i just want to make sure that you and i are okay on this it was typical of coverdell because i think so many of us including me and especially me would have said all right you are way off base i am right and you are wrong not paul he made it so that it was just so easy to get along he also told me a couple of weeks ago in a private conversation about committing to the team when you are a member of congress when you are a member of an issue and you are associated with that issue commit to your team and be proud to be on that team even if the vote is an uncomfortable one he talked to me about nancy he said you know we are doing a little bit with real estate i have to tell you nancy is better at real estate than i am she is real good at it i will tell you what you men know it is a rare man who really privately one on one takes time to brag about his wife to another man and that is a sign of a great marriage and a great husband and true love paul coverdell was a good republican a great strategist a great ideas man had a world view had civility and integrity a great organizer he was energetic he was a great communicator and a loyalist in short paul coverdell was a statesman years ago there was another paul on this earth and he tells us in a scripture that it is better to wear out than rust out i would not submit to you that paul coverdell wore out but i would also say he certainly did not wear out and maybe in this institution which he loves so dearly we could say and he would

chairman goodling for their work on this proposal and their continuing efforts to empower our local school districts my mother was a school teacher so ive always placed a high priority on our public schools when i meet with my constituents there is widespread support for proposals that give our teachers the tools and flexibility to better prepare our students for the challenges of the 21 st century edflex is an example of the type of positive solutions that congress the state govemors and our local communities can work on together this measure has the bipartism support of our nations governors mainstreet businesses and education groups under this program states can apply for waivers to burdensome federal regulations in exchange the states then must remove requirements that interfere with our schools main purpose of improving academic achievement my home state of ohio is one of the 12 states that participated in the initial demonstration program on which the current proposal is based during the 105th congress i worked closely on this program with ohios former govemor george voinovich who was recently elected to the unitedstates senate i remain a strong proponent of the program which has allowed individual schools freed from the burden of both state and federal regulations to focus on their core mission of teaching our children under edflex communities have successfully reduced class size expanded title i services improved student achievement and reduced paperwork too often the approach washington has taken is to solve all problems simply by throwing more money at them in the past it has been much easier for congress to create new programs with new layers of administrative bureaucracy to write pages of guidelines rules and regulations for local schools to follow this program takes the opposite approach edflex is a forwardthinking program which recognizes the importance of local control of our schools instead of new program rules and regulations we free our local school boards administrators teachers and personnel to concentrate on what they do best teaching our kids ive worked with school boards administrators and teachers across ohios 7th district i know firsthand that they are a capable committed and caring group of individuals who have dedicated their time and energies to our kids lets give these individuals and communities

foundation which provides financial and motivational support to youth and helps children realize that they can raise the quality of their lives this resolution cites payton as a christian who was viewed by his friends and former classmates as a funloving warm and smiling man with a joy of life his family and his sport on february 2 when walter payton announced that he was suffering from a rare liver disease he was frail and emotional i shall never forget sitting at the television and watching him as the tears rolled down his face payton brought joy into the lives of millions of fans but at 45 years old only 45 years old he needed the gift of life his liver disease could only be cured by an organ transplant a transplant he would never unfortunately receive on november 1 walter payton died of a disease malignancy of the bowel duct he had undergone chemotherapy and radiation treatment to stem the cancer but because of the aggressive nature of the malignancy and because it had spread to other areas a liver transplant even if a donor were available could no longer save walter paytons life by encouraging the 20 000 fans who attended a memorial service for payton to register as organ donors walter paytons family used his death to highlight the importance of organ donations and the gift of life in other words it was their effort to try to bring out of his death new life i could not help but think of walter payton when it was reported that in my own district of baltimore maryland a 60yearold mother of three from bowie donated a kidney to a 51yearold father from california what was special about this situation was that it was a good samaritan organ donation good samaritan organ donations in which the donor offers an organ to a recipient who is a complete stranger are very unusual most live organ donors are relatives or friends of the recipient the donor sue rouch read about the desperate need for an organ donor in a newspaper and called various local hospitals offering to become a donor she is quoted as saying its a gift im a generous person and giving and receiving is all part of the same circle of life last friday she gave her gift to rick sirak if not for sue rouch a generous and compassionate human being rick sirak may have suffered the same fate as our hero walter payton like rouch walter payton was a generous and caring man he was famous and world renowned but he was a good samaritan who cared for the abused and the needy among us he celebrated life and brought joy into the lives of so many he touched gregory brown coach of the calumet park
