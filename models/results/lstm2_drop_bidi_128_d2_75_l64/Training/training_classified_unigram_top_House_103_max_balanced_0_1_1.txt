for yielding me this time i rise to join with my colleagues from louisiana and florida who very eloquently have been discussing over the past several weeks the fact that one of the greatest attacks on the process of representative government has taken place since the january 5 back in the 95th congress when we looked at legislation that was moving to the floor of the house fully 85 percent of the rules which came to the floor bringing legislation for us to consider were open allowing for free and fair debate and 15 percent of the rules were restricted e 1730 by restrictive rules i mean of course members who represent today 600 000 americans who were prevented from being able to stand up on the floor when they were considering legislation and offer amendments we have seen since that time when only 15 percent of the rules being restrictive we look most recently at the 102d congress when 66 percent of the rules were restrictive preventing members from having the opportunity to represent their constituents and stand up on the floor of the house and offer amendments now as we have moved into this 103d congress since january 5 we have had 10 major pieces of legislation which have been considered here on the house floor ranging from the motorvoter legislation family planning family and medical leave extend unemployment benefits a wide range of measures every single one of them have been gag rules preventing members from having the right to stand up and represent their constituents i think the important point that needs to be made here is not that members right are being violated but the rights of the american people are being violated there are literally millions and millions of americans who are disenfranchised by virtue of the fact that their representatives cannot stand here in the well of the house and offer an amendment that is really what has happened the american people are being told very arrogantly by the majority leadership in this institution that representative government does not work that we know better for you than the person who you elected to represent you unfortunately that has existed throughout the entire 103d congress as we are here in midapril now one of the things that we have done we are so frustrated and it is not just republicans it is not just minority members but democrats too have been prevented from having the right to offer amendments so one of the things that we have done on our side we have established the republican leadership task force on deliberative democracy specifically geared toward looking at this problem i happen to believe as i have said that this is probably the greatest attack on the process of representative government that we have seen in literally decades i cannot imagine what would be a greater attack on the process of democratic government than preventing elected representatives from having the right to amend legislation there are a wide range of things that have been used to prevent us from working our will on legislation in behalf of our constituents for example there is something known as the 3day layover provision on legislation it is a very simple and basic thing that came into place came into effect in 1970 what it says is that there should be 3 days for a committee report to be available for members before they have to vote on legislation so what do we do we consistently waive that 3day layover measure in fact on 77 percent of the rules that have been considered in the 103d congress the 3day layover period provision has been totally thrown out the window let us look again at the history of this in 1972 the average length of measures that were considered here on the house floor were 3 2 pages and constantly people were allowed to have 3 days to read work with their staffs and look at measures before they voted on them today the average length of measures that we consider here is 12 8 pages so if you look at the very small number of pages that existed in the early 1970s and 3 days to consider it and today the longer bills that we have to look at and the fact that we have in many cases virtually no time to even read these measures at all it is again a very serious attack on the process of representative government now as i look at the constant waivers that we have on the 3day layover provision one must ask would an individual embark on a major contract for the purchase of a home or an automobile or any small business person without having had the opportunity to look at it whether that person is expert on it or a staff member or an assistant no of course not and yet the representatives in this house are consistently being told that they have to vote on measures without having the opportunity to look at those at all over the past few weeks we have had very rigorous debates on the budget one of the other things that we do consistently is that we waive the budget act this debate that we went through on consideration of the budget is something that was taken very seriously on the house floor and yet when we upstairs in the rules committee consider this what happens is that we throw it out the window meaning that there is very little meaning to what it is that we are actually doing when we are trying to pass and put into place a budget then of course the attack on the amendment process itself democrats and republicans sit in line up in the rules committee my friend the gentleman from sanibel fl mr goes and myself sit there and listen to expert witnesses who have very valid ideas like the gentleman from louisiana like the gentleman from indiana they come before our committee and they request the opportunity to consider their amendments on the floor of the house and what happens consistently on partyline votes we see the leadership sit there and vote no denying the rights of members to even consider these ideas on the floor of the house in full view of the american public so i think that the goal of our task force on deliberative democracy is to let the american people know that one of the greatest attacks on representative government has taken place in the first 3 2 months of 1993 the gentleman from florida and i and the gentleman from new york and the gentleman from tennessee will work diligently to try to ensure that the rights of not only our minority members but the rights of democrats are recognized so that they can in fact offer amendments on the house floor and that the arrogance of the democrat leadership will not continue to stifle the will of the majority membership of this house members on both sides of the aisle who want to have the rights of their constituents recognized so i thank my friend the gentleman from indiana for giving me the opportunity to share in his time and i congratulate those who want to struggle in behalf of greater democracy of greater opportunity for the rights of their constituents to be heard here on the floor of the house"], [0.00437074014917016,

that will follow it as the gentleman from texas has indicated this rule waives all points of order against the conference report for the national defense authorization and all points of order against its consideration this type of rule was requested by the appropriate members from both sides of the aisle and so members can feel comfortable in supporting it i must take this opportunity today to address many of the same thoughts i expressed last week when the conference report for defense appropriations was considered first i believe we must commend the work done by the new chairman and the new ranking republican member of the armed services committee they have some of the most difficult assignments of any members in this house and they truly do an outstanding job they have performed their tasks very well and have done the best they could under some extraordinarily challenging circumstances we must also be very appreciative of the fact that the authorizers on one hand and the appropriators on the other kept in contact with each other throughout their respective conferences and they both produced conference reports which are reasonably consistent and harmonious with each other all of that said i must state again my profound concern about the slippery slope down which our nation is heading a moment ago i referred to extraordinary challenges that were presented to the conferees on this bill and i cannot repeat it often enough the clinton administration is proceeding with a 4year plan of defense spending which comes in far below what the administrations own bottomup review has defined as the minimum amount necessary to protect the security of the country that simple fact of life is going to come back someday and haunt this house and every member in itnot to mention the other body and the white house itself and i am going to keep repeating it and challenging this house every chance i get as a warning that our nation is becoming increasingly unprepared to deal with a major crisis abroad and to protect our essential interests i refer right now to the washington post story in sundays edition entitled army challenges clinton defense cuts that is our unitedstates army challenging our presidents defense cuts the first paragraph of this article says the army has mounted a vigorous challenge to the clinton administrations program of defense cuts warning in an internal document that planned reductions will leave the service substantially weakened and ultimately threaten national security now how does all that happen here is another article from the new york times and i am including these articles at this point in the record the other article is entitled pentagons new somalia bill is 300 million i have heard you on this floor i have heard good democrats like the gentleman from missouri who is the chairman of the armed forces subcommittee on personnel talk about the serious problems we are going to have with our national defense because of the drain that is taking place in somalia and many other places around this world where we are involved in u n operations this is putting a severe drain on our national defense preparedness and something has got to be done about it i have grave doubts about the capacity of this administration to deal with a significant crisis that is taking place right now at the 38th parallel in a place called korea or in the former soviet bloc or the middle east just for exampies if the present trend continues who knows what potentially disastrous situations a new administration will inherit in 1997 or whenever the inevitable crisis is finally at our doorstep i do riot want anybody coming back here and saying they did not know i urge members to support the rule the rule is a fair rule we want to expedite the business of this house i would ask for a yes voteon the rule when the time comes pentagons nzw somalia bill is 300 million by eric schnitt washington the pentagon plans to ask congress for an additional s300 million to pay for the military operation in somalia through next march when american forces are to withdraw a senior defense department official said on friday the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the extra money was needed because the somalia operation was being paid for with money earmarked for other activities like routine training in the 1994 fiscal year the request which still needs white house approval is in addition to the 3251 billion 1994 military budget approved on wednesday and signed by president clinton on thursday that budget sets aside no money for the somalia mission the pentagon has historically paid for military operationswarfighting as well as peacekeepingthrough an account called op erations and maintenance the pentagon sometimes recoups the costs of specific military missions through a supplemental appropriation last year for example congress approved 750 million to help offset the 981 5 million in incremental costs the military incurred in somalia from december 1992 when the operation started to september 1993 the senior official said that if congress did not approve the extra spending for this year the pentagon might be forced to reduce routine training and combat exercises a step that congress has vigorously opposed the services are paying for somalia by borrowing money they planned to spend in the third and fourth quarters of this fiscal year the official said for that reason pentagon and congressional officials say lawmakers would probably approve the extra financing the united states now haa about 7 450 troops in somalia and 8 600 on ships offshore combat readiness has become an increasingly important concern both at the pontaion and on capitol hill senior commanders recall with anguish that the military reductions after the vietnam war in the late 1970s drastically cut training time and remlted in combat units fielded at levels well below full strength the army in particular has

sponsor of this important resolution i am proud that my colleagues who have cosponsored this measure have provided the opportunity for our nation to support our courageous servicemen of the vietnamese

continue to oppose the normalization of relations with vietnam until all remaining questions have been answered and our government has received a full accounting of those who are prisoners of war or missing in action i am concerned that information that has recently come to light indicates that north vietnam may have made available captured united states airmen to china or the former soviet union for interrogation or for holding them both countries have always denied this however newly declassified united states intelligence reports and a 1967 document from the soviet embassy in hanoi discloses that the chinese and the soviets had access to captured united states airmen and to downed united states aircraft while no returned pows have reported being held in china several of the intelligence documents specifically mention camps which were used to detain united states prisoners based upon this new sensitive information i believe that vietnam and china must be more forthcoming

extending the mostfavorednation status to china and by normalizing relations with vietnam our nation would gain economically and our balance of trade would be improved i disagree we must not simply go on with normalization we must learn from our history and teach these lessons so that future generations will not repeat yesterdays mistakes furthermore i believe that if and when mostfavorednation

security for instance that if we have an increase in the eligible population and if there is a large increase in inflation it just might be helpful if we understand that the real effect of that is on therecipients that is all the gentleman from south carolina does he suggests that instead of congress being given one piece of information instead of the public only being given one perspective they be given two i ask members what on earth is wrong with that"], [0.9909507036209106, 0.9909507036209106, 0, "i rise in support of s 1130 legislation that permanently reauthorizes the federal employees leave sharing act of 1988 public law 100566 this measurs makes both the leave transfer and leave bank programs permanent thereby allowing federal employees to donate annual leave to coworkers who have used up their annual leave and sick leave as a result of a prolonged illness when enpedencing severe personal or medical problems sometimes the gft of time is exactly what the doctor ordered i commend the managers of this legislation for bringing it to the floor so quickly both the leave transfer and leave bank proposals are highly sueceesful and merit permanent continuatlen the leave transfer program allows employees to donate their annual leave directly to other federal employees and the leave bank program allows employees to donate their annual leave to a leave bank for use by any member of the bank stricken by a medical emergency when time is needed for a full recovery this program is a tremendous aid what we are doing through these leave sharing programs is merely encouraging the generous behavior of our federal employees i leamed of the leave sharing idea after a constituent robert hague wrote me about his desire to share some of his leave with a blind colleague barbara dipietrantonlo who as a relatively new employee had not accrued enough leave to cover time needed to train a new guide dog barbaras ability to carry out her job effectively is dependent of the mobility she has achieved through reliance on a guide dog without the generosity of mr hague barbara would have had to take annual leave or leave without pay to train with her new dog leave shadng removes that financial impediment to proper treatment of a sickness physical handicap or other problem whose proper treatment depends on the healing power of time in 1988 the congress approved my amendment to the fiscal year 1968 continuing appropriations bill creating a 1year governmentwide leave sharing program for federal employees who were facing medical or family emergencies congress has extended this program since then and after studying the program and finding that it has been highly successful we are now prepared to extend this authority permanently i am a strong advocate of programs that will help strengthen the families of our federal employees and support this and other innovative measures that improve the working environment for federal workers also as the nations largest employer this measure may serve as a model for state governments and private industry to follow when designing leave programs for ill employees i encourage members to support this permanent and longawaited extension of leave sharing authority"], [0.9906815886497498, 0.9906815886497498, 0, "i would like to associate myself with the remarks of the gentleman from mississippi in essence this amendment would extend the right of appeal for military technicians beyond the adjutant general of the state and outside of the military therefore i must oppose it the amendment infringes on the constitutionality provided for the states to supervise the militia in terms of appointing officers and regulating training but just as importantly on a practical level the amendment would undermine the readiness of the army and air national guard units by deemphasizing the military nature of the technical programs divided control over state and national guard units and the personnel there would undermine the military chain of command and downgrade the readiness of national guard units this is at a time when we are trying to improve their readiness because of an expected increase in reliance

of the development of fusion energy in this country which is currently the subject of probably the most extensive international cooperation in science that we have the socalled iter project which involves scientists from the united states from europe from japan and from russia teams from each of these countries are currently in the final stages of developing the engineering design for the first prototype power plant using fusion energy which should be under construction within the next 4 or 5 years and be completed perhaps by during that rather lengthy period of time 10 years or more we need to continue with the research necessary to improve the processes of fusion energy this is the purpcse of the program which the gentleman from new jersey referred to the tpx which will allow the fusion scientists and that community of scientists to continue to work on the improvements in the fusion process itself that will finally lead to improvements in the design beyond the first prototype power plant to the fully commercial power plants which will be begin to construct and deploy in the years probably after 2010 all of these things come together in a comprehensive longterm
