very eloquently have been discussing over the past several weeks the fact that one of the greatest attacks on the process of representative government has taken place since the january 5 back in the 95th congress when we looked at legislation that was moving to the floor of the house fully 85 percent of the rules which came to the floor bringing legislation for us to consider were open allowing for free and fair debate and 15 percent of the rules were restricted e 1730 by restrictive rules i mean of course members who represent today 600 000 americans who were prevented from being able to stand up on the floor when they were considering legislation and offer amendments we have seen since that time when only 15 percent of the rules being restrictive we look most recently at the 102d congress when 66 percent of the rules were restrictive preventing members from having the opportunity to represent their constituents and stand up on the floor of the house and offer amendments now as we have moved into this 103d congress since january 5 we have had 10 major pieces of legislation which have been considered here on the house floor ranging from the motorvoter legislation family planning family and medical leave extend unemployment benefits a wide range of measures every single one of them have been gag rules preventing members from having the right to stand up and represent their constituents i think the important point that needs to be made here is not that members right are being violated but the rights of the american people are being violated there are literally millions and millions of americans who are disenfranchised by virtue of the fact that their representatives cannot stand here in the well of the house and offer an amendment that is really what has happened the american people are being told very arrogantly by the majority leadership in this institution that representative government does not work that we know better for you than the person who you elected to represent you unfortunately that has existed throughout the entire 103d congress as we are here in midapril now one of the things that we have done we are so frustrated and it is not just republicans it is not just minority members but democrats too have been prevented from having the right to offer amendments so one of the things that we have done on our side we have established the republican leadership task force on deliberative democracy specifically geared toward looking at this problem i happen to believe as i have said that this is probably the greatest attack on the process of representative government that we have seen in literally decades i cannot imagine what would be a greater attack on the process of democratic government than preventing elected representatives from having the right to amend legislation there are a wide range of things that have been used to prevent us from working our will on legislation in behalf of our constituents for example there is something known as the 3day layover provision on legislation it is a very simple and basic thing that came into place came into effect in 1970 what it says is that there should be 3 days for a committee report to be available for members before they have to vote on legislation so what do we do we consistently waive that 3day layover measure in fact on 77 percent of the rules that have been considered in the 103d congress the 3day layover period provision has been totally thrown out the window let us look again at the history of this in 1972 the average length of measures that were considered here on the house floor were 3 2 pages and constantly people were allowed to have 3 days to read work with their staffs and look at measures before they voted on them today the average length of measures that we consider here is 12 8 pages so if you look at the very small number of pages that existed in the early 1970s and 3 days to consider it and today the longer bills that we have to look at and the fact that we have in many cases virtually no time to even read these measures at all it is again a very serious attack on the process of representative government now as i look at the constant waivers that we have on the 3day layover provision one must ask would an individual embark on a major contract for the purchase of a home or an automobile or any small business person without having had the opportunity to look at it whether that person is expert on it or a staff member or an assistant no of course not and yet the representatives in this house are consistently being told that they have to vote on measures without having the opportunity to look at those at all over the past few weeks we have had very rigorous debates on the budget one of the other things that we do consistently is that we waive the budget act this debate that we went through on consideration of the budget is something that was taken very seriously on the house floor and yet when we upstairs in the rules committee consider this what happens is that we throw it out the window meaning that there is very little meaning to what it is that we are actually doing when we are trying to pass and put into place a budget then of course the attack on the amendment process itself democrats and republicans sit in line up in the rules committee my friend the gentleman from sanibel fl mr goes and myself sit there and listen to expert witnesses who have very valid ideas like the gentleman from louisiana like the gentleman from indiana they come before our committee and they request the opportunity to consider their amendments on the floor of the house and what happens consistently on partyline votes we see the leadership sit there and vote no denying the rights of members to even consider these ideas on the floor of the house in full view of the american public so i think that the goal of our task force on deliberative democracy is to let the american people know that one of the greatest attacks on representative government has taken place in the first 3 2 months of 1993 the gentleman from florida and i and the gentleman from new york and the gentleman from tennessee will work diligently to try to ensure that the rights of not only our minority members but the rights of democrats are recognized so that they can in fact offer amendments on the house floor and that the arrogance of the democrat leadership will not continue to stifle the will of the majority membership of this house members on both sides of the aisle who want to have the rights of their constituents recognized so i thank my friend the gentleman from indiana for giving me the opportunity to share in his time and i congratulate those who want to struggle in behalf of greater democracy of greater opportunity for the rights of their constituents to be heard here on the floor of the house"], [0.0136875594034791, 0.0136875594034791, 0, "last night president clinton called for bold persistent experimentation president clinton should not experiment with middleclass tax hikes and the american taxpayers do not deserve to be guinea pigs tax hikes will not solve the deficit problem we must hold the line on spending and reduce or eliminate federal programs i recently received a graphic reminder from barbara bowling of dallas tx she offers a sign similar to the one we saw at the clinton campaign when it comes to the economy its the spending stupidt the administration should reduce spending before they even talk about tax increases they have got the cart before the horse president clinton may try to convince us that tax hikes are patriotic but without going after spending president clintons tax hikes become just a patriotic pickpocket"], [0.013729658909142017,

republican alternative that will also be considered tomorrow i hope during the course of this hour that i will be joined by some of my other colleagues from the committee on the budget to discuss this obviously tomorrow we begin a long and important debate a long debate because very rarely in the house in the course of the year do we have debates that have as much as 10 hours as we will have tomorrow and thursday of general debate on the subject of the budget but i think it is appropriate that we take that kind of time to have this discussion about the budget about the various alternatives because i believe that the budget in a very real way and also the stimulus package that we will debate the following day establishes the fundamental policy for this congress and for this country as to where we are going to go i believe that the debate tomorrow and the next day will highlight some of the major differences that exist between the plan that the republicans have put forward in the committee on the budget and that which president clinton and the democrats on the committee on the budget have put forward but i thought it would be appropriate to spend a little bit of time this evening as a preview to this date that we will have on the following day because i think that this issue is of such importance it is really important to get the fundamentals of this debate down to understand what the real differences are let me just if i might highlight for my colleagues what i think is the fundamental philosophical difference and then i would like to yield to the gentleman from colorado a distinguished member of the committee on the budget to discuss this but let me just very quickly highlight what i think are the differences leaving aside the numbers which after all the budget resolution is numbers and tomorrow when our colleagues see this budget resolution all they will see is a handful of numbers showing budget authority and outlay for fiscal year 1994 by function but as i tried to point out yesterday or last week in the committee on the budget it is policy which drives the numbers you have to have some kind of fundamental underlying policy to get to the numbers that are in the budget resolution if one was to leave those numbers aside for a moment and talk about what is the policy which drives this budget resolution and again i want to say that i am including in this the economic stimulus package and the reconciliation package that we will have later in the year that deals with the tax part of the legislation the tax increases proposed by the administration the economic stimulus package the spending part the budget resolution which sets out spending targets for the coming year and the reconciliation bill the added taxes are the heart of this are the three parts that constitute the heart of this overall budget debate in one sentence i think the democratic plan is one that calls for more spending that is very clear the economic stimulus has 16 billion of spending in it it calls for more taxes that is very clear the president has more than 316 billion of taxes over the next 5 years in his proposal that is the largest tax increase in american history by far and it has spending cuts but spending cuts that only come in the third and fourth year of the budget resolution in other words the philosophy of the democratic proposal and the democratio proposal consists of that budget which was offered by president clinton or brought to the congress by presie h 1265 dent clinton and the changes that have been subsequently made by the democrats in the committee on the budget to that to add another 62 billion of spending cuts to it and we will come back to that in a little bit perhaps in some of our dialog here but in that overall process they have said we are going to do the spending part first we are going to do the tax part second and only later trust us we will get to the spending cuts the real deficit reduction i think all of us in this body know certainly all of us that have been around here more than one session of congress and actually even a freshman can know this from having observed the process here and having observed this body from afar in the past that the congress rarely if ever gets to the spending cuts if they do not enact them up front so the philosophy of the democrat plan is more spending more taxes and an ephemeral promise of spending cuts and deficit ieduction in the future that is a prescription for disaster the republican plan on the other hand is labeled i think accurately it is called cut spending first very simply we believe that we ought to go after the spending part first we ought to cut spending have real spending cuts first and then and only then if that is not sufficient to meet the kind of deficit reduction we need to have in order to have a balanced budget then we would say to the president mr president come back to us come back to the american people and ask for more spending cuts or then ask for a tax increase but do not ask for the tax increase first and give us another one of those illusory promises that we are going to get spending cuts sometime down the road in the future if we weigh these two proposals in the balance the democrat proposal says more spending more government and more taxes to pay for that the republican proposal is one that suggests that we should have less government we should not have new taxes and we should have real spending cuts in order to achieve the kind of deficit reduction we need in a very real sense i think this difference is one that has characterized the fundamental difference between the democrat and the republican parties for a number of years there are those from the other side of the aisle my good friends on the other side of the aisle that believe and i know they believe very sincerely very genuinely that government is the answer to the problems if we just had more government spending if we just had more government intervention if we just had more government programs then we could solve the problems that exist in this country many of us ion our side of the aisle believe that government should be reduced in size that it should be reduced inits scope of regulation of its involvement in the private lives of people in the private sector of our economy then and only then can we have the kind of engine of growth that is needed in order to grow and to solve the problems of this country of productivity of our ability to compete in the world to solve the economic growth that is needed in order to reduce the deficit and to ultimately reduce the national debt that mr spealker characterizes the difference between the two proposals that are before us today let me just give one other quick figure to summarize the differences then i will yield to my good friend the gentleman from colorado mr allarj very quickly on tay increases the clinton proposal is 316 billion of tax increases over the next 5 years the republican plan is no tax ncreases that is the stimulus package and all the other investments called for by the president in everything from immunization to head start to demonstration highway and road projects and all kinds of investments and more government programs is 186 billion over the next 5 years of new spending the republican plan is no new spending the defense cuts the additional defense cuts in addition to the 25 percent that we are already making now in defense the president would cut another 112 billion from that we have seen the problems of that in states like california with the base closings that we are facing there now we have seen the problems that that could pose for us when a country like north korea pulls out of the nonproliferation pact on nuclear weapons and threatens to send this world into a very deep problem of nuclear proliferation there the republican plan would call for an additional 60 billion and we believe that is a responsible additional reduction in defense spending over the next 5 years no part of the budget has come close to taking the kinds of reductions over the last several years in real reductions of real dollars that defense has taken in nondefense cuts president clinton would cut another 156 billion over the next 5 years we would cut 370 billion of spending cuts deficit reduction would be under the clinton plan 362 billion and under our plan 430 billion there it is there it is more deficit reduotion under our plam about the same when we add in the additional cuts that the democrats are talking about roughly the same in deficit reduction however they get theirs by a factor of 3 to 1 by more taxes on the american people and the hope the promise of those spending cuts coming in outlying years ours is making the spending cuts now putting them in place now so that we have those~spending cute not only this year but guaranteed for each of the next several years without raising taxes on the american people let me yield to my good friend the gentleman from colorado who i might add has been one of the really hardworking members of the committee on the budget it has been really a pleasure to work with him"], [0.013810468837618828, 0.013810468837618828, 0, "covina ca could be the start of a trend this morning in the housesenate conference the largest tax bill in the history of the world got underway as the conferees begin their work they and all my colleagues should take heed of a recent event in the city of covina ca recently the city council in covina enacted a 6percent utility tax this equates to about 12 60 per household per month the 219 members who voted for the clinton tax bill earlier this year take note the day before yesterday covina held a recall electionthe entire covina city council was recalled remember new jersey it once had a legislature solidly controlled by bigtaxing bigspending democrats so that the 219 members who voted for the largest tax increase in the history of the world can reflect on what the covina recallmight mean to their careers i would like in order to underscore this point to include in the rcord a copy of an article from the los angeles times about the election in covina ca the article referred to follows from the loa angeles times july 16 1993 fear of rhoall trend grows wrrm latest ouster by andrew lepage the resounding recall tuesday of the en tire covina city council because of the citys 6 utility tax is the latest sign that voter resentment over new taxes and fees is grow g city officials taxpayer groups and academics say were seeing more and more of these recalls efforts many of them successful throughout the state said alan heslop a professor of government studies at claremont mokenna college generally money in the form of some kind of tax or fee is at the bottom of the dispute i suspect a lot of city council members throughout the state will be very frightened by what occurred in covina said sheri erlewne spokeswoman for the california league of cities we are seeing recall being considered more and more in communities its ugly out thereevery city is facing what covina is facing urlewne said there just isnt enough money anymore to pay for what the people want record numbers of covina voters angry over the tax on gas electricity water and telephone bills that the council imposed last year to balance its budget flocked to the polls to dump their council members the vote set up an oct 5 special election in which five newcomers will be elected until then current members will remain on the council its tough im extremely disappointed and im sorry for the community councilman john king said i think were seeing a desperate moment in covinas history our financial problems wont go awayit wont be any easier for the new council mayor henry morgan and council members king chris richardson chris lancaster and richard gratton were defeated morgan will lose his seat on the south coast air quality management district all of them said they had done everything in their power to convince voters that they adopted the tax on utility bills only after cutting the city budget to the bone further outs they said would weaken police fire and library services but recall leaders argued that the tax would not be needed if the council had kept a tight rein on finances the tax costs the average household about 12 60 a month this recall will have a broad impactcities will start checking their budgets two or three more times to make sure theyve done everything possible to out costs said kris vosburgh executive director of the howard jarvis taxpayers assn a growing number of citizen groups have been calling his organization he said for advice on fighting new taxes and fees in their communities the common thread is that these people feel their elected officials are detached arrogant and dont share the problems of the average taxpayer vosburgh said the electorate of covina a town of 43 000 in the flatlands of the east san gabriel valley includes a sizable population of elderly people on fixed incomes retirees started the petition drive that forced the council into a recall election helping to organize 200 volunteers and to raise about 8 000 in donations for prorecall mailers and signs that dotted lawns throughout the community were overwhelmed by the outcome said stop the utility tax committee leader earl p purkhiser a retired economics and accounting professor at mt san antonio college in walnut the next council will have to spend money like it was its own city officials elsewhere say that they have had little choice but to raise taxes but that educating the public is the key to avoiding voter backlash in pasadena where voters last month overwhelmin ly approved a 1 3million tax to bolster the library system mayor rick cole said the citys yearlong campaign to educate residents on the need for the tax was the key to success despite the successful recall drive in covina over the utility tax he said it would be stupid to draw the conclusion that you cant raise taxes rather he said council members should realize that the public cant be railroaded and councils must take the time to build community understanding of their budget crisis and possible solutions before imposing a new tax the same day the covina council went down to defeat the nearby community of sierra madre tentatively approved a 6 utility tax city officials said there was little opposition to the tax because the city reached out to the public at several community meetings to discuss the budget deficit utility taxes have been around for years but cities have increasingly turned to them and to assessment fees that appear on property tax bills during harsh economic times taxpayer groups say the taxes and fees are convenient ways to skirt proposition 13 because most do not need to go before voters the antitax backlash in covina is hardly unique over the last two years several recall groups in the state have succeeded in recalling a majority of the council members upset over an assessment for lighting and landscaping voters in the northern california town of pacifica ousted four of five council members last year in morgan hill council approval of a 9 utility tax led to the recall of three of five council members in december 1991 for taxpayer groups covinas recall election is convincing proof that the tax revolt of the proposition 13 era is note dead we think san gabriel valley governments will sit up and take notice that

disapprove we work for the people of this country and 3 out of 5 do not like the job we are doing anybody who got that kind of message from their boss ought to be thinking about changing the way they are conducting themselves that poll incidentally was taken before this weeks worth of arm twisting dealmaking and political buyouts by the democrat leadership of the congress to ensure that the presidents tax plan would squak by though it squeaked by by the narrowest of margins i hate to think how much further those credibility ratings will sink after americans begin to shell out the 250 billion in new taxes that are being imposed by president clintons plan only to see jobs lost which is what the prediction is and spending increased which is a certainty and the debt rising after 5 years which is also a certainty and a prediction the debt is not falling it is rising when people lose faith in this institution they lose faith in its product as well people do not feel they can trust their congress to listen to them and represent their priorities and that is especially true after this week when 10 million americans attempted to reach their representatives by phone and we all know it a majority called to say do not do it do not pass that tax bill but the democrats went ahead and did it anyway and we all saw the spectacle last evening americans do not believe congress is

powerful members including the chairman of the committee on ways and means who clearly is a major architect of this monstrous tax bill that just passed and questions remain about the stock dealings of the very speaker of this institution who is causing consternation among americans because he has filed suit against the people of washington state in an attempt to derail term limits against this backdrop of perks privileges institutional arrogance of power the american people now see this massive tax bill they see higher income tax rates rates that curiously enough are just high enough that

their tax bills and planned prudently for the year they see tax bills that hit middleclass seniors hard fiftyseven percent of the seniors involved in this are middle class while breaking the trust of the social security system which affects all seniors or anybody in the social security system they see all of this at the same time as they see massive new spending and we did it today ws did a

faded if there ever was a proclinton cast of press coverage it has been washed away by whitewater washington journalists have only two enduring biases against entrenched power and in favor of a good yarn wrong steve roberts the press also has entrenched biases in favor of abortion and sodomy these are articles of faith for the dominant media culture i have a quote that i will read later from a journalist named ethan something up in boston who says anybody who is prolife today is an uncivilized person in this modern society but i will go with your two enduring biases against entrenched power in other words circle the uboats the wolfpack tear down anybody who is in the white house even if he is one of you own and in favor of a good yarn both prejudices are now hurting clinton when whitewater first surfaced during the 1992 campaign if was dismissed by the press as too complicated i want to pause right there because mona charen whom i greatly admire also said it was complicated i want to tell my fellow americans all my colleagues and you it is not too complicated this is not celestial navigation in the cockpit of an f100 at night trying to shoot the stars to train yourself to go to moscow alone and drop an atom bomb that is what i did that is complicated this is not rocket science it is not brain surgery it is long it is long that is different from logarithms it is not complicated it is intricate which is different it is long the american people must and will i predict take the time to sort through the players and the facts and try to follow during the secret period of fiske and all of these engineered subpoenas blocking all of this from us trying to take it at least through the 1994 election and as the wall street journal says and i am hoping they are paranoid through the 1996 election i heard that special prosecutor fiske subpoenaed george stephanopoulos last night that is no 11 i cannot believe all of these subpoenas in the white house and treasury the problem is there should be congressional subpoenas as well back to steve roberts he continues that when the story was revived last fall team clinton thought the same thing would happen that because it was too complicated the press would give up but there is a difference between to way the press covers a campaign and an administration the white house is finding that out 1240 even what seems small in the political context takes on new size and meaning when viewed through the magnifying lens of the white house i predicted that on this floor in september and october 1992 i said this will all come out if he makes it to the white house moreover a campaign ends in a few months an administration lasts years 4 years giving editors more time and incentive to invest resources in investigative projects almost 20 years after richard nixons resignation the washington press corps is still inspired by watergate it was the good war of the journalistic fraternity a whole generation now filling the major beats and editor slots in many major news organizations who aredreaming of being the next woodward and bernstein of the day when dustin hoffman or bob redford or now tom cruise or denzel washington or holly hunter would play them in the movies one of the biggest mistakes the white house made in handling whitewater was to set those dreams racing in the press as clinton advisor now with his subpoena george stephanopolus admits the administrations damage control operation did more damage than control how is david gergen earning his huge salary over there suddenly the story was no longer about boring bank records and intricate land deals in a small rural state a beautiful state the old words like the lyrics from a halfforgotten battle hymn were echoing through the newsrooms of the capital subpoena shredding machines grand jury burn bags and most resonant of all coverup coverup coverup the republicans are doing their part playing on the guilt feelings of the press corps i have been doing that for 30 years folks it is not a change with me they have gotten too cozy with the clintons by demanding equalopportunity cynicism that is what we are supposed to be demanding and

something had to fill the news vacuum is that the way news and history run in america now filling vacuums only last december bill clinton was already starting to sour on the press complaining to rolling stone magazine that he had not gotten one damn bit of credit from the kneejerk liberal press george bush or any expresident would certainly nod in sympathy now here is what i have lined up before me for a chronology next week here is the toady liberal press structuring a personal 60 minutes showit was only 13 minutes longfollowing the super bowl in 1992 january 26 1992 i ask permission to put that in the record following that is the unbelievable disgusting nightline show in february on lincolns birthday when at the request of rick kaplan of the abc a charter fob friend of bill who meets with him at the renaissance group koppel is conned by his former 10year producer rick kaplan into giving clinton his own nightline they actually went into overtime and that is when mandy grunwald gave them this line all i have been asked about by the press are women i didnt sleep with and a draft i didnt dodge now i do not know how to handle this and follow house rules suffice to say that there are two untruths in that statement about the draft and gennifer flowers that line was written by mandy grunwald the daughter of a 25year senior editor of time she could not keep her mouth

that i found in the new york times and then those of you can go to the library in a few days please do not call mee call your own congressman for the congressional record of march 18 1994 and we will

to go and defend hungarians south koreans vietnamese anybody else who called i was not a boy i was a man later on clinton slips and calls himself a boy again and then after a quick pause says a young man twentythree he never went to class at rhodes he is not a rhodes scholar he was a rhodes scholarship nominee he never went to class the second year all he did was conduct teachins at london university arranged demonstrations that he coordinated here with strobe talbott strobe talbotts brotherinlaw derek shearer married strobes sister who was a rhodes scholar over there he has been

of the distinguished speakers own remarks even though he did not believe in the october surprise and that george bush was zipping across the atlantic on an sr71 do you know what one of my young staffers told me today that i missed last night jimmy carter was the president during the 1980 election how in the name of god did we waste 30 million on gary sicks stupid book charging that george

history before that first we heard about the restaurant scandal then we heard about the gym scandal then we heard about the post office scandal then we heard about the bank scandal now we hear about the post office scandal again in the last election more incumbents were rejected by the electorate than any time in contemporary history the irony of all this is if you look at all these scandals all these scandals that i just mentioned there is one innocuous procedure in this house that inflicts far more damage on the citizens of america than all of these scandals put together websters ninth new collegiate dictionary defines fraud as deceit trickery intentional perversion of truth an act of deceiving or misrepresenting one who is not what he pretends to be tonight we are exposing the biggest fraud in the history of congress a fraud that has endured for 63 years tonight i am joined by several freshmen newlyelected congressmen who are among the most reformminded individuals a lot of them are referred to as the reform brigade they have been instrumental in bringing us to this point tonight that when understood will be considered the most significant reform of the last six decades these freshman members have wondered as i did when i was first elected why is it that legislation that enjoys a mandate by the people that for example might poll 90 percent of the people in favor of it somehow is introduced then disappears never to be brought up again as if it fell into a deep dark hole tonight we are going to solve the 63year old mystery of that deep dark hole the cornerstone of the foundation of fraud hypocrisy deceit and even institutional corruption is found in a rule first articulated in 1930 by then speaker of the house john nance garner now something strange was going on i am not sure since i am not a journalist why it was but prior to 1930 for some reason nobody really cared what happened in the house of representatives the journalists did not write about it the editorial boards did not endorse things they just did not seem to care so you had this arrogant feeling and attitude around here that we could do anything we wanted we were immune no one was going to say anything about it it was perpetuating the insiders club but in 1930 there was an investigative reporter who started focusing on e h 6081 voting behavior and they even started actually printing and editorializing on specific votes on sensitive subjects keep in mind this was back in 1930 so the leadership caucused behind closed doors i would imagine they devised a system where they could hide their positions from the public i mean after all what business was it of the public to know what the congresspeople were doing what right did they have at that time to know how their congressmen were voting speaker john nance garner and his leadership in congress devised a system that was ingenious they provided for a discharge petition that would be sacrosanct in secret and here is how it worked i know this is complicated the complication of this fraud is what has made it so difficult to expose for 63 years but you need to know how this thing works bills and resolutions that were popular at home but were against the wishes of the leadership insiders would be assigned to a committee such as the rules committee with the unwritten understanding with the chairman of the committee that they would never bring it up for a vote let us be sure we understand this congressmen could cosponsor legislation that is popular at home knowing all the time that it would never have to be voted on the only way it could come out of committee for a recorded floor vote would be for 218 members of the house of representatives to sign a discharge petition the discharge petition would be kept in a locked drawer and if the camera can go right up behind the gentlemans head there to the left of the podium where the book is the journal that is where the locked drawer is the sinister locked drawer that only members of congress can see and it is kept in secret the only time this drawer could be opened would be during a house session and then only the members of the congress could see the discharge petition a member of congress could sign it he could look at it but he could not record anything that was in it he could not even take a pen or a pencil up to the desk with him now we have got two problems here in exposing this thing first of all how do you know under these conditions who signed the discharge peti tion if you cannot go up there and write them down because you have to get up to 218 names and that is really a job this apparently has never been done until now we have 200 names on a discharge petition i showed this list to someone today and this senlor member told me that to the best of his recollection he had been here over 30 years be has never seen a list compiled of everyone who signed a discharge petition if a member of congress somehow figured out how to obtain a list of those who signed he could not divulge the names to the public if he did he would be subject to punishment which could include expulsion from the house of representatives in fact when a member signs a discharge petition he is given a notice called important notice now if the camera could look over there at this important notice this is what is given to each member when he signs a discharge petition i will read in part it says the publication or release of the names of the members who have signed this or any other discharge petition is strictly prohibited under the precedents of the house the prerogative of individual members to determine when and whether to sign a discharge petition is in the nature of a private and serious agreement it goes on to say that you are even violating the house rules if you tell someone how many names are on the discharge petition there are 200 on this discharge petition no 2 which i just filed under the house rules now i am not a lawyer and certainly not a constitutional lawyer but i beieve this directly defies article i of the constitution which states each house shall keep a journal of its proceedings now does this not clearly imply that the journal is for public consumption our founding fathers did not say a secret journal they referred to secrecy but historically this has been when talking about intimate personnel matters or matters of national security i am a great believer in the covert possibility and activities that can go on because the public cannot know everything that affects our national security but it certainly does not mean you hide your votes and your positions from the people at home can you imagine being ex~elled from the house of representatives just for telling the truth to the folks back home what a foolproof system they set up in 1930 a member could make the people at home think that he was voting their wishes while all the time he was opposing them and it worked years went by decades went by no one found out no one found out until 63 years later tonight everyone finds out tonight we have the ability to ignite and annihiliate that cornerstone of the foundation of fraud hypocrisy deceit and institutional corruption and this is how we will do it in march of this year i introduced house resolution 134 house resolution 134 is a very simple resolution some of the greatest reforms we have are in one sentence all this says is once a motion to discharge has been filed the clerk shall make the signatures a matter of public record that is all it says very simple let the people know let me repeat that once a motion to discharge has been filed the clerk shall make the signatures a matter of public record of course as i expected this was assigned to the rules committee think of the irony of all this the resolution to reform this discharge petition process is bottled up in the rules committee and the only way to get it out is with a discharge petition so i started getting signatures from individuals i thought to be reform oriented one at a time those here with me tonight the ones you are seeing here are the ones who were the very first to sign this discharge petition and that gave courage to others to defy the leadership in signing this i had to explain to each individual the process i did not know it when i was first elected to congress and then ask them if they go up and sign discharge petition no 2 up at the desk and come back and tell me what number they had assigned to them each one has a number i was no 1 jimmy duncan was no 2 buck mckeon was no 3 and it goes on all the way to no 200 that we have on this think of the time it took now 5 months later we have 200 signatures on the discharge petition no 2 it takes 218 to discharge it to a vote so we are 18 short only 18 signatures away from the most significant reform in 63 years now how can we get the additional 18 signatures listen listen very carefully the day after tomorrow we will be leaving for our august recess i am announcing here on the floor of the house of representatives that the day after tomorrow at the close of business i am disclosing to the wall street journal and they have agreed to print the names of all members who have not signed discharge petition no 2 let me repeat this so it is abundantly clear to all members of congress and have it into the record so it cannot be confused i will actually read this i am announcing tonight here on the floor of the house of representatives that the day after tomorrow at the close of business i am disclosing to the wall street journal and they have agreed to print the names of all members who have not signed discharge petition no 2 i understand i have talked it over with my wife that i am taking a chance of being expelled for my actions expelled from the house of representatives from the position which i have been in elected to represent over a half million voters that those half million citizens of oklahoma could be disenfranchised through the enforcement of the rule that has somehow endured over six decades an evenly conceived rule we intend to dispose of with house resolution 134 and discharge petition no 2 i am doing this because no one else over the past 63 years has been willing to do it i am not excited about it i wish someone else would do it but i am doing it to destroy that pillar on which most of the fraud deceit and hypocrisy around here depend in order to exist i am doing it because the people deserve to know what is going on in this place so tonight i encourage my colleagues to sign discharge petition no 2 and do it quickly because once that 218th signature only 18 more people goes on the discharge petition the books are closed no one else can sign it and you are too late to get in on this reform and it will come out and we will vote on it and we will pass it in doing so imagine what we will be able to accomplish we will be able to debate and participate in recorded votes on those issues that are so important to mainstream america they asked the question which all you guys you freshmen have heard at your townhall meetings i think you have had them already they say why is it the congress refuses to pass legislation that all you guys want all the people in your districts want and the answer is now obvious they hide their positions behind a 63yearold house rule i really do not want to be overly dramatic but i say to my colleagues do you all understand the significance of this there will be no place left to hide our votes and our positions from the people back home the fraud would die forever one short trip to the secret door to sign discharge petition no 2 is all it takes take a friend with you"], [0.013989577069878578, 0.013989577069878578, 0, "i yield myself such time as i might consume once again i rise to join my friend from texas in urging all members to support the rule but not necessarily the conference report that will follow it as the gentleman from texas has indicated this rule waives all points of order against the conference report for the national defense authorization and all points of order against its consideration this type of rule was requested by the appropriate members from both sides of the aisle and so members can feel comfortable in supporting it i must take this opportunity today to address many of the same thoughts i expressed last week when the conference report for defense appropriations was considered first i believe we must commend the work done by the new chairman and the new ranking republican member of the armed services committee they have some of the most difficult assignments of any members in this house and they truly do an outstanding job they have performed their tasks very well and have done the best they could under some extraordinarily challenging circumstances we must also be very appreciative of the fact that the authorizers on one hand and the appropriators on the other kept in contact with each other throughout their respective conferences and they both produced conference reports which are reasonably consistent and harmonious with each other all of that said i must state again my profound concern about the slippery slope down which our nation is heading a moment ago i referred to extraordinary challenges that were presented to the conferees on this bill and i cannot repeat it often enough the clinton administration is proceeding with a 4year plan of defense spending which comes in far below what the administrations own bottomup review has defined as the minimum amount necessary to protect the security of the country that simple fact of life is going to come back someday and haunt this house and every member in itnot to mention the other body and the white house itself and i am going to keep repeating it and challenging this house every chance i get as a warning that our nation is becoming increasingly unprepared to deal with a major crisis abroad and to protect our essential interests i refer right now to the washington post story in sundays edition entitled army challenges clinton defense cuts that is our unitedstates army challenging our presidents defense cuts the first paragraph of this article says the army has mounted a vigorous challenge to the clinton administrations program of defense cuts warning in an internal document that planned reductions will leave the service substantially weakened and ultimately threaten national security now how does all that happen here is another article from the new york times and i am including these articles at this point in the record the other article is entitled pentagons new somalia bill is 300 million i have heard you on this floor i have heard good democrats like the gentleman from missouri who is the chairman of the armed forces subcommittee on personnel talk about the serious problems we are going to have with our national defense because of the drain that is taking place in somalia and many other places around this world where we are involved in u n operations this is putting a severe drain on our national defense preparedness and something has got to be done about it i have grave doubts about the capacity of this administration to deal with a significant crisis that is taking place right now at the 38th parallel in a place called korea or in the former soviet bloc or the middle east just for exampies if the present trend continues who knows what potentially disastrous situations a new administration will inherit in 1997 or whenever the inevitable crisis is finally at our doorstep i do riot want anybody coming back here and saying they did not know i urge members to support the rule the rule is a fair rule we want to expedite the business of this house i would ask for a yes voteon the rule when the time comes pentagons nzw somalia bill is 300 million by eric schnitt washington the pentagon plans to ask congress for an additional s300 million to pay for the military operation in somalia through next march when american forces are to withdraw a senior defense department official said on friday the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the extra money was needed because the somalia operation was being paid for with money earmarked for other activities like routine training in the 1994 fiscal year the request which still needs white house approval is in addition to the 3251 billion 1994 military budget approved on wednesday and signed by president clinton on thursday that budget sets aside no money for the somalia mission the pentagon has historically paid for military operationswarfighting as well as peacekeepingthrough an account called op erations and maintenance the pentagon sometimes recoups the costs of specific military missions through a supplemental appropriation last year for example congress approved 750 million to help offset the 981 5 million in incremental costs the military incurred in somalia from december 1992 when the operation started to september 1993 the senior official said that if congress did not approve the extra spending for this year the pentagon might be forced to reduce routine training and combat exercises a step that congress has vigorously opposed the services are paying for somalia by borrowing money they planned to spend in the third and fourth quarters of this fiscal year the official said for that reason pentagon and congressional officials say lawmakers would probably approve the extra financing the united states now haa about 7 450 troops in somalia and 8 600 on ships offshore combat readiness has become an increasingly important concern both at the pontaion and on capitol hill senior commanders recall with anguish that the military reductions after the vietnam war in the late 1970s drastically cut training time and remlted in combat units fielded at levels well below full strength the army in particular has complained that the pentagons longterm

carried over the continuation of the houses committee on banking finance and urban affairs the socalled bnl bank or the atlanta branch of the italian bank that we commonly and popularly know as the bnl or the banca nazionale del lavoro and say in a way that repeats what i said in the last special order 2 weeks ago that even though it got embroiled and it did at the very outset of last year which was a political year a presidential election year the basic facts surrounding the investigation on the part of the committee on banking finance and urban affairs were kind of overshadowed the basic thrust the underlying reason that we were concentrating on that one as well as some related occurrences such as the bcci and one or two lesser publicized but similar in pattern of their activity incidents and experiences all of which as i said in the last speech go back personally to my interest since 1975 when i caused the bringing of 2 days of hearings in my hometown of san antonio tx i was not the chairman then but i was the chairman of the subcommittee on international finance which chair i held for 10 years and having come across some information back home very disturbing information concerning the very heavy volume of money transactions across the border daily with no record whatsoever and given that antecedent activities of mine were the ones that led to the ultimate exposure of a ringand became notorious in texas as a drugimporting ring and one that became notorious in my area because of its operation similar to the organized crime in the united states i was the one who revealed the extensive stolen automobile vehicles and other vehicles in exchange for drugs i brought out over a 3 year period of time beginning in 1970 i took to the floor and mentioned in two special orders at the outset my concern i appeared before the local county grand jury four times then finally with some startling events going back to the arrest of the ring leader in san antonio who had been coming back and forth from san antonio at will from mexico into san antonio and back and forth and involving some san antonans who i first became acquainted with when i was a chief juvenile probation officer for the bexar county juvenile court soon after the war and who were simply astounded that they were not even middie school graduates yet telling me they had traveled to paris and were wearing very expensive clothing and had fancy cars one thing led to another to make a long story short and i soon discovered the police were calling me to find out what if anything i could connect with some hits or murders that had been taking place in one particular part of the southern edge of the city and the county the question i asked of the police was the nature of the occupation if any of the individuals who were found gangsterstyle knocked off they said well you know its kind of interesting you would ask that because they are all involved in the automobile business either automobile salesmen or agents or something so then i got some more tips that there was a steady stream of stolen automobiles some of them coming down what i call the eastern seaboard from this area the washington area down to florida and then across the southern tier of the country over to texas through houston and then to the southern border crossing in brownavillematamoros the other was more central it was the new yorkchicagodallassan antoniomexicolaredonew laredo and then there was a third that i found out about the second year i went into that and that was the las vegas down to el paso across ciudad juarez and into mexico then the last was the western seaboard that was california down through calexeco and across into baja ca in exchange i received very sophisticated information how a certain make of carfor instance a pickup a ford pickupwould bring more than the same year model of a sedan in exchange for a given amount of kilos of either marijuana or at that time it was not so much cocaine as the other principal hard drug then to my alarm i soon came to the conclusion that these hits were being made because these fellows had gotten mixed up in that trade and somehow or another were caught cheating and they were knocked off the police were baffled because they had no clues then i found that one whole nest of this gang was headquartered in a rural area 10 miles south of nuevo laredo across the texas border on one occasion they got so brazen when the federal government of mex1co sent what they called the judicial officials and by golly they hit two of them gangster fashion in the very city of nuevo laredo so i then tried to put things together came to the conclusion and verified one particular death that what was happening and the reason san antonio police or any other local police would find it difficult to solve the crime was that these individuals were crossing the border which they could do at will all they had to do was cross the bridge pay the fee and then instead of going right over to laredo they kept on coming 3 hours or 3 hours later they were in san antonio they would make the hit and 4 hours later they were across the border in mexico so then things happened and there was a lot of disbelief until i then made an inquiry of the national automobile theft bureau and asked for statistics which they provided and they verified by 1972 that traffic was over a billion dollars worth of stolen automobiles in exchange for hard drugs and marijuana so i then took to the floor and i made several special orders the years went by the grand jury had a hearing or two they did not indict anybody but then came the arrest of the leader at a motel in san antonio by a courageous police officer of the san antonio police force he attempted to resist but he was overwhelmed he was then placed in the county jail and while in the county jail his lawyers were able to get a cell that had a telephone and other services and comforts denied any other regular denizen of the county jail i was soon informed by a former friend of mine that went back to my juvenile officer days that the fellow as using the phone even to do some drug businessout of the county jail so he was tried and sentenced and sent to the penitentiary he had not been there long when he grabbed four hostages two men and two women and he held himself up in the huntsville state penitentiary and held everybody at bay a couple days finally he demanded that his attorney who had represented him in san antonio come and negotiate with him the first thing he demanded was i want to see what they are going to do about that guy henry gonzalez nobody could figure out why this guy was mentioning my name to make a long story short it all ended up in a ghastly tragedy he ended up in killing the hostages or at least half of them and he himself was killed everybody then thought that ended it well of course not soon after that and right soon after president carters administration had started we had another momentous case that to this day is still mysterious this involved the case of sante barrio this is very interesting one of the most interesting individuals anybody could read about in a novel he had been an italian policeman but he was young very versatile managed to dominate two or three languages went to france ended up in new york then subsequent to that he was hired by the newyork crime commission the celebrated crime commission that began to target the french drug connection he was given credit for having exposed the french connection he then came to washington and went to work for what used to be called the bureau of narcotics or the forerunner and in fact he was here when i think the dea was begun as such he was then transferred to mexico city as the deas agent in charge one day there was a big story in the san antonio papers saying that this man had been arrested in a local hotel and charged with bribery because while he was in that hotel room he had been caught exchanging money and drugs or something with an equaly fascinating engrossing and mysterious individual by the name of picot who was a french agent e3 1540 now whether he was a double agent or a triple agent or whatever you have nobody has ever really bothered to find out his true nature was never determined what happened was that when sante barrio was sent to mexico city this agent picot followed him there sante barrio had been able to help break the french connection by being able to pass himself off at will he was so able he could pass himself as an italian frenchman a spaniard what have you and one of those that he latched on to in breaking the french connection at that time was this fellow picot so when i read that and then found that the man that had been in that hotel room with him apparently giving him the money was this fellow picot i began to ask questions of the local police who said well of course this is federal and i said well all i want to know is how did it come about that sante barrio would come to san antonio tx to this very prominent hotel they could not answer that but then for his protection they said and under the protest of his lawyer at the time in san antonio he was removed up to a county about 90 miles north of san antonio and then be pause of the insistent protest of the attorney who said i cannot consult with my client its difficult its unfair its unjust they brought him back to the bexar county jail now mind you this was the same jail where this ringleader known as carrasco that i mentioned was the one who had held the hostages and got killed had been able to get a phone installed in his cell and everything else they bring back sante barrio from that county north of bexar the first day he is there in the afternoon or evening early evening his given a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and he goes into a convulsion and a coma and he lies in a coma until the following day almost 6 months at which time he expires but he never regained consciousness and the case was dismissed that is closed but never never really resolved i was determined to see a little bit more information gathered it seemed to me that if a man who was relatively young and had been in perfect health and was brought down to the county jail given a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and then collapsed into a coma that it had to be more than just some coincidental happenstance well that was enshrouded and still is in a lot of mystery except that the dea took a very very strong position and then said well he was taking bribes now he was never tried he was never indicted he was never heard to explain his side only whatever in privity he told his lawyer obviously his lawyer was going to defend him from the charges but lo and behold the dea says well you know what were going to deny his widow his benefits his pension and other benefits and in the meanwhile i came to the floor i reported all of this to my colleagues i stated that there was a connection but almost coincidentally we have the attempted murder of the federal district attorney for the western district which is more or less headquartered in san antonio and extends all the way to el paso 600 miles away and a big mystery the attempt was made there in san antonio in the suburbs right outside of my district up in an exclusive suburb and the police could not ascertain anything even though the way it was done was the assistant federal attorney was getting up early in the morning about 8 am he was going to get in his car going to the local office when a vanlike automobile pulled up in front of him the rear door opened and they fired these submachine guns just riddled his car with bullets now he ducked he said he ducked under the dash but to me it was intimidation pure and simple i felt that it was more than an attempt to murder him because if what were obviously professional hit men had wanted to kill him they could have done it so i felt it was an attempt to intimidate the law enforcement side of things and i had predicted that if those murders that had been reported to the police and had defied resolution and were tied in with this very sophisticated ring of importation and exportation of stolen vehicles that the day would come when these interests well entrenched highly organized obviously infiltrating levels of society that made us weak to the defense against crime such as business law enforcement government officials and the ability to defy any coordinated attempt and with great ease defy local attempts to control it so as a result of all that i did bring about one thing after reporting to the white house and asking for some help and alerting the executive branch the federal agencies then decided that they would coordinate certain activities with the local police and the state enforcement police of texas but what bothered me the most was that i was getting reports that there were aircraft coming in daily at will across the border with nobody checking and that some of that money that they were bringing in in undetermined amounts was beginning to filter into our banking and s l system well the first indications were just kind of glimmers i was more concerned about this sophisticated car business so together with the federal agents the local police and the state they conducted a 26hour sting in my area in my district and in 26 hours they were able to ascertain and stop individuals that were driving 26 motorcycles that were stolen and headed for mexico about 60 or so if i remember correctly pickups about 70 or so regular passenger automobiles then it was brought to our attention that even when they apprehended the individual and they said this is a car that has been reported stolen that some of the vital parts other than the engine itself were not marked so they could not really be traced to the rightful owner as a result of that i introduced legislation that finally was enacted some 4 or 5 years later whereby you do have now registration of some of the vital portions of an automobile that was one byproduct by way of legislation but on the other what worried me was that if these forces then become so brazen and i was really horrified at my own self after having told the local police officials and the newspaper editors that i feared they would be so brazen that they would defy and probably endanger the lives or limbs of some of the local law enforcement agents but i never dreamed they would do that to an assistant federal attorney as they did in the case of this individual known as mr kerr james kerr the police called me and so did an editor of the paper and said look we have been putting things together you have been speaking is this what you had in mind i said i never dreamed they would be on this level but it is obviously connected with mr kerrs prosecution in the western district of el paso where they had some celebrated cases involving a group that had connections with las vegas 0 the judge john wood was very very severe on these drug mules and peddlers and what not mr kerr was one of his chief prosecutors so i then took to the floor i had no less than two speeches to this body which i labeled king crime i said one thing we found out about these chop shops in chicago for instance was the underworld was so sophisticated they had a computer system to synchronize what kind of car or parts they wanted i said that compared to that our law enforcement agents are not that well organized because what bothered me is that customs that may be checking on something on the ground or maybe even in the air were not checking with the immigration service and they in turn were not correlating with the law enforcement agencies whether it is federal much less the state or local and we have to get some coordination so that is the reason for that sting operation i think everybody was astonished when in that brief period of time they found this volume just on this screen new york chicago austin dallas san antonio and laredo well about 5 months after i had begun to speak on king crime and i brought out how the nation was imperiled and that until it even halfway resolved that that we would not be able to really control the destiny of our society and that in the meanwhile organized crime was so sophisticated and so well entrenched in every level of our society and had penetrated our society at every level that i did not see at what cost or by what means we could extricate ourselves i then received a phone call just about 5 months after i had begun to speak at the opening of that congress which was 1979 and it was from mr kerr mr kerr said say i am here in d c because the fbi is going to honor me and award me a certificate for my performance in enforcement and the fact that my life was at risk and i just cannot leave washington without setting up a meeting to meet you or if possible could you come to the ceremonies i said no i cant beoause we are going to be in session and we are going to be having votes so he said well i will go by so he did i brought him in on the thursday before memorial day of 1979 he said let me ask you to do something on behalf of a request by judge john wood he and every one of us has been keeping up even though you havent been reported in the san antonio papers i did not go out making releases or anything i made my presentation tg my colleagues and advised them of the bills i thought would be necessary for us to entertain and i introduced some of them and that was it but they knew down there he said judge wood would like for you to autograph a photo and send it to him so he could put it in his chambers i said well i will be delighted to he said you know we have and unitedstates marshals surveillance of the federal judges but judge wood has been chafing and he finally got rid of them last week well i could not hold myself i said mr kerr you mean judge wood has dispensed with his protection from the unitedstates marshals he said oh yes he just couldnt i said look when are you going back he said this saturday i said please make a beeline to judge wood or call him from here and tell him by all means to get those marshals back on the job do not dispense with their services well i thought maybe i was overreacting because mr kerr did not seem to be overly wrought but he was impressed he itaid well i will do that i went down that weekend to my district as i do every time the house is not in session on monday we had memorial day i was going to come back the next day at noon when on that tuesday at about 8 30 in the morning i get a phone call from the editor of one of the papers he says henry i am glad i caught you do you know that judge wood has just been shot i said what he said yes he was getting into his car leaving his dwelling at this apartment complex again in this suburb where the assistant district attorney lived and he was fired upon i said well was he hurt he said oh he was killed and we wanted you to know we are on our way but the report just came through we have been quite amazed that you would have been so concerned i said well i just cant tell you how i feel i feel terrible so then i came and took the floor and kept on talking in the meanwhile there were no leads i then tried to get a resolution first i tried to get the president to set aside up to 1 million for the fbi to ha e as reward money for any information my theory was and i think i turned out to be somewhat correct that whoever made that hit was not only professional but had spent a long time in figuring out that complex and must have had access to blueprints and everything else and knew exactly where to be and where to shoot he did not fire a half a dozen shots at all one did it police could not find a rifle they could not find clues they could not find anything no witnesses and i came forth and said we can at least flush out the people that for 1 million will throw out this lower echelon hitman or you can get the middle the top dog that is going to be hard there are a lot of connections up there and it will be tough but if you can get that amount of money it is not going to take 50 000 or 100 000 but you get a million so finally i introduced a resolution to provide 3 million because i could not get any favorable agreement to that and i was resisted and got nowhere with it so then i kept talking soon months passed and it looked like the john w wood case would die as i said then like jimmy hoffa and i said as long as i have breath i will not cease from concentrating on this well finally i forget how many months it was almost a year i went home on a friday and i was thereat the house when at about 4 or 5 the phone rang and it was judge webster the director of the fbi at that time and he said congressman i am calling you because in about 2 hours we are going to have a press release announcing the first four indictments on the john wood case and i was calling you to thank you because had it not been for your efforts that enabled us to have such things as a task force which we had difficulty but with you raising your voice day after day week after week month after month we want you to know that we give you credit and we want to thank you for it and that is the reason i am calling you now it is confidential until we have this release in about an hour or two i forget whether he said 1 hour or 2 hours well that to me was all the reward i would ever hope to get but as it turned out they finally had an arrest and a conviction they had the presumed hitman apparently his background showed he was a pro they had what i would say might be middle but i do not know that the real real powers behind that fated attempt to intimidate as i pointed out time after time besides the assassination of president kennedy this is the assassination not only of this century but of any time in the history of the federal judiciary you never have a federal judge assassinated and we cannot tolerate to have that you cannot have anybody even if in the long run unsuccessfully in the short run over a period of time having any part of our judiciary our law enforcement body under the intimidation of a powerful but insidious and destructive element in our society so then in the middle of this and right before these developments with the federal attorney i received definite information about a heavy volume of money coming across the border at will and that they were beginning to be used in some sort of a takeover of some s ils so i then tried to get the chairman of the subcommittee that has jurisdiction and there was resistance i went to the then full committee chairman and he was not about to have any hearings in san antonio so then i got desperate and i told the chairman of the subcommittee that had absolute jurisdiction on supervision and so forth of financial institutions i said i tell you i am so concerned that if you dont do it and i am respectful of the line of channels of jurisdiction i am not a member of your subcommittee i want to respect it but if you dont do it then i am going to do it in the name of the subcommittee on international finance because there was no law at that time and it was not until 1978 3 years after 1975 there was no law governing international banking can you believe this i could not when i first ascertained that we thep finally under the pressure in the spring of 1975 had 2day hearings as a result of those 2day hearings we had two indictments and convictions one of the s ls south of my city went under when it was revealed how it had been milked there was a bank that had become exposed but survived at that time but what concerned me more after the hearings was that during the course of the testimony surfacing to our evidence were individuals from louisiana and other places that were just as mysterious and questionable as anybody could be well it turned out that was a forerunner of exactly what happened to us back 3 years ago when we were so agitated by the s l crisis as it was labeled the pattern was clearly visible since then one of the individuals whose name surfaced just 3 years ago was exposed as one of the big manipulators and he was convicted but mind you we first knew of that activity since 1975 i came back after the hearings in april 1975 and i asked the chairman there is no law i am having the legislative service and counsel help me prepare at least sonifething that i would consider minimal he did not seem to be interested so i went on ahead and did it on my own i introduced it i could not get any hearings from the proper committees so we went out that congress came back the next same thing then when we came back at the beginning of the 1977 congress i stirred up a little comment and finally the chairman called me in and he said in the last sessfon of that congress in 1978 look we think that the bill you have is too strong the federal reserve board wont give us a clearance on it and all of that so we are going to have to water it down well they did and it provided the first banking act known as the 1978 international banking act but it was so watered down that i kept going 1979 1980 1981 1982 1983 1984 and it was not until we had the drug money laundering cash scandals that we got the first amendment and that was a weak a very weak one then finally last year we strengthened the socalled drug money laundering laws a little bit more but in the meanwhile as i have said here just in the last few speeches i have made you have the potential for many more bnls bccis and only the lord in heaven with the advent of this huge speculative worldwide unregulated worldwide there is no governn ent that has jurisdiction even partially on a trillion dollars moving as fast as an instantaneous electronic signal can conduct and speculating on an hourtohour daytoday basis on what is known as the international currency exchange or values futures market this is what i fear is going to sink us and not just us the world i have been blessed or i guess i could say it is a blessing and there are some who would say well you dont want to remember everything but i have a good memory and i can remember after world war i and why i would be interested in that i do not know but i can remember some of the writers who were speaking about why the bubble burst wall street the stock market that was the symptom of something else that had been happening waht was the something else as i recall reading and then through the years as i go back and reread and in fact i still have those publications and do not ask me why i kept them since i was 15 years old but i did if we just change the names of the countries the particulars and instead of stock exchanges we substitute what we have today in these highly speculative international currency exchange futures we have the same thing even with respect to what happened after world war i and i remember it as if it were today i had been working for this german druggist since i was 10 years old because i started working when i was 10 years old and there has not been a year since then until now and i am 76 that i have not worked at something or another depression or no depression i remember working for this german druggist i remember him as if it were today he was a very unusual man one day he was talking about how he had just made i forget how many dollars 500 but it was a lot of money in that day and time and i am talking about a day and time when we were supposed to have prosperity but gee if we got 10 cents an hour that was not bad at that time you could buy a loaf of bread for a nickel you could buy a pint of milk for a nickel and it was another world there is no use evoking it i am just using this by comparison to say in how many ways things change but still stay the same in so many ways for us to make the same mistakes we made seems to me to be ironic and actually unforgivable what mr von helms was talking about was how he had made a killing by going to the bank and going into the stock market i remember vividly it was the month of may 1929 when the big thing that we read about in history about the big fall in october 1929 the big bust occurred it was not preceptible right away any more than the 1987 precipitous decline of the market also in october of 1987 was immediately visible i said recently what i remembered and that was that we did not feel the impact of all of that until 2 or 3 years later sure enough 2 years later almost to the day but in the month of october 1931 mr von helms the druggist was foreclosed on and the bank that he banked in the city central bank went broke let me tell the members what kind of world it was i was 12 i was 13 i was 14 and then when i became 15 was when he went broke every week he would get a little paper sack he would put the weeks receipts in cash with a deposit slip he would give it to me i would get on the bicycle and i would pedal about 4 miles downtown go to the bank park my bicycle outside go up to the teller he would get it stamp the receipt and that was it nobody would ever think that anybody would bother me in any way yet i would have as much as 1 100 1 200 sometimes 1 400 in that sack yet he was foreclosed on just 2 years before prosperity unbounded forever and a day as a matter of fact in reading the history of that period it was may 1929 that a blueribbon commission set up by president hoover to report on the economic future of the united states said we see an unlimited prosperous nation for the foreseeable future that was may 1929 then when i read what the banks were doing the banks could then borrow from the fed and this sounds like a lot of highfalutin language but if we understand what the system is then it is not so complicated the federal reserve board which is really not a federal agency though it was created by the congress is really a creature of the commercial banking system the commercial banks it is the federal reserve board that prints the money now there is not a note or a bill whatever we want to call it in our pockets that does not say federal reserve note it was not always that way in fact i remember more often than not when it was a unitedstates treasury note there are a lot of reasons that i will not go into for that but that is one of the causes why we are in the mess that we are in i remember the moratorium germany said you just cannot wring blood out of a turnip we cannot pay the reparations you have imposed on us i remember in the old liberty magazine that i sold during the depression and i used to go sell it together with a couple of other magazines the american magazine at that time the cosmopolitan the ladies home journali sold all of those i did everything you could imagine but i did something i remember reading the article and seeing the features of emaciated palelooking german mothers with little kids in line and the caption said german mothers waiting for milk then there is a picture i have been trying to locate but i guess i lost it in one of those same publications and it shows a whole row of men with their head on what looks like an iron rail and it said german homeless men in a railroad station sleeping that was 1932 then we began to see like we did in 1982 the socalled homeless i would meet and see 15yearolds 14 13 my sameage kids just traveling all over the nation riding the rails i would run into them at what we call san pedro park i do not know why with all the guys playing there i would be theone they would seek out i got to know some and they were just wandering the country it was hundreds of thousands and adult men that were called hobos but actually they were not what later we were accustomed to call the drifter so in 1982 1 years after i had become chairman of the subcommittee on housing i began to see a different kind of homeless this time it was mother father maybe a child maybe two living in a car at a park or underneath an underpass and then an indi i vidual freezing to death here in the district of columbia in that early autumn of 1982 and then a couple in new york and then even back in the socalled sun belt down in my part of the country i had emergency cases and i had to intervene with the housing authority because the salvation army did not have any room for the family context or over a 1night stay even for male single adults so i managed to get a father and a mother and one child who had parked and were trying to live in their car in one of the west side parks i got them emergency housing thanks to the sensitivity of the public housing director so i then caused to be held the first hearing and as a consequence brought the first national attention to what we now call homelessness but what everybody forgets is we never had it like that since the depression it is just like lists of money in the financial setup when the germans said we cannot pay the reparations to the french and the british and then the french and the british said well uncle sam we cannot pay you the war debts that we owe you the money that we have borrowed from you because as i have singlemindedly brought up time after time going back to 26 years ago here on the house floor our country was the only creditor nation in world war i and in world war ii we began as a creditor nation in the year 1914 and we did not become a debtor nation again until september 16 1985 my colleagues put that date down in your notebook because when that happened that meant the american hegemony was beginning to dwindle if not fade out and today less than 7 years after we are the greatest debtor nation in the world and we want to delude ourselves into thinking we are the strongest and the only what do they call it unipolar power it is a delusion it is a delusion we became a debtor nation again when the department of commerce announced it very unnoticed yes but it announced it september 16 1985 in the meanwhile we have kind of worked in a decentralizing sort of centrifugally where say europe not to speak of japan but europe has been working toward a unification i was the only one in this congress that even mentioned ems or the ecu in august of 1979 i brought out what to me was the most disturbing thing of all and that was that the principal banks in the united states in a matter of a year and a half or less had loaned out in 1 years they went from 3 billion to over 47 billion to socalled lesser developed nations governments that i knew could not pay them back i will windup by saying this is where we really are today plus the fact that we had allowed our domestic systems such as the deposit insurance system to become so corrupted and so out of urpose certainly from oongresaional ntent that to me it is the most serious problem confronting us and yet we do not find the perception and i cannot around a perception i have tried for 3 years let me just conclude by saying that t is simple arithmetic you do not have to be a mathematician to figure this out right now there is in excess of 4 trillion in commercial bank deposits that are insured just in commercial banks and they are insured deposits uncle sam says if you have up to 100 000 you are insured but the average depositor is one who has less than 9 000 in that bank where is all of that other money where is it from up until recently when we tried to partially stop it last year the regulators had been paying out the uninsured those that had more than 100 000 some couple a couple of million now we have 4 trillion dollars worth plus of insured deposits just in the commercial banks and we have an insolvent a broke insurance fund which is what we have in our country the bank insurance fund is broke it is insolvent what do you have an insurance system or an illusion"], [0.9831434022635221, 0.016856597736477852, 1, "responds well i guess i fear the intolerance as i said

reverse 12 years of squeeze the middle class policies of the reaganbush years certainly there are plenty of critics who pan the clinton administration deficit reduction plan as having done too much or not enough in comparison to what i had a front row seat for a decade of the reaganbush years and their initiatives hardly resulted in greater investment or smaller deficits when ronald reagan moved into the white house the deficit was just over 74 billion and the national debt and just under 1 billion when george bush moved out of the white house the deficit was racing paid 300 billion and the national debt stood at just over 4 trillion the test of the clinton deficit plan should not be perfection rather is should be does this plan offer a change of direction from failed trickledown economics that brought us shrinking incomes record unemployment soaring debt and more families living in poverty than in the last 40 years the clinton plan delivers that change of direction surely even given its worst assessment the clinton plan could come nowhere close to the recldess results of the past two republican administrations and what do my republican colleagues choose to do to set this situation right nothing not a single member of the party which brought us this debt was willing to begin to reverse the spend now pay later policies which this party wrought more than 40 republican members voted no on every plan even their own partys instead the republican party embarked on an unprecedented campaign of misinformation falsely alleging the middle class would get soaked and that small business would be robbed by the clinton plan now the facts not a single family with a gross adjusted income under 180 000 a year will pay a penny more in income taxes need i respect that families with higher incomes will pay higher taxes as they should during the last decade the wealthy saw their incomes increase at a rate of about 136 percent as a result of trickle down economics during this same period working class families incomes fell the clinton plan restores progressivity and tax fairness and asks that the wealthiest do the most to help reduce the deficit middle class families are asked to pay only about 1 a week in the form of the gas tax and every penny of that weekly dollar will go directly to reducing the deficit but the clinton plan does more than just reduce the projected deficit by about 500 billion it also invests in families and in small business el paso alone living in poverty despite both parents fulltime jobs will receive 86 million in assistance to lift them out of poverty and reward their economic contribution more than oneinthree of every family in el paso will see their taxes cut and their incomes increased fewer than 1 000 families in the entire county actually have incomes high enough to require that they pay higher income taxes most importantly the small business owners of our county are finally going to get their just rewards for having done their best during the long recession to keep their heads above water and create jobs the clinton plan will provide some of the most lucrative tax incentives ever offered to small business to say otherwise is dishonest even the wall street journals analysis of the small business package last week carried a headline that read higher expenditure ceiling retroactive too promises an array of breaks the package includes a 50percent cut in the capital gains tax rate for investment in small business a 75percent increase in expensing of investments in equipment and an extension of the health insurance deduction for the selfemployed in fact 95 percent of small business or six million entrepreneurs will see their taxes go down under the clinton plan this is not the largest tax increase in history it is the largest deficit reduction package in history because it restores tax fairness and cuts 260 billion from projected government spending those are the facts"],

california we do have differences of opinion and we have differences in political philosophy however i would say that in his case and mine perhaps the differences are not as distinct as in some other situations that come to mind but i do for the committee respectfully oppose the gentlemans amendment it seems to me that in dealing with a situation where we seek to find avenues to change educational patterns where we have designed legislation which allows local governments and state governments to use their sources of revenue to use local money tax money to enter into partnership with the federal government that the federal onethird match in many of those instances will prove to have been and will prove to be needed to keep the projects alive that as state governments in the future change and their attitude towards these operations change and as administrations change and perhaps their attitude toward this initiative changes that the last thing we need is for this program to have to experience the planned uncertainty of sunset provisions normally to put in legislation a mechanism whereby the procedure the program will selfdestruct sometime in the future that has appealed to me and to others of my colleagues but i do not think that we want to apply this selfdestruct mechanism to these new educational initiatives it seems to me that will discourage participation from the beginning and help to thwart the very purpose for which they are created i will say in conclusion that these manufacturing centers are an important source of local information on a variety of topics of importance to manufacturers who with to compete at home and abroad and they ought to be here to stay we ought not to put it out and say well we are going to put in here a mechanism whereby this initiative this program at a certain number of years will selfdestruct in the event of a positive evaluation that is the only way that the centers can be extended the secretary of commerce has responsibility to oversee the operation and there will not be a question as to whether or not this initiative is extended unless there is a positive evaluation so while i respect and admire my colleague from california we believe that in this instance his wellmeaning amendment should be rejected i mr walker i move to strike the last word and i rise in support of the amendment i wonder how many members of congress ran in their districts last year saying that one of the things we ought to do to reform government is to have sunset provisions to assure that programs dont go on and one and on forever without being reaffirmed that we ought to have a way of getting rid of some of these programs somewhere along the line there was a former president who said that the embodiment of eternal life on earth is itself a federal program the ugly truth of the language that is in this bill is that we are going to perpetuate the idea that a federal program once created is neverending let me tell my colleagues something that was not the deal when this program was originally put in place when this program was originally put in place we very specifically wanted these manufacturing centers that were being created to go out on their own after a 6year period let me quote to you from the law that was passed at that time the law says that no funding be provided for a center provided by the department of commerce after the sixth year of operation of a center in other words we gave them 6 years of funding after that period of time they were supposed to have proved their worth to the community and then they got their funding through private enterprise in other words we were taking public money and turning it over to private money we were stopping spending money that increased the national debt and we were putting the burden on industry on all those rich people out there that we hear so often we ought to be grabbing for more of the resources of government what does this decide to do it decides that those rich people ought not fund these centers but instead what we ought to do is continue to pile up public debt in order to fund these centers and so what the gentleman from california has done is said that the language in this bill is really at odds with the law that the sunset law that we put in place years ago ought to be upheld we ought not to do what this bill does if we go to page 39 and we look at lines 1 through 16 on page 39 of the bill we find this shocking retreat from reform here was an attempt in public law to do something real about sunset for once we had actually sunsetted a program we had said after 6 years the program gets no more public money then we go to page 39 of the bill and we find that we are retreating from that reform it is high time that we do something for real why are the american people disgusted with what goes on in the congress because every time we do something phony every time we tell them that we are doing something real about reform they find out later on that it was just a phony here we are a few years later and what we are saying is that little job we did back a while ago where we sunsetted a program forget it buried down in page 39 of this bill we are just going to wipe out the sunset provision and we are going to go right on spending money as though there was no tomorrow guess what it is money we are going to be piling on the backs of our kids because this is all debt money that is being spent to fund these centers now if my colleagues want to continue to accumulate public debt if they have no regard for the reforms of the past if they want to continue to tell the american people that everything we do here in terms of reform is a phony what they will do is support what the committee wants to do because the committee bill wipes out the sunset provisions if they want to be a reformer if they want to stick with the reforms of the past if they want to do something about debt and deficit if they want to stop spending the public money in places where the rich could actually pick up some of the tab then what they will do is they will support the gentleman from california because these manufacturing centers can in fact be sustained with private money we do not need to go to the public till we do not need to pile up more debt and we do not need to abandon reform we can support the gentleman from california we can retain the manufacturing centers but we can retain them in the way that they were originally meant to be done so i would suggest that we do want to support what the

throughout my tenure in congress many seniors have contacted me to express their fear that the social security trust fund is being mishandled and a recent gao report which reported that an estimated 250 000 drug addicts and alcoholics collected approximately 1 4 billion in social security disability insurance and supplemental security income funds last year proves them right while the recipients of these payments are eligible for this federal assistance there is little or no evidence that these funds are being used for treatment instead in many cases these payments are being used to fuel the addictions now my heart goes out to those families that have had to deal with a loved one who is addicted to drugs or alcohol and i feel we should continue to offer our help in getting these people treatment but the purpose of the social security act is straightforward to provide for the economic security of our population as it grows older or becomes disabled it is certainly not intended to provide drug addicts and alcoholics with the financial means to perpetuate their substance abuses making the social security administration an independent agency would greatly enhance public confidence in the management of these funds the integrity of the social security system is important to me and to many of my constituents and i firmly believe that this legislation will help to protect the system now and in the future i urge my colleagues to support this conference report"], [0.00011453032493591309, 0.4998854696750641, 0, "i would also like to thank the gentleman from

amendment but i want to put some of the issues involved in this amendment into a certain context the gentleman read about expenditurea from this account for representational purposeo essentially inside the united states entertainment of foreign dignitaries had the congress and the subcommittee which i chair net declassified that information in the 1991 state department authorization bill the gentleman would not have been able to bring that to the floor of congress moreover we separated out the representational moneys from the emergency and reward moneys because we felt there were questionable activities and expenditures being made from that account and we wanted one for it to be declassified and second to be limited moreover the amount that has been authorized and appropriated for representational activities has been dramatically cut and in this appropriations bill there is a flat cap on that portion of the emergency funds which can be spent on representational activities which is considerably less than the level back in the beginning of the 1990s on the broader question and both the gentleman from iowa and the gentleman from kentucky have made reference to this issue this account is a very important account it provides the secretary with his discretionary ability to deal with unforeseen crises particularly those affecting the lives and safety of american citizens abroad threatened by war civil unrest or natural disaster when the persian gulf crisis erupted the department totally depleted the account in evacuating unitedstates employees from all agencies citizens and dependents out of harms way through operations made possible through this account we removed thousands of our compatriots from danger this helped our armed forces to conduct operation desert storm without special measures to protect the safety of american civilians the state department had to be able to rely on this account for last minute charters of civilian aircraft this cost money the persian gulf is not the beginning and end of the story since 1979 emergency evacuations have become a fact of life repeatedly in iran afghanistan libya liberia somalia evacuations have saved countless american lives the end of the cold war has increased not diminished unrest around the world as recent events in kuwait and iraq demonstrate the risks to our people overseas from terrorism are something we must continue to plan to counteract now we also deal with that portion of the account that pays for rewards for information to deter counteract and prosecute international terrorists and drug thugs the awards program has been a success i would hate to see the department stop publicizing rewards for lack of funds the account also pays for confidential efforts to investigate unitedstates visa and passport frouds by terrorists and refugee smugglers t gentleman makes an interesting point c n the carryover money and we must acknlowledge this carryover money is part of an effort to replenish this fund to deal with those contingencies whch may be far more than anyone could now anticipate as i look at the spending history of this account and moving aside the representational expenses which now have been capped and limited the fact is that in fiscal year 1989 there was appropriated 4 5 million with obligations of just less than 100 000 left in that in 1990 the year of desert storm there was an appropriation of 4 6 million and 7 4 million was spent they actually reached into a deficit situation in that particular year by the time we passed our supplemental in fiscal year 1991 long after that money was spent we appropriated 15 million and included a repro gramming transfer we only expended or obligated 12 496 000 now we are carrying over approximately 4 5 million and appropriating 7 million more presumably we will have to see where we are at the end of fiscal year 1994 next summer as we get into the appropriations process hopefully we will have built the fund up to the point where the state department can feel free to respond quickly before congress has a chance to pass a supplemental the gentleman makes one other point regarding programming of salaries and expenses the fact is we have cut well over 100 million in salaries and expenses and support staff for the state department below fiscal year 1993s level in addition when you take the peacekeeping drain and the humanitarian relief drain for what is going on in bosnia and other countries the ability to reprogram quickly substantial amounts of salary and expense money is getting more and more limited i think this is a prudent level of appropriation for this year i think we want to look at it again next summer"], [0.00016355514526367188, 0.5001635551452637, 0, "and the
