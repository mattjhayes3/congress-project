introducing the longterm health care amendments of 1987 certainly i commend president reagan health and human services secretary otis bowen and my esteemed colleagues pete stark and bill gradison for their leadership and efforts in developing legislation which addresses the acute illness area i am however very concerned about the direction in which we are headed on this issue under both the reagan and the starkgradison proposals approximately 5 to 8 percent of medicares 30 million elderly would benefit from the part a and part b payment expansions i strongly believe that by limiting our focus to the acute care illness we will be missing a real opportunity to act upon what i consider to be the real risks that most senior citizens face in a truly catastrophic illnessnamely those associated with longterm and nursing home care the time has come for congress to reexamine the medicare program and to address the changing needs of our senior citizens therefore the legislation i am introducing today addresses some of the most critical longterm care needs of our elderly population the bill also offers incentives to the workingage population for developing their own longterm care protection i have attempted to create balance in the bill by incorporating a combination of governmental individual and employer incentives to address the issue of longterm care my legislation has three major titles first my bill creates a new part c of the medicare program to offer financial assistance for nursing home home health and communitybased services that the elderly need for long periods of time this longterm care benefit is income related that is the amount of an individuals outofpocket expense is related to his income level the second provision of the bill provides for individual incentives to allow an individual over the age of 50 to contribute up to 1 500 of noncoreinterest income toward the purchase of a longterm care insurance policy as an added incentive this policy would retain a cashsurrender value so that should the individual predecease the use of the policy its value would roll over into his estate and could be transferred to his spouse finally the bill provides for group incentives for longterm care catastrophic protection this congress has a real opportunity to act on some very critical health policy issues but i hope we do so in a manner that looks toward tomorrow

which will continue the process of preserving the pinelands region of new jersey i thank my friend the gentleman from minnesota mr vexqro for his efforts to being this much needed legislation to the floor for a vote i thank the senior senator from new jersey mr bradley for sponsoring this legislation in the other body and finally i thank my dear friend and colleague mr hughes for his efforts to work with me on this legislation i think we truly have assembled a bill that addresses many of the concerns of the region i believe that congressman huaifs and i represent almost 90 percent of the pinelands national reserve it is for this reason that we hold such a strong feeling about this preservation program the pinelands reserve is an area of great cultural historic and environmental significance the pinelands reserve is also the location of the coahnsey aquifer which holds some of the purest pristine water in the world it is a testimony to the pride of all new jerseyans that these 1 million acres most of them pristine are able to exist in the most densely populated state in the country in addition it has been recognized by the united nations as an international biosphere reserve today everyone recognizes the historical and environmental significance of the new jersey pinelands region in 1978 and 1979 the state and federal governments recognized the need to preserve as much of this land as possible and entered into a cooperative agreement which might be termed an experiment the objectives of those who supported the pinelands experiment were to find a unique way to preserve large amounts of environmentally important land while at the same time transferring a controlled level of development from this land to less sensitive areas it pleases me that this experiment has been for the most part a success in spite of this success however there are some weaknesses in the plan these weaknesses are obvious to the people who live in the pinelands whether through loss of property value or cost of policing the region these people have found themselves primarily responsible for paying the bill for the preservation of the pines however i feel and i know that my friend mr hughes agrees that inasmuch as the pinelands are being preserved for all of us then all of us should share in some way for paying the bill therefore when we found that we must continue the acquisition program we felt we must also continue to address the concerns of the people of the region the legislation will continue the land acquisition program established by the original pinelands legislation we have differed though from the original legislation by decreasing the federal share of the funds to 50 percent instead of the 5 percent stated in the original program we have done this in light of the federal budget deficit and the fact that new jersey finds itself in a fairly good fiscal situation additionally the bill restricts acquisition to areas that are either within the preservation areas of the region environmentally sensitive lands that are threatened by adverse development or lands owned by a small landowner who has exhausted all other methods of compensation for the loss of his rights to build seeing the need to compensate landowners for the loss of the right to develop their lands the planning entity established a program of transfer of development credits for every acre of land that a person owns in the preservation region that landowner is entitled to a certain number of pinelands development credits or pdcs these pdcs can be transferred to growth areas in order to allow a developer to build units in excess of what otherwise might be possible it is a unique program that in theory works very well however in spite of the best efforts of the state and the pinelands commission the program has been only marginal successful while we realize that the state has recently established a credit bank in order to facilitate the trading of these credits we feel there is more that could be done to stimulate the program toward that end our legislation calls for the secretary of the interior to perform a study and make recommendations to the state and to the congress as to how this pdc program might work better furthermore in order to establish a method for the 52 local municipalities located within the pinelands area to have a voice in the process the planning entity established the pinelands municipal council the council was not intended to be a legislative body it is more of an advisory body that would provide input to the pinelands commission this council composed of each of 52 mayors has also not been successful congressman huths aid i believe that it should work and to that end this bill also calls for a study of the municipal council in order to provide recommendations as to how it might be improved finally if the pinelands experiment is to succeed it needs to be understood understood by the residents of the region of the state and of the country toward that end mr hughes and i concur that there ought to be a formal interpretive program in the region after much discussion we arrived at an agreement as to how this program should proceed this legislation will provide funding for the pinelands education and interpretive program there are presently a number of sites in the pinelands region that are very well suited to act as sites at which this program should proceed i speak of historic villages state forests and academic facilities many of which presently perform pinelands programs of their own in order to obtain the right combination of the best facilities we have decided to call on the secretary of the interior to design the educational program that utilizes these sites to the greatest extent possible as i have said i believe that the bill before us is a good piece of legislation it will contribute to the continued preservation and understanding of the pinelands area continued land acquisition and the pinelands interpretation and education program operating in conjunction with federal efforts to assist with programs designed to address the concerns of the local citizens will assure the success of

rule but that does not diminish the importance of correcting these defects in the system to address these concerns the bill incorporates several nrc recommendations designed to improve security and safety at both commercial nuclear facilities and department of energy facilities licensed by the nrc the administration supports this needed legislation and i urge my colleagues to support it as well"], [0.0007233917713165283, 0.49927660822868347, 1, "i rise today to voice my support of the rights which are such precious and fundamental elements of our democracy constitutional rights rights to protection against discrimination based on gender race age or handicap and rights such as the opportunity for free and open discussion in this house of representatives i oppose this rule for the same reason that i have opposed other rules in the past that are closed and artificially obstruct the open deliberation of serious ideas of serious consequence in this body of which we are all elected on very rare occasions can such restrictiveness be justified in a democracy and this bill at this time could hardly be considered one of those occasions in fact i suggest to all of us who are ardent supporters of the fundamental rights that i mentioned originally that this action actually works to the harm of those final results that we seek i had hoped to offer an agriculture amendment to this bill ta day that would guarantee in statute as some have not only hinted but have kindly agreed to in colloquy that this bill has no intention of imposing new paperwork requirements vulnerability to lawsuits and susceptibility to unannounced federal inspections on family farms and ranches my simple question to the rules committee is if indeed no such intrusions are intended by the authors of the legislation it seems there should be no problem in stating so in the actual law of course without lie opportunity to offer an agriculture amendment on the floor and to offer other amendments there is no way of expressing the will of the congress in statute on this specific issue i reluctantly urge my colleagues to oppose the rule but not the intent of the legislation we all agree on the intent it just seems that of all the legislation this is one on which we should be a little more willing to hear the debate and to answer the questions before it is put into law so that the problems that we have found in the past would not be there for us in the future"]]}
