also provides for an extension of the monumental land and water conservation fund for a period of 25 years at its current authorization level as the sponsor of h r 1320 i am pleased to bring before the house legislation that i believe sets in place a reasonable and workable policy on entrance and user fees for our park and recreation areas while at the same time addressing important national conservation needs h r 1320 represents the bipartisan efforts of many members and i am pleased with the constructive input i have received from members interested in this matter the fact that the committee was able to forge a bipartisan agreement on this matter was a feat in itself frankly the fee proposals of the administration did not make our task easier the various dubious formulas and allocations that have been advanced by the administration does not hide the fact that by and large they were seeking funds to replace moneys they have simultaneously axed out of the national park service budget our national park units are a unique system that preserves and protects several of our national treasures that are the very symbols of our country we should not and cannot allow our parks to become another of the administrations revenue enhancers the american citizen has grown weary of this type of nitpicking taxes every time they turn around the fact is that under the most ideal collection system for access fees the national park serice and parks will only receive a token amount from such fees in fact less than 5 percent of the 1 billion used to fund these programs in the current year cycle many members of congress and the public in general have no objection to reasonable fees even entrance fees if they are carefully controlled in both place and amount i believe that h r 1320 as reported by the committee meets that test the legislation provides for a limited and targeted entrance fee program for national park units protecting such national treasures as the statue of liberty and independence national historical park and the washington monument from entrance fees therefore limiting and denying access to these national parksreally worth tens of billions dollars investment and invaluable cultural historical and natural resourcesbeing denied access by charging and discouraging unitedstates citizens from enjoying and being educated by exposure to these outstanding resources is a far greater loss than the small amount of revenue that might possibly be generated or gained h r 1320 provides that the singlevisit permit at any designated area shall not exceed 5 per vehicle for those entering by private noncommercial vehicle and 3 per person for those entering by other means the bill permits the sale of the golden eagle passport at a fee not to exceed 25 and authorizes the establishment of an annual admission permit for a specific park or group of parks at a fee not to exceed 15 in crafting h r 1320 it was my intention and the committees intention to assure that entrance fees be set and maintained at a fair and reasonable level this measure is being put forth with the understanding and agreement that such fees should in no way dissuade use of national park units by the public in fact the bill contains provisions requiring the secretary of the interior to report to congress on the fee program and to be fully able to justify both the imposition of an entrance fee at a specific park unit as well as the level of the fee proposed to be charged within the caps contained in this measure at present there are approximately 338 units of the national park system under h r 1320 only about 130 parks would have an entrance fee these units in large measure are our destination parks that are the focal point for a trip or vacation the legislation includes language prohibiting an entrance fee at those national park units located in an urbanized area where a fee was not charged prior to september 30 1986 many other parks will never have an entrance fee proposed because they do not meet the criteria contained in section 4 d of the land and water conservation fund act h r 1320 not only takes steps to limit the imposition of entrance fees but just as important the fee receipts generated under authority of the land and water conservation fund act would be returned to individual park and recreation units to enhance certain operational and resource protection efforts rather than being used as an offset against existing appropriations the bill would make all entrance fees generated by the nps available for resource protection research and interpretation activities on the basis of the following allocation 50 percent of entrance fee funds available shall be provided to all units of the park system based on each units proportion of operating expenses and 50 percent shall be provided to units with entrance fees based on each collecting units proportion of total entrance fee collections all other recreational fees generated by the nps as well as other federal agencies will be available for those activities cited earlier with the addition of funds availability for maintenance activities related to resource protection the ability to generate entrance fee receipts has little bearing on the value of a park unit to the system as a whole as has been reiterated in law and policy each park unit is equally important the formula in h r 1320 will assure that extra funds will be available to enhance and protect each and every park unit i know this is a concern shared by my distinguished colleague mr yates i was pleased to be able to work out language in the bill with him to assure that the allocation of the fee receipts receives continuing congressional oversight as part of the annual budget submittal the administration will submit to the appropriations committee a detailed list and accounting of the fee receipts received by the collecting agency under authority of this act the administrations report shall include the proposed distribution of the previous year fee receipts by function within the individual park unit or recreation facility in accordance with the provisions of this act the committee on appropriations may adjust the projects proposed to be funded within a particular park unit or recreation facility provided that no action is taken to decrease the overall amount available from fee receipts and that funds may not be transferred among park units or recreation facilities i would like to point out to members that the new subsection i to section 4 of the land and water conservation fund act exempts the unitedstates fish and wildlife service from its provisions this was done for two reasons first it is our intent to clarify that no revenues currently received and distributed pursuant to the refuge revenue sharing act be affected by this act second last year congress passed the emergency wetlands resources act of 1986 this act authorized the fish and wildlife service to charge entrance fees at certain national wildlife refuges the act directed that 70 percent of the entrance fees be deposited into the migratory bird conservation fund and the remaining 30 percent be made available without further appropriation for refuge operation and maintenance it is our intent to abide by the entrance fee allocation provided for under that act h r 1320 repeals inconsistent provisions in law and makes several additional national park units subject to the provisions of this act rather than the piecemeal exemptions that now exist in law to further a reasonable and workable policy with regards to recreation use fees the legislation includes language that first permit the use of volunteers in fee collection subject to training and bonding requirements second prohibits charging an entrance fee to those 16 years of age or less third allow for transportation fees in lieu of an entrance fee in those park units that furnish bus tours of the park fourth permit sale of golden eagle passports by private businesses fifth require a study of alternative fee pricing to aid in distributing use at parks over a greater portion of the year and sixth authorize a higher entrance fee at three specific national park units namely grand canyon yellowstone and grand teton last but not least h r 1320 would continue the current authorization of the historic land and

a blind eye toward reality it has refused to acknowledge that its policy toward nicaragua has been counterproductive after several years of american aid to the contras the sandinista regime is gaining continual strength the contras on the other hand are growing more and more divided as is further witnessed by the recent resignation of arturo cruz the administrations support for the contras has not only failed to change the policies of the sandinistas but has instead provided the sandinistas with an excuse for their crackdown on internal democratic opposition and their greater reliance on soviet and cuban military assistance last year after a great deal of debate the house approved 100 million in military assistance to the contras the house approved the moneys because the administration had gleaned a promise of reform from the contra leadership the contras agreed to curb human rights abuses place the military under civilian control and assure proper accounting of contra funds unfortunately few of these reforms have been implemented in addition to the increasing evidence of escalating contra brutality it has become clear that the administration in its zealous commitment to the contra cause has become directly involved in fundraising for the contras and their military operations such activities appear to be in direct violation of the congressional prohibition on direct

addresses many of the concerns of the region i believe that congressman huaifs and i represent almost 90 percent of the pinelands national reserve it is for this reason that we hold such a strong feeling about this preservation program the pinelands reserve is an area of great cultural historic and environmental significance the pinelands reserve is also the location of the coahnsey aquifer which holds some of the purest pristine water in the world it is a testimony to the pride of all new jerseyans that these 1 million acres most of them pristine are able to exist in the most densely populated state in the country in addition it has been recognized by the united nations as an international biosphere reserve today everyone recognizes the historical and environmental significance of the new jersey pinelands region in 1978 and 1979 the state and federal governments recognized the need to preserve as much of this land as possible and entered into a cooperative agreement which might be termed an experiment the objectives of those who supported the pinelands experiment were to find a unique way to preserve large amounts of environmentally important land while at the same time transferring a controlled level of development from this land to less sensitive areas it pleases me that this experiment has been for the most part a success in spite of this success however there are some weaknesses in the plan these weaknesses are obvious to the people who live in the pinelands whether through loss of property value or cost of policing the region these people have found themselves primarily responsible for paying the bill for the preservation of the pines however i feel and i know that my friend mr hughes agrees that inasmuch as the pinelands are being preserved for all of us then all of us should share in some way for paying the bill therefore when we found that we must continue the acquisition program we felt we must also continue to address the concerns of the people of the region the legislation will continue the land acquisition program established by the original pinelands legislation we have differed though from the original legislation by decreasing the federal share of the funds to 50 percent instead of the 5 percent stated in the original program we have done this in light of the federal budget deficit and the fact that new jersey finds itself in a fairly good fiscal situation additionally the bill restricts acquisition to areas that are either within the preservation areas of the region environmentally sensitive lands that are threatened by adverse development or lands owned by a small landowner who has exhausted all other methods of compensation for the loss of his rights to build seeing the need to compensate landowners for the loss of the right to develop their lands the planning entity established a program of transfer of development credits for every acre of land that a person owns in the preservation region that landowner is entitled to a certain number of pinelands development credits or pdcs these pdcs can be transferred to growth areas in order to allow a developer to build units in excess of what otherwise might be possible it is a unique program that in theory works very well however in spite of the best efforts of the state and the pinelands commission the program has been only marginal successful while we realize that the state has recently established a credit bank in order to facilitate the trading of these credits we feel there is more that could be done to stimulate the program toward that end our

establish a method for the 52 local municipalities located within the pinelands area to have a voice in the process the planning entity established the pinelands municipal council the council was not intended to be a legislative body it is more of an advisory body that would provide input to the pinelands commission this council composed of each of 52 mayors has also not been successful

if the pinelands experiment is to succeed it needs to be understood understood by the residents of the region of the state and of the country toward that end mr hughes and i concur that there ought to be a formal interpretive program in the region after much discussion we arrived at an agreement as to how this program should proceed this legislation will provide funding for the pinelands education and interpretive program there are presently a number of sites in the pinelands region that are very well suited to act as sites at which this program should proceed i speak of historic villages state forests and academic facilities many of which presently perform pinelands programs of their own in order to obtain the right combination of the best facilities we have decided to call on the secretary of the interior to design the educational program that utilizes these sites to the greatest extent possible as i have said i believe that the bill before us is a good piece of legislation it will contribute to the continued preservation and understanding of the pinelands area continued land acquisition and the pinelands interpretation and education program operating in conjunction with federal efforts to assist with programs designed to address the concerns of the local citizens will assure the success of the pinelands experiment"], [0.9993494153022766, 0.9993494153022766, 0, "chief

reconstructing medical data for many veterans of tile world war ii and korean conflict periods as you may be aware the fire at nprc in july 1973 destroyed the major portion of records of army military personnel for the period 1912 through 1959 and records of air force personnel with surnames hubbard through z for the period 1947 through 1903 the new soulce consists of a collection of computer magnetic tapes that were created by tile national research council nrc a private organization from admissions punch cards prepared by the office of the surgeon general department of the army the original punch cards have been destroyed the 91 tapes contain information for the years 19421945 and 19501954 on a large sampling of army patients admitted to army medical treatment facilities during those time periods it is estimated that the tapes contain approximately 10 million records however an unknown number of these will be multiple entries for the same individual the data includes various personal indentifylng and medical treatment factors such as serial number grade or rank age race length of service date and place of adnission type of case disease nonbattle and battle injuries battle casualty diagnosis operation circumstances surrounding injury type and date of disposition etc although the individuals names are not included positive identification can be made through the service number although copies of the tapes finally are being duplicated and released to nara by nrc following authorization from tile department of the army certain access problems prevent us from immediately using tile information 1 format each tape must be analyzed to determine its format then reformatted to be compatible with nprcs system sonic of tile tapes have been converted to ninetrick tape compatible with nprcs system lluo ever the information on the tapes is in at least 10 different formats 2 access the data must be crossrefer enced by service number and service code td nprcs auxiliary file index to facilitate inquiries furthermore the information must be arranged in service number sequence to support generation of the computer output microfilm listing of each record which will be needed to produce the final drcoded report on the individual productio of tile final report is dependent upon pc software which will decode each data element in the record s on the requested indivihual unfortunately it appears that separete pc programs will be required for each sagment of the file the system will work as follows an inquiry by service number to the registry system will generate a hit on the finding aid report na form 13096 for eatih relatel record on the microfiche listing see attachment 1 to interpret the coded record a blowback copy is made of the microfiche page sec attachment 2 the codes are then entered to screen format which is part f a personal computer program the pe sotware quickly interprets each code and generates a printout see attachment 3 the hits will also appear on the automated va 3101 see attachment 4 so far nprc has analyzed and reformatted the 1944 collection and added it to the registry index approximately 3 4 million records pertaining to 2 4 millibn veterans are included in this first group sets of computer output microfiche com listing each coded record on the 1944 file also have been produced the pc program has been written nprc expects to received tapes from nrc for all years except 194243 by the end of june indeed we are not certain when we will receive the tapes containing data for 194243 it is our understanding that nrc is experiencing problems with their format reformatting of the other tapes by nprc can be affected in a matter of weeks development of the pe software within two months i e every effort will be made by us to expedite this project because nprc has not yet received and added all the files to the registry system we are extremely concerned that nprc may be inundated with inquiries before all of the information is put into a usable format it is probable that such a situation would have an equally serious impact on your operations as claims previously disallowed due to the lack of supporting evidence may be resubmitted in large numbers in the absence of the complete file our agencies may be deluged prematurely with request which cannot be properly serviced it is our understanding that ms judy veres of the compensation and pension service and mr gray cooper of the va regional office in st louis met with nprc officials on wednesday june 15 to discuss this matter we also have been contacted by mr lerb mars of your agency and have scheduled a meeting for june 30 1988 at 10 00 to discuss plans for advising veterans veterans organizations and tie congress of this new information clearly we need to notify these groups as soon as possible but in some manner which will avoid triggering the undesirable situation drscribed above you may also wish to consider including a representative from the nrc in the meeting on june 30 to impress on that organization tile importance of completing the transfer of the tapes to nprc as soon as possible if you or your staff have any

is noncontroversial i would like to start out by commending the committee for their hard work in providing funds to upgrade the quality of fire and life safety equipment in the buildings house members and staff occupy as well as the capitol itself these improvements are long overdue and much needed the amendment i am offering today deals with the issue of a fire alarm system in every building on capitol hill the only reason i am offering this amendment which gets down to micromanaging what the architects office will do is because of what i read to be an apparent cavalier attitude in the architects office for fire and life safety as a result of a recent incident that occurred in the longworth building some quotations from representatives of the architects office have alarmed me one such quotation was that the congressional office buildings are as safe as any place in the world another one was that these buildings meet and exceed the building officials conference of america codethe boca codewhich describes the national standard 1 have talked to every major fire and life safety group in america since the fire in the speakers office i have also as recently as this morning talked to the executive counsel of the code and the organization that was cited by the architects office and in no way will they back up that statement in fact the longworth building is in blatant violation of that code today as a matter of fact the longworth building and other buildings on capitol hill are in violation of every major fire and life safety code in america contrary to what we have been told by the architect as a result of the fire in the longworth house office building in the speakers office we noted several discrepancies and deficiences first is a lack of a sprinkler protection system second was a lack of automatic recall of elevators third stairwells not being properly enclosed fourth a lack of preplanning and fifth a lack of any alarm system with which to evacuate the men and women who inhabit that building at that point in time this body as the result of a request that i made 2 weeks ago has approved a select committee to investigate that fire and make recommendations however as we investigate that fire and make recommendations there are some things that will be corrected by this particular bill the sprinkler systems are in fact being put into place today in the longworth building and there are plans for an alarm system to be installed in every building on capitol hill my concern is that these changes and improvements will take up to 2 years to complete that means that for 2 years we will not have any means of evacuating people in our office buildings during times of an emergency what happened 2 weeks ago when the speakers office caught on fire was the fact that we had members who left their offices on the fourth floor who were greeted with smoke and did not know whether to exit at the top of the building or down through the stairwells we had one staff person who apparently was on an upper floor of the longworth building who had a hearing problem and who never got the word to evacuate the building and in fact for 3 hours following the fire the d c fire department would not allow anyone in that building because of the level of toxic fumes and substances in the air it is intolerable that we in the capital of this great nation would allow our buildings to be so unsafe in terms of life safety what my amendment does is very simply require the architect to proceed immediately with installing alarm systems in every building covered by the appropriations in this particular act in addition i am going to ask for a colloquy with my distinguished colleague from california in a moment that would also allow us to have the architect proceed immediately with other steps to implement other alarm systems as quickly as possible while a fullscale alarm system is being developed for the entire capitol hill complex"],

overall thrust of h r 2266 is consistent with the findings of hearings held in may 1987 by the public works committees subcommittee on investigations and over sight permit me to focus briefly on the deficiencies addressed by a few key provisions of the legislation first the bill addresses the lack of standards governing federal pipeline inspectors as well as the currently inadequately number of such inspectors by authorizing the establishment of minimum standards for inspector qualification and certification and by providing for the hiring of 16 additional feder al inspectors over the next 2 fiscal years in addition the legislation attempts to remedy a lack of available data on various types of pipelines and their leak history by requiring operators to establish and maintain pipeline inventories detailing the types of pipeline they operate and their materials and leak history hopefully the data base generated will allow us to identify certain potentially leak prone pipes so that
