trying to eliminate waste fraud and abuse in the federal government and in federal spending i want to start out by alerting members to a brief history lesson on where congressional overspending has gone over the last 30 years in fact going back to 1970 members can see the line below the baseline here is the amount of money that the congress has spent money that it did not have this is deficit quantity spending back in 1970 we began a dangerous habit and trend going down here in 1976 here we were at almost 100 billion in deficits we continued to drop and drop spending more and more without regard to the cash that was on hand for the federal government we can see here in 1982 and 1986 the height of democrat control of congress was when we were on a virtually spending spree here in washington then when deficits got at about their worst down in this area that is about the point in time that the american people changed their mind this is when the republican revolution took place americans were fed up with a congress that year after year after year from 1970 right on up to the 19921993 fiscal years had spent more money than it had on hand in fact borrowing from my children and the children of every other american in order to appease the spending appetite and habits of washington that ended at about this point here we can see the line beginning to go up when a new idea a new party was put in charge with majority status in congress members can see when we took over that the deficit spending began to ease that we began to start moving toward a goal of spending the dollars that we actually had on hand to run the legitimate purposes of the federal government back there in 1994 when republicans took over the congress they promised in a great contract with america that we would balance the budget by the year 2002 well we underpromised and overdelivered because right here in 1998 was the first year in 30 years that the expenditures came above the line here of our baseline spending in other words we began to start saving money this little purple section here represents a cash surplus that we began to accumulate here in washington d c it is this surplus that has allowed us to do a number of things one it has allowed us to stop borrowing the money i would remind my colleagues when we start borrowing money spending more money than the congress actually has to spend we borrow it from somewhere and the fund of preference for many many years has been the social security system in fact this congress and the white house has raided the social security trust fund the social security system to the tune of about 638 billion over a little bit shorter of a time frame this goes back to 1984 once again we can take a look at where we were when we came here and president clinton continued and this was the year of the tax increase and the year that the congress spent quite a lot of money at the presidents insistence again in 1998 this congress got serious about stopping the raid on social security members can see the dramatic decrease this is not the final column of the graph here this is an actual decrease in the propensity of congress to borrow from the social security system this is an effort to stop the raid on social security members can see that that does end right here this year in 1999 the first year we stopped raiding the social security system in order to pay for government that is a trend we want to see continue in fact we want to see this line continue to go down further and build greater surpluses including the social security fund in order to accomplish that we have to exercise some fiscal discipline right now this year in congress that is the debate that is taking place presently between the white house and the congress here is one of the suggestions we came up with as a republican majority to avoid raiding social security as the president has proposed to do we have proposed that of the increase in spending that we have budgeted for this year that we just tighten our belt a little bit for every dollar in federal spending we are asking the federal government to come up the federal bureaucrats and the federal agencies to come up with one cent in savings in efficiency savings in order to help rescue the social security fund and to stop borrowing from the social security system we want to stop that raid we think that out of every dollar that is spent in washington we can find that one cent in savings and continue to run the legitimate programs and the legitimate services that are needed and necessary under our federal system and do it in a way that allows us to save social security at the same time that is what that one penny on the dollar represents when we suggested this idea folks over at the white house almost had a heart attack they said one penny on the dollar we cannot possibly come up with one penny on the dollar in savings because that would cripple the federal government finding this one cent in savings therein lies the difference between the republican majority in washington and the liberal democrat leadership that we find down at the white house we believe that the government can do what every american family does every day work a little harder to find that one cent savings to just simply start realizing that we can be more efficient and more effective with a whole assortment of federal programs to find that one cent again it was a little frustrating but not surprising here in washington to hear the various cabinet secretaries say we cannot find that one penny on the dollar all of the federal departments are so efficient so lean so effective so accountable with their dollars that we cannot possibly find the savings necessary to save social security so we as members of congress decided that we would take it upon ourselves to help that is the point of todays special order i appreciate members going through that brief history with me about how it is we came to the position we are in it is a very relevant and important position to consider because at this very moment the impasse in passing a budget hinges on the difference of opinion between this congress and that white house to find that one penny and do it in a way that honors and respects not only the taxpayers of america but the children of america who rely on a sound and credibly run government and certainly the seniors the current retirees who rely on social security there are a number of great examples one of our colleagues who i have been told was planning on joining us here issued a report out of his committee and that report lists assuming i can put my fingers on it lists just agency by agency the savings that can be found here are some good examples here is the gentleman from california who has arrived in his report he e2319 suggested that we could find savings in the department of agriculture he cited examples in the department of defense the department of defense spent nearly 40 billion on programs for 15 overseas telecommunications systems that cannot be fully used because the department failed to obtain proper certifications and approvals from the host nations that is according to a 1999 inspector general report we found savings in the department of education 3 3 in loan guarantees for defaulted student loans according to one general accounting office audit there is more we will talk about more of that today he found savings in the energy department in the health and human services department administration and so on and so forth it is not hard to find savings to find that one penny if you are devoted to rolling up your sleeves and doing the hard work of finding the money it is an important proposition i suggest for this congress and for the white house rather than fighting over the relative merit of saving one penny out of a dollar to save social security we ought to be joining in partnership and rolling up our sleeves together and getting down in the trenches at the department of education in the department of defense over at the department of energy over in health and human services and working together cooperatively to find all the efficiencies and savings that we possibly can to build a credible government for the future security of our children and for our nation i yield to the gentleman from california who has led the house through this investigation of where these funds may be found and pointed not only me but other colleagues in the direction that we ought to look in order to find some of these savings"],

castro would be so committed to completing two nuclear power plants whose design is so inherently faulty that everywhere where they had been completed in eastern europe they were closed down proves he is desperate he wants it complete even those nuclear power plants the dictatorship is bankrupt and desperate the clear signs of that for example are that just a few days ago he went to the dominican republic where the very mediocre president of the re public there who falls all over himself when he sees castro literally just about he drools in admiration castro was there and all of a sudden his number two bodyguard and it is important to know what these bodyguards are in the context of cuban society they are the ones who have everything the people do not have starting with the food and all the privileges and benefits his personal bodyguards well his number two personal bodyguard defected responsible for waking castro up and taking care of his life if he cannot trust his number two bodyguard of the hundreds of bodyguards he has who can he trust obviously he knows no one that is a sign of desperation that is a sign of where the dictatorship is people say well the policy has not functioned what do they mean it has not functioned when it has to be in place conditioned our embargo conditioned its lifting conditioned on the three key developments that have to occur in cuba and that will occur in cuba in other words the liberation of all political prisoners legalization of political parties labor unions and the press and the scheduling of free elections this is a desperate bankrupt dictatorship that obviously everyone knows even the supporters of the dictatorship that it cannot survive the life of the dictator if we maintain the embargo the leverage obviously the dictatorship is desperate and bankrupt now there is something i need to say because i think it is fair the un human rights commission in geneva passed a resolution this last friday condemning the human rights violations by the castro regime and i want to publicly commend congratulate and show my admiration for the czech republic who was the prime sponsor of the resolution and the polish government as well in other words the czech president vaclav havel and polish prime minister jerzy buzek who were the prime sponsors of this resolution this marvelous resolution standing firm on the side of the cuban people and really those who voted for the governments who voted for it constitute a hall of fame and dignity at this time and those who voted against it really constitute a hall of shame it only passed by one vote by the way but it passed obviously too many people when we realize it passed by one vote are in the hall of shame but nevertheless the hall of fame prevailed in favor argentina austria canada chile the czech republic ecuador france germany ireland italy japan latvia luxembourg morocco by the way i want to thank his royal highness king hassan and the distinguished and brilliant foreign minister mohammad benaisa benahista for their courageous stand norway poland the republic of korea romania that wonderful heroic people the united kingdom the united states of america and uruguay a significant development in this last year because there was a defeat in this resolution a year ago a significant development was the naming by secretary albright of assistant secretary coe assistant secretary for human rights he did a wonderful job and he is to be commended and then of course voting against and i am not going to go into the entire list but the fact that latin american neighbors of the cuban people two of them voted against mexico and brazil the mexican government remains consistent in its policy of corruption in all aspects and the new venezuelan president who wrote a letter by the way to carlos the jackal the terrorist that i referred to previously well the new venezuelan president wrote him a letter the other day congratulating him that is the new president of venezuela and then abstaining in other words those who say yes i see the horrible violations of human rights but i do not have the courage or the whatever to vote to condemn them abstaining was colombia el salvador and guatemala they may not be in the hall of shame but they sure are near i think in addition to congratulating the people who those governments have voted for this resolution and noting our disillusionment with those who abstained and of course our condemnation of those who voted against i remain convinced that a great problem that the cuban people face the reason why there have been so many years of dictatorship there one of the great reasons is the lack of press coverage i ask my colleagues i ask the american people watching on cspan did they read or see coverage of castros bodyguard defecting the no 2 bodyguard of a dictator that has been in power for 40 years did they read about it hear about it was it in the news did they hear about this resolution that condemned the human rights violations did they read or hear about did they see coverage about the crackdown that castro was involved in against the cuban people the new law calling for up to 30 years of imprisonment for peaceful prodemocracy activity have they read about that have they seen coverage do they know about the four best known dissidents in cuba the in effect vaclav havels and lech walesas of cuba who bravely refused freedom in lieu of prison and were just sentenced to long prison terms for writing a document asking for free elections and criticizing oneparty government have they read about their names vladimiro roca felix bonne rene gomez manzano marta beatriz roque had they heard about the prisoner that i referred to before that pax christi netherlands talked about his repeated beatings a 33yearold man condemned to 18 years in prison for peacefully advocating for democracy had they heard about jorge luis garcia perez antunez did they know about oscar elias biscet or leonel morejon almagro who has been nominated by over 60 members of this house for the nobel peace prize or vicky ruiz or the hundreds of other prodemocracy activists in cuba or the independent press who bravely each day fight for democracy or work to inform the world about the horrors about what is going on have they read about that or did they read about the baltimore orioles or the harlem globetrotters playing with cubas national teams is that what we read about that is the only thing that the press covers with regard to cuba how cute the baltimore orioles or the harlem globetrotters playing castros designated national team that is the only coverage in essence with very rare exceptions it is time to help the internal opposition a number of us are filing we prepared legislation that basically tells the president of the united states we in the congress we passed a law 3 years ago saying he is authorized to help the internal opposition in cuba to find ways to do it like we did in poland and he has not done it and it is time that we do it and we are filing legislation to do so it is time that the world learn the names of the vaclav havels and the lech walesas of cuba it is time that the world be able to put faces to those names and names to those faces it is time to help the internal opposition we will be filing this legislation we need the support of our colleagues it does not deal with the embargo they can be protrade antitrade or in the middle they can stand for the cuban peoples right to be free by supporting this legislation that calls on the president to devise a plan like was done by president reagan in poland to help the internal opposition and we talk to those now members of parliament in poland or the president in the czech republic and they will tell us what it meant when we had a president in the united states who stood with them and found ways to help them when they were dissidents and when they were being persecuted by their communist totalitarian regimes that is what we need to do in the case of cuba cuba will be free the congress has always been on the side of the cuban people what we need is the president to speak up on this issue on these people 90 miles away our closest friends our closest neighbors to stand on their side and against the repressor we need the administration to be heard the congress is heard will continue to be heard has been heard and we are going to file our legislation and we need the support of our colleagues i know we have it because always the congress of the united states have stood with the cuban people and the cuban people when they are free they will remember this congress for having stood always for their right to be free for selfdetermination for freedom for

distribution from the resettlement fund for the people of bikini establisled by congress in 1982 for relocation and resettlement assistance primarily for the remaining senior citizens of bikini atoll the odyssey of the bikini people is a very sad one indeed they were moved off their atoll in march of 1946 by the unitedstates navy to facilitate the unitedstates nuclear testing program they were first moved to rongerik an uninhabited atoll some 100 miles east of bikini naval officials stated that rongerik was bigger and richer than bikini but it turned out that the move was illconceived and poorly planned contrary to the navys assertions rongeriks land area is onequarter of the size of bikini and its lifesustaining pandanus and coconut trees were considerably less productive than those of bikini the situation on rongerik steadily deteriorated over the next 2 years in july of 1947 a medical officer who visited the atoll reported that the bikinians were visibly suffering from malnutrition several sites for another relocation were explored but none proved satisfactory however when a navy physician examined the bikinians in march of 1948 and found them to be a starving people emergency measures were called for and the bikinians were immediately evacuated to the navy base at kwajalein atoll as early as 1948 as the official navy history of the trust territory notes definite physiological scars were left on the people the consequences of their two relocations 2 years on rongerik and nearly 8 months on kwajalein were already abundantly evident in less than 3 years the once selfsufficient people had been transformed into dependent wards of the united states their very existence had been threatened and the little confidence that they had in themselves was diminished the third relocation of the bikinians occurred in november of 1948 when the community was moved to kili island some 400 miles south of bikini although kili receives more rainfall than bikini and has richer soils it is an island a high island not an atoll and it is about oneninth the land area of bikini it has neither lagoon sheltered fishing ground protected anchorage nor good beaches instead a flat reef shelf forms around the circumference of the island and drops abruptly to great depths as a result it is virtually inaccessible by sea from november to may when tradewinds cause heavy surf to pound the shore this drastic change from an atoll existence with its abundant fish and islands as far as the eye could see to an isolated island with no lagoon and inaccessible marine resources took a severe physiological toll on the bikini people since their arrival there in 1948 the bikinians have compared kili to a jail the elders sorely miss the ability to move about an atoll engage in fishing expeditions across the lagoon or in the open sea and sail to other islands at bikini much of mens lives had centered about their sailing canoes and they spent many hours working together on them these sailing canoes had to be abandoned on kili and the bikinians have lost virtually all thier sailing and fishing skills today 53 years after their move from bikini less than half the elders who were moved off originally in 1946 are still alive the radiological cleanupand resettlement of bikini is at least a decade away and will cost at least several hundred million dollars and the numerous relocations of the people have had severe consequences the bikinians did not desire relocation in 1946 but they believed they had no alternative but to comply with the wishes of the united states much of the bikinians culture and society and identity are rooted in their ancestral home the islands reefs and lagoon of bikini atoll the peoples identity the very essence of their perceptions of themselves is intimately tied to their home atoll the system of land rights provided much of the underlying structure for the organization of the community short of loss of life itself the loss of their ancestral homeland represented the worst calamity imaginable for the bikini people the confinement of the bikini people to kili has deprived them of most of the activities and pleasures that they enjoy at bikini atoll the people of bikini gave the united states everything they had their land and their home they demanded nothing in return they asked only that the united states care for them until their land had served its purpose and could be returned to them the united states promised that it would do so but some 53 years later and 41 years after the last nuclear test at bikini the bikinians are still not home they lived up to their side of the deal and the people of the free world did well by them they made contributions to the victory and the cold war that many other peoples did not the tests in the marshall islands cost hundreds of billions of dollars but we never questioned their value because these nuclear tests assured unitedstates nuclear superiority over the soviet union and saved billions of dollars in defense spending as the atomic energy commission reported to congress in 1953 each of the tests involved a major expenditure of money manpower scientific effort and time nevertheless in accelerating the rate of weapons development they saved far more than their costs in an attempt to assist the people of bikini we provided funding for their resettlement trust fund in 1982 those funds have been well invested and it is only appropriate for us to support a onetime 3 percent distribution to the heads of household with the understanding that the bikini elders will be the primary beneficiaries thanks to sound investment decisions this trust fund has earned almost 14 percent annually since 1982 so a 3 percent distribution will not require an appropriation of funds by congress nor will it diminish the original corpus of the trust i want to say on a personal note that this especially goes out to the family of ralph waltz who was a peace corps volunteer on kili atoll and who was personal witness to this mr waltz has since passed away but he was a very good friend of mine and he first brought me to these issues that are

the essence h r 5164 can and should be enacted into law this year it directly responds to the problems that the committees hearings uncovered in the firestone tire recall case the legislation directs the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa to develop a plan for analyzing and using information it receives this is important because the hearings showed that more than two years ago nhtsa had information on 47 cases of tread separation involving the recalled tires but failed to do anything with the information it already had in addition this legislation requires manufacturers to give nhtsa claims data and other information that proved to be so important in the firestone case if this legislation becomes law manufacturers will have to notify nhtsa about recalls or customer satisfaction actions taken in foreign countries furthermore new enhanced criminal penalties will apply to man ufacturers and others if they knowingly and willfully withhold or falsify information with the specific intention of misleading the secretary concerning safety related defects that have caused death or serious bodily injury the criminal penalties provided in this legislation fit the requirements set out by transportation secretary rodney slater when he testified before the committee at that time secretary slater said the wrong kind of criminal penalties could slow down nhtsas enforcement activities and that he would only support criminal penalties for egregious activity and serious matters the criminal penalties provided in the legislation strike the proper balance between holding people accountable for their actions without discouraging voluntary reporting and cooperation with government agencies we have adopted an amendment on criminal penalties which will ensure that the safe harbor provisions cannot be used by an individual if that individual had actual knowledge at the time of the violation that the violation would result in accident causing death or serious bodily injury as the gentleman from louisiana mr tauzin stated in his explanation of the provision i also call to my colleagues attention the fact that this legislation authorizes 9 1 million for nhtsa the full amount that the agency requested to deal with matters related to the firestone tire recall while budget cuts in the past may have hindered nhtsas activities in important areas it is clear that at this time republican and democratic members of the committee recognize the importance of nhtsas work i would note however that we must move quickly if we are to help nhtsa prevent a recurrence of the kind of problem that occurred in the firestone case time is quickly running out for this congress while there is not enough time to solve every problem at nhtsa we can and we should enact legislation to deal with the major problems uncovered in the committees investigation of the recent firestone tire recalls public concern is great and not just about the dangers of driving on the recalled tires the public rightly perceives that both firestone and nhtsa failed to respond early on to information and warnings that should have alerted them to the problems with the recalled firestone tires those failures caused consumers to be exposed to risks of injury and death far longer than should have been the case both nhtsa and the companies involved need to take affirmative

most rushing yards in a game 275 but what made payton a great football player was his total packagethe blocking the running the receiving and the durabilityhe only missed one game his entire career during his rookie season when the coaches held him out despite paytons insistence on playing through an injury he was also the bears emergency kicker punter and quarterbackhe once played quarterback

hardworking lunchpail attitude that payton brought to the field walter was a role model on and off the field he owned many businesses and started a charitable organization the walter payton foundation payton quietly helped collect toys and clothes for children who spent the holidays away from their own families usually because of abuse or other mistreatment for some children the toys were the only gifts they got walter was also a religious man his former teammate mike singletary said that walter found an inner peace the day of his death when the two read scripture together it came as a surprise when walter was diagnosed with his rare liver disease still those who followed walters career on and off the field believed that he would overcome the disease just as he had overcome many opponents on the field and in the boardroom so the big shock came with news of his death the nation grieved the loss of a sports hero but chicago mourned the loss of an icon who touched many when payton was once

that question is are they into it are they into ft is the current slogan for the 4h are they into it is the rallying cry for the 4h clubs of america as they approach 100 years of service to communities and neighborhoods from coast to coast are they into it is the call that over 6 million young people answered last year in 4h clubs and organizations across the nation are they into it is the mantra repeated by over a half a million volunteers who donate an average of 200 per year to keep the 4h clubs strong and vital in their communities are they into it is the question answered by private sector partners of 4h who invest almost 100 million into 4h youth development programs i am glad to say that today this body is into it and i thank the gentleman from georgia for bringing this resolution forward today i am very pleased and proud to be on the floor supporting this important measure introduced by the gentleman from georgia many people believe we live in an era of unprecedented cynicism and skepticism that is why it is important for this congress to take a little time to recognize the outstanding organization like 4h which brings young people together to do good for their communities and to grow as principled individuals in fact research indicates that volunteerism among young americans has actually been on the increase americas youth want to participate in the betterment of their communities and their country the 4h is uniquely established to provide opportunity to young people nationwide to learn valuable life skills work with others toward common goals and developing into community leaders the 4h is a dynamic organization whose mission is to foster innovation and shared learning for americas youth ages 6 to 19 its vision is to draw upon combined power of youth and adults so that we can learn together in order to address the challenges and opportunities critical to youth in our communities 4h stresses three fundamental values first we must treat others with mutual trust and respect and open and honest communication second we must assume personal leadership and responsibility for our actions and third we must celebrate our differences as well as our similarities and always realize that working with youth as partners is the key to our success last week i met with several young people from my district from western wisconsin who are in washington on different trips two of whom were here for the conference voices against violence and one was here with the national young leadership conference which uses the 4h facilities here in washington for mock government sessions throughout the year what i found striking about these young people is their commitment to their communities and whether consciously or unconsciously to the values and ideals fostered by the 4h andy slind of boyceville wisconsin told me he plans to continue working in his community during the last 2 years of his high school and would work to participate in some form of public service after college our young people know they have a stake in their communities and want to help shape their futures 4h provides opportunities for such involvement and it hones the values and skills we all cherish as americans i am grateful for the opportunity to commemorate the 4h today for personal reasons as well i am a former 4h club member myself when i was a boy growing up in western wisconsin i loved and appreciated the time that i spent within my 4h club 4h continues to play a central role in communities like mine in fact just on saturday my local paper carried an article describing a man who was being honored for his dedication to 4h bob fredrick of viroqua wisconsin has been a 4h youth development agent for 40 years he started in 1957 at the age of 25 and decided to make the youth program his sole career in honor of bobs lifelong dedication to vernon county youth the community is establishing a special fund for youth programs in his name as i mentioned earlier over 6 million young people were involved in 4h programs last year in fact nationwide 1 in 7 americans have been involved in 4h at some point during their lives in fact in addition to myself three of my staffers here in washington were 4h members in their youth and i would venture to guess that many others around capitol hill have experience with a 4h club 4h was founded in 1902 and established in my home state of wisconsin in 1914 there are currently over 2 000 4h clubs in my state alone and almost 190 000 young people from wisconsin that belong to 4h clubs wisconsin was proud to host the national 4h dairy conference this last september which drew over 250 young people from around the united states and canada to learn about new technologies and techniques in dairy farming while many people associate 4h with rural communities and agricultural issues kids from cities and suburbs from all backgrounds belong to 4h clubs through 4h they study citizenship and civics communications and arts consumer and family issues earth and environmental science technology and personal leadership in closing i am very happy to be here today to commemorate 4h and its contributions to american communities for the past 98 years by pledging their heads to clearer thinking their hearts to greater loyalty their hands to larger service and their health to better living our young people along with the adult volunteers who teach and help them do work to strengthen their clubs their communities their countries and their world i reserve the

diabetes the epidemic of our time the impact diabetes has on the health of our population on the national budget is staggering every year diabetes causes about 24 000 more people to lose their sight 28 000 more people to undergo dialysis or transplantation for kidney failure and 77 000 more people to lose their lives from heart disease these diabetesrelated side effects in combination shorten life expectancy by an estimated 15 years in the year 1999 approximately 800 000 people will be diagnosed with diabetes and the disease will contribute to almost 200 000 deaths in the united states the number of americans with diabetes has increased nearly 700 percent in the last 40 years again a primary reason that the cdc has called it the epidemic of our time the public and private costs of diabetes are enormous an estimated 105 billion annually including over 40 billion a year in federal dollars more then 1 out of every 10 health care dollars in the unitedstates and about 1 out of 4 medicare dollars is spent on diabetes care in new york state almost 600 000 people and 10 of our seniors have been diagnosed with diabetes at an annual public and private cost of about 8 billion diabetes kills one american every 3 minutes and a new case of diabetes is diagnosed in the united states every 40 seconds and unfortunately an estimated 52 million americans have diabetes right now and do not even know it but new research is filled with promise the diabetes research working group created by congress in 1997 has developed a comprehensive plan for future research that would cost 827 million next year congress mandated this study congress has received its mandated report and yet last year we gave 448 million about half of what is called for only 3 percent of the total nih budget for diabetes that is simply 28 per patient that is not enough yet every day research and new technologies are improving diabetes diagnosis and treatment for example current diagnostic methods cannot always detect adult onset diabetes at the earliest stage of the disease but a new technology has been developed that will diagnose adult onset diabetes as much as 5 years earlier than any current method by scanning the eye retina with low intensity florescent light an early diagnosis can significantly reduce the risk of serious complications we need to increase research for diagnosis blood testing is also becoming less obtrusive a continuous glucose monitoring system recently approved by the fda continuously and automatically monitors glucose levels underneath the skin future generations of this device may permit the patient to monitor blood levels and connect to an insulin pump for seamless care a glucowatch a device worn like a wristwatch will test blood levels easily and painlessly this device which is pending fda approval is as successful at blood testing as conventional methods that require pricking the finger multiple times every day and causes only a slight tingling sensation we need to increase research for blood monitoring we also must increase research for treatment for example we are at the brink of developing an ability to inhale insulin rather than inject it into the body multiple times per day another burden for people with diabetes is the need to inject themselves with insulin several new drugs taken orally may reduce the need to take insulin injections one class of drugs called insulin sensitizers helps to lower blood glucose primarily by reducing insulin resistance in muscles other groups of drugs work by suppressing glucose production from the liver increasing insulin production by the pancreas or decreasing sugar absorption from the intestine for those who will still need insulin a power is being developed that can be inhaled so that injections might not be necessary we need to increase research for treatment in juvenile diabetes type 1 insulinroducing cells called islets are destroyed making daily insulin injections necessary the juvenile diabetes foundation jdf has established three centers for islet transportation which will attempt to transplant healthy islets to cure juvenile diabetes and find new ways to prevent transplant rejection and other dangerous sideeffects the nih and the jdf are also developing new ways to manipulate the immune system by inhibiting harmful immune responses while keeping protective ones intact we need to increase research for cures ultimately genetics may hold the key to a cure the american diabetes association has initiated the genetics of noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus gennid study in order to maximize the rapid identification of the gene or genes involved in adultonset diabetes this study has established a national database and cellbank to store information and specimens from families with long histories of the disease the human genome project which is currently mapping the entire human genetic structure may also provide significant clues to the nature of diabetes again we need to increase research for treatment but the fight goes on we must increase support and research for diabetes for diagnosis for monitoring for treatment and

month without celebrating my parents my mother and my father my father is 87 years old and fortunately he is still around we say that he was a doctor of sorts but he really was not he was a doctor

to save this calf that we could not afford to lose it so he simply got his ax sharpened it as sharp as he could get it got himself some ashes and soot and coal oil and chloroform had my brothers and i to hold this calf and cut the calfs leg off the calf lived and we had a threelegged cow from then on we were the only people and we actually kept the cow until we finally took her to the auction in a
