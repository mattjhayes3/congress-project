reasonable steps against it and thus eliminate any chance of repeating what happened during construction of the unitedstates embassy in moscow some years ago i also commend the conferees for including 8 4 million to refresh the supply of quick masks deployed around the capitol complex to protect persons against chemical or biological attack the current masks have a limited shelflife and making these funds available now will expedite the process of replacement as they approach their expiration dates there is no question that the congress needs a new offsite delivery center to facilitate the

than five months remaining in fiscal 2005 the police could not hire and fully train 132 more officers by september 30 so there is little reason to include funds in this bill or even the funds for all 50 more officers included in the senatebill i am pleased that under these circumstances the conferees chose to defer a decision about the need for 254 more officers until the house administration

considered to have been more dedicated to the peace and security of his country than was yitzhak rabin as a young man rabins character was hardened by war he joined the army at 18 years old before it was named the israeli defense force before the state of israel existed he would serve in the military for 27 years fighting in the 1948 war of independence 1956 suez war and after rising to the rank of chief of staff commanded the israeli defense force in the six day war of 1964 shortly after leading his troops to a stunning decisive victory in that historical war rabin retired from the military to become a diplomat and politician perhaps suggesting that peace was more effectively sought through diplomacy than through war rabih who spent a majority of his life as an instrument of war shifted gears and dedicated the rest of his life to the peace process among his major accomplishments were as prime minister orchestrating the signing of the interim peace agreement between israel and egypt which laid the groundwork for the 1979 camp david peace treaty between the two countries fifteen years later in his second term of service as prime minister he would sign a peace treaty between israel and jordan it is remarkable in retrospect that rabin who as a young man fought several wars against egypt and jordan would be such an outspoken and instrumental figure in working towards peace with israels arab neighbors yitzhak rabins life was prematurely taken from him on november 4 1995 when he was murdered at a peace rally in king david square many today suggest that if rabin had never been murdered his visi5n of peace for the middle east may have come to fruition despite his great military career yitzhak rabin is remembered as a champion of peace i urge my colleagues to honor the

resolution came about as he described after a trip that we took with other members of the international relations committpe to russia in may of this year during the trip we learned firsthand the extent of the ip piracy problem in russia which has reached epidemic levels second only to china in the world indeed the unitedstates copyright industry lost over 1 7 billion last year due to russian piracy and over 6 billion in the last 5 years and the situation is getting worse when we visited in may the number of optical disk plants was 36 now it is 42 with a production capacity that far

inadequate and nondeterrent i fear that unlesg russia substantially improves ipr law and enforcement practices russian participation in the world trade system should be restricted this is the reason

protecting intellectual property rights we understand that to curb the proliferation of ipr violations in russia it is not enough to focus on how many laws are passed by the duma and how many raidsqn
