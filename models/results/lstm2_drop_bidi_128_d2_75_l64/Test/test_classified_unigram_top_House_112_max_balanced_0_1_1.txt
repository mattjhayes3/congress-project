6 months ago the house and the senate have both been understandably and properly concerned with one issue that has perhaps eclipsed every other issue that has come before us in this halfyear period of time that related to our national debt and the anticipated expiration of our debt limit which will hit in just a couple weeks many americans are understandably concerned and have articulated the concern that if we pass the debt limit deadline of august 2 without raising the debt limit there could be catastrophic financial consequences in light of that i along with a number of my republican colleagues both in the senate and in the house have introduced legislation called the cut cap and balance act to address the debt limit to address it head on it says we will raise the debt limit if three conditions are met first that we make significant cuts to domestic discretionary spending for the fiscal year 2012 budget second we need statutory spending caps to put us on a smooth but steady glidepath toward balancing our budget sometime within the next decade third we need a balanced budget amendment passed out of congress and submitted to the states for ratification we think all three of these steps are necessarily required before we take the significant additional step of raising the debt limit because of the fact that it took us a long time to get to this point the point where by the end of the year we will have accumulated 15 trillion in debtabout 50 000 for every man woman and child in america between 120 000 and 150 000 for every wage earner in america this is a lot of moneybefore we extend that debt limit again by an additional 2 4 trillion we have to solve the problem we have to address the problem that led to its creation in a real lasting binding fundamental way that is why the most critical part of this legislation while each part is important happens to be found in that which rests upon the idea of a balanced budget amendment to the constitution we as members of congress could decide right now that over the next 10 years or 15 years it might be a good idea to cut spending by 2 trillion 3 trillion 4 trillion 5 trillion 6 trillion perhaps morebut if we made that promise today as a downpayment to the american people in exchange for the permission of the people to raise the debt limit it is a promise we cannot make good on because we cannot bind a future congress this congress was sworn in in january of 2011 elections will be held in november of 2012 and a new congress will be sworn in based on those elections in january 2013 the same thing will happen again in january 2015 and every 2 years after that for the duration of our republic the decisions we make right here right now can affect the here and now and can be binding for the here and now but we cannot reasonably expect and we cannot ask the american people when making a decision so longlasting and precedentsetting as this one to simply trust us that future congresses will see things the same way we do the only way we can bind a future congress is by amending our law of laws that 224yearold document painstakingly ironed out by some of the brightest men of the last several centuries in philadelphia 224 years ago when we amend the constitution we make it possible to bind a future congress that is what we need to do we have had some interesting debate and discussion surrounding this proposal last friday i listened with surprise and dismay as our president said we dont need to amend the constitution to require a balanced budget but we do need to balance our budget in the opinion of the president congress just needs to do its job not amend the constitution i think i understand his point i think he is suggesting that for congress to do its job it needs to balance its budget but i have to ask the question how has that worked out for us have past congresses balanced their budgets has the current congress balanced its budget overwhelmingly the answer is no it happens every now and then some would describe those instances where it has balanced in the last two or three decades as an accident others a momentary blip still others would suggest it was the product of accounting gimmickry rather than an actual act of budget balancing when that occurred regardless we know that balanced federal budgets are newsworthy indeed because they are very rare i look forward to the day when they are no longer newsworthy when they are customary and the only way to make them customary based on our experience as americans throughout most of our nations history is by amending the constitution to require it to make this a binding and permanent law i was shocked and dismayed again to learn that our senate majority leader senator reid from nevada stated just a few hours ago that he does not like this legislation he made some very disparaging comments about it notwithstanding the fact and completely ignoring the fact that this is not just the best legislation to address the debt limit issue right now it is the only legislation it is the only legislation that addresses this issue that is moving through congress and that has been reduced to legislative language it is certainly the only one that has been passed by one body of congress and is now moving over to the senate he is criticizing something when he himself has not offered anything this is the only show in town given how close we now are to the august 2 deadline and in part because we punted this so long and in part because we have not been having the debate and discussion in congress we should have been having for months this is it this is the only proposal if senator reid has suggestions on how we might change this proposal i am all ears i would love to hear what they are if he has his own proposal i would love to see what that is but simply to stand from that desk over there and disparage this legislation is inexcusable absolutely inexcusable given the fact that he has offered nothing let me read some of his words he said the american people should understand that this this meaning the cut cap and balance act is a bad piece of legislation perhaps some of the worst legislation in the history of this country i dont know what he is referring to he didnt give specifics nor has he given any specifics on what he would like to see in its place or how it could be improved my suggestion to our senate majority leader is if he has ideas please put them on the table because as we approach this debt limit deadline we are running out of time the clock has been ticking for 6 months we have known this was going to happen this is not news to us why then has there been so little debate and discussion in this body why is it that we spent weeks and weeks and weeks often dealing with legislation that paled in comparison to the importance of this issue the clock kept ticking and we kept debating and discussing other legislation far less important this in my opinion was a gross dereliction of duty but we still have a few weeks we can still deal with it we can still address it i suggest strongly that we address it by starting with that legislation that has actually been proposed and that we have full debate and discussion but no we are told even after the house of representatives earlier this week passed the cut cap and balance act passed it with bipartisan support by the wayno fewer than five members of the democratic caucus in the house of representatives voted to support this that was passed tuesday night we were told later we would be having a vote on saturday or perhaps monday then just a little while ago we were informed by the senate majority leader that the vote would be tomorrow giving us little or no time for actual debate and discussion on the floor of what is still to this moment the only legislation moving through to address this issue this is not an appropriate moment for demagoguery demagoguery on an issue this important can result in a lot of unnecessary pain no one disputes that there could be significant negative economic consequences associated with not raising the debt limit i do not dispute that not for a moment that is exactly why i put my neck on the line in order to file this legislation because nothing else was moving forward i didnt want to do it but when i was sworn in as a senator just a few months ago i understood it was my obligation to do what i could to make things better to make our constitutional system work so i filed it it is an insult not only to me and to my colleagues but to all americans when addressing an issue this important to have so little debate and discussion over this issue i find it appalling i find it reprehensible i demand an explanation and i demand an alternative solution if the senate majority leader is going to pick this apart and say he will not do it moreover i will remind the senate majority leader that just a few short years ago in 2006 when we had a different president belonging to a different party and this body was in control of another party if my memory serves me correctly not only did thensenator barack obama vote against raising the debt limit calling the need to do so the product of a failure of leadership that he was not willing to condone and perpetuate but every single one of his democratic colleagues joined him in that vote not one of them voted to raise the debt limit here we are again approaching the debt limit here we are again with only republicans stepping to the plate and offering a solution only this time the solution is a permanent one unfortunately in 2006 and prior and in subsequent debt limit extension votes there was no serious debate attached to it as to a permanent solution we have to amend the governing document the law of laws the only kind of law that can bind future congresses in order to solve this problem we have to do it now this is part of what it means to be an american we as americans crave liberty and we eschew tyranny to any degree every single time we authorize deficit spending we fuel the unfettered expansion of the federal government and all its power we commit ourselves and our posterity to a future that will include working more and more hours and days and weeks and even months just to pay their federal tax bills every single year that is time they will not get back that is time we will not get back that erodes our individual liberty it also erodes our liberty when the same regulatory structure that exists today grows bigger and bigger every year because we are borrowing now more than 1 5 trillion every single yearnot because of some aberrational condition some unusual development that requires an unusual expenditure of borrowed money but just to cover our basic daytoday operations this is what fuels the perpetual expansion of government and when government expands perpetually our individual liberty is diminished unfortunately and to a corresponding degree this is unacceptable but there is a way home the way home is found in limiting the role of government we can limit the role of government most effectively at this point in time i believe by limiting the pool of money to which congress has access the only way to do that is through a constitutional amendment i wish to close by addressing one final argument that sometimes has been used in response to and against the cut cap and balance act many of its detractors are making the claim that i find extraordinary a claim that says why are you even supporting this because it cant pass it is a little bit akin to saying why do we even play the super bowl when it is expected that one team is going to beat the other team we have to play but this one is not a game this one is for real when we vote after debating and discussing members of this body can and will be held accountable to our constituents so it will be up to me and each of my colleagues in this body to decide how to vote on this issue for those who make the unfortunate decision to vote against this notwithstanding the fact that 75 percent of the american people strongly support the idea of a balanced budget amendment notwithstanding the fact that 66 percent of americansboth of these figures according to a cnn poll todaysupport the principles underlying cut cap and balance notwithstanding the fact that this is the only permanent way of solving our debt problem if members of congress and members of this body choose to vote against this legislation they will do so i believe at their own peril they will have to face their constituents and explain why a handful of them were unwilling to raise the debt limit unwilling to address this problem unwilling to fix the perpetual deficit spending habit of congress simply because they did not want a balanced budget amendment to the constitution i think that is a tall order i think that is difficult to explain i think those who try to make that explanation to their constituents will do so at their own political peril but more importantly the vote they cast will be at the peril of the people of the united states of america of their liberty of their economic stability and of their ability to prosper now and in the future we can turn this ship around but in order do it we need robust debate and discussion and our constituents deserve more the american people deserve more than to have the kind of sleightofhand scheduling and the kind of dismissive cavalier attitude toward what is being characterized correctly by many as the fight of an entire generation we need to pass the cut cap and balance act it is not only the best solution it is the only solution the time is running out and i urge each of my colleagues to support this thank you mr president i yield the floor"], [0.9920467156916857, 0.007953284308314323, 1, "i have known john adler for 20 years he entered the new jersey state senate in january 1992 having been the only democratic candidate to win an open seat that year defeating an incumbent in what was not a strong year for the democratic party his party it was a strong year for my party the republican party and so he came to trenton as a phenomenon he was a very young man he was born in 1959 so he would have been 32 years old when he became a member of the state senate i had been elected to an unexpired term in the general assembly the year before and i served in the 1990s in the general assembly the lower house of our legislature and he served continually in our upper house in our state senate having first been elected in 1991 and then reelected in 1993 1997 2001 2003 and 2007 he rose to a position of prominence in the new jersey senate he eventually chaired the state senate judiciary committee which is an extremely important responsibility in the structure of our government in new jersey and he was always interested in public policy the year before he was elected to the state senate he had run as an underdog in a congressional race and although he did not win that race i think that many took note of his candidacy and i think that propelled him into our state senate i moved from the lower house of the new jersey legislature to the state senate in the election of 2001 when we became direct colleagues and we worked together on many different issues and he always worked in a collegial and extremely competent fashion indeed we sat next to each other for a period of time of our service in the state senate divided only by the center aisle to those who know our state capitol in trenton the state senate chamber is a very small room it was designed originally for 21 members one state senator from each of our 21 counties and when the state senate was increased in population in the 1960s based upon the principle of one person one vote to 40 members it became a place where its really quite overcrowded and so we really sat extremely close to each other in this small chamber of the state senate john adlers career in the legislature was one of distinctionfor example prohibiting smoking in indoor public places and workplaces he also sponsored an act promoting lower vehicle emissions and an antipredatory lending act to protect consumers from unfair credit practices and based on that and many other accomplishments when he came here he was appointed to the financial services committee the committee to which i was appointed as well and so we became colleagues not only here in this chamber the house of representatives the peoples house across the united states but we became colleagues on the financial services committee john was not raised in circumstances of affluence he lost his father when he was a young man and for him and his mother it was a struggle and yet despite that he went to harvard he was graduated from harvard college in 1981 and from harvard law school in 1984 he was an excellent student and at harvard he met the person who became his wife shelley someone whom i know and who is known by my wife heidi and we consider ourselves to be friends with the entire adler family and together john and shelley brought into this world four wonderful sons jeff alex andrew and oliver all of whom i know jeff is at harvard at the moment alex is at cornell and they have two younger brothers and tonight on this sad day the day when johns funeral took place at temple emanuel in cherry hill we remember prayerfully his wife shelley and their beautiful sons jeff alex andrew and oliver in 2008 there were two open seats in the house of representatives in new jersey due to retirements jim saxton in district 3 and mike ferguson in district 7 and john succeeded jim saxton as i had the honor of succeeding mike ferguson so we were the only freshmen in the class of 2008 from new jersey and i think that we shared that bond as of course every member of a freshman class shares a particular and special bond certainly it is exciting for someone to move from a state legislative chamber here to the house of representatives and i think we shared that excitement for example when we went together to the harvard seminar that took place for new members and of course the orientation that takes place here and when we would bump into each other in the hall here during orientation sometimes we thought what were we doing here it was an exciting time for both of us john adler was a person of enormous wit a very dry subtle and sophisticated wit and it really pierced the veil of much of what occurs in public life and in political life where in so many instances we take ourselves too seriously that was not congressman adler he had been involved over the course of his life in many different charitable activities he served on the cherry hill township council before he went to the state legislature the boards of the camden county chapter of the american red cross the food bank of south jersey the virtua west jersey health and hospital foundation and the camden county advisory board on children and certainly his respect for the political process is something that we should all recall especially those of us who had the honor of serving with him in trenton and in washington i believe that those who serve in public life do so out of a sense of responsibility john adler could have made a great fortune in the practice of law given his native intelligence given his academic training and given his ability as a speaker he chose to be involved in public life in cherry hill a great suburban community in camden county in southern new jersey in the state legislature where he was very much involved in making sure that the judges who were appointed to office in new jersey were men and women of ability we have a system in new jersey where our judges are appointed not elected appointed by the governor and confirmed by the state senate and as chairman of the state senate judiciary committee john was intimately involved in that the district he served was an interesting district the only camden county community in the district is his hometown of cherry hill and he served vast portions of neighboring counties burlington county and ocean county and to those who are not familiar with the geography of the state of new jersey places in ocean county are among the most beautiful beaches anywhere not only in this country but in the entire world and i know that he had a commitment to protecting our environment john adlers life was ended by a bacterial infection in his heart at age 51 his father had died in his late 40s also based upon a heart condition so perhaps john adler had a weakened heart but he had a very strong heart in his views on public policy in his views on helping the people whom he represented first in a municipal governing body for many distinguished years in our state senate and in the 111th congress where he was my colleague and my friend and where we too alone were the freshmen from the state of new jersey

representatives i rise in support of the underlying bills the entrepreneur access to capital act and access to capital for job creators act now while i support the two bills before us i do wish the rule was an open one i will be voting against the rule an open rule would allow the house to work its will in a true democratic process allowing members to come down to the floor and freely debate these bills unfortunately in the rules committee we were offered only a structured rule now both of these bills accomplish something very important in terms of opening up capital markets and helping startups work let me discuss briefly how this whole accredited investor concept works to be an accredited investor you simply need to be worth 1 million or have income of 200 000 a year now thats a very rarified strata of the american people what does that mean when youre an accredited investor it means that you can participate in a private equity offering that doesnt need to go through the full sec process which is cumbersome and costs a lot of money so in effect many venture capital opportunities funding opportunities for startup companies are reserved for those who are only worth above a million dollars they say the easiest way to make a million dollars is to already be worth a million dollars in fact people worth more than a million dollars have heretofore had a monopoly on participating in these kinds of opportunities now what can an average american family lets say with a net worth of 50 000 or 100 000 do well they can go to las vegas and they can bet it all on number 9 they can buy gold which is being pushed by all these profit organizations and i think we need a congressional investigation into that many of these organizations selling gold sell it for above market value by preying on unsuspecting people who are not accredited investors they might be worth 50 000 or 100 000 what you find by the way is that this whole concept of tying an accredited investor to net worth has its flaws just because somebody has several million dollars doesnt mean theyre a sophisticated investor meanwhile there could be somebody whos worth 10 000 who is very sophisticated its unfortunate that we have the whole system tied to that but what we see before us today are two important chinks in this armor one is consistent with the current concept of accredited investor but at least opens it up beyond their personal networks and the other one allows small investors to participate in a more meaningful way first the entrepreneur access to capital act crowdfunding what this means is it provides a new way that companies startup companies can raise a limited amount of money 1 million a year or 2 million if they have audited financial statements now thats a sizable amount for a company to get off the ground and get started many tech companies that you hear of today started with that much money or less historically how did they raise that money they would go to a venture capitalist they would go to a wealthy individual we call that person an angel investor theyd get a check for 500 000 the investors had to be worth more than a million dollars your average american might be worthmight only have 5 000 to invest or 1 000 to invest was unable to under law participate in that offering what this does is it opens up an avenue that allows the individual investor to invest up to 10 000 in a startup company now thats a risky investment they could lose that 5 000 they could lose that 2 000 but you know what they could go to las vegas and they could lose it a lot quicker with a lot less upside so this gives every american the opportunity to invest in startup companies if one of their friends is starting one if there is some concept they are excited about and reap the rewards as well in addition to feeling part of something special some of these investments the vast minority could return 50 1 100 1 and could help those people acquire wealth and thats very very exciting the access to capital for job creators act also deals with a flaw in how private equity is raised currently you have to know the right people to get into a private equity deal in fact a company thats offering private equity is not even allowed to under sec regulation post a prospectus and information on their web site in an open environment what this bill does is it creates a safe harbor that allows them not to advertise it in the sense of loudly promoting it and trying to sell shares but in a sense of simply providing it in a nonpasswordprotected way on their web site to allow people who arent part of their personal network of elite friends to participate in that private equity offering as well the average median household net worth in this country is about 100 000 and previously all of these investment opportunities have been reserved for people worth over a million dollars now if somebodys family an american family watching this or one of my constituents is worth 100 000 or 150 000 or 50 000 it may not make all the sense in the world to invest 5 000 or 10 000 in one startup but a cap of 10 000 is a reasonable amount its their money and their right to do that if thats what they want to do these bills are consistent with that and more importantly they provide a new financing mechanism for startups in this country that way a startup that has broad appeal and a broad network can go to 1 000 people that have 1 000 each rather than one wealthy investor for 1 million that was previously nearly impossible under current law i have here a statement of administration policy and im proud to say that this bill the entrepreneur access to capital act has strong support from the administration this bill will make it easier for entrepreneurs to raise capital and create jobs and the administration looks forward to continuing to work with congress to craft legislation that facilitates capital formation i would like to applaud the leadership of the president of the united states in strongly supporting these endeavors as a former small business owner i know how important it is to invest in a companys future and how critical resources are for growth the more avenues that we can provide for financing startup companies or allowing a momandpop company to expand the better it is for the growth of our economy more importantly these two pieces of legislation before us demonstrate that democrats and republicans can work together we can put aside our partisan differences we can fast track a commonsense piece of legislation and work towards solutions to spur economic growth now to be clear these two bills alone dont do enough to turn our economy around these measures do little to address what the american people are asking us for creating jobs in the short term and getting the economy moving will they have a positive impact in creating jobs and allowing for financing to flow to new startup operations yes but they are not fundamentally game changers these bills will allow average americans an opportunity to invest in earlystage companies now many of these opportunities wont work out american investors will lose their money other american investors will make money but again it is a very american concept that it is your money to invest as you choose and the best opportunities shouldnt be reserved for millionaires we should make them widely available to all americans democrats on the financial services committee have also been extremely instrumental in improving these bills to protect business and investors democrats have added a critical provision requiring that issuers verify that an investor is actually eligible to purchase the offer in securities and the change ensures theres a balance between the need to use restrictions on capital formation and protecting investors from fraud and making sure we dont get in the way of state regulation as well there is a fine line and there are as i mentioned some areas where sham investments are being aggressively promoted that are certainly contrary to the spirit if not the letter of the law likewise there are real opportunities that until this bill becomes law those who are worth under 1 million are ineligible from participating in and as a companion those who might be worth more than 1 million but dont know the right people are unable to participate in private equity offerings this bill remedies both of those restrictions and will help unleash capital flows to startup corporations im proud to support both bills"], [0.9917038409039378,

duty or have made the ultimate sacrifice military medals and declarations constitute a tribute as well as tangible manifestation of our nations deep and abiding recognition and appreciation to our servicemembers there are however those who falsely claim to be recipients of these special honors such malicious actions denigrate the integrity of those honors to those who have legitimately received them in response a law was enacted with the laudable purpose of ensuring the integrity of military honors by punishing those who make such false representations unfortunately the scope of the law was recently found by the supreme court to be unconstitutional as an abridgement of the first amendments right to free speech because the first amendment even protects despicable speech justice kennedy however writing for the court set out certain guidelines that congress could follow in remedying the statutes constitutional flaw he wrote where false claims are made to effect a fraud or secure moneys or other valuable considerations say offers of employment it is wellestablished that the government may restrict speech without affronting the first amendment so as reported by the judiciary committee this bill adheres to this suggested construct by amending the current law to prohibit individuals from fraudulently representing themselves as recipients of these honors in order to obtain money property or other tangible benefits this will actually cover most of the incidences of false claims as a result this measure will in full compliance with the constitution ensure that no one will financially benefit or receive other tangible rewards from falsely representing that they have been awarded these honors and this will cover all of the despicable cases of false claims that the
