committee chairman commended us and said he was incorporating most of our ideas it all sounded great but when the final curtain came down real cuts were small and the deficit grew and the public was

spending pennykasich is not draconian look at medicare we all agree wealthy retired seniors must pay more of their medicare premiums than seniors retired on 6 000 or 20 000 or even 69 000 even seniors support means testing on premiums most seniors have incomes higher than most singleparent households if we want to adjust the income levels closer to those recommended by president clinton we can do that in conference but this is not draconian and lets look at the other medicare cutsall proposed by the president if you dont like them we can give seniors the chance to join managed care programs

must be turning over in his grave one hundred and thirtytwo years ago today he signed into law the nations first income taxdesigned as a temporary emergency measure to finance the civil war today president clinton is raising taxes to finance his version of a class war of course the administration is not without admirers one master of illusion the great houdini must be smiling down on this chamber today when we blow away the smoke and shatter the mirrors what we get from president clintons taxandspend road show is nowhere near what he claims not the 496 billion in deficit reduction not if we use the cbo numbers because cbo based on their estimates would score it at best at 428 billion in deficit reduction even that figure is generous because of the presidents illusory claims of slower spending growth 4 or 5 years from now and then that figure is generous because of the presidents illusory claims of lower spending in the fourth and fifth years this is the president who said we have all got to use congressional budget office estimates they are the real estimates and we have got to reject accounting gimmicks then he ignored cbos baselines and had his bookkeepers invent their own and counted savings from the 1990 budget agreement twice in order to puff up his deficit reduction numbers and i do not know if that is smoke and mirrors or what but if an accountant on main street did it he probably would go to jail that fact is this package includes about 120 billion in promises of net spending reductions almost all in the third fourth and fifth year 255 billion dollars worth of real net new taxes and user fees and about 53 billion in questionable debt service claims that is what you get when you lay this package against cbos estimates instead of the ones the administration cooked up there will be no net spending cuts in the first year zero and virtually none in the second year this package includes deficit increasing items totaling 62 billion over 5 years this new spending probably seems odd to the american people in a socalled deficit reduction package it is one of the reasons why they are nervous about this bill the largest tax increase in our nations history yes the largest by cbo estimates new taxes in this bill are 275 billion the democrats dispute this and they talk about the 1982 tax act but the cbo scored the 1982 tax act as raising 3214 billion in new taxes instinctively americans know these new tax increases are jobkilling poison for the economy they do not believe for one minute that the democrats tax increases are going to create jobs nor do most of the economists in this country the president claims the vast majority of these taxes will hurt only the rich and that is baloney he must not have read his own bill the socalled rich who are targets for massive retroactive tax increases are the small business men and women who create the vast majority of new jobs heaping higher taxes on those jobs creators translates into fewer jobs for working people perhaps we should remember the socalled luxury tax from the 1990 budget deal it is repealed in this bill because that misguided class warfare scheme backfired and killed the boatbuilding industry try to sock the rich and you drown working men and women simplistic attempts to minimize the impact of the energy tax on american families will not hold water either when the democrats tax transportation they are not just taxing people who pull up to the gas pump they are taxing everything that has to be transported senior citizens are among the hardest hit in this package thanks in particular to increased taxes on their benefits it must make them feel real special to learn that president clintons definition of rich people includes seniors with incomes of just 34 000 and that includes half of their social security benefits now that sounds pretty callous especially since seniors on fixed incomes are the one group of americans for whom lower interest rates serve as a financial curse rather than a blessing yes president clinton would like the american people to believe his own taxes only hurt rich people but with over 40 tax increases and 16 user fees in this package no one should seriously buy that story here is what the taxpayers do understand when he was courting their vote clinton promised the middle class a tax cut now he is raising their taxes he promised to create jobs now he is promising tax increases on employers that will kill jobs he promised 500 billion in deficit reduction he is at least 73 billion short of that at best all of

federal budget deficit the president and the democrats raise new taxes without eliminating a single federal program in the first few years of the plan the plan includes a 71billion energytax and 32 billion in taxes on senior citizens according to several studies the energy tax will cost the unitedstates economy almost 600 000 jobs by 1998 and it will lower economic growth by 35 to 50 billion the energy tax will raise the cost of practically every good and service that americans produce resulting in higher prices for consumers and making american workers and companies less competitive in the world market the average american family of four will pay an additional 500 per year in energy costs as a result of the energy tax according to a study by the american petroleum institute this is in addition to the 2 150 that the average household already pays each year in energy costs a study by the affordable energy alliance shows that a large number of the states highpaying industries mining manufacturing construction and agricultureuse a lot of energy and will be the ones hardest hit by the tax if the clinton tax had been in effect in 1990 north carolina residents and industries would have paid 714 8 million in additional energy taxes the alliance notes that a tax burden this large will slow the economy of the state cost jobs and make goods and services produced in north carolina less competitive in world markets consider for example the case of a company in my district called the timken co the timken co is a leading international manufacturer of highly engineered bearings and alloy steels if the proposed energy tax becomes effective the direct cost impact on the company resulting from higher energy needs will be 5 6 million to put that in perspective the companys net income from worldwide operations amounted to only 4 5 milion in 1992 the energy tax will cost manufacturing jobs and diminish the ability of energyintensive industries like the timken co to compete in the international market clintons plan will also raise taxes on social security recipients under current law older americans with a modest income 25 000 for singles and 32 000 for couples pay income taxes on up to 50 percent of their social security benefits but under the clinton proposal seniors will pay taxes on up to 85 percent of their benefits this increase will raise 32 billion over 5 years a study by a senior advocacy group shows that the average senior citizen will pay 483 a year in new taxes finally the presidents plan will have a devastating effect on small businesses according to information from the national federation of independent business 80 percent of businesses in america pay taxes as individuals not as corporate entities the tax code also taxes the profits of a

revolution a china or any nation that is engaged in the world community could not hide 80 million deaths repression and mass slaughter are only possible when a nation isolates itself from the world sunshine is the best disinfectant for repressive government and that is what trade brings it is a new world out there the iron curtain is drawn open international companies are chipping away at the iron rice bowl we must engage these societies drawing them out even more into the world community but let us not kid ourselves nations like russia and china are still in transition there is every possibility that they could return to the ways of the recent past and the chinese people for one live in fear of this the washington post story quoted a farmer who said who knows what could happen if there is a change of policy at the top who knows our side in this debate rejects any policy that seeks to isolate nations frdm the world community trade shines the bright light of the free market into closed societies market economies as we have shown lead to human rights improvements in this debate we have answered the question what does trade bring let me summarize again trade brings a better standard of living so children do not have to go to bed hungry at night so families have a roof over their heads and it also brings about the exchange of ideas whether principles of law and a judicial system or the exchange of students and scientists music books and movies and as innocuous as that sounds art is saturated with cultural messages and floods over a closed society in a wash of western values and individual freedoms vaclav havel once said communism was not defeated by military force but by life by human spirit by conscience by the resistance of being and man to manipulation havel is right we all have a duty even a moral obligation to pursue the path of trade diplomatic engagement produce healthier more just societies on earth"], [0.9938017157837749, 0.006198284216225147, 1,

back last year that we age administrative and managerial syswould see those same kinds of job tems to facilitate the adoption of comlosses and we would see utter destruc munity oriented policing as an organition of the economy coming about as a zationwide philosophy result of the passage of that economic this means that a program which was designed to reduce federal bureaucrat can tell local police

the budget deficit is down now sub thattnstead of apprehending criminals stantially below even where we ex it should be preventing crimes from pected it to be as a result of the pas taking place granted both are necsage of that program no job losses as essary but why should the federal a matter of fact there have been more government be involved in telling the jobs created across the country in the police force what it needs to do last 18 months than were created in the second the bill sets up a quota sysprevious 4 years tern for hiring police section so the same kind of scare tactics

the american pdople ayea r ago the extent practtcable seek recruit when we fortunately had the ability and hire members of racial and ethnic h8692 co minority groups and women in order to increase their ranks within the sworn positions in the law enforcement agency that quota section speaks for itself third the clinton crime bill provides only seed money for a community that wants to hire police officers here is the irony for a community to get a grant to hire police officers it must show a specific financial need the grant runs out in equal stages over 5 years however a community must also show that as a grant runs out in steps the community must be able to afford to keep the cops permanently this does not make sense a community applies for a grant because it needs the money but must show that as the money runs out it has the financial ability to continue the program if a community has the money in the first place then it could not receive the grant yet it has to show it has the money in order to continue the program fourth the actual amount of money allocated in the crime bill for cops will hire 20 000 at most not 100 000 cops the reason is in the application the clinton administration itself estimates it will cost 75 000 per year to hire one cop so if you stretch out the money allocated for the program over 5 years it comes out to 14 500 per cop that is why we have police officers all the way from down in florida from a city that employs 17 police officers to say that we are in a tight budget now so why should we hire more policemen on this program when the money will be whittled away in a short period of time essentially leaving us with an unfunded mandate these are the words of terry chapman acting police chief of the brooksville fl police department and paul logli the states attorney for winnebago county il which i represent the county that leads the state in crime and he is saying we have all these programs and yet the money that is held out is just seed money and after a few short years it is reduced on a periodic basis still leaving the city and the municipalities involved with the prospect of raising all this money essentially an unfunded mandate to keep the programs going who runs community policing do local law enforcement agencies or social agencies we have probably never heard this argument before the application and the proposed statutory language show how little emphasis is placed on the crime rate in a community here are some of the 11 mandatory requirements to get a grant the police department has to have a longterm strategy that is devised not by the police but by community groups and appropriate private and public agencies what does that mean those words are not defined it means the federal government is saying

may consume i really find it very surprising that my amendment is controversial i think it is selfexplanatory it would require that counselors in title x clinics who are providing information on what h r 670 terms pregnancy management options that is prenatal care adoption and abortion among others have a professional degree in medicine nursing clinical psychology the allied health professions or social work my reason for offering this is quite simple if part of the purpose of the title x program is to provide quality care and advice to pregnant women then i believe it is only reasonable to require that the advice be given by a qualified professional during all the debate on the socalled gag rule and this title x policy over the years we have heard from the proponents of the title x program that counseling is being done by professionals and that the bush administration and those of us that oppose the process are gagging professional medical service providers and professional counselors therefore i feel it is extremely important to emphasize that professionalism so that women particularly underaged women that find themselves pregnant and come to a family planning clinic for advice be protected from receiving uninformed or inexperienced advice it bothers me when i read from a planned parenthood preliminary report on the counseling function in their affiliates throughout the nation that and i quote data from the nearly 500 individual counselor profiles give a clear picture of a counseling staff which is largely young and inexperienced much of it working unpaid and probably using ppfa employment for training experience and preparation for other jobs in the future counselors formal training is relatively modest a lawsuit involving the planned parenthood association of san mateo county in california further illustrates my point in this case a planned parenthood employee with the job title reproductive health specialist stated in a deposition that she had had no prior experience or education in medical care nor had she even had a biology course before being hired for that position rather the prior job experience of this socalled reproductive health specialist was as an architectural drafter for various corporations she was given 2 months onthejob training by the center manager who also had no prior medical training this reproductive health specialist was responsible not only for performing medical exams on clients she was also charged with providing information on human reproduction and counseling pregnant women on their reproductive choices there is something very wrong with this situationif i were a woman who expected to receive professional care and advice when going to a federally funded clinic i would find this very upsetting even as recently as last month i noticed a help wanted ad in the washington post in which a northern virginia planned parenthood clinic was advertising for a fulltime educatorcounselor the ad reads as follows the clinic provides family planning hiv pregnancy options counseling and medical services college education desirable bicultural and bilingual spanish drivers 11cense car isnt it sad and even frightening that for this pregnancy counseling position one must have a drivers license but not a college degree while i cannot comment as to the professionalism of this particular clinic or whether it receives title x funds this ad serves as an obvious example of what my amendment attempts to correct i do not think it is right for the federal govermnent to fund clinics that hire individuals without even a college degree to counsel pregnant women on one of the most important decisions they are going to make in their lives it is my understanding after speaking with officials from the unitedstates department of health and human services that state law does not address the issue of educational standards for counselors in a meaningful way if at all rather private organizations attempt to establish such standards for their own members for example the council on accreditation of services for families and children which is sponsored by the child welfare league of america the national association of homes and services for children and the lutheran social ministry system among others requires its agencies personnel who provide counseling to an expectant parent on the decision to parent the child to transfer custody of the child or to terminate the pregnancy to have a masters degree from an accredited program of social work education or have a bachelors or masters degree in an allied field and are supervised by a person with a masters degree in social work e3 1610 furthermore in a november 1991 letter signed by 21 organizations including the american medical association the american college of physicians and the national association of community health centers the words health care professionals appear seven times on one page in reference to those who would be affected by the counseling restrictions known as the gag rule it is obvious that much of the health care community recognizes the need to require counselors to be qualifled why is it then that situations such as the ones i described earlier continue to exist it is vital that we address this problem now i am not asserting that all family planning clinics receiving title x funds are employing inexperienced counselors however even if only a few clinics are doing so then we are not taking womens health care seriously enough i believe requiring pregnancy counselors to have a professional degree can only enhance the title x program i urge a yes vote on this amendment and a no vote on the waxman seconddegree amendment"], [0.0008502304553985596,
