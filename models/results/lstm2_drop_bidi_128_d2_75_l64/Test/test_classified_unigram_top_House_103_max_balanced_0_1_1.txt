illegal aliens are residing in this country today but the number is estimated to be at least 5 million this number is increasing daily and according to one study the cost of supporting these illegal

was small as it grew so did our anxiety and rhetoric but we have not been willing to match our words with action in 1985 i was one of a small group that developed an alternative budget we cut defense s25 billion we cut discretionary programs line by line 525 billion for a total of 50 billion in cuts and a balanced budget in a few short years everyone saidimpressive honest courageous the thenbudget committee chairman commended us and said he was incorporating most of our ideas it all sounded great but when the final curtain came down real cuts were small and the deficit grew and the public was led to believe we had been tough and so it has gone year after year the deficit goes up and we go home and say how tough we have been today is dday this is our last real chance to save our kids to actually address the deficit that so endangers the economic strength of our country and the personal security of our people we raised taxes a couple of months ago by over 300 billion now we must cut spending pennykasich is not draconian look at medicare we all agree wealthy retired seniors must pay more of their medicare premiums than seniors retired on 6 000 or 20 000 or even 69 000 even seniors support means testing on premiums most seniors have incomes higher than most singleparent households if we want to adjust the income levels closer to those recommended by president clinton we can do that in conference but this is not draconian and lets look at the other medicare cutsall proposed by the president if you dont like them we can give seniors the chance to join managed care programs just as 15 states are now allowed under an hcfa demonstration program we could even amend medicare law to allow it to fund preventive service to reduce costs though so far that has been too radical for this body no the 1percent pennykasich cut is not draconian then why the ruckus listen up americalisten up the ruckus is because the pennykasich cuts are real the onecentineverydollar cuts are backed by budget caps and are enforceable thats the big difference between the sabo and kasich budgets thats why the threatening letters and the arm twisting the game is over yes pennykasich is real its good for your kids because it will slow deficit growth and every american now being whipped up to believe theyll be hurt will end up being better served by a congress truly focused on fiscally responsible spending and taxing policy we have no right to do health care reform until we have done our duty to bring current spending more in line with current revenues i urge your support of

raise taxes i want to emphasize theopoint that before we raise taxes we need to examine carefully every aspect of government as my colleagues know this is a city washington where the objective need to raise taxes is almost overwhelning and every time we turn around somebody has a new reason why we need to raise taxes and they always talk in sort of casual terms we need 10 billion here 15 billion there a littie consumer tax wouldnt hurt anybody 20 billi6n 30 billion there i want to suggest that we are all forgetting because of the nature of government language that this is about real money involving real families and that it is a question to go back to president clintons inaugural address of who sacrifices first and it is fine to talk about sacrifice but somehow it always turns out to be the working american the taxpaying american the retired american who sacrifices and the government bureaucracy and the government employee unions and the trial lawyers who do better and better i would suggest that this is a real test of the family budget versus the government budget and which one is more important to those of us who have been elected now we talk about a billion dollars that dulls the senses because the truth is no family budget in america is at the billiondollar level even billionaires are only down in the 50 or 100 million a year level and for normal americans 100 is a lot of money a 1 000 is an enormous amount of money as my colleagues know at 1 000 we are talking about helping our child go through college at 1 000 we are saving up for a down payment on a house or a car at 1 000 we are talking about a lot of money for most americans and at 1 million we are talking about a thousand families talking about 1 000 and when we get to 1 billion we are talking about a million families with 1 000 each so it is very important to get these discussions down to real amounts for most people 5 is real 50 is real 100 is real but 1 billion is just government and so we sort of get numb it is almost like an anesthetic when we start talking about billions of dollars we sort of forget what is really involved the decisions we will make this spring on who sacrifices on whether we decide to change the government or to change the family budget on whether the real choices need to be made back home by working americans in their homes and their businesses or whether the real changes need to be made in washington by the bureaucracies and the welfare state these go to the core of where we are at i believe there are three very large very tough questions that need to be answered before we raise taxes we need to ask first are we using the money we already have wisely enough to morally justify asking our american families for more money we need to ask second even if the system is efficient are we in fact doing what the american people want us to do with their money and third we have to ask if we want to cut the deficit is raising taxes the right answer or will a tax increase so weaken the economy that it will kill jobs cripple revenues and increase the deficit all three of these questions i think need to be answered before we raise taxes now let me start with the question are we using the money we already have wisely enough to morally justify asking other americans to take money out of their families i just want to suggest that anybody who comes to washington and watches the federal bureaucracy for a couple of days will understand that we do not have the moral right to ask american families to tighten their belts to send the money to washington anybody who has watched the frugality of a small business that carefully monitors everything it is doing in order to stay in business or who watches the family that carefully saves pennies and decides whether or not they can afford to go to a movie and whether it has to be the twilight movie that is 3 50 rather than the evening movie at 7 understands that for most americans in tight times there are real decisions about saving even a few dollars and when you come to washington or any aspect of the federal government you can see that we are nowhere near the kind of frugality we need i recently last monday did a speech entitled renewing american civilization i talked about applying five pillars of freedom quality technological advance entrepreneurial free enterprise the principles of american civilization and psychological strength let me say that three of those quality as defined by edward demming the concept of profound knowledge technological advance using technology to do things better faster for less and entrepreneurial free enterprise using the basic principles of the free enterprise system those three pillars could dramatically lower the cost of the federal government imagine for example if president clinton were to invite 5 or 6 or 8 or 10 of the top corporate downsizers to the white house people who had downsized ford downsized ibm downsized xerox people who are in the process of downsizing sears roebuck and said to them if the key is to save money in bureaucracy and if modern computers and modern information systems allow us to save money in bureaucracy what have you learned by doing it to a bureaucracy of a hundred thousand that i can now apply to a bureaucracy of 2 million what would the department of agriculture or the department of labor look like or the department of health and human services look like if we applied the same downsizing principles for that matter what will the pentagon look like if we require it to go through the same quality transformation that say the ford motor co or xerox has gone through what we know is we would have a lot fewer bureaucrats and a lot fewer offices shuffling a lot fewer papers what we know is we would be dramatically less expensive and we would be in a position to talk seriously about how much less the federal government would cost let me also suggest that when you look at what we are subsidizing in waste waste in education in places like the new york city school bureaucracy or the washington dc school bureaucracy waste in the unionized work rules of philadelphia and detroit and new york the kind of institutionalized waste of money it makes no sense there was one report last year that in philadelphia the union work rules literally required three people at the philadelphia airport to change a ltghtbulb because one person had to come and take the various lighting fixtures off a second person had to come to change the bulb and a third person had to come to sweep around the area after the first person put the light fixtures back on now we cannot afford that kind of waste in government i recently talked here about the problem of the new york city custodians who are given a brandnew jeep every 5 years by the school board and if they do not use the jeep at the end of 5 years they get to take it home as a personal vehicle and then they get a new jeep so all the alternatives in the new york city system are for nonuse of the jeep so it can become a personal vehicle with minimum miles on it and minimum waste and there was the recent custodian for the public schools in new york city who was indicted because he was sitting on his yacht when he was collecting money for supposedly cleaning up the school my point is that there is a tremendous amount of reform in local state and federal government that is needed before we raise a penny in taxes let me go a step further and suggest that precisely what made americas biggest corporations inefficient and ultimately economically insecure was their unwillingness to go through dramatic change general motors would be a healthier company today if over the last 10 or 15 years it had gone through change and sears and roebuck would be a more competitive company today if over the last 10 to 15 years it had gone through dramatic change now we see the private market forcing change at that level we see what is happening to these corporations in order to stay alive they have got to become leaner more competitive and more customer oriented yet what do we hear from the government not any talk about dramatic bold change not any talk about dramatic management reforms not any talk about downsizing the bureaucracy instead what the government says is that we really cannot change anything except in your pocketbook we cannot threaten any of the public employee unions we cannot talk about changing any of the bureaucracies we cannot think about changing the civil service laws or the personnel laws or the procurement laws all we can think about is getting more money out of working americans but before we raise taxes i think we owe it to the american people to apply the same management toughness to government that we are seeing applied throughout the private sector there is a second question we need to ask before we raise taxes even if the system is efficient and i do not believe it is or even if we went through that process of making it efficient are we in fact doing what the american people want us to do there is a very simple test of this which congressman bob walker of pennsylvania has put in the record it is a bill that would allow all taxpayers to set 10 percent of their tax aside to go directly to the debt they could set aside anything from 0 up to 10 percent let us say you paid 3 000 in federal taxes under the walker proposal you could designate anything from 0 up to 300 to go to the federal debt and the congress would receive an instruction to lower federal spending by the same number of dollars the congressional budget office suggested that congressman walkers bill would probably balance the budget within 5 years based on public opinion polls of how many people would be using the 10 percent deficitcutting mechanism but notice what it says it says that you do not have to pay for any more government that you think is wasteful or that you think is not useful it says that you could make decisions to force the congress to cut the size of the aggregate federal government i think that is a very useful idea and a better idea than raising taxes so one of the things we ought to look at is before we get around to tax increases before we raise taxes passing congressman walkers 10percent deficit setaside to allow the american people to vote by their pocketbooks on how much of their taxes up to 10 percent could go to reducing the deficit and forcing the government to set priorities let me carry it a step further what if we were to set priorities what if we were to say to the american people here are the 30 least important bureaucracies in washington could we close them down what if we were to say here are the 20 least important programs not that they are not good programs if you have a milliondollarayear income it is amazing what you can do that you would not do if you have a 20 000ayear income you do not need as many priorities and you would not have to make nearly as many tough decisions at a million dollars a year what we have in washington is a congress and a government which has an openended idea about how much they want to spend but has a fairly limited actual amount of revenue coming in and the deficit is the gap between our unwillingness to set priorities and the size of the real revenue if we were to actually test the system here is what we would find out eightyone percent of the american people want us to replace welfare with workfare it is an astonishing number eightyone percent of the people agree that we need to require people to work if they get money that by the way would dramaticallyohange the cost of welfare yet we are hearing talk that we ought to raise taxes on working americans to subsidize the welfare system and take care of people who are not working that is something 81 percent of the people object to seventyfive percent of the american people believe we ought to have malpractice reform and tort reform so we would have fewer lawsuits and fewer gigantic settlements and so we would have less litigation that would save more than 5 billion and the estimates go on up to 30 billion or 40 billion a year it would save money oa defensive medicine it would save money in lawsuit costs it would save money in court costs and it would save money across the board in terms of not having to pay professionals to do extra things just to be prepared to defend ourselves we ought to pass malpractice and tort reform before we talk about raising taxes then we come to an area where people do not want change and yet it is one of the areas that the democratic administration is talking about changing i am fascinated by this this is a wire story which was brought to my attention just a few minutes ago it talks about president clintons economic aides and i want to share this with my colleagues this is an associated press story in the first word of what clintons longdiscussed proposal will look like clintons aides said the presidents package would consist of 16 billion in immediate spending increases for fiscal 1993 which runs through sept 30 in addition the package will contain 15 billion worth of investment tax credits a tax break given businesses that invest in equipment there is no word in that story about any offsets this is a 31 billion increase in the deficit we remember that ross perot ran promising to cut the deficit and bill clinton ran promising to cut the deficit he was going to cut the deficit in half in his first 4 years the first proposal we are now hearing is a 31 billion increase in the deficit if my memory serves me that is around a 9percent increase on the current total deficit projection so we are going to actually increase the deficit on the way to decreasing the deficit does that not sound like something we have all lived through before where the politicians promise anything to get elected and then rapidly begin to figure how they are not going to do any of the things they promised we notice also that the new term in washington is investment investment has replaced pork barrel it is a good washington word and people who love big government and love the welfare state believe if they run around chanting investment long enough people will not notice that investment is just a new word for spending the article goes on to say thisand i am quoting from the associated press story that came over the wire a few minutes agothe administration officials spoke of a raft of upperincome taxes that arwe under consideration the official said in addition panetta spoke of the need for a shared burden in deficit reduction the off icial said although he did not specify what he meant the former house budget committee chairman has been an advocate of finding savings in the social security program panetta has been a supporter of one proposal under consideration the elimination of next years costofliving increase for the nations 41 million social security recipients the article goes on to say this also under consideration is a plan cc tncrease the amount of taxes social security recipients would have to pay on their benefits many senate democrats prefer that alternative since only the v4 bestoff retirees pay any taxes at all now notice this what are they talking about here when they talk about the concept of shared burden in deficit reduction now this is the democratic office of management and budget the director of the budget shared burden does not mean cutting the size of government notice this is an article saying they are going to increase the size of government by 16 billion so the bureaucracy the politicians the pork barrel recipients they are not going to suffer any shared burden shared burden according to this article is going to mean people on social security paying more taxes or alternatively people on social security having to give up part of their costofliving increase or even the elimination according to this consideration of the elimination of rext years costofliving increase now let me point out the one government program people actually seem to like is social security it is the one program where grandchildren seem to think it is reasonable to pay to help their grandparents grandparents are grateful they are getting money parents are glad that they are in a situation to help their own parents who are now retired and there is a social contract which is very deeply held this is the one program also by the way which has a very tiny bureaucracy we send out more social security checks with fewer civil servants than almost any other program in the government so which program do our friends in the democratic administration want to hit social security notice also to receive social security you actually were working you were actually putting money away you were actually paying the social security tax so once again who is going to get it in the wallet it is the working american in this case it is the retired version of working americans meanwhile is government going to get smaller no according to this article the very first step that the clinton administration wants to take is to increase the size of government by 316 billion exactly the wrong step here wehave not even the usual fig leaf let us vote for a tax increase and we will have smaller government because we will cut spending by the way that fig leaf is never kept the average over the last 20 years is that for every dollar of tax increase there is a 1 58 increase in spending but that is not the key here the key here is that you have an administration which is saying let us raise spending and raise taxes now what does that mean that means less money for retirees it wreans less money in social security it means less money in the private sector it means less money for families but it means a lot more money for bureaucrats a lot more money for politicians to give away as pork barrel and a lot more money for the public employee unions to be able to organize people now i think that it is very important for the american people to understand up front exactly what is at stake here this is the first shot in what is going to be a 4year process of the democrats attempting to raise taxes on working americans and retired americans to transfer the money to politicians and bureaucrats to have a larger welfare state and a bigger welfare system it is explicitly wrong and as long as the welfare state keeps growing i think we have an absolute obligation to fight any tax increase so before we raise taxes let us overhaul the entire welfare state let me go to the third question even if we were doing the right things and we were doing them efficiently would we want to cut the deficit by raising taxes or will tax increases so weaken the economy that in fact a recession will come on jobs will be killed revenues will go down and the deficit instead of decreasing will increase now notice everywhere around the world we are telling people who are trying to make a transition from big centralized governments that they ought to decentralize we are telling boris yeltsin in russia we are telling menem in argentina salinas in mexico privatize parts of your government shrink your bureaucracy go back to the free market go back to private property and yet here in washington we have all too many people in the democratic administration who are talking about bigger government bigger bureaucracy mora programs and higher taxes i believe that that will in fact kill the current recovery and put us back in a recession it might take 1 or 2 years but it will happen it will happen first because as they increase the size of government you are going to see interest rates go back up and you are going to see the inflation rate go back up i am now prepared to predict having watched for a couple of weeks we are now very very close to the low point for both inflation and interest rates we are at a 20year low it has taken us 12 years to recover from carters inflation it took a tremendous amount of pain both in the recession of 198182 and in the recession of 199091 but finally we are at the lowest interest rates for home mortgages the lowest longterm unitedstates bond rates and the lowest inflation rate we have seen in 20 years the result we now have liberal democrats promptly promising bigger spending bigger government higher taxes which will lead to more inflation and higher interest rates and i will be very prepared a year from now or 2 years from now to come back here to the house floor and defend that projection and look at what inflation and interest rates look like at that point i feel some confidence in talking about the economy because on august 22 1990 1 spoke at the heritage foundation on a speech entitled the was ington establishment versus the american people a report from the budget i want to take page 9 of that particular speech and share with people what i said in 1990 because i think we are right back in the same situation economic dangers i believe that we have to then take this analysts and look at a very real danger which can cause all of us enormous pain and that is a recession the world that existed at the beginning of the budget summit is over i went on to talk about the seizure of kuwait and what is happening in iraq we have the fact absolute fact in my judgment that the economy is clearly weaker today than it was a year ago and i want to make a point that is not made often enough in this city a recession is the worst enemy of a balanced budget if we have a recession and we have millions of americans put out of work the net effect of not paying taxes because you dont have a job and increasing unemployment and welfare because you need it will be to dramatically widen the budget deficit but there is a second hidden whammy now and that is the cost of the savings and loan bailout the government is now the largest seller of property in america therefore it has a greater interest than any other person or group in keeping property values up because if property values crash the cost of liquidating the properties goes up astronomically avoiding a recession now given those two objective realities and combining with them a caring humanitarian view that argues that a job is the best welfare program the number one goal on september 5th when the congress returns should be to adopt a proposal which will avoid a recession and for the life of me i cannot see how any member of congress or any member of the government could argue for anything else in terms of domestic policy we must be strong in the middle east and we must be strong in the american economy i believe we should have a tax cut package because we know what doesnt work and we know what does work in the 1970s we tried raising taxes going into a recessionthis was the famous hoovercarter policy and it didnt work in the early thirties didnt work in the seventies turns out when you raise taxes going into a recession you get a depression if youre unlucky and you get a very deep recession if youre lucky we also tried a different technique in the eighties called lowering taxes lowering taxes seemed to have a better effect than raising taxes now i am not an economist or a political scientist so i dont have any kind of linear projection here but as a historian i am willing to suggest that we would rather be like the eighties than the seventies now this is in washington by the way a very radical statement im serious large parts of washington want to raise tayes precisely to repudiate the eighties this is an act of purification and liberal democrats want to be able to go home and say you see we have finally done away with all the wicked things that ronald reagan did and now youll be safe and theyll say this to very long unemployment lines let me make the point that i said this on august 22 1990 and we were discussing at that time a situation in which we were in a budget summit and all the establishment figures of washington were saying raise taxes raise taxes as we all know president bush tragically gave in we raised taxes and what was the result it was exactly what i said in august 1090 recession was deeper the unemployment was longer the deficit grew bigger government revenues declined fewer people were at work they paid fewer taxes the result was the government had less money and the net result was a bigger debt and a worse economic situation sadly the final result was the defeat of president bush who finally looked back in august 1992 and said in houston at the republican convention that in fact it had been a great mistake to raise taxes in 1990 well let me just suggest to you that this is still a great mistake this economy is much weaker than its macro numbers when you see general motors talking about laying off thousands of people when you see sears talking about laying off thousands of people when you see ibm talking about laying off thousands of people when you see additional burdens being put on small business the fact is objectively we are a very fragile economy the german economy is in trouble the japanese economy is in trouble if we have one or two unexpected shocks we are going to go back into a recession now we have a very painful very hard bought gradual slow recovery under way and any effort to increase the deficit with bigger government spending is going to raise interest rates and that is going to weaken the economy and any effort to raise taxes is going to weaken the private sector and that is going to weaken the economy and the result is going to be more people out of work yet the fact is that in washington those obvious common sense historic lessons do not seem to get through to people i made that point on page 12 in the 1990 heritage speech when i said washington against america and we need to look at this city as a city which is almost totally out of touch with the american people today a city which has rejected every presidential election since 1968 in both parties they rejected the republicans and they rejected jimmy carter and then they rejcted more republicans this is a city which is proud that it has withstood all the screams of the american people for lower taxes less government and a replacement for the welfare state i think i could say that paragraph today and include bill clinton as well as jimmy carter what did we have last fall we had a presidential campaign in which a thirdparty candidate one of the most powerful of the 20th century campaigned against the deficit said we had to cut spending in washington we had to cut the deficit and what do we see we see the very first clinton socalled stimilus package giving the politicians and the bureaucrats 16 billion in bigger deficit because they are going to spend 16 billion more in washington we have as i said in 1990 a rejection of lower taxes by the washington power structure which wants higher taxes a rejection of lees government by the washington power structure which wants more government and a rejection of the concept of replacing the welfare state where workfare is supported by 81 percent of the american people by liberal democrats who in fact favor the welfare state now in that framework let me suggest that there is a book which has been a best seller which is worth looking at by folks by harry figgle jr with gerald swanson called bankruptcy 1995 the coming collapse of america and how to stop it this is a very powerful book which talks about deficits it is a book which talks about the need to cut spending and the need to cut the deficit i want to share with you a couple of key points that mr figgle and dr swanson make in their book this is a current best seller he talks about the budget reconciliation act of 1990 this lethe act which was passed against my opposition after the speech i made at heritage in august it was a deal made in october by the power structure of the city of washington to prop up the welfare state by raising taxes on the american people this from pages 59 to 61 is what mr figgie says"],

budget deficit the president and the democrats raise new taxes without eliminating a single federal program in the first few years of the plan the plan includes a 71billion energytax and 32 billion in taxes on senior citizens according to several studies the energy tax will cost the unitedstates economy almost 600 000 jobs by 1998 and it will lower economic growth by 35 to 50 billion the energy tax will raise the cost of practically every good and service that americans produce resulting in higher prices for consumers and making american workers and companies less competitive in the world market the average american family of four will pay an additional 500 per year in energy costs as a result of the energy tax according to a study by the american petroleum institute this is in addition to the 2 150 that the average household already pays each year in energy costs a study by the affordable energy alliance shows that a large number of the states highpaying industries mining manufacturing

million in additional energy taxes the alliance notes that a tax burden this large will slow the economy of the state cost jobs and make goods and services produced in north carolina less competitive in world markets consider for example the case of a company in my district called the timken co the timken co is a leading international manufacturer of highly engineered bearings and alloy steels if the proposed energy tax becomes effective the direct cost impact on the company resulting from higher energy needs will be 5 6 million to put that in perspective the companys net income from worldwide operations amounted to only 4 5 milion in 1992 the energy tax will cost manufacturing jobs and diminish the ability of energyintensive industries like the timken co to compete in the international market clintons plan will also raise taxes on social security recipients under current law older americans with a modest income 25 000 for singles and 32 000 for couples pay income taxes on up to 50 percent of their social security benefits but under the clinton proposal seniors will pay taxes on up to 85 percent of their benefits this increase will raise 32 billion over 5 years a study by a senior advocacy group shows that the average senior citizen will pay 483 a year in new taxes finally the presidents plan will have a devastating effect on small businesses according to information from the national federation of independent business 80 percent of businesses in america pay taxes as individuals not as corporate entities the tax code also taxes the profits of a business not what the owner takes home this means that business owners are taxed on the money they reinvest back into their business as a result the clinton tax plan will increase taxes for individuals increase the tax

assure me that if i ever went into politics there was no good way out of it you either retired to do something else he said in which case no one remembers your name about 6 monthslater or you get

already adheres to the civil rights act the fair labor standards act the americans with disabilities act and the family and medical leave act among others congress is not your typical workplace it is a unique political institution however it is not above the law and this legislation should clarify this point once and for all the bill achieves the necessary balance between maintaining the

frequently over the last few months has been the question why do we need health care reform there has certainly been those in this house who have said we do not need health care reform that everything is just fine that if one has health care insurance now do not worry they are taken care of there is nothing to worry about i want to take this time to talk to the members about an issue that affects me very much personally because i know the people involved this is not some theoretical story this is an actual human beings story who have what is called good health insurance many times people say are you in the congress going to give us the same kind of health care that you have i would suggest to people who say that that they want better than we have in the unitedstates congress all the members of the unitedstates congress belong to the federal employees health benefit program all other federal employees are in that same program i want to talk about what that program really does and how it affects individuals many times as people talk about the whole area of health insurance they say that the problem is the patients the patients they are using the system too much it is costing too much because the patients are the ones at fault in the health care system the theory then is that we ought to have managed care we ought to force everybody into managed care and give people a bunch of booklets to look through so that they can shop smart like buying health insurance was like buying a new automobile or was like buying a new refrigerator if you are going to buy a new refrigerator you know exactly the size of your kitchen you know the space it is going to go you know whether you want a deicer or what kind of attachments you might want on it if you are buying an automobile you know whether you are going to be driving long distances or short distances or over rough terrain or what kind of use you will put that vehicle to the problem with health care for all americans is none of us know what we will need tomorrow we hope that we will never have to use our health insurance there is not anybody out there sort of slathering after using their health insurance people have health insurance policies hopeful that when the time comes and a problem comes to them that health insurance will cover them for the things that they need i was a physician in the state department living in zaire a long time ago in 1987 and as a member of the state department i got to know the director of medical affairs of the unitedstates department of state he has allowed me to use his name and i am going to tell his story and his wifes story because i think it is instructive about what all americans face no matter who you are or in what level you are why we need health reform in this country dr goff is an oncologist that is somebody whose primary specialty is in the treatment of cancer so if there is anybody in this society who ought to know how to buy a smart insurance policy related to cancer it should be dr goff but here is what happened to the goff family mrs goff who is 53 years old got cancer of the uterus and she had the diagnosis made at a fairly late stage she has had now two operations and several sets of chemotherapy and they recently did what they call an operation to look back and see if the cancer has cleared up there is a reoccurrence and the recommendation made by the hutchinson cancer center in seattle and the doctors in bellingham wa where she lives is she ought to have high dose chemotherapy plus a bone marrow transplant to support that high dose chemotherapy they went to their federal employees health benefit plan and they looked in it and they said well it says it covers bone marrow transplants we will go and get the assurance of the federal plan that we are covered by now the federal plan is administered by blue cross of washington dc here in the city of washington in the capital city even though they live out in washington state their insurance plan is administered by blue cross of washington dc blue cross of washington dc said our plan does not cover your treatment the high dose chemotherapy or the bone marrow transplant so here is a family dr goff is now retired from the state department he has been in the government for 25 years paid into a plan that he every year thought would cover whatever is necessary for his familys wellbeing and suddenly he finds that he has a plan that does not cover his particular problems now he began to do some research because he is an oncologist and he went through the literature and found that things that are covered by that plan there is no more basis for their being covered than for the procedures that his wife was trying to get payment for and in fact in many instances the things that are covered have less scientific basis than what they produce he talked to people at the washington state blue cross blue cross of washington and alaska is in seattle he talked to the medical director there and i talked to him the doctor said yes the federal plan does not cover this kind of treatment but if you happen to be in blue cross of washington state if you are covered by the washington state blue cross this treatment would be covered now i ask you and i ask any member of congress how we can possibly in this body put out the belief to people that we are going to make it possible for them to shop smart you cannot shop smart when you do not know what is going to happen to you when you cannot read your blue cross plan when you do not know what the scientific changes are across the medical field and yet here we are hurdling toward going after presenting to the american people a plan which gives more power to insurance companies what is happening to dr goff and what is happening to lots of americans is that their health care is being rationed right now all the rationing that is going on in this country is being done by insurance companies it is being decided by actuaries it is being decided by accountants people who decide well this only gives somebody 10 percent greater chance we are not going to worry about it we will not give that kind of treatment we will only give treatment to somebody maybe 50 percent or 60 percent or whatever the decisions that are being made in health care today are being made by insurance companies and for the congress to say that we want to get everybody into managed care and therefore we will be able to save money is simply handing control of the health care of all our constituents into the hands of about six or eight large insurance companies in this country now dr goff has a fallback position since his insurance does not pay for it if you want to get a bone marrow transplant i dont care what center it is in the united states they will either take you if your insurance plan covers it or if you can take out of your pocket 60 or 80 or 100 thousand and put it on the table before you come in now this is a doctor he has got a practice he is making a decent living he has a pension and so forth but they will not accept from him oh just come in and have the treatment and pay us when you get the money they wanted the money up front this is in the hutchinson cancer center in seattle and every other cancer center they do not do bone marrow transplants without advance payment or assurance of it from an insurance plan now dr goff is lucky he may be able to take a loan out on his house take the equity out of his house for 60 000 or 80 000 and put that money down and get that kind of treatment for his wife he is lucky not everybody in this country is not lucky enough to be able to come up with 80 000 at the exact time that their loved one whether it is a wife or a child or whomever needs that kind of treatment and what the president has said is that we need health care that can never be taken away and that covers the things that americans are worried about everyone who has insurance right now says why should i be worried well let me tell you the reason why every american including members of congress should be worried is that none of us know whether the policy we have been paying on will cover the kinds of things that may face us and there is no way we can ever be that knowledgeable i am a physician i could not be that knowledgeable nobody can and it is nonsense to say that he american people suddenly we are going to hand them booklets and they are going to then be knowledgeable to buy health insurance any time anybody comes on the floor of this house and says that we will hand around a bunch of booklets and people will know how to buy good health care simply is talking nonsense if dr goff did not know how to do it it is sure that jim mcdermorr will not know how to do it and every member of congress and all the american people are going to be in the same bind now i support the single payer system because i thinkit is the best way to give every one the opportunity to see the physician of their choice to have the biggest benefit package to have it paid for in the most efficient way we can save 100 billion a year the congressional budget office has said by eliminating insurance companies from the process and letting the doctor and the patient make this decision about what ought to be done we can save 100 billion a year which will cover all the benefits which our society presently does not have all of us hope all of us hope desperately hope that we will never use our health insurance we do not want to use it it is not something people lie around at night saying gee i wonder how i can get some benefits out of my insurance policy that would be like saying you would want to have some benefits out of your fire insurance policy maybe if we had a fire in the house we could finally get some benefits out of that nobody want that and tbe fact is that the single payer system is the only way you can guarantee to the american people that you provide a benefit package that covers the things that people need with an affordable cost and i hope that this congress will consider the case of dr goff and all the other people he is not alone there was a case in california of a woman who had breast cancer and the doctors recommended a bone marrow transplant for her and she did not have the money so she had to go around and try and raise the money finally she got it but too late she died but the case was settled in the california courts for 84 million very simply because the contract that she had from the managed care operation said they did bone marrow transplants what it didnt say was we dont do bone marrow transplants if you have breast cancer so she thought she was covered and in fact that same case was settled really in large measure because they found a provision in the internal memos of the company which said to the doctors if you dont make referrals for bone marrow transplants you will get paid more that is what managed competition is all about that is what managed care under insurance companies is all about it is not directed at what is in the best interest of the patient it is directed at what is in the best interest of the stockholders you have to remember that managed care from insurance companies simply is designed in a corporation to take in as much money as possible spend as little on benefits as possible so at the end of the quarter you can give the biggest dividends to the stockholders and a health insurance plan run by insurance companies with managed care by insurance companies is not going to be good for the american people that is why i support the american health security act which is the sin glepayer plan h r 1200 i hope every member of this congress will read that bill and consider it the best for all their constituents"], [0.9815608691424131, 0.01843913085758686, 1, "i just wanted to say ffunds in the following ways they can how right you are i

when we fortunately had the ability and hire members of racial and ethnic h8692 co minority groups and women in order to increase their ranks within the sworn positions in the law enforcement agency that quota section speaks for itself third the clinton crime bill provides only seed money for a community that wants to hire police officers here is the irony for a community to get a grant to hire police officers it must show a specific financial need the grant runs out in equal stages over 5 years however a community must also show that as a grant runs out in steps the community must be able to afford to keep the cops permanently this does not make sense a community applies for a grant because it needs the money but must show that as the money runs out it has the financial ability to continue the program if a community has the money in the first place then it could not receive the grant yet it has to show it has the money in order to continue the program fourth the actual amount of money allocated in the crime bill for cops will hire 20 000 at most not 100 000 cops the reason is in the application the clinton administration itself estimates it will cost 75 000 per year to hire one cop so if you stretch out the money allocated for the program over 5 years it comes out to 14 500 per cop that is why we have police officers all the way from down in florida from a city that employs 17 police officers to say that we are in a tight budget now so why should we hire more policemen on this program when the money will be whittled away in a short period of time essentially leaving us with an unfunded mandate these are the words of terry chapman acting police chief of the brooksville fl police department and paul logli the states attorney for winnebago county il which i

do local law enforcement agencies or social agencies we have probably never heard this argument before the application and the proposed statutory language show how little emphasis is placed on the

that unitedstates savings rates are not up is because peoples wages have been going down or they are stuck it is not because they are bad people but it is pretty rough to save money when you and your husband have to pull down two parttime jobs in order to keep feeding your kids so for the past 20 years the gentleman has been a party to all of these trade agreements which have really pitted the workers of this country against the lowestwage workers in the world in the most undemocratic nations on the face of the earth i know he is the kind of man who wants to do good but the fact is after 20 years of increasing trade deficits i think it is time to look in the mirror and say something has not quite gone right this year we will amass again another 150 billion more imports coming into this

order against the amendments are waived finally the resolution provides for one motion to recommit with or without instructions the full budget disclosure act of 1994 is designed to improve our budget process precisely as itsshort title suggests by requiring full budget disclosure the official title of h r 4907 is a bill to reform the concept of baseline budgeting i can assure the members the bill will do just that to the extent they have the time and inclination to follow it at all most americans find the federal budget process difficult to comprehend at best part of the problem is our confusing terminology we just dont use the same budgetary terms and concepts that ordinary people do we have fiscal years rather than calendar years we have discretionary spending and mandatory spending we have appropriations bills and we have authorization bills we have onbudget and offbudget programs we have the deficit and we have the national debt we have countless other terms that we throw around here but i dare say probably the most difficult budget concept for ordinary americans to understand is our notion of a budget baseline under the law when the president submits his budget to the congress and the congress prepares its congressional budget they start from something called a current policy baseline that baseline assumes for the budget year and subsequent years a continuation of the current spending level for programs and services adjusted for inflation and certain other technical factors there is absolutely nothing wrong with using a current policy baseline after all every american appreciates how inflation erodes the purchasing power of his dollars over time all americans know the same number of dollars wont buy today what they bought 10 years ago or even last year this is why the law provides costofliving adjustments to social security benefits if we did not give costofliving adjustments social security benefitswould over time lose much of their value and recipients would lose much of their income even though the number of dollars in their checks wouldnt actually drop those checks would buy less and less in the future as inflation eroded their purchasing power well inflation erodes the purchasing power of federal tax revpnues too any given number of federal tax dollars does not buy the same quantity of goods and services today that it bought 10 years ago or even last year as a result it takes more dollars to repair a mile of federal highway buy uniforms for soldiers and sailors and to maintain national parks government must adjust to the same inflation that households do and the current policy baseline helps policymakers to understand inflations effect on government but use of the current policy baseline has one drawback it makes more difficult comparisons of how spending changes from year to year in actual terms it is the problem h r 4907 is designed to solve under the bill the president and the congress would have to include an additional baseline a current funding baseline in their budget documents the current funding baseline would start from last years spending level and would not be adjusted for inflation this additional baseline would allow people to see and understand how various budget proposals would change spending from year to year in constant dollars without taking inflation into account by comparing proposed spending to the two baselines for example policymakers and the public could both understand that a budget proposal for a given program might very well represent an increase over last year in actual dollars but not enough to keep pace with inflationor effectively a cut in the program or people culd see that a proposal might represent an increase in actual dollars over the amount needed to keep pace with inflation or effectively an expansion of the program in addition h r 4907 will require the congressional budget office to include its annual report to the budget committees a comparison to current spending levels and an analysis of the causes of increased spending in mandatory programs due to costofliving adjustments changes in beneficiaries higher healthcare costs and other factors this provision will help us better understand the reasons for growth in those programs commonly called entitlements i am convinced h r 4907 will improve the budget process and that it will help both policymakers and ordinary americans to understand that process better i urge all members to support the bill and the rule and i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.9805939514189959,

judy lemons of my staff for her work since 1972 on the presidio issue today i rise in opposition to the duncan amendment this is the same amendment mr duncan offered and lost last year the presidio transfer will end over two centuries of military history to become part of the most visited park in the united states its over 1 400 acres include the largest number of historic structures of any national park and it is the only urban park in the world included in the u n biosphere reserve its unique natural features and educational potential provide us with an unprecedented opportunity to create an extraordinary 21st century national park it is essential to seek innovative ways to manage our federal assets that save money while ensuring accountability the history and national significance of the presidio must be preserved as a testament to the growth of our nation as i mentioned when mr duncan first offered his amendment last year plans were well under way for the suecessful conversion of the piesidio the paik service has completed the planning process for the presidio a lease is now being negotiated for the major revenuegenerating property at the presidio a legislative process is underway in the house and senate to seek an innovative costsaving management mechanism that will reduce federal outlays for the presidio i have introduced legislation h r 3433 as a costeffective means for managing the presidio a subcommittee markup will occur this monday on my bill as well as one introduced by mr duncan at a hearing on these two bills the subcommittee on national parks heard testimony that the duncan bill would cost 100 million more than the legislation i have proposed financial and real estate consultants working on the presidio have determined that h r 3433 is the leastcost option under consideration and would be less costly than the duncan bill which is projected to cost over 100 million more than my legislation traditional park service management which is projected to cost over 400 million more than h r 3433 mr duncan has no plan to actually reduce costs for the presidio so he must resort to simplistic tactics that delay a process that was set in motion 22 years ago when in 1972 congress determined that the presidio would become a national park delay is expensive every dollar cut now simply means that taxpayers costs will increase even more than the costs of the duncan bill essential maintenance projects will only cost more next year the presidio is a national resource that should not be squandered"]], "top_unsure":
