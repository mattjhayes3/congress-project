recall congress mandated that the adissue involves interstate branching by ministration review the relevance of banks and interstate acquisitions by geographic barriers today and analyze the effects of any amendments which may be proposed that report thoroughly examined both the mcfadden act and the douglas amendment and presents a very strong casein practical and competitive termsfor ending the current restrictions on interstate banking let me quote excerpts from the i eport this administration is committed to the avoidance of an undue concentration of resources and supports the continuation of a viable dual banking system the issue treated in this report is whether the existing framework of geographic restrictions on bank expansion is an effective efficient and eqguitable way to avoid undue concentration in the f inancial environment of the 19809 put another way given that existing geographic restraints can impede competition and reduce efficiency in many markets could undue concentrations of financial power be avoided without such restraints the administration has concluded that market forces inside and outside banking per se are diminishing the effectiveness and increasing the inequities and inefficiencies produced by current geographic limitations that the persistence of those forces will create growing pressure for change in the statutory framework in the early 1980s and that a phased liberalization of existing restraints would serve the public interest the administration cannot justify on grounds of logic or economics the prohibition on one side of a state border of the banks activities which are permissible on the other side of the border financial markets have experienced fundamental and accelerating change businesses households and the financial institutions serving their needs have expanded their geographic reach but the basic federal statutory approach toward geographic expansion by banks has been virtually unaltered for nearly half a century whatever their benefits in an earlier era the administration regards existing geographic limitations as anachronistic in the competitive marketplace of the 1980s the gap between the powers of commerical banks and the geographic breadth of todays financial services markets is growing and as it grows the inefficiencies and inequities for both banks and the public they serve will become more severe the financial services industry is inherently an interstate business and banking activities on the wholesale side are increasingly conducted on an interstate basis today the nations major corporations and wealthy individuals frequently effect transactions with banks across state lines it is only the small business and household customers who continue to be deprived of the benefits of a competitive interstate banking system in the administrations view the failure to liberalie the present framework will perpetuate the existing discrimination against the retail customer deprive the public of the benefits of increased competition impede the efficient allocation of resources retard the development and application of new technologies and restrict the ability of bank management to compete with other nonbank financial institutions playing under a different set of rules 000market forces will continue to undermine the effectiveness of artificial boundaries unrelated to those forces 0 0changes in demographics technology consumer preferences regulation and the financial industry itself have eroded many of the barriers erected in the 1930s what was once a financial system consisting of highly segnmented geographic markets had for many kinds of banking services been transformed into a competitive nationwide marketplace what was once a segmented product market has been replaced by headtohead competition between banks and various nonbank institutions indeed there is no longer a single service or product line offered exclusively by commercial banks the report included several legislative recommendations which i have included in my bill package for moving the nations banking system toward full interstate banking its recommendations are especially timely today because of the serious pressures experienced by our nations banking system the goal of the reporta goal i enthusiastically endorseis to open the way for a new era of unfettered competition in the banking industry the industry has been evolving in that direction by fits and starts while i realize that the tendency of government is to wait for a crisis before addressing a problem i would hope that we would take a broad view of our responsibilities and deal with this issue as a whole instead of by bits and pieces this approach would greatly benefit consumers borrowers business and the financial industry it also reflects the reality of our nations financial structure and would at last bring the legal structure of banking into line with the national financial structure my purpose in introducing today the following package of bills is to address all of the options for giving our nations banking system a nationwide foundation i want to make clear that i am not wedded to any one approach but as we consider what we must do it is important that we have before us all of the legislative alternatives let me briefly explain each of the bills the first two bills would permit nationwide branching through amendment of the banking laws or the bank holding company act it may be that upon study congress will decide that a change to nationwide banking is too precipitous a change to make all at once and that regional approach to banking is a more cautious and reasonable step the next two bills i am introducing would permit branching throughout the entire standard metropolitan statistical area within which the bank or holding company is located this smsa approach to banking would also solve the unique problem of banks located in the district of columbia in the event the next congress did not want to apply smsa banking across the nation the next two bills which i am introducing would limit smsa banking to the washington d c metropolitan area the seventh bill would phase in modifications in the mcfadden act by allowing the deployment of eft terminals on a statewide basis and within natural market areas that cut across state lines it would permit full nationwide deployment of eft terminals within 5 years of the acts enactment j 4193 the final bill represents a major first step toward interstate banking by allowing banking institutions to cross state lines to acquire failing institutions whether they be banks or thrift institutions this would allow congress to examine the effects of interstate acquisitions through the failing bank

reached more distressing to us as american citizenff the commitinent of the united states to a human rights policy and world implementationi of the universal declaration of human rights has not been consistent president jimmy carter took the world by surprise when he stressed unitedstates concern for international human rights as a major goal of our foreign policy by contrast president ronald reagan is less concerned with the internal policies of other nations as a criterion for our assistance which has caused lament among human rights advocates who see a major shift in the unitedstates position however it is important to remember that it was congress not carter which initiated the unitedstates human rights policy of the 1970s now that the administration has deemphasized this issue it is up to congress to take the leadership again and reassert the need for a strong human rights policy which can serve our national interests and promote international peace and stability international human rights first became a priority for congress at the same time it took a more active role in foreign policy during the postvietnam war era with the war over remnants of the antiwar movement turned their attention to the roots of that conflict and pushed for a tighter control on our involvement with repressive foreign policy governments beginning in 1973 congress passed a series of progressively tougher provisions banning unitedstates assistance to foreign nations engaged in human rights violations and it also required annual reports onl the human rights practices of other nations in 1976 congress passed a sweeping bill that would have established a mandatory cutoff of security asssistance to human rights violators but it was vetoed by president gerald ford by 1977 when carter proclaimed in his first inaugural address that our moral sense dictates a clearcut preference for those societies which share with us an abiding respect for individual human rights congress had already set the basic framework of the unitedstates human rights policy during the carter administration congress worked with the president to implement that policy legislation established the position of assistant secretary of state for human rights and humanitarian affairs first held by patricia derian her name and actions became well known and appreciated worldwide by victims of oppression from dissidents in argentina to refuseniks in the soviet union working with the interagency committee on human rights and foreign assistance informally chaired by d puty secretary of state warren christopher derian insured that human rights was a factor to be considered on foreign policy decisions as the focus on human rights shifted from congress to carter and expanded in scope criticism also mounted carter officials were challenged by those who believed that unitedstates concern about the humane treatment of foreign citizens by their own governmients operates against unitedstates security interests however the dichotomy between these national priorities is artificial international human rights considcrations in reality are an essential element of our own longterm strategic goals cozy relations with repressive foreign governments can ultimately hurt more than help recent experience demonstrates that victims of repressive governments are not quick to forget unitedstates identification with their former leaders for example our uncritical support pf the authoritarian regime of iranian shah mohammed reza pahlavi alienated us from the iranian people with devastating results when the shah was overthrown likewise our close ties with nicaraguas despised president anastasio somoza has crippled our ability to dal with the sandinista government which took over following somozas resignation these scenes could be starting all over again in the philippines and south korea in september of this year 6 000 people demonstrated in the philippines and attacked the united states as the imperialist partner of the regime of president ferdinand marcos a month later rockthrowing students denounced unitedstates ties with the filipino government during the most violent rioting in manila since two people were killed in a 1976 riot many koreans bitterly resent the american aid used to quell a violent uprising in the korean city kwang ju where the death toll

of state edmund s muskie said the heavy silence of repression is not stability it is too often the ominous calm before the storm the lesson which this administration must learn to heed is that we cannot afford to sacrifice our essential enduring relationship with the people of a nation for short term security objectives there is no question that our human rights policy has increased global sensitivity to tile issue aided in the release of political prisoners and the emigration of dissidents eased repression and even saved lives equally important yet harder to measure the heightened

title is the private sector survey on cost control but is really a government spendingwatchdog committee said thatthere are presently 900 000 puerto ricans who live in the city of new york and they are all on food stamps he went on to say that 2 1 million puerto ricans were living on the mainland but then went on to also talk about the puerto ricans who live in puerto rico and stating thatthe food stamp program is basically a subsidy program for the puerto ricans i take offense with that because both you and i know that poverty is no joke yes there are many persons in this country 2q million to be exact who today are forced to use food stamps as a way of life most of these people if not all of these people prefer not to have a handout what they prefer is to find a mechanism by which we can give them a handup mr grace has since stated in the new york times and in several periodicals of course that have come out in various parts of the nation that he made an oratorical mistake and that lie apologizes for making that oratorical mistake an oratorical mistake may be one thing but a slip is yet something else this is not the first time that the poor of this nation have been faced with an insensitive person at the helm talking about making certain that the private sector and the trickledown theory can function and that we should be much more sensitive toward following that road and that example my feeling about that is as the chairman of the congressional hispanic caucus and as a proud puerto rican a person who was born in the city i represent the city of new york but of two parents who arrived in new york just as many other people have arrived just looking for a better way of life andtrying to raise a family to make certain that we all had our education mr grace was born in a totally different atmosphere he was born in an atmosphere of polo ponies and private clubs there is a big difference between the world from which he comes and the world from which so many puerto ricans come from we have refused to accept his apology because the only apology we will accept is if and when mr grace steps down from that position as the head of this

to write words as he sees fit to make the poem a complete poem and to be able to have that poem interpreted he does not have a poetic license and my sense of what he said was that those statements would never have been made had they been made before the american grain association who was having their meeting or their convention let us say in the city of new york why should he pick dallas why should he pick dallas to make those statements because he probably felt secure that in the city of dallas because there were no puerto ricans or very few to speak of that it would not be picked up it was picked up by the press and it was sent out throughout the country both myself and my colleague from the island of puerto rico the congressman from puerto rico baltasar cornada del rio have issued

we are at the most dangerous moment of the nuclear era i say this because if the next round of nuclear weapons is deployed verification problems will be infinitely more difficult under any kind of strategic arms treaty likewise any futher attempt to negotiate or ratify such a treaty will become more difficult and if such new generations of nuclear weapons are deployed the first strike capability of these weapons raises the risk of those weapons being launched by accident because of a perceived intention on the other side to fire them at the other side and we will begin to get into a hairtrigger state because the only defense in this situation is to be in a launchonwarning posture which i think is incredibly dangerous to the entire human race around this chamber there are many

are those within the administration who believe they can play games with weapons as meancing as those that are in our arsenals today there are those who have chosen as a matter of national policy to pursue nuclear agitation and then hand us the crazy evacuation plan now under consideration this kind of nuclear madness will only provoke the other side to respond in kind to which then we would find

when epa has proposed to retain a pesticide by additional restrictions on its use rather than canceling its use section 6 b of fifra entitles persons adversely affected by a proposed cancellation action to challenge this decision in an administrative hearing epa in reviewing registered pesticides for possible unreasonable adverse effects to man and the environment through the rpar process has utilized the risk benefit analysis as a result in many cases is able to continue the use of pesticides by incorporating restrictions such as usage limitations improved application directions or more emphatic label warnings epa in 1979 made an administrative decision in interpretation of adversely affected that only registrants and users of pesticides which are those with an economic interest in the continued registration of a pesticide were entitled to a hearing under section 6 b the public interest groups although they may have participated in the rpar process still feel they should be able to demand an administrative hearing to challenge this type of action saying it has not gone far enough and that in effect the pesticide use should be canceled the public interest groups unsuccessfully challenged this administrative ruling in court the court ruled that congress intended to provide an administrative hearing only when a pesticide use is being canceled not when its use is being retained conditionally since the public interest groups have an input in the rpar process and have the opportunity to appear before the fifra scientific advisory panel all before the final decision is made and then may challenge this refusal to cancel in federal district court under the provision of section 16 a i feel that adequate safeguards have been provided and this amendment should be rejected i might point out that the subcommittee considered this proposal during its deliberations and determined that such language was not needed for those who are more interested in the details of this issue i will continue further the rosenthal amendment to section 6 b of fifra provides that whenever epa proposes to place regulatory restrictions on a product any interested person may compel epa to hold a courtroomtype cancellation hearing for the purpose of determining whether even greater restrictions should be imposed on the product than those epa decided on my prob lem with this amendment is not with its underlying conceptthat any interested member of the public should be able to request stricter regulatory action my problem is with the procedure chosen to do thisthe formal courtroomi ype cancellation hearing a cancellation hearing is a lengthy timeconsuming resourceconsuming piece of litigation it is simply bad law and bad policy to make cancellation hearings the vehicle for regulatory decisions as to how strictly pesticides should be regulated yet that would be the primary effect of the rosenthal amendment i believe that all interested persons should have an input into epa decisions as to how strictly to regulate pesticides but as i will show that opportunity is already provided under current law during the administrative review process because cancellation hearings under section 6 b are really formal litigation they serve a very narrow purpose it would be a grave mistake to adopt the rosenthal amendment and thereby turn them into something they were never intended to be and that is essentiallyunworkablea forum for deciding how strictly to regulate pesticides the issue raised by the rosenthal amendment is not whether environmental groups should have the same right to demand a cancellation hearing under section 6 b as a pesticide registrant that is a false issue rather the issue is what is the proper time and place for the public to have input on how strictly a product should be regulated is the proper procedure as i contend for the public to make its beliefs known during the agencys regulatory review process or is the proper procedure as mr rosewhal contends to decide regulatory issues through administrative litigationthat is to let any person demand that a formal courtroomlike cancellation hearing be held to redecide how strictly to regulate a product whenever a person feels that epa has not been strict enough i believe that cancellation hearings under section 6 b should not be the forum for redeciding regulatory issues the proper time for the public to comment on how strictly to regulate a product is during the administrative review process if anyone thinks that epa was not strict enough after an administrative review that person has the right to take epa to court under section 16 a of fifra and ask the court to review what epa has done cancellation hearings serve the narrow purpose of giving a registrant a right to due process of law if his product is going to be canceled they should not be expanded as proposed in the rosenthal amerdment into a device for deciding anew epa decisions that a person does not like i believe the logic of my position becomes even more clear when one understands the different purposes served by administrative review on the one hand and by cancellation hearings on the other epa decisions as to whether to impose restrictions on a product or even cancel a product are made in an administrative review process called an rpar rebuttal presumption against registration every person has a full right to participate in this regulatory process and to urge that a product be strictly regulated and to provide to epa any data or arguments in support of his position if the person feels that epa has not been strict enough at the conclusion of the rpar he can sue epa in federal court and obtain review of epas decision this is in fact made crystal clear in an amendment in h r 5203 to section 16 of fifra concerning judicial review in summary epa has found based on many years of experience that the administrative review or rpar is the best procedure for deciding how strictly to regulate and that is the proper time and place for the public to participate and express its views on how a product should be regulated in contrast a cancellation hearing under section 6 b serves a very different and narrow purpose when epa proposes to cancel a product the registrants and other adversely affected persons can request a formal hearing to protect their procedural right to make sure that the cancellation is carried out in accordance with due prdcess of law cancellation hearings are very rare very expensive for the taxpayer very time consuming and resource consuming and very burdensome on epa there have been only a handful of such hearings since epa was created in 1970for ddt aldrin and dieldren heptachlor and chlordane and 2 4 5t they typically last for a minimum of 6 months and can take years to complete they consist of an administrative trial conducted in the same manner as a trial in federal court they require the public to foot the bill for the time of a team of agency lawyers and administrative law judge they take epa scientists away from their duties and require them to spend time testifying and in crossexamination for periods of days or weeks because cancellation hearings are rare they are an acceptable procedure for protecting registrants due process rights to a hearing but they are clearly an ineffective and undesirable mechanism for making routine decislons as to how strictly epa should regulate particular products they result in legal decisions made by lawyers and administrative judges not in regulatory decisions made by epa scientists and policymakers if the rosenthal amendment were adopted epa would be inundated with these cancellation hearings the amendment would give extraordinary power to a single individual to tie up epas regulatory resources in unproductive litigation a single person could demand a hearing on virtually every epa regulatory decision and force epa to spend months or years trying its case before an administrative law judge after the agency had alfeady fully considered the evidence and reached a decision through its administrative review this clearly would be unwise the law should stay as it is the public should provide its input during the administrative review at the time when epa makes its regulatory decisions if a cancellation hearing is held of course the public should continue to have the right as it does now to participate in it and the public should continue to have the right as it does now to get judicial review of epa regulatory decisions but a person should not be able to tie epa in knots by demanding that lengthy and expensive cancellation hearings be held whenever they feel that epa has not been quite strict enough epa should spend its

stone clay and colloidal phosphate industriesand thereby effect their transfer to the regulatory jurisdiction of osha let me stress that these industries were not to be left unregulated but would have been transferred at their request to osha which has certainly not been traditionally considered a patsy for the business community this amendment was subsequently adopted by the house and later added by the senate to the continuing resolution which would fund msha for fiscal year 1981 unfortunately during the fight over the congressional pay raise issue the amendment was lost along with a hundred other amendments and therefore did not become law decpite the overwhelming congressional supportboth in the house and in the senate i am today offering this amendment my amendment accomplishes the objectives of a bill currently cosponsored by 153 members of this body h r 1603 h r 1603 and other similar bills have languished in the health and safety subcommittee of the education and labor committee in the 96th congress and now in the 97th congress despite the great support this legislation has from many many members of congress congressmen marlenee and barnardthe principal sponsors of h r 1603 join me in urging your support for my amendment which is necessitated because of inaction by the committee having jurisdiction over h r 1603 two years ago the appropriations committee included language to deny msha funds to enforce complicated and in many instances irrelevant training requirements against these same industries i am pleased to note that prohibition has been continued in the proposal pending before the house today while our action on the training requirements has helped these industries there is still a desperate need for further congressional action my amendment makes it clear that we intend for osha to exercise jurisdiction over not only training of employees working in these industfies but have total responsibility for assuring a safe and healthful workplace the industries i am seeking to have transferred from msha to osha were made subject to the mine safety and health act by the amendments that the congress enacted in 1977 few of us recognized at that time that we were imposing sophisticated regulations designed for large and highly technical operations on small businesses which are located in virtually every community in our country the sand gravel and crushed stone industries the two largest industries affected by the amendment have an average number of employees per operation of 7 and 11 respectively the 1977 act has created continuing confrontations between these small businesses and the federal government this adversary relationship is to no ones benefit the transfer proposed in my amendment will restore a cooperative relationship between federal safety and health experts and the industries for the benefit of the workers the industries which would be transferred are not hazardous industries as their current safety records demonstrate and our acceptance therefore of this amendment will not provide any less safety and health protection to their employees some of my colleagues have suggested that the relief sought by these industries can be administratively accomplished by the mine safety and health administration to date the only significant administrative relief and possibly all that is available under the constraints of the act has come from the socalled compliance assistance visit program which allows msha inspectors to examine an oper ation that has been closed due to seasonal conditions and provide a citation and penalty free inspection prior to its reopening this limited and courtesy inspection is in sharp contrast to oshas program where an operator can request such an inspection at any time the problem is that the 1977 mine safety amendments act leaves the secretary of labor with very little flexibility in providing such relief thus underscoring the necessity for passage of my amendment it is regrettable that this serious regulatory problem which has been the subject of 21 days of hearings in the last congress must be addressed by means of an appropriations rider here today hopefully passage of my amendment will force full house consideration of legislationspecifically h r 1603in the near future to make permanent the changes my amendment would make here today for 1982 what is the actual effect of my amendment my amendment simply provides that the regulation of persons engaged in the surface mining of stone clay colloidal phosphate sand or gravel or with respect to any person engaged in construction activities on the surface area of any coal or other mine for safety purposes is transferred from msha to osha one question often asked about this amendment is does the msha amendment create a void in federal enforcement of safety and health standards over the surface mining of sand gravel stone clay colloidal phosphate as well as surface mining construction no osha under the occupational safety and health act has jurisdiction over these mines osha by its terms applies to all employers engaged in a business affecting comoctober 6 1 981 coi merce title 29 united states code section 652 5 thus osha legally covers mines which are also covered under the mine and safety and health act of 1977 additionally the drafters of osha realized that there was the potential problem of dual regulation thus they included in the act a deferral provision title 29 united states code section 653 b 1 it provides that where another federal agency exercises its own statutory authority to prescribe or enforce occupational safety or health standards then osha will not apply the legislative history of osha shows that the key factor triggering deferral is the exercise of another agencys statutory authority over them in three separate court cases three courts of appeals in our country which incidently are the courts next in authority to the unitedstates supreme court it was held that osha has jurisdiction when any other agency for example federal railroad administration msha et ceterais deprived of their jurisdiction the appropriations limitation has the effect of not providing funding for fiscal year 1982 for the exercise of mshas statutory authority over the surface mines described in the pending amendment thus there will be no exercise of statutory authority by msha the effect of this nonexercise under section 4 b 1 of oshatitle 29 united states code section 653 b 1 thus triggers by operation of existing law the responsibility of osha to assume enforcement activity over the described surface mines let me talk for a minute about the construction industry the construction industry was and still is specifically under osha jurisdiction for safety and health in fact in 1973 the construction industry initiated the call for a single standard separate and apart from the general industry osha standards so that the specific concerns of the construction industry could be adequately addressed this was done on the basis of a study which pointed out the shortcomings overlaps and voids between the general industry and the construction series of osha standards this step published in the federal register in 1979 is an example of longterm cooperation between the construction industry and osha and dedication to a mutual goalsafety with practicability unfortunately those construction contractors worfring on a suirface mine sites are considered to be miners and fall under mshas rules and regulations these socalled miners may be constructing a scale house a garage a new shop building or a structure to house a processing plant biut under the 1977 mine safety and health act they are considered miners ajid they are now subject to rules and regulations established for miners in addition to construction rufles and regulations found under osha let me give you a specific example a construction firm is planning on building a highway along the rightofway the contractor negotiates with a farmer or a rancher for the purchase of stone sand or gravel from a borrow pit on his property suddenly the farmer has become a mineowner and the contractor has become a mine operator this is the result of the msha ruling one day the contractor may greet an osha compliance officer performing an inspection of the site the next day he may find an msha enforcement officer at the gate neither operate under the same rules nor do they use the same or cven similar citations of penalties the contractor must take time from his schedule to accompany each of these federal officials during their inspections or have one of his supervisors do so in addition the contractor must also permit theemployee representative to join the entourageall at the contractors expense this situation is clearly absurd if we are truly serious about budget cuts and cutting down on truly excess federal expenditures then we should be saying you cannot send two inspectors to the same jobsite because there is no reason to pay two people to do one job there is an interagency agreement between the mine safety and health administration and the occupational safety and health administration which should reduce some of the existing problems however all such memorandums of understanding have a degree of fragility about them in that they commit only those signatory to the document nnd for an unspecified period furthir the agreement reclassifies as mining some operations which have traditionally been regarded as construction it suggests that whenever a construction contractor uses equipment to process or size material which he alone is responsible for excavating he must be covered by the requirements of msha compelling the contractor to provide 24 hours of superfluous training prior to 1 ounce of productive effort from his work force again this cost spiral is all too obvious one construction industry group surveyed its members to get some idea of the cost impact of msha on the construction industry the most conservative estimates of cost impact of msha on the nations highway program place the increase at 1 percent that 1 percent comes to 300 million per year this is only a part of the problem what about the building contractors who purchase their stone sand gravel aggregates cement concrete brick and so forth from suppliers members of the construction industry report that the~r material suppliers costs would increase anywhere from 5 to 10 percent these increases are completely unnecessary one member of the industry stated if the huge msha staff went to the underground mines to work at the mining problem instead of cluttering up the surface landscape with wasteful duplicative efforts we would all benefit now i would like to address those who say that nsha is doing a terrific job and it is changing its waysbecoming more and more receptive i say that msha has not turned over a new leaf the agency and its supporters are making inaccurate statements about its socalled new look that the situations brought to our attention by constituents with stone sand gravel and clay operations as well as surface construction activities have not been resolved conditions have not improved to any appreciable degree during the 96th congress hearings were held on this issue in the house and despite consistent overwhelming testimony from all elements of the noncoalmining industrythese hearings are slated to continue ad finitum with the committee in the house showing no inclination to take action toward resolving the injustices found not just in the administration of the actbut in the act itself certainly there is always need in every industry and service to continually improve safety and health conditions but the policeman approach of msha is not the answer it appears methods of aggravation are the product not constructive efforts to better safety it is now time to resolve this matterif at least only for a year the senate subcommittee on labor has voted out s 351 which would authorize this change in the msha legislation the senate has also indicated that they will include my amendment in their version of the laborhealth education appropriations bill for fiscal year 1982 i urge support for this amendment to remove the stone clay sand gravel and surface mining construction from the heavy foot of msha to osha i urge the support of my colleagues let msha be directly and principally concerned with deep underground minesnot these surface operations which can be and should be addressed by osha assigning jurisdiction over these industries to msha ill serves the objective of employee safety and health imposes unnecessary burdens upon the separate industries and dilutes

realtors urges your vote tomorrow for the budget resolution to be offered by representative latta because it reduces the fiscal year 1983 deficit below 100 billion and it contains a binding reconciliation date which will force the process towards a balanced budget in future years we believe that passage of a federal budget reducing the deficit below 100 billion in 1983 is a necessary step oward the real goal of interest rates declining to normal levels without this action government spending will continue to increase faster than peoples income and federal deficit borrowing will consume virtually the entire savings pool of the american people congress must write a budget that will regain control over the deficit and provide impetus necessary to restore the health of the many insensitive segments of the nation which have been devastated by unaffordable interest rates we are hopeful that this action will result in a decline in interest rates sufficient to generate economy recovery we are not happy with the high deficits in the out years forecast for the latta resolution let me interject that i am not either we have cut better than 80 billion out of the 1983 deficit and we are cutting more out of the future year deficits but we will have an opportunity in future years to take further cuts continuing the letter in recent months we have urged on the congress a deferral

james watt and secretary of energy james edwards in order to put the results of that press conference into proper perspective i would like to remind everyone of the following first the citizens of this nation have seen the price of energy almost triple in less than 2 2 years second the united states faces a hydrocarbon fluid energy crisis for the next 20 to 30 years third while consumption of oil is expected to drop by 1990 the domestic production of oil is expected to drop at a faster rate increasing or at least maintaining our current rate of imported oil fourth the united states is enormously endowed with abundant hydrocarbon fluid resources since it is estimated that we have as much conventional oil left as we have already produced fifth at least 85 percent of this nations remaining oil is owned by the federal government sixth up to 60 percent of our remaining oil is estimated to be located in the ocs seventh the ocs oil and gas pro gram has returned to the general treasury in excess of 10 billion in the past 2 years and eighth last year the united states paid foreign countries around 80 billion for imported oil these are alarming and curious facts our energy problems center around domestic consumption of oil our low level of domestic production and therefore our inordirate dependence on foreign nations for such a high percentage of our oil needs this negatively impacts upon the value of the dollar abroad inflation and national security the question arises however if we are so abundant in energy resources why are we so dependent on foreign nations for such a high percentage of our needs the fact is that domestic production is stagnant and is expected to drop over the next 10 years unless there is a change in the existing policies of the federal government it has been the land use and leasing policies of past administrations that have been at the root of many of this nations energy problems this has been pointed out in numerous studies including three studies recently released by the gao it is this area that has been impacted by todays press conference secretary of the interior james watt proposed historic revisions in the policies and procedures for leasing ocs oil and gas resources the new 5 year ocs leasing schedule which incorporates the changes represents a crucial step in our efforts to help ourselves out of our energy problem some of the proposed changes announced today include but are not limited to the following first offering of the high potential ar eas in alaskan waters and the atlantic ocean at earlier dates than the old doi leasing schedule second focusing the leasing efforts on areas of highest potential third conducting areawide eiss and resources evaluations fourth areawide lease offerings and fifth 42 lease sales over the next 5 years instead of 36 this country lags behind the other nations with active ocs programs in spite of the fact that we were the leader in ocs drilling and are currently the leader in ocs safety and technology the united states currently only gets 9 3 percent of its domestic oil and about 21 percent of its domestic gas production from its ocs over 21 percent of total world oil production comes from the ocs in other words in spite of enormous hydrocarbon potential a safety record that is the envy of the world and the supplies and capital to do the job the united states is not only lagging behind the rest of the world in ocs production but is falling further behind if the policies that have been announced today are adopted these trends can be reversed as was

been submitted by the congressional black caucus and which will be considered on tuesday as the fauntroy amendment in the nature of a substitute he will find that he will have an opportunity to vote for a balanced budgeta balanced budget that saves the taxpayers more than 50 billion in deficit spending that the administration would have us to spend a balanced budget that enables us to spend less money overall than does any proposal before the house this week and that provides more in tax relief than does any proposal before the house today so i hope that the gentleman will take the time to study the launtroy substitute i think he might find himself in support of this very constructive alternative budget proposal"], [0.002733290195465088, 0.5027332901954651, 1, "i thank the gentleman for yielding i rise in support of h r 4500 which extends the sba section 8 a pilot and bond waiver programs through fiscal year 1983 both provisions were created as part of public law 95507 which i authored in late 1978 it was my intention that both of these programs be made permanent however in conference with the senate it was decided that they should be limited to a few years during which sba gao and congress would havp time to evaluate the programs true worth unfortunately to this day neither of the programs has been implemented satisfactorily as was found by both gao and the small business committee incredibly the small business administration waited some 19 months into an initial 24month program to publish proposed rules on the surety bond waiver program final regulations were not forthcoming until after expiration of the 24month period to this day more than 36 months later sba has failed to issue the standard operating procedures necessary to implement this law this program must be continued to carry out congress intent that this program be given a chance to work and be properly evaluated the8 a pilot program was also delayed a pil6t agency for the program was not designated by the president until 75 days after the bill became law to date little more than a handful of contracts have been awarded although the number dollar amount and quality of these procurements are growing at an encouraging rate the more sophisticated contracts are just now being made available so it would be a mistake to allow the program to expire before full evaluation of the program is completed i know that some question has arisen as to the most appropriate agency for this program i personally believe that a defense agency should continue with this pilot program as chairman of the defense appropriations subcommittee i find it imperative that the defense activities put more reliance on placing high quality high dollar value contracts with qualified small and disadvantaged firms procurement officials must accept the fact that small disadvantaged firms are capable of more than just janitorial services or ditch digging it is good for our defense industrial base and it is good economic policy accordingly i willsupport this bill whether or net the program is shifted to a nondefense agency but i would be disappointed to see that happen the army has always resisted having this program in its agency it should be asked to give this program a chance before it passes judgment one way or the other as of today we do not have sufficient experience to make a satisfactory evaluation i urge my colleagues to vote to extend these programs they are not giveaways rather they have the potential for increasing the number of qualified small disadvantaged firms
