deregulation that has not yet ing in the united states as you been addressed legislatively that recall congress mandated that the adissue involves interstate branching by ministration review the relevance of banks and interstate acquisitions by geographic barriers today and analyze the effects of any amendments which may be proposed that report thoroughly examined both the mcfadden act and the douglas amendment and presents a very strong casein practical and competitive termsfor ending the current restrictions on interstate banking let me quote excerpts from the i eport this administration is committed to the avoidance of an undue concentration of resources and supports the continuation of a viable dual banking system the issue treated in this report is whether the existing framework of geographic restrictions on bank expansion is an effective efficient and eqguitable way to avoid undue concentration in the f inancial environment of the 19809 put another way given that existing geographic restraints can impede competition and reduce efficiency in many markets could undue concentrations of financial power be avoided without such restraints the administration has concluded that market forces inside and outside banking per se are diminishing the effectiveness and increasing the inequities and inefficiencies produced by current geographic limitations that the persistence of those forces will create growing pressure for change in the statutory framework in the early 1980s and that a phased liberalization of existing restraints would serve the public interest the administration cannot justify on grounds of logic or economics the prohibition on one side of a state border of the banks activities which are permissible on the other side of the border financial markets have experienced fundamental and accelerating change businesses households and the financial institutions serving their needs have expanded their geographic reach but the basic federal statutory approach toward geographic expansion by banks has been virtually unaltered for nearly half a century whatever their benefits in an earlier era the administration regards existing geographic limitations as anachronistic in the competitive marketplace of the 1980s the gap between the powers of commerical banks and the geographic breadth of todays financial services markets is growing and as it grows the inefficiencies and inequities for both banks and the public they serve will become more severe the financial services industry is inherently an interstate business and banking activities on the wholesale side are increasingly conducted on an interstate basis today the nations major corporations and wealthy individuals frequently effect transactions with banks across state lines it is only the small business and household customers who continue to be deprived of the benefits of a competitive interstate banking system in the administrations view the failure to liberalie the present framework will perpetuate the existing discrimination against the retail customer deprive the public of the benefits of increased competition impede the efficient allocation of resources retard the development and application of new technologies and restrict the ability of bank management to compete with other nonbank financial institutions playing under a different set of rules 000market forces will continue to undermine the effectiveness of artificial boundaries unrelated to those forces 0 0changes in demographics technology consumer preferences regulation and the financial industry itself have eroded many of the barriers erected in the 1930s what was once a financial system consisting of highly segnmented geographic markets had for many kinds of banking services been transformed into a competitive nationwide marketplace what was once a segmented product market has been replaced by headtohead competition between banks and various nonbank institutions indeed there is no longer a single service or product line offered exclusively by commercial banks the report included several legislative recommendations which i have included in my bill package for moving the nations banking system toward full interstate banking its recommendations are especially timely today because of the serious pressures experienced by our nations banking system the goal of the reporta goal i enthusiastically endorseis to open the way for a new era of unfettered competition in the banking industry the industry has been evolving in that direction by fits and starts while i realize that the tendency of government is to wait for a crisis before addressing a problem i would hope that we would take a broad view of our responsibilities and deal with this issue as a whole instead of by bits and pieces this approach would greatly benefit consumers borrowers business and the financial industry it also reflects the reality of our nations financial structure and would at last bring the legal structure of banking into line with the national financial structure my purpose in introducing today the following package of bills is to address all of the options for giving our nations banking system a nationwide foundation i want to make clear that i am not wedded to any one approach but as we consider what we must do it is important that we have before us all of the legislative alternatives let me briefly explain each of the bills the first two bills would permit nationwide branching through amendment of the banking laws or the bank holding company act it may be that upon study congress will decide that a change to nationwide banking is too precipitous a change to make all at once and that regional approach to banking is a more cautious and reasonable step the next two bills i am introducing would permit branching throughout the entire standard metropolitan statistical area within which the bank or holding company is located this smsa approach to banking would also solve the unique problem of banks located in the district of columbia in the event the next congress did not want to apply smsa banking across the nation the next two bills which i am introducing would limit smsa banking to the washington d c metropolitan area the seventh bill would phase in modifications in the mcfadden act by allowing the deployment of eft terminals on a statewide basis and within natural market areas that cut across state lines it would permit full nationwide deployment of eft terminals within 5 years of the acts enactment j 4193 the final bill represents a major first step toward interstate banking by allowing banking institutions to cross state lines to acquire failing institutions whether they be banks or thrift institutions this would allow congress to examine the effects of interstate acquisitions through the failing bank experience"], [0.00021976232528686523, 0.9997802376747131, 1, "i am

osha and msha i offered this amendment last year to the labor department appropriation bill to provide needed regulatory relief to a variety of small businesses regulated presently byp the mine safety and health administration the purpose of my amendment was to deny funcl to msha to enforce its inflexible rules and regulations against certain industriesnamely the sand gravel crushed stone clay and colloidal phosphate industriesand thereby effect their transfer to the regulatory jurisdiction of osha let me stress that these industries were not to be left unregulated but would have been transferred at their request to osha which has certainly not been traditionally considered a patsy for the business community this amendment was subsequently adopted by the house and later added by the senate to the continuing resolution which would fund msha for fiscal year 1981 unfortunately during the fight over the congressional pay raise issue the amendment was lost along with a hundred other amendments and therefore did not become law decpite the overwhelming congressional supportboth in the house and in the senate i am today offering this amendment my amendment accomplishes the objectives of a bill currently cosponsored by 153 members of this body h r 1603 h r 1603 and other similar bills have languished in the health and safety subcommittee of the education and labor committee in the 96th congress and now in the 97th congress despite the great support this legislation has from many many members of congress congressmen marlenee and barnardthe principal sponsors of h r 1603 join me in urging your support for my amendment which is necessitated because of inaction by the committee having jurisdiction over h r 1603 two years ago the appropriations committee included language to deny msha funds to enforce complicated and in many instances irrelevant training requirements against these same industries i am pleased to note that prohibition has been continued in the proposal pending before the house today while our action on the training requirements has helped these industries there is still a desperate need for further congressional action my amendment makes it clear that we intend for osha to exercise jurisdiction over not only training of employees working in these industfies but have total responsibility for assuring a safe and healthful workplace the industries i am seeking to have transferred from msha to osha were made subject to the mine safety and health act by the amendments that the congress enacted in 1977 few of us recognized at that time that we were imposing sophisticated regulations designed for large and highly technical operations on small businesses which are located in virtually every community in our country the sand gravel and crushed stone industries the two largest industries affected by the amendment have an average number of employees per operation of 7 and 11 respectively the 1977 act has created continuing confrontations between these small businesses and the federal government this adversary relationship is to no ones benefit the transfer proposed in my amendment will restore a cooperative relationship between federal safety and health experts and the industries for the benefit of the workers the industries which would be transferred are not hazardous industries as their current safety records demonstrate and our acceptance therefore of this amendment will not provide any less safety and health protection to their employees some of my colleagues have suggested that the relief sought by these industries can be administratively accomplished by the mine safety and health administration to date the only significant administrative relief and possibly all that is available under the constraints of the act has come from the socalled compliance assistance visit program which allows msha inspectors to examine an oper ation that has been closed due to seasonal conditions and provide a citation and penalty free inspection prior to its reopening this limited and courtesy inspection is in sharp contrast to oshas program where an operator can request such an inspection at any time the problem is that the 1977 mine safety amendments act leaves the secretary of labor with very little flexibility in providing such relief thus underscoring the necessity for passage of my amendment it is regrettable that this serious regulatory problem which has been the subject of 21 days of hearings in the last congress must be addressed by means of an appropriations rider here today hopefully passage of my amendment will force full house consideration of legislationspecifically h r 1603in the near future to make permanent the changes my amendment would make here today for 1982 what is the actual effect of my amendment my amendment simply provides that the regulation of persons engaged in the surface mining of stone clay colloidal phosphate sand or gravel or with respect to any person engaged in construction activities on the surface area of any coal or other mine for safety purposes is transferred from msha to osha one question often asked about this amendment is does the msha amendment create a void in federal enforcement of safety and health standards over the surface mining of sand gravel stone clay colloidal phosphate as well as surface mining construction no osha under the occupational safety and health act has jurisdiction over these mines osha by its terms applies to all employers engaged in a business affecting comoctober 6 1 981 coi merce title 29 united states code section 652 5 thus osha legally covers mines which are also covered under the mine and safety and health act of 1977 additionally the drafters of osha realized that there was the potential problem of dual regulation thus they included in the act a deferral provision title 29 united states code section 653 b 1 it provides that where another federal agency exercises its own statutory authority to prescribe or enforce occupational safety or health standards then osha will not apply the legislative history of osha shows that the key factor triggering deferral is the exercise of another agencys statutory authority over them in three separate court cases three courts of appeals in our country which incidently are the courts next in authority to the unitedstates supreme court it was held that osha has jurisdiction when any other agency for example federal railroad administration msha et ceterais deprived of their jurisdiction the appropriations limitation has the effect of not providing funding for fiscal year 1982 for the exercise of mshas statutory authority over the surface mines described in the pending amendment thus there will be no exercise of statutory authority by msha the effect of this nonexercise under section 4 b 1 of oshatitle 29 united states code section 653 b 1 thus triggers by operation of existing law the responsibility of osha to assume enforcement activity over the described surface mines let me talk for a minute about the construction industry the construction industry was and still is specifically under osha jurisdiction for safety and health in fact in 1973 the construction industry initiated the call for a single standard separate and apart from the general industry osha standards so that the specific concerns of the construction industry could be adequately addressed this was done on the basis of a study which pointed out the shortcomings overlaps and voids between the general industry and the construction series of osha standards this step published in the federal register in 1979 is an example of longterm cooperation between the construction industry and osha and dedication to a mutual goalsafety with practicability unfortunately those construction contractors worfring on a suirface mine sites are considered to be miners and fall under mshas rules and regulations these socalled miners may be constructing a scale house a garage a new shop building or a structure to house a processing plant biut under the 1977 mine safety and health act they are considered miners ajid they are now subject to rules and regulations established for miners in addition to construction rufles and regulations found under osha let me give you a specific example a construction firm is planning on building a highway along the rightofway the contractor negotiates with a farmer or a rancher for the purchase of stone sand or gravel from a borrow pit on his property suddenly the farmer has become a mineowner and the contractor has become a mine operator this is the result of the msha ruling one day the contractor may greet an osha compliance officer performing an inspection of the site the next day he may find an msha enforcement officer at the gate neither operate under the same rules nor do they use the same or cven similar citations of penalties the contractor must take time from his schedule to accompany each of these federal officials during their inspections or have one of his supervisors do so in addition the contractor must also permit theemployee representative to join the entourageall at the contractors expense this situation is clearly absurd if we are truly serious about budget cuts and cutting down on truly excess federal expenditures then we should be saying you cannot send two inspectors to the same jobsite because there is no reason to pay two people to do one job there is an interagency agreement between the mine safety and health administration and the occupational safety and health administration which should reduce some of the existing problems however all such memorandums of understanding have a degree of fragility about them in that they commit only those signatory to the document nnd for an unspecified period furthir the agreement reclassifies as mining some operations which have traditionally been regarded as construction it suggests that whenever a construction contractor uses equipment to process or size material which he alone is responsible for excavating he must be covered by the requirements of msha compelling the contractor to provide 24 hours of superfluous training prior to 1 ounce of productive effort from his work force again this cost spiral is all too obvious one construction industry group surveyed its members to get some idea of the cost impact of msha on the construction industry the most conservative estimates of cost impact of msha on the nations highway program place the increase at 1 percent that 1 percent comes to 300 million per year this is only a part of the problem what about the building contractors who purchase their stone sand gravel aggregates cement concrete brick and so forth from suppliers members of the construction industry report that the~r material suppliers costs would increase anywhere from 5 to 10 percent these increases are completely unnecessary one member of the industry stated if the huge msha staff went to the underground mines to work at the mining problem instead of cluttering up the surface landscape with wasteful duplicative efforts we would all benefit now i would like to address those who say that nsha is doing a terrific job and it is changing its waysbecoming more and more receptive i say that msha has not turned over a new leaf the agency and its supporters are making inaccurate statements about its socalled new look that the situations brought to our attention by constituents with stone sand gravel and clay operations as well as surface construction activities have not been resolved conditions have not improved to any appreciable degree during the 96th congress hearings were held on this issue in the house and despite consistent overwhelming testimony from all elements of the noncoalmining industrythese hearings are slated to continue ad finitum with the committee in the house showing no inclination to take action toward resolving the injustices found not just in the administration of the actbut in the act itself certainly there is always need in every industry and service to continually improve safety and health conditions but the policeman approach of msha is not the answer it appears methods of aggravation are the product not constructive efforts to better safety it is now time to resolve this matterif at

was a press conference at the department of energy held by the secretary of the interior james watt and secretary of energy james edwards in order to put the results of that press conference into proper perspective i would like to remind everyone of the following first the citizens of this nation have seen the price of energy almost triple in less than 2 2 years second the united states faces a hydrocarbon fluid energy crisis for the next 20 to 30 years third while consumption of oil is expected to drop by 1990 the domestic production of oil is expected to drop at a faster rate increasing or at least maintaining our current rate of imported oil fourth the united states is enormously endowed with abundant hydrocarbon fluid resources since it is estimated that we have as much conventional oil left as we have already produced fifth at least 85 percent of this nations remaining oil is owned by the federal government sixth up to 60 percent of our remaining oil is estimated to be located in the ocs seventh the ocs oil and gas pro gram has returned to the general treasury in excess of 10 billion in the past 2 years and eighth last year the united states paid foreign countries around 80 billion for imported oil these are alarming and curious facts our energy problems center around domestic consumption of oil our low level of domestic production and therefore our inordirate dependence on foreign nations for such a high percentage of our oil needs this negatively impacts upon the value of the dollar abroad inflation and national security the question arises however if we are so abundant in energy resources why are we so dependent on foreign nations for such a high percentage of our needs the fact is that domestic production is stagnant and is expected to drop over the next 10 years unless there is a change in the existing policies of the federal government it has been the land use and leasing policies of past administrations that have been at the root of many of this nations energy problems this has been pointed out in numerous studies including three studies recently released by the gao it is this area that has been impacted by todays press conference secretary of the interior james watt proposed historic revisions in the policies and procedures for leasing ocs oil and gas resources the new 5 year ocs leasing schedule which incorporates the changes represents a crucial step in our efforts to help ourselves out of our energy problem some of the proposed changes announced today include but are not limited to the following first offering of the high potential ar eas in alaskan waters and the atlantic ocean at earlier dates than the old doi leasing schedule second focusing the leasing efforts on areas of highest potential third conducting areawide eiss and resources evaluations fourth areawide lease offerings and fifth 42 lease sales over the next 5 years instead of 36 this country lags behind the other nations with active ocs programs in spite of the fact that we were the leader in ocs drilling and are currently the leader in ocs safety and technology the united states currently only gets 9 3 percent of its domestic oil and about 21 percent of its domestic gas production from its ocs over 21 percent of total world oil production comes from the ocs in other words in spite of enormous hydrocarbon potential a safety record that is the envy of the world and the supplies and capital to do the job the united states is not only lagging behind the rest of the world in ocs production but is falling further behind if the policies that have been announced today are adopted these trends can be reversed as was pointed out in an editorial by william raspberry in the washington post last year it is about time

association of realtors urges your vote tomorrow for the budget resolution to be offered by representative latta because it reduces the fiscal year 1983 deficit below 100 billion and it contains a binding reconciliation date which will force the process towards a balanced budget in future years we believe that passage of a federal budget reducing the deficit below 100 billion in 1983 is a necessary step oward the real goal of interest rates declining to normal levels without this action government spending will continue to increase faster than peoples income and federal deficit borrowing will consume virtually the entire savings pool of the american people congress must write a budget that will regain control over the deficit and provide impetus necessary to restore the health of the many insensitive segments of the nation which have been devastated by unaffordable interest rates we are hopeful that this action will result in a decline in interest rates sufficient to generate economy recovery we are not happy with the high deficits in the out years forecast for the latta resolution let me interject that i am not either we have cut better than 80 billion out of the 1983 deficit and we are cutting more out of the future year deficits but we will have an opportunity in future years to take further cuts continuing the letter in recent months we have urged on the

requiring an investigation by the comptroller general into competitive bidding practices with respect to highway and mass transit construction in this country our sole reason for dropping this provision is that it has proven to be unnecessary this is because since the time our highway legislation was first developed this past spring the study has been requested and is now under way the deletion has been discussed by both the house and senate sides with full agreement that whether initiated by statute or otherwise this investigation is urgently needed has the support of both the

assure that enhancement of highway safety result from the carrying out of any project for the resurfacing restoring or rehabilitation of any highway tc iwntent of this provision morever is to provide some flexibility to the states in the degree of safety improvement which reasonably can be required in the circumstances of a given project it is explicitly not the intent of the committee for example that new construction standards necessarily be applied in every case during the discussions which led to the negotiation of this bill by both house and senate co ttees it was agreed that this would be

going to read a statement because this procedure is technical important and it may be repeated i do not want to make any mistakes when i describe the parliamentary processes i would like to add a little bit to that statement by saying that quite clearly for a variety of reasonsand i am not going to try to fix any blame at this pointthe processes of the house are in considerable disarray the whole legislative process is going to be enormously difficult in this coming year there are many causes some of them are problems of timing between the legislative committees and the appropriations committee some of them are problems of the budget act caused by i guess every political entity in this town from the house of representatives and the senate to and including the executive but we are going to have a very difficult task in the house of representatives this year bringing order out of legislative chaos the rules committee is going to try to do what it can to be helpful i am sure that all of the other committees will do the same but it is going to get technical and difficult and complicated and sudden because we will be dealing with nothing but emergencies and since this illustrates a part of that problem i intend to read the remainder of my statement house resolution 355 is a somewhat unusual rule essentially it provides waivers of section 311 a of the budget act so that the house might consider house joint resolution 389 an urgent supplemental appropriation for the commodity credit corporation and house joint resolution 391 an urgent supplemental appropriation for unemployment compensation section 311 a of the budget act prohibits the consideration of any bill resolution amendment or conference report providing additionail new budget or spending authority that would result in the breach of the ceiling of total new budget authority or total budget outlays set forth in the most recently agreed to concurrent resolution on the budget for the current fiscal year yesterday the committee on the budget as required by section 311 b of the budget act certified to the speaker the current level of spending these current level estimates indicate that there is some 4 4 billion in budget authority under the ceiling set forth in senate concurrent resolution 50 the second budget resolution agreed to by the house on december 10 1981 outlays are some 42 8 billion in excess of the ceiling already consequently the urgent supplemental appropriation bills for the commodity credit corporation and the employment services portion of the unemployment compensation bill would breech the ceilings set forth in the second budget resolution without the waivers the appropriation bills would be subject to a point of order and the house could be prevented from considering these critical matters the rule waives section 311 a of the budget act against the initial consideration of the two joint resolutions by the house it would further provide for a waiver of the same section of the budget act against consideration of any conference report on either of the resolutions provided that the conference report figures do not exceed the budget authority of or outlays resulting from the joint resolutions as they were reported from the house committee on appropriations in other words to expedite consideration of these matters the rules committee proposes to grant waivers to the conference reports in advance but only so long as the figures in the bills are not increased beyond the levels as reported from committee if those levels are exceeded the waivers are inapplicable thus requiring the rules committee to again review the matter the committee on rules views waivers of section 311 a of the budget act as a very serious distortion of the budget process and does not intend to grant any type of blanket waiver each request for a waiver of section 311 of the budget act will be reviewed very carefully and in only the most critical of circumstances will such waivers be recommended as i stated earlier the rule provides only for waivers of the budget act if my colleagues will permit me however i will quickly review the parliamentary situation for consideration of these two urgent supplemental appropriations supplemental appropriations for a single item or departme it are not privileged matters under the rules of the house on february 4 chairman whirrn asked for and received the unanimous consent of the house that four urgent supplemental appropriations bills be considered on february 5 or any day thereafter mr whirrens request specified that house joint resolution 389 and house joint resolution 391 be considered in the house thereby precluding any amendment to the bills except a motion to recommit with instructions which of course must be germane the bills would be considered in the house under the hour rule with the floor manager controlling the time and yielding only for purposes of debate to put it simply there will be an hours debate on each of the lint resolutions at the end of which a motion to recommit either with or without instructions would be in order and then an up or down vote on the proposition the rule does not specify the procedure but simply provides the waivers so that the process may take place when the unanimousconsent request was made to consider the bills it was not clear that the budget waivers were necessary after definite confirmation of the necessity of the budget waivers the rules committee met in emergency session yesterday to consider rules on the four supplemental appropriation bills the committees judgment was that three of the matters were sufficiently urgent to warrant waivers the two most pressing matters concerning unemployment ii1262 compensation and the commodity credit corporation were granted waivers by one rule a separate rule on fuel assistance was recommended and will be brought up later today no motion to grant a rule on the fourth supplemental was made house joint resolution 389 provides 5 billion in new budget authority for the commodity credit corporation to restore borrowing authority which will be exhausted in

the united states code under that section the united states has the right and duty to bring suits for money damages against third parties on behalf of indian tribes and individuals for claims arising out of contracts or torts the kinds of claims involved include infringement of indian water rights degradation of fishing rights and a variety of nonpublic trespasses the law requires that the united states bring these socalled 2 415 claims by december 31 of this year house joint resolution 553 was introduced in part because of concern that the departments of justice and interior will not have fulfilled their responsibilities with respect to these claims by the time the statute expires on september 23 the interior committee held a hearing on the resolution and on the departments efforts with respect to the claims i can say that the testimony established a clear need for action to insure that the united states fulfills its legal obligations to indians and protects the federal treasury from unnecessary liability the record shows that when congress in 1966 enacted the 6year statute of limitations for the united states to bring contract or tort claims against american citizens it did so without any intent to affect the unitedstates obligation to bring such claims on behalf of indians when it became apparent that the united states faced potentially huge liability for breach of trust if it failed to act on the indian claims congress extended the statute to give the departments of the interior and justice time to identify research evaluate and file any such valid claims in the language of the last extension congress also included a requirement that the departments submit by june 1981 legislation to resolve those claims not well suited to resolution by litigation over the past 10 years and at a cost of over 20 million the departments have identified over 17 000 legally valid claims however the department of justice has determined that less than 1 000 of these claims are candidates for litigation that several thousand should not be litigated and that several thousand others should be resolved by legislation despite having identified a number of claims as condidates for legislative solution the departments did not submit any legislation to congress until just this past month much too late for proper consideration and passage moreover the legisltion submitted deals only with a fraction of those claims which the departments indicated would most appropriately be resolved by legislation as reported by the interior committee house joint resolution 553 would provide a mechansim for resolving these indian damage claims with finality and in a manner that is fair to the claimants in short the legislation provides that a list of all identified claims with arguable legal merit be compiled within 360 days any and all claims not listed would be forever barred the listed claims would be dealt with in the following manner for those claims the departments determine should be resolved by legislation the statute of limitations would run 3 years from the date legislation is submitted to congress for those claims the departments determine should be neither legislated nor litigated the statute would run 1 year from the date that notice is provided to the tribes or individuals advising them of the departments decisions and the reasons for them the remaining claims would be litigated house joint resolution 553 should be enacted for a variety of reasons among them the following first it precludes the need for the filing before december 31 of hundreds of protective lawsuits this means that thousands of potential defendants will be spared being joined in litigation which otherwise might be avoided by negotiation or legislation second house joint resolution 553 insures that potential indian claimants are provided due process in particular it would insure that indians receive more than just a few weeks notice from their trustee of the trustees decision not to bring litigation on their behalf after years of consideration of these cases the departments have recently been publishing notices of potential actions in newspapers this gives the indians little time to learn more about their potential claims and whether they want to pursue them on their own simple fairness mandates an extension in these cases third house joint resolution 553 insures that congress will have sufficient time to consider legislative solutions to claims which the departments believe can best be resolved by legislation fouth and perhaps most important to those of us concerned about federal deficits house joint resolution 553 reduces the prospect of substantial liability to the unitedstates treasury as a result of successful breach of trust suits brought psinst the united states for failure to pursue identified claims such liability has been repeatedly cited in the past as reason for extending the statute it is still an excellent reason for doing so i am pleased to state that the administration does not oppose enactment of this legislation that it is considered workable and all things considered desirable for the record i recognize that some within the administration disagree with language in the committees report concerning decisions respecting these indian claims and the bases for them nevertheless we share

within a few months of that time if not in 1982 we must then face the critical issues of making some permanent solution to the social security program that is our challenge and our responsibility and

be made evident again and again as the budiet comes out in january the social security trustees report comes out in early summer the midsession review arrives and as press reports appear throughout the year on meetings of the statutory advisory council and or the presidents task force all the estimates show the trust funds even with interfund borrowing going steadily downward all three funds together can make it as far as 1986 or 1987 if we look through rosecolored glasses and what we see actually comes true in every single year in every single detail but all three funds could also go under as early as late our chances of hitting any projections that have been made are nil we may be above or below but we will not be on the mark as late as 1979 we were projecting 7 4 percent cpi and 0 6 percent real wage growth for last year last year we had 13 5 percent n9t 7 4 percent cpi and we had minus 5 percent not plus 0 6 percent real wage growth the problem which the new medicare numbers showed us is while we are using projections which we know will not be exactly on the mark we have no room for error putting aside projections we do know that actually to go broke in 1984 we need only have minus 1percent real wage growthwhich we now have or we need have 12percent inflation and inflation the last 4 months has averaged 11 1 percent or we need medicare expenditures rising at 23 percent and for 1980 they did rise at 21 4 percent or we can have any combination of these at lower numbers and now we must factor in higher levels of unemployment which will sharply lower revenues into the funds my friends if we cannot take our warning from those simple facts then we just are not looking after the social security program we came close recently in the committee to taking steps to address the longterm problem in social security and i am encouraged that this congresss will address this problem f recognize that the process of solving the real problems in social security has been delayed 1 would hope however that we will use the short respite here to continue working on fuller solutions to the problems facing the social security program in one national poll taken in iseptember 82 percent said they felt it necessary for congress to revise the financing of social security in the next year or so and 77 percent said they felt it necessary for congress to revise the benefits in the next year or so i will continue to propose that we break out of this fearful standoff and recognize that it is the social security program itselfnot any of us that the people really care about we must do right by that program we must make it sound and that is whit i will continue to try to do as r know will my colleagues on both sides of the aisle t"], [0.0032768845558166504,

such time as i may consume no one could be against full employment just like no one could be against motherhood no one could be against honesty no one could be against truth no one could be against children education or anything else but in 4 000 years of recorded history we have never had an economy that was predicated on the free enterprise system that had full employment oh we have had some dictatorships that had full employment we have an economy in the peoples republic of china that has full employment because everyone works for the government no one can get fired no one is challenged no onb is evaluated economically everybody gets so much a month and that is that so to stand here today and to suggest that i am not for full employment would be ridiculous everyone is for it just like everyone is for free trade motherhood and honesty but the economic realities are such that the only way we can put people to work in a productive free enterprise economy is to let business make those jobs on a longterm basis we have been pursuing the idea that government can provide jobs for 15 years and let me tell you what has happened over those 15 years over those 15 years the share of our economy controlled by the government state federal and local has crept up from about 35 percent to almost 45 percent that is the private sector has left only 55 or 56 or 57 cents out of each dollar to provide the savings to provide the capital to provide everything else that you need to provide jobs now to see if this type of economy works our evaluation should 1e a fairly objectively approached evaluation we could simply go round and look at other economies throughout the world to see if there is a viable and healthy economy controlled by government we could define that by simply saying an economy where the real increase in gross national product each year is say 3 percent is viable and healthy if in any of these economies we had government spending of more than 40 percent of the gross national product we could say fine then we can safely pursue the same end we can spend 24 percent of the economy at the federal level and let the state and local governments spend at 19 or 20 percent and everything will work out fine you see because country x is doing it but i challenge any of my colleagues supporting any of the three budgets labeled the bipartisan coalition budget the obey budget or the jones budget to point out to me an economy a healthy economy on this planet whcre government is controlling that much of the economy they are simply not there over the last 15 years we built a system that is incredible we built a military retirement system that now has 30 retired generals drawing more in retirement pay than the chief of staff of the unitedstates army and government retirees drawing more than their working counter parts all at the expense of the taxpayer let us examine the history of another government program supplementary fuel assistance a noble end back in 1977 when we enacted it the first time it was 300 million a oneshot appropriation because fuel oil prices went from 60 cents to 1 a gallon in 1977 well here we are five years later and what do we have now the appropriation is 1 8 billion which includes airconditioning because obviously we had to do something for the sun belt states to get them to continue to vote for this and we have an increased appropriation this year but what is economic reality economic reality is that the price of fuel oil is down 20 or 25 percent from a year ago yet we appropriate more money it has been said that reaganomics has not worked reaganomics has not even started reaganomic was more than offset that miniscule tax cut that working americans got last october was more than offset by the increase in their social security taxes which occurred january 1 so our only hope is to get a part of it in july of this year a 10percent acrosstheboard tax cut for every working american we ought to be concerned about those working americans out there because they are the people that have got to provide all that money we spend so freely up here now unfortunately we are entering this budget debate with two very emotional factors influencing our thinking one is unemployment and my heart goes out to those who are unemployed because they are suffering more than their share of the burden i submit that the people who are suffering the most are those unemployed who are involved in those industries where savings are most important and i refer to homebuilding and i refer to the automobile industry where in order to buy a home or a car someone must have saved the money so that other people can borrow it the other factor is the high interest rates dragging down the economy well i submit to the members that both of those are symptoms they are not the disease the disease is government it is government that grows year by year to where it takes over more and more of the productive wealth of this country the wealth that is produced by millions of american men and women just think about the last 5 years the gross national product of this country that which we all produce added together the total wealth produced in this country in the last 5 years has increased a little over 15 percent but what has government spending done in the last 5 years it has increased more than 60 percent government is growing four times as fast as the income of american men and women now the critical thing as we begin this budget debate is not the deficit in the short run sure in the long run it may be important it may be painful but the important thing is how we are going to cure this problem of how much of the economy we can take over the only way to cure that is by stopping our growth in spending to the growth of the economy this does not entail cutting anyone this entails simply being content to level benefits to say hey we have not got the money so we cannot give you an increase next year because if we continue to provide thdse increases that retiree who is now making more than his counterpart who is working will further increase his benefits and his share we have to have savings in this country we cannot save less than 4 percent our income each year and have a free enterprise economy it has not worked it is not going to work but the only way the american working people can save is to have less taken away from them by the government yet the spending proposals that are proposed in three of these budgets of 770 billion simply proceed on the assumption that we can take more from the american people in the way of taxes and deficits which will further impair their ability to save the fact is that the government under john fitzgerald kennedy was not spending the percentage of the gross national product than it is under president reagan why the government back then was spending only 18 percent of our economy now government is spending 24 percent of our economy can reaganomics possibly work with the government taking over the economy i seriously question it yet do we address the question of spending in three of these budgets no we simply promote an increase in government spending that once again exceeds the increase in the economy as a whole i do not believe like my colleague from california that government alone and i believe that is a direct quotecan provide employment i believe that this system grew great under an economic system that will have a certain amount of unemployment at all times as economic dislocations occur but it has given america the greatest standard of living from a material standpoint that this planet has ever known because it acknowledges that there are risks and there are rewards more control more manipulation of the monetary policy of this country is not what is in order monetary policy is a reflection of the sickness and the sickness is the share of this economy government is taking and we have got to address that more government spending has not worked as an economic system if it had worked this economy ought to be going great because now government is spending almost 45 percent of the total economy this ought to be theoretically a perfect economy under the humphreyhawkins full employment bill concept we ought to be just running away with jobs because year after year government spending as a percentage of gross national product has gone up and up and up it has not worked and unless the congress is prepared to address seriously and at some political risk the real question in this country how much of its economy can we take over then there is little chance that this budget will ever be balanced because as the economy grinds down due to overwhelming burdens of taxation and government spending there will not be any opportunity to restore it because the tax base simply will not be there we have got to control spending not increase taxes"], [0.004282087087631226,
