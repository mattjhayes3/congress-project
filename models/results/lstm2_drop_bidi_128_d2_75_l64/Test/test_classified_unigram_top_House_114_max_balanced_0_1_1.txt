but consider puerto rico their home we are here today because our fellow americans are suffering and it is our constitutional responsibility to help them they are suffering from the effects of a debt crisis more than a decade in the making a devastating combination of mismanagement unfair federal policies opportunistic hedge funds and desperate budget cuts have destroyed the economy on the island the monstrous burden of puerto ricos 70 billion debt is swallowing the funds needed to provide health care education transportation and public safety for the commonwealths families almost 100 000 people have left the commonwealth last year to look for better economic opportunities which only makes the situation on the island worse about 80 percent of children in puerto rico live in highpoverty areas compared to about 11 percent of children on the mainland the islands poverty rate is about 44 percent and unemployment is 13 percent if congress fails to act the island and its people face another decade of further economic and social collapse our fellow citizens of puerto rico should not have to endure this coming humanitarian crisis our colleague nydia velazquez has described the status quo as a recipe to lose an entire generation to forced migration to the mainland after 6 months of difficult bipartisan negotiations four hearings and a series of draft bills we are here today to consider h r 5278 h r 5278 will provide the tools necessary to get the economy of puerto rico on a more stable footing and allow the commonwealth to regain access to credit markets the bill would allow restructuring of all outstanding debt without favoring any particular creditor require transparent audits combined with annual fiscal plans and budgets and temporarily pause the ongoing flurry of litigation to allow the oversight board to begin its work and create a space for voluntary negotiations as i have said throughout this process this is not a bill that i or democrats would have written the oversight board is too powerful and is yet another infringement of the sovereignty of the people of puerto rico and they have a right to find it offensive the provisions undermining minimum wage and overtime rules dont belong in the bill what is worse they threaten the effectiveness of the overall legislation provisions that should be includedlike full pension protections an earned income tax credit equal funding for medicaid and a zika responseare missing but the reality is that this is the only bill that would attract enough support from my colleagues across the aisle to pass in a congress which they control there is no other avenue available to address the crisis this compromise is the bill we can and should pass when measured against a perfect bill this legislation is inadequate when measured against the worsening crisis in puerto rico this legislation is vitally necessary i urge my colleagues to support h r i would like to take a moment to clarify for the record a number of inaccurate and misleading statements in the committee report on h r 5278 it appears that the committee report on h r 5278 was prepared based on earlier nonpublic drafts of the billnot the version considered by the committee several references plainly do not reflect the current language in h r 5278 as introduced or as voted on by the house committee on natural resources during its markup hearing the following statement on page 40 of the committee report oversimplifies a complex problem facing puerto rico and in my view mischaracterizes the nature of the territory governments action it says puerto ricos local politicians have accelerated the crisis on the island through the passage of harmful legislation including the imposition of a moratorium on the payment of debt puerto ricos passage of a moratorium law was a local response to attempt to address its fiscal and debt emergency in the absence of necessary congressional action it is misleading and unreasonable to characterize the passage of a local moratorium law as accelerating the crisis the committee reports summary of section 101 provides that mportantly fiscal plans ensure the protection of the lawful priorities and liens as guaranteed by the territorial constitution and applicable laws and prevent unlawful interdebtor transfers of funds this interpretation is misleading and does not reflect the language of the bill or the evolution of the language throughout the legislative process section 201 b 1 n provides that a fiscal plan certified by the oversight board must respect the relative lawful priorities or lawful liens under territory laws not ensure the protection of such priorities or liens the verb respect was specifically chosen by the drafters of the bill and carefully considered by the committee for instance at the committee markup representative fleming twice offered amendments that would have changed the respect language in section 201 b 1 n to comply with the committee twice rejected those amendmentsthe first time on a voice vote and the second time on a roll call vote 16 yeas to 23 nays the committee recognized that the verb comply with was unduly restrictive and that the oversight board needed the flexibility afforded by the verb respect which is more openended for that reason it is inaccurate for the committee report to statecontrary to the current legislative text and the committees intentthat fiscal plans ensure the protection of lawful priorities and liens in addition the summary of section 201 explains that hile this language seeks to provide an adequate level of funding for pension systems it does not allow for pensions to be unduly favored over other indebtedness in a restructuring but section 201 b 1 c has nothing to do with relative priorities among various creditors the provision requires the board to provide for adequate funding of pensions which relates to the fiscal plan and the manner by which annual budgets comply with the fiscal plan of course any restructuring under title ill must be consistent with the fiscal plan under section 314 of the bill but the committee report is inaccurate in suggesting that this provision relates to relative priorities the following statement on page 48 summarizing section 303 is missing a critical adjective nor may an executive order divert funds from one instrumentality to another or to the territory certain executive orders that divert funds from one territorial instrumentality to another or to the territory may be lawful under applicable territory laws the only types of executive orders that are preempted by section 303 3 of this act are unlawful executive orders as the text of section 303 3 makes abundantly clear for instance if an executive order is permitted by the territorys constitution or its laws it is not an unlawful executive order and is not preempted by section 303 the drafters intended section 303 3 to make clear that promesa preempts and renders void any executive orders issued beyond the scope of what would have been authorized by its local laws lawful exercises of executive authority are unaffected in summarizing section 314 on page 50 the report states y incorporating consistency with the fiscal plan into the requirements of confirmation of a plan of adjustment the committee has ensured lawful priorities and liens as provided for by the territorys constitution laws and agreements will be respected in any debt restructuring that occurs this summary suffers from the same problem that the summary of the provisions of section 201 suffered it refers to language that has never existed in a public version of the bill rather it reflects stafflevel draft text that was ultimately rejected section 201 clarifies that fiscal plans must respect lawful priorities and lawful liens the committee carefully considered this language and twice rejected amendments proposed to change it to comply with such priorities and liens the summary of section 407 on page 52 explains that his section grants creditors the right to sue upon the conclusion of the stay if the government of puerto rico transfers property between instrumentalities during the tenure of the oversight board in violation of any agreement or applicable law that a creditor has or would have a pledge of security interest in or lien on such property section 407 as drafted and passed through committee establishes a federal remedy for puerto ricos creditors in certain circumstances but the addition of the language or would have in the committee report again reflects stafflevel text that was not ultimately included in the version approved by the committee the current text provides a cause of action for creditors thatat the time of the alleged unlawful transferin fact have a pledge of security interest in or lien on the transferred property contrary to the suggestion of the committee report the provision does not permit such a cause of action if the plaintiff only would have in some future circumstance such an interest indeed the fact that the addition of words like or would have were discussed but not ultimately included in the text is strong evidence that congress did not intend for such prospective contingent rights to be within the scope of this provision it would have been extraordinary to provide certain creditors an argument that federal law establishes for them a property interest where no such property interest existed under the terms of the agreements they negotiated the committee rightly declined to do so i reserve the balance of my

understand how difficult it is to pass legislation but it is sometimes often even harder to get the regulations written correctly sometimes you dont recognize the legislation that passed when they are done with it rather than following the intent of the law we have seen interest groups using the regulatory process to interpret the law in their best interests this should not be the case h r 185 will create a more streamlined transparent and accountable regulatory process and give the american people a stronger voice in agency decisionmaking specifically the bill requires agencies to choose the lowest cost rulemaking alternative streamlines administrative hearings to provide for more stakeholder input and provides for more judicial review of new agency regulations similar legislation received bipartisan support in the house in previous congresses and i urge my colleagues to again support these commonsense reforms"], [0.9987808502046391, 0.0012191497953608632, 1, "i come to the floor today as the founder and cochair of the congressional ethiopian american caucus this caucus was established to give a legislative voice to the specific concerns of the ethiopian american community founded in 2001 the caucus is comprised of members who appreciate the critical relationship between ethiopia and the unitedstates and value the contributions of ethiopian americans to our nation congressman john garamendi and i cochair this caucus of nearly 20 members of congress president obamas upcoming visit to ethiopia on july 27 which is next monday will be the very first visit to this nation of 97 million people by a sitting american president ethiopia has africas second largest population and is a nation with a rich independent cultural history and by the way ethiopia is the only african country in that continent that has not ever been colonized it is a country of growing economic humanitarian and strategic importance to the united states accompanying these opportunities are many challenges that face ethiopia today situated at the center of the horn of africa ethiopia is located in an unstable region making it a key ally of the united states in combating radical extremists in the region ethiopia has a checkered humanitarian record and the government must learn to embrace the voices of political dissent and promote basic human and civil rights i believe that president obamas upcoming trip to ethiopia provides a unique opportunity to promote respect for freedom of speech and press in addition to supporting economic health food security and humanitarian development in ethiopia the united states must aggressively support and encourage ethiopia to embrace democracy and its hallmarks free speech and a free and independent media with a base of young entrepreneurs a large labor force and a wealth of natural resources ethiopia has quickly become an important center of industry agriculture and technology we must explore avenues for unitedstates investment and partnerships with ethiopia to further this growing economic partnership here at home ethiopians in the unitedstates provide us with a large pool of talent education and experience if we are to draw lessons from unitedstates relations with china vietnam and india we can see that engagement is an important tool in bringing about sustainable change the unitedstates and ethiopian governments must work closely to engage private business and ethiopians in the diaspora if we have learned anything about ethiopia and ethiopians it is to never discount the capacity for genius and resolve in the interest of their country and fellow countrymen i visited ethiopia in 2005 and i left the country a changed man the ethiopian diasporas generosity and forward vision continue to inspire me as a person and as a policymaker numbering over a quarter of a million people across this country the vibrant and fastgrowing ethiopian american community greatly contributes to the richness of american culture and strengthens our economy to help make our nation competitive in the 21st century as i traveled around ethiopia and met people from all walks of life who are bound by one truth to control their own destiny i was inspired more than ever to strengthening a longestablished relationship between ethiopia and the unitedstates and become an effective voice to encourage lasting democratic humanitarian and security improvements and partnerships with our friend in the horn of africa as president obama prepares for his upcoming trip to africa in the coming days many human rights groups are criticizing his visit to ethiopia as one that props up and supports a repressive regime a government that has been censoring and intimidating the media and even imprisoning journalists who spoke out against the ruling ethiopian party since 2014 six privately owned media outlets have shut down due to government harassment of over two dozen journalists and bloggers who have faced criminal charges and at least 30 others have fled the country to avoid arrest more journalists are in jail in ethiopia than anywhere else in africa this crackdown and use of antiterrorism legislation to stifle political dissent in ethiopia is absolutely unacceptable the state department has publicly and privately expressed concerns about ethiopian restrictions on political and human rights these issues present complicated diplomatic engagement and security cooperation scenarios stability security and economic development are sustainable only with the development of democratic values and ethiopia has a long road ahead to fully achieve these goals but with our support and the support of the ethiopian caucus we can help them move closer to those ideals over the past month in the runup to president obamas visit the ethiopian government has released half a dozen journalists and bloggers who were being held on dubious charges while this is a positive step this does not forgive or cause us to overlook the restrictive and undemocratic pressures on the media in ethiopia the governments recent actions of good faith are not an achievement but rather they represent the first step in a long road towards the government demonstrating it can embrace a free and open democracy with a vibrant and free press i believe the unitedstates can be most effective at championing human rights and democratic institutions in ethiopia through engagement the unitedstates must build on obamas historic visit and work harder to encourage positive change as a partner we can have frank conversations with the government and champion human rights and democratic principles ethiopia is a young country in terms of democracy and over time we can help shape their maturing political system in a way that provides real choices for the people the ethiopian government needs to continue to uphold democratic principles and engagement while at the same time reconciling the need for security with the increasing opportunities to engage talented ethiopians 2045 i stand with amnesty international and call for the immediate and unconditional release of any and all remaining journalists and bloggers who remain in prison based on politically motivated convictions on terrorism charges as a friend to the people of ethiopia it is our responsibility to encourage president desalegns government to stick to this reform as the unitedstates pursues closer economic and strategic relationships with ethiopia we must remain adamant that improvements to human rights and democratic institutions are a requirement to a successful partnership ethiopia is a valuable partner in a critical region from peacekeeping to fighting alshabaab to pursuing peace in south sudan in recent years the number of attacks performed by extremists across the horn of africa has been increasing ethiopia has been a vital partner and ally to confront extremism in the region unitedstates national security is intertwined with countries like ethiopia that are on the frontline of fighting terrorism the threat posed to african countries posed by terrorism requires the support of the united states government in helping build stability that will allow democratic institutions to grow and flourish ethiopia has historically been a key contributor to united nations and african union peacekeeping missions and as the seat of the african union has taken an active role in trying to bring peace to the region and the continent to this end ethiopia gets nearly 800 million a year in unitedstates military assistance to fight the somali islamic group alshabaab a group that is responsible for numerous attacks across the region as we invest hundreds of millions to combat this brutal extremist group we must remember that military strength alone will not defeat extremism the only lasting solution is a comprehensive one that addresses the political and economic concerns of the region one in which the rights of all religious and cultural groups are respected i encourage president obama to work with the ethiopian kenyan and somali governments to find ways to address the underlying social and economic issues that are resulting in fertile grounds for extremist movements like alshabaab ethiopia has undergone amazingly rapid economic growth in recent years and has made significant progress toward its millennium development goals the unitedstates must continue to support ethiopias development goals and increase opportunities for unitedstates businesses in the region ethiopia has the fifth fastest growing economy of the 188 international monetary fund member countries the ethiopian economy has enjoyed strong economic growth with average gdp growth over 10 percent in the past decade double the average for subsaharan africa this growth has largely been a result of governmentled development policies with an emphasis on public investment commercialization of agriculture and nonfarm private sector development as part of this growth ethiopia has prioritized infrastructure development ethiopia is investing heavily in physical infrastructure as part of its development strategy this includes the development and upgrading of the countrys power transport and telecommunications facilities with a brandnew railway network and the construction of a number of hydroelectric power stations these investments will allow the country to continue to export power to neighboring countries ethiopia has also proven to be a partner in renewable energy development their hydro programs are helping move ethiopia to become a climateresilient economy by 2025 ethiopia has the second highest hydropowergenerating capacity in africa and the continents biggest wind farm these renewable resources have enabled ethiopia to export electricity to kenya djibouti and sudan despite having limited hydrocarbon resources this incredible growth has not gone unnoticed by the rest of the world and numerous developed nations including china and india are investing heavily in ethiopia india is the biggest investor in land in ethiopia with indian companies accounting for almost 70 percent of the land acquired by foreigners the unitedstates government needs to do more to encourage american companies to invest in ethiopia with the continents second largest population ethiopia is a huge market for american companies and products selfimposed congressional limitations on programs like opic the overseas private investment corporations are severely hindering unitedstates investment into this economy selfimposed congressional limitations are severely hindering unitedstates investment in this economy we have to remember that according to figures from the world bank and ernst young foreign direct investment into ethiopia has risen more than tenfold in 7 years from 108 million in 2008 to 1 2 billion in 2014 with 1 5 billion projected for 2015 a significant portion of this investment growth is represented by chinese investment in ethiopia ramping up this includes a new 200 million african union headquarters financed by china a 300 million contract to expand the addis ababa airport and construction of a reported 2 billion factory for chinas huajian corporation which will employ 30 000 ethiopians it is critical that the unitedstates government mobilizes private sector capital to address these development challenges or other countries will despite all this economic growth ethiopia has significant challenges ethiopias per capita gdp of 505 is one of the worlds lowest though per capita gdp is on the rise7 2 percent in 2014it is still one of the poorest countries in the world ranking 173 out of 187 countries on the human development index although ethiopia is outperforming many subsaharan countries in poverty reduction widespread malnutrition continues to haunt the nation estimates suggest that the country loses around 16 5 percent of its gdp each year to the longterm effects of child malnutrition dependency on agriculturecoffee in particularleaves the large rural population vulnerable to droughts natural disasters and other economic shocks recent periods of rapid inflationary pressures and large refugee inflows from eritrea and south sudan further aggravate these trends this has led to food prices rising 100 percent in 2011 ethiopia still relies heavily on aid to achieve its development goals ethiopia receives the most usaid assistance of any subsaharan african country ranked seventh worldwide even among other donors ethiopia remains the single largest recipient of official development assistance in subsaharan africa so ethiopia has made progress towards reaching most of the millennium development goals together with government action and the largest social protection scheme in the region ethiopia has seen remarkable progress towards its development targets apart from the overall decline in povertyreduced by 33 percent since 2000positive gains have been made in terms of education health and reducing the prevalence of hiv aids and fistula usaid development funds and programs are having a massive impact in ethiopia in everything from nutrition sustainability food stability health and education unitedstates businesses and entrepreneurs also have a strong role to play in ethiopia organizations like the unitedstates africa diaspora business council focus on tapping into the large entrepreneurial ethiopian and african diaspora populations in the unitedstates they help provide information build capacity and developmental infrastructure to assist american companies to build business footprints in ethiopia and develop trade between the unitedstates and africa i would like to particularly highlight the budding benefit corporations that are producing a positive impact on society and the environment as well as making a profit ethiopian diasporaowned company blessed coffee the nations second benefit corporation is established as a socially responsible business focusing on trade in coffee growing regions as well as in communities in the unitedstates where coffee is sold a symbiotic relationship will be one that not only benefits the american consumer but also the farmers in ethiopia and the development of the region on a side note i am not sure that it is well known but according to dna analysis all coffee came from ethiopia so we can thank them for that i was proud to help reauthorize the african growth and opportunity act last month which paves the way for continued investment in ethiopia and africa through preferential dutyfree treatment to unitedstates imports of certain products this important bill incentivizes american companies to invest in industry and development programs in africa and ethiopia that provide products to the united states and jobs to the region as the representative from silicon valley i take special note of the large opportunities in high technology and internet fields with just over 2 percent internet penetration and 27 percent cellular phone subscriptions ethiopia has one of the lowest rates of internet and mobile phone penetration in the world persistent state interventions including nationwide internet filtering public sector monopoly over the telecom sector and a relatively closed economy have suppressed the growth of economic freedom over the past 5 years all of this points to an opportunity for the unitedstates government and companies to help ethiopia modernize and open its markets to american tech companies in closing let me just say that ethiopia is a nation of growing importance and opportunity for the united states a reality that is highlighted by president obamas visit next week as one of the poorest countries yet with one of the fastest growing economies and largest population in africa ethiopia still represents enormous untapped potential for economic growth ethiopia is a country where american companies can invest and bring jobs and development it is critical that the unitedstates government seizes this opportunity for investment and mobilizes private sector capital to address the development challenges ethiopia faces additionally the unitedstates has an opportunity to help ethiopia address the numerous humanitarian challenges it faces the administrations feed the future initiative supports ethiopias food security strategy to reduce hunger improve nutrition and promote broadbased economic growth ethiopia still has many serious unmet development needs in sectors like smallbusiness lending private education health care and access to electricity healthy bilateral aid programs through usaid and development programs like power africa can help make significant improvements into the health and food security of millions of people in ethiopia notwithstanding ethiopias enormous development needs we must secure ties within the country to reinforce its constructive collaboration with the unitedstates on regional security issues in the horn of africa ethiopias ongoing strategic partnership with the united states in combating alshabaab and defeating extremism in the horn of africa is an opportunity for the united states to change the narrative in the region away from focusing solely on military solutions and instead focusing on a comprehensive approach that addresses the underlying social economic and political causes that fuel extremist groups stability security and economic development are sustainable only with the development of democratic values ethiopia is a young democracy where human rights and freedom of speech are not respected by the ruling government the united states must take a strong position of standing with democratic institutions such as free speech and open fair transparent elections the unitedstates must build on obamas historic visit and work harder to encourage positive change as a partner we can have frank conversations with their government and champion human rights and democratic principles ethiopia is a young country in terms of democracy and over time we can help shape their maturing political system in a way that provides real choices for the people the ethiopian diaspora here in the united states are the natural bridges and ambassadors and human resources to build and strengthen the economic strategic and humanitarian connections between our nations the future looks extremely bright for ethiopia and the united states has an opportunity to be a strong partner as it moves towards a wealthier more secure and more democratic future i am proud to be the cochair of the ethiopian american caucus where i can help give a legislative voice to the specific concerns of
