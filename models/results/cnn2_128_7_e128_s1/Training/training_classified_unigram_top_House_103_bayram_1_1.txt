worth 5 000 costs you or your employee 5 000 just making a group insurance policy available reduces that cost about 20 percent and 20 percent off 5 000 is a lot of money it is 1 000 now you are down to a cost of 4 000 and do you know and you two probably do your own income taxes like i know i do but it is so frustrating to have to keep track of all of your medical bills and your insurance costs and then when you figure out the formula and you go to take your deduction you do not save a doggone thing if you could write off the total cost of your insurance premium out of your pocket and your deductible or your outofpocket medical costs and if you had a cost of 1 000 and you were in sd 25percent tax bracket or a 30percent tax bracket you have already reduced the cost of that premium by another 300 or 400 then if we could ever get through medical malpractice in this congress think what that would do to lower the cost of insurance to individuals you know these are the things we ought

think is also very important it i true that the present law does not force fluid whole milk on children but it does force fluid whole milk on school districts which was the point my school nutritionist was making why do you mandate our school districts such as liberty il buy a product that we do not think is the healthiest product to serve our kids and that is why this language is in the bill i have heard a lot of things said about the appetites of kids and their taste and if they grow up with fluid whole milk at home they will want it at school the nutritionists will know that the people running the school lunch program will know that if they are conscientious men and women they will provide the milk that the kids will drink and if they are not drinking it they will ask why there is one thing that has been kind of lurking in this debate that i find curious there seems to be a suggestion here primarily from people about my age or older that kids need more fat in their diet i would like to find any nutritionist in america who agrees with that premise my kids like every kid are going to be exposed to more sources of fat in their diet than they know what to do with we now know from a nutritional viewpoint and from a health viewpoint we should start off early suggesting to them to reduce the fat content in their diet then there is this interesting provision where people say now if this durbin amendment the one in the committee bill goes through it is going to cost us 52 million follow me for a minute here folks do you know why it is going to cost 2 million because the butterfat that you are not squeezing down the throats of kids is going to turn into butter that is purchased as part of price supports through the commodity credit corporation and that is going to cost us 52 million i agree with that but i think healthier kids are worth 52 million and i think it is basically sensible for us to say to the school districts you pick out what is most nutritious for our kids so many of our conservative members and my friend john myers who is a true conservative have stood up and said let the decision be made at the local level but a lot of other members have taken the microphone this evening and said no we know better in washington or the dairy industry knows better we will tell you what kids really want i think what kids really want are

effort to cut less important programs to make room for emerging priorities then we are not going to fare very well at any other level whether it is within your committee in dealing with fusion research in trying to reallocate that to a more beneficial purpose or whether it is within the agriculture committee as we attempt to perhaps modify our price support program or our foreign credit programs in deference to a smarter way of investing those dollars in our rural economy perhaps other policies or programs that have more to do with job creation and growth than the expenditures that are now a part of our farm policy i would say that if the president cannot succeed in winning from congress the cuts that he has requested there is precious little hope that we can take this a step forward and approach this issue in the committees of congress on that same basis i share with you enthusiasm for the report of the progressive policy institute in which they have recommended a cutandinvest strategy where they have a long list several hundred programs as well as some tax breaks some questionable tax breaks which they would cancel in favor of an investment strategy some of those savings from program cuts and tax benefit eliminations would go to reduce the deficit but some of that would then be transferred to the investment programs in research and in public infrastructure and in education which will build for a stronger future the president has begun in a very modest way to point us in that direction your committee has the challenge of doing that in the arena of scientific research and energy research my committee has the responsibility to do that for the health of our rural economy all of us have to take this cutandinvest attitude about our spending

time remaining this evening if the gentleman wants to distance himself from these remarks i would certainly understand his sentiments in that regard i want to talk a litte bit about the health care bill which is following an alltoofamiliar course through the hails of congress like so many issues in the past it is being handled in three separate committees each committee having total jurisdiction over the health care menu each committee likely to develop a different proposal it is redundant it is time consuming it is like lobbyist heaven because the interest groups will make a lot of money from their membership as they gin up the fear factor about what one committee or another might do it is going to keep us all terribly busy for the next several months but at the end of the day we are really going to be back to square one because it is likely we will have three separate plans developed by three separate committees none of which can command 218 votes a majority of support here on the house floor so we will have to then trade back and forth make amendments and try to meld at that point in time a middle ground approach to health care reform that garners the necessary support within congress to become the law of the land i have been greatly distressed by the approach that has been taken within this congress on this issue because to date in the committee hearings that have been held there is precious little pretense of bipartisanship at the subcommittee level in the committee on ways and means we have seen any number of close votes on important policy decisions like employer mandates and cigarette taxes you name it assume basically party line votes close votes party line votes i am convinced that we cannot pass health care reform without significant bipartisan support for those that do not talk washingtons language that means democrats and republicans voting for this bill in significant numbers i am a bit distressed that time and again leaders in my party including the white house the president and others in the administration pretend bipartisanship talk bipartisanship and yet they have prepared a very partisan bill a bill which upon introduction garnered support only from democrats no republican cosponsors and now a strategy on the part of the white house and within the congress that seems to be pushing this issue forward on a strictly party line basis that may be possible at the committee level it is not possible here on the house floor i am firmly convinced that we will not pass health care reform without meaningful participation from the republican caucus nor should we pass health care reform in a strictly partisan fashion there are some things that we have to accept going into this debate if we want republican support we probably have to negotiate if not back off entirely from this notion of employer mandates but it is not simply republicans that balk at the idea of a mandate of that sort any number of democrats in this congress fail to be convinced that a mandate is the best way to move toward universal coverage for all americans under a reasonable health care policy price controls when have they ever worked i think it is immensely difficult for us to get republican support for a bill that has government price controls one of their own president nixon attempted price controls not a terribly successful undertaking some 20 years ago it seems we should learn from past experience and not pretend that price controls can work today when they have never worked throughout our nations history deficit reduction can we actually save money with health care reform we all had better hope so because last year we did about as much as this congress is capable of doing in terms of cutting the defense budget we did about as much as the public will stand for in terms of tax increases even though primarily those increases only fell on the wealthy and now that we have a budget freeze on the discretionary programs we are beginning to see that we have to pick and choose within that tighter budget to take care of priorities while cutting lower priority items there is precious little we can do to further reduce the deficit if we do not cut entitlement spending significantly and the biggest chunk of the entitlement agenda is health care spending it is the fastest growing element in the entitlement budget growing at a double digit rate per year projected to increase perhaps 10 11 percent for medicare and medicaid costs in the coming year alone so deficit reduction has to be evident in health care reform or it is really a waste of our time to talk about it because without cost savings in our federal health care programs we will never see the end of government deficit spending yet there is no deficit reduction evident in the presidents health care plan in the first 5 years of their plan the congressional budget office indicates that they are 70 billion to 80 billion over budget and at the very best the rhetoric from the white house would lead us to believe that within the first 5 years they may be able to keep their program deficit neutral which means it will not increase the deficit but neither will it reduce the deficit we have to do better or we will have failed the american people on the critical question of whether we can rein in the costs of health care not only for the private sector but for the government as well because it is the part of our budget that is running away from us at a rapid rate a party vote for health care reform at the end of this legislative session would be a disaster for the country two hundred eighteen votes from democrats alone does not represent to the american public a serious and sincere effort to resolve this issue in the best interests of the country it will represent to them a fiercely partisan effort to do it our way and to reject any and all suggestions from the republicans as if they have nothing of worth to offer in this debate and that is ridiculous on its face to suggest that there is nothing to be offered by the republicans in the context of a health care debate that may be productive and useful and could become part of a meaningful health care reform plan i do not think speaking strictly as a democrat that we as a party want to go down the same path that we traveled oon the budget resolution and the budget reconciliation bill last year in which in the final analysis we passed it with only one vote to spare and the public was outraged because after a decade of deficit spending after voting for change in the white house after voting in numbers approaching 20 million for an independent candidate as a way of sending a message of revulsion to both the democrats and the republicans what they saw in washington last year was a strictly partisan shooting match in which the democrats pushed through their own version of a budget plan one that did buy us some nearterm relief on the deficit but one that does not offer any longterm solution to or deficit problem the public will not be impressed this year with a strictly partisan health care plan just as they were not impressed last year with a strictly partisan budget as yogi berra once said it is deja vu all over again and that is what the american public is going to say if they see this congress and this white house walk down a partisan path on health care reform the way we did on the 1993 budget as i said earlier the public will not trust a partisan health care reform initiative i come from the state of minnesota where we have a major health care reform program in place today it is controversial it has been to some degree disruptive not all of the players in the health care system are entirely satisfied with the impact of this reform on them and their livelihood or their comfort level but it has been generally accepted because it was passed in a bipartisan fashion by the state legislature a legislature controlled by democrats and signed into law by a republican governor in other words the political processreached a consensus and developed a plan that represented the best contributions of both parties and developed a plan that was somewhere within the mainstream of the electorate a plan they could understand and accept not a plan that frightened them and sent them into fits of rage and anger if we want health care reform to work the american public must accept it and their trust level rises only a couple of inches off the floor for either the democratic party or the republican party if we want them to have a higher level of trust for the product of our work we must demonstrate to them that leaders and members in both political parties are working together in the best interests of the country for a bipartisan health plan a bipartisan health plan will be more saleable among the electorate because based on the bipartisanship required to develop the plan the public will accept it as a plan that is not radical a plan that is not designed for partisan purposes a plan that is sensitive to various points of view because bipartisanship suggests to them that all points of view were heard history shows us quite clearly that monumental legislation landmark legislation throughout the years has always been approved with strong bipartisan support let us not break with history just because of some notion in todays washington because one party now controls both houses the house and senate and the white house and therefore one party has all of the answers the most important legislation in our nations history including domestic legislation in the 1930s in the 1950s and in the 1960s always enjoyed broad bipartisan support and we ought to follow that example on health care reform i am amazed after having said all of that that so many leaders in my own party at the national level seem to resist the obvious it is clear that there have been many signals in the past months to confirm that that senator dole is ready to deal on health care reform it is undeniable that senator moynihan the chairman of the finance committee has been publicly advocating a bipartisan approach to health care reform for some time now in the house the only proposal that has broad bipartisan support is the coopergrandy bill and yet that is the only proposal that seems to be on the enemies list as far as many of our democrat leaders and as far as the white house are concerned but we ought to respect the work and embrace the work of this bipartisan group rather than rejecting it as we have to date and there are many republicans like the 92 group i am not even sure they call themselves that any longer they would clearly want to be part of a serious health care reform effort they include members like nancy johnson who serves on one of the pertinent committees and steve gunderson of wisconsin these legislators and others would prefer to be part of a solution because they are serious legislators not partisan game players and i have to believe because i have worked with him now for 12 years i have to believe that minority leader bob michel would like nothing more in his final year in congress as he approaches retirement than to be able to be a part of something really important for the countrys future and that is a resolution of the inequities and the inadequacies of our current health care system so the evidence is obvious that bipartisanship is possible and it amazes me that our party is so resistant to these indications on the part of our republican colleagues that they are ready to come to the table again i would say bipartisanship is not only possible on this issue it is preferable stealing from yogi berra one last time when you come to the fork in the road take it we are at that fork in the road and the right path to follow is the path toward bipartisan health care reform"], [0.4969077706336975, 0.9969077706336975, 1, "it is an opportunity today an opportunity for this house i want to talk just a moment not about democrats not about republicans because both have been responsible for the last 12 years getting us in the shape we are in but this deficit and this debt are the most serious thing that this nation faces the deficit feeds the debt which means more interest that our country has to pay in 1980 this nations entire debt was 800 billion today it is 34 2 trillion we cannot continue that now gentlemen you keep talking about the taxexempt foundation that says so many jobs will be lost you can find economists to develop whatever numbers you want i am from an energy state i have a background in energy policy and understand energy policy this will mean positive things for oklahoma it will mean additional jobs in the natural gas industry there are very positive things for this nation in this bill in american today we have the lowest total energy cost of any country in the world and we will have after this tax is passed as well the deficit reduction trust means every penny raised through taxes every spending cut goes into the trust and has to used for deficit reduction none of it can be spent for new programs the entitlement caps are very important but most of all if you vote no today do not say you are for deficit reduction you have an opportunity to start today this bill is not everything i want not everything you want but if you vote no and go out here and tell your constituents you are for deficit reduction you are not being truthful to them i would encourage my colleagues to step forward do the right thing vote yes and start this country on a turnaround to addressing the deficit and the debt that we have"]]}
