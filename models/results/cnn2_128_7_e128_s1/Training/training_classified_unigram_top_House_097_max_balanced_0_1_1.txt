being made by the gentleman from kentucky i know that the gentleman from new york mr fxsh who has cosponsored the bill along with the gentleman from connecticut believe this is a worthwhile endeavor and i am sure it will have the support of the whole house i am pleased that we are able to consider this matter in this rather extraordinary fashion the committee on the judiciary just this week favorably reported a similar measure to the house as a part of a comprehensive immigration reform bill some of the provisions contained in the committee version of this legislation are now contained in the amendment which has been proposed by the gentleman from kentucky the chairman of the judiciary subcommittee on immigration refugees and international law enactment of this legislation is certainly long overdue and it responds in an effective and practical manner to a most difficult humanitarian problem in my judgment it recognizes a moral responsibility that we have to these children who have been fathered by americans abroad the purpose of this amendment is to insure the safety and wellbeing of these children after they immigrate to the united states there is certainly a consensus that every possible step should be taken to insure that the sponsorship process is legitimate the committee amendment accomplished this by requiring the involvement of state child welfare agencies as well as other public and private agencies who are familiar with the process of intercountry adoption and the intercountry placement of unaccompanied minors orphans and other similarly situated children the potential for exploitation must be addressed and the amendement embodies some of the precautions that have been taken in recent years with regard to the intercountry adoption of children and the process of admitting refugees who are unaccompanied minors from various countries of first asylum in southeast asia as noted in a recent washington posr editorial the committees action with respect to the ameraslan legislation preserves the spirit of the bill and eliminates some possible problems because of the unique nature of this legislation it is the committees intent that the attorney general should closely monitor the implementation of this legislation and report to the judiciary committee on a regular basis concerning the sponsorship process and the progress that is made under this legislation in fact the attorney general is directed to file specific reports to the committee on the judiciary on this matter as well as on the impact that the legislation has had on existing family relations abroad particulary in view of my concern that some family separation and dislocation will result from this bill the committee also expects that the attorney general issue regulations to specifically implement these safeguards and it is anticipated that close consultation with the judiciary committee is an essential requirement in that process once again the protective provisions contained in the amendment are essential in insuring that these children will be properly treated after arrival here and i certainly concur in the following recommendations made by the childrens committee on amerasian children and youth of the american council of voluntary agencies for foreign service inc the placement of amerasian chidren and young adults in the united states should be carried out by well qualified child welfare agencies different alternatives such as family reunification adoption foster care or group placement should be considered according to individual cases it is also pointed out by that same committee that amerasian children will indeed have special needs based on the severe social and economical hardships that they have experienced over the years because of their mixed heritage it is evident that these individuals once admitted to the united states will require special counseling and other social services leading to their assimilation into american society it is the committees hope that adequate resources will be made available to insure that these social services are properly and effectively delivered to these amerasian children in summary this is indeed extremely meritorious legislation and i urge my colleagues support of this bill and the amendment that is now under consideration"],
