after weeks of negotiations with our republican colleagues i believe the legislation before us today achieves the same goal and is worthy of all our support most importantly the houseamended version of s 880 would preserve the intent of the clean air act amendments of 1990 by requiring public meetings to inform citizens who would be impacted by offsite worst case scenarios at each covered facility these meetings which will take place during the moratorium on information disclosure will provide every interested resident with the relevant information about the potential dangers in their community it is our intent and hope that these meetings will not only include facility representatives as required by the act but also local emergency planning responders who are most qualified to answer questions about safety and security as well as how to react to an accidental offsite chemical release by bringing different community representatives together to discuss the offsite consequences of a worst case scenario we maximize the probability that the damage caused by such an event will be minimized for the facility its employees and especially the surrounding community it is also our intent that the administration will develop regulations that recognizes every individuals fundamental right to the offsite consequence analysis oca information affecting their community including their home office and childrens school i have not heard any justifiable reason based on either policy or security that would allow this information to be compiled by the government but prevent citizens from receiving the oca data impacting their own community the widespread public release of public information is being delayed to give the administration some time to determine how not if this information can be distributed safely to the people impacted by worstcase scenarios i am also supporting this legislation because it includes the appropriate and necessary site security studies to be completed by the attorney general if we agree that the legislation is necessary because of potential risks to site security than we have a responsibility to aggressively investigate these concerns with the results of this study the administration and congress will have the necessary tools to base future decisions on site security on substantive and complete information the results can also be used by the facilities to improve their internal safety procedures to minimize risk to the facility and its employees again i want to express my appreciation to the chairmen and
