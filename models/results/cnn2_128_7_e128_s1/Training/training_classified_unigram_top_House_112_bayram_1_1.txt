companies my amendment would undo harmful economic actions taken by the administration that will if carried out continue to weaken credit availability and job creation you see earlier this year the department of housing and urban development proposed a rule to establish regulatory standards regarding the use of the legal theory known as disparate impact disparate impact liability allows for plaintiffs and government agencies to bring suit charging discriminatory practices based solely on statistics if statistics indicate for instance that disparity exists between the number of loans made in a specific area to a certain preferred minority class versus the number of preferred minorities that live in that area a lender could be charged with discriminatory practices even if there was no intent whatsoever now we all agree that discrimination is terrible and that when there is intent we must prosecute to the fullest extent of the law but under the example i laid out the lender could even have specific antidiscriminatory practices in his company in place but still be found liable under this legal theory you see accurate risk identification and classification is essential to the lending and insurance business but the hud rule ignores that riskbased lending and insurance underwriting and pricing that unintentionally results in a statistically disparate outcome that is not discrimination the proposed hud rule would create a presumption of discriminatory disparate impact that could basically undermine the basic purposes of riskbased pricing which ensures persons with different risk characteristics have to make payments commensurate with the risk they pose so protectedclass characteristics including race are actually prohibited from consideration in this assessment state law already prohibits insurers from recording race for example but this hud rule requiring race consideration would be impossible then under state law looking specifically at homeowners insurance commonly considered factorsincluding applicants claim history construction materials the presence or absence of a security system and the distance from a firehousecould be barred if they were found to result in creating a statistical disparity for a class defined by race ethnicity or gender you see all 50 states have antidiscrimination provisions in their housing insurance regulations already and there is no claim that these regulations have been insufficient so the process that hud proposes for the disparate impact rule is therefore unworkable and economically impractical the process hud proposes for defending against a charge of unlawful discrimination based upon disparate impact would then require a defendant to prove a ridiculously high standard that the challenged practice is necessary to its very survival and that its business would basically collapse if it didnt do it you see the process hud proposes would find the defendant company liable if a court could find another practice that is simply less discriminatory not instead a reasonable economical practical workable stateauthorized or known practice simply all they have to come up with is another practice extending disparate impact analysis to faciallyneutral practices exceeds huds authority under the fha and it is contrary to law extending disparate impact analysis to faciallyneutral practices therefore is arbitrary and it is capricious therefore the application of this hud rule on the insurance industry should be precluded and it should preclude it also because of mccarranferguson recognizing disparate impact analysis under the fha exceeds huds authority under the fha and therefore is contrary to law the supreme court recently agreed to hear a challenge on this i think it was just last year unfortunately you may know that that case was withdrawn why because of pressure from this administration the administration rightly i believe was concerned that the court would strike down the whole theory as being unconstitutional now recently a new case had been submitted to the supreme court for consideration on the very same issue i hope the court takes that case up soon the justice department knows it has a weak case and i do not believe that this administration should try to frontrun the supreme court and attempt to push through this failed legal theory my

thank you to chairman smith and ranking member conyers as well as to my colleagues congressman coble and congressman scott who are managing the bill on the floor today it was just 5 months ago that i had the pleasure of joining the elected leaders of the virgin islands at a ceremony to celebrate the virgin islands supreme court reaching a historic milestone specifically the occasion was to receive the report from the judicial council of the third circuit regarding their review of the virgin island supreme court during its first 5 years as required by law which authorized the virgin islands to create a local appellate court the third circuit report concluded that the unitedstates virgin islands supreme court developed sufficient institutional traditions to justify direct review of its final decisions by the united states supreme court and urged congress to enact legislation providing that the supreme court of the unitedstates virgin islands enjoy the same relationship with the unitedstates supreme court as the highest court of any state today the house will take the first step in making the virgin islands supreme court just like every other high court in the states and territories this is just one more step on the journey for further local selfgovernance which was begun in 1984 when my predecessor former delegate to congress ron de lugo amended the virgin islands 1954 organic act to allow for the creation of an appellate court chartered under local law while it took another 20 years for virgin islands act no 6687 to be signed into law by thengovernor charles w turnbull and 2 more years for a chief justice and two associate justices to be nominated and confirmed and for the supreme court to formally accept appellate jurisdiction chief justice hodge and associate justices cabret and swan are to be commended for the work they did to earn the recommendation of the third circuits judicial council for appeals of their decisions to go directly to the unitedstates supreme court in doing so they are following our sister territory of guam which was the last supreme court to gain direct appeals of their decisions to the unitedstates supreme court over

would require in statute the integration and display of the flags of each of the unitedstates territories at unitedstates military installations when and where the flags of the 50 states are flown or displayed the lack of a unified armed forces policy requiring the display of the flags of our unitedstates territories is indeed a serious oversight it is an oversight on the district of columbia and the unitedstates territories who are part of the american family and who have unique histories with our nation in our nations history soldiers have fought valiantly in battle but at times with little recognitionfrom the hundreds of thousands of african americans who fought for our nation since the time of the revolutionary war to some 200 000plus soldiers who made up 10 percent of the entire union army in the civil war to the tens of thousands of japanese american soldiers who fought alongside their fellow americans in europe during world war ii servicemembers and veterans of the district of columbia and the unitedstates territories are marginalized by this oversight despite our significant contributions to our nation as a matter of fact the unitedstates territories were in large part acquired for the very purpose of our national defense and important strategic and military interests a noted navy admiral alfred mahan was one of those who advocated the theory during the late 19th century that a nation who controls the oceans would rule the world at a time in the world when words like colonialism and imperialism and manifest destiny were accepted norms of foreign policies of various nations admiral mahans theory was proven correct when a little island nation known today as the united kingdom or great britain or england established one of the most powerful nations ever in the world it was due primarily to the fact that great britain had the most powerful navy in the world during world war ii the samoan islands were a major staging location for some 40 000 marines and soldiers before they were transferred to guadalcanal tarawa iwo jima and other destinations in the war against japan during world war ii for years the unitedstates naval officials pleaded earnestly for the united states to show presence in the south pacific and the suggestion was the harbor in pago pago on tutuila island in the samoan islands would be an ideal place to build a coaling station and a naval facility to allow unitedstates naval ships and commercial vessels to utilize especially during the hurricane season in 1899 in washington d c not known to the samoansthe united states great britain and germany held a conference whereby a tripartite treaty was agreed upon so that germany and great britain would continue their colonial policies of figuring out how to control the two largest islandssavaii and upoluand the unitedstates was free to deal with the traditional leaders and chiefs of the islands of tutuila aunuu and manua and by consent of these chiefs they ceded these islands to the united states in 1900 and 1904 these proposed treaties were never approved by the united states congress until 1929 some ask today is a territory like american samoa still relevant to our nation and to that i would argue absolutelyespecially given the unitedstates pivot of focus on the asia pacific region from our continuous involvements for over 10 years now in iraq and afghanistan i would ask the question what would happen if the leaders of samoa or perhaps fiji or vanuatu or the solomon islands or tuvalu or kiribati would agree to have lets say china perhaps build a submarine base on these islands i would be curious if our department of defense or the pentagon or even the congress might indicate some concern in this region of the world as a vietnam veteran and

other social safety net costs so we have to start being smart about how we use taxpayer dollars and recognize that when we buy something overseas the contract price may be 10 percent less but the overall cost to the unitedstates government is much more with that i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.47155736200511456, 0.028442637994885445, 0, "this amendment is very limited and straightforward to deal with a problem that weve started getting a lot of calls from realtors in our district as im sure many of my colleagues across the country are receiving as well as property owners who own apartment units and other types of housing that are rented out the department of housing and urban development has recently come out with a rule called the disparity impact rule and its not a final rule that has been issued yet were just trying to make a narrow clarification that would allow property owners to be able to check and make sure that if somebody has a criminal conviction that that person could be prevented from moving into an apartment complex for example where youve got single mothers with young children every single day in this country property owners use background checks to check on criminal records of people that are applying for housing this has nothing to do with violations of the fair housing act its just a basic common practice that property owners use every day to make sure that somebody thats looking to move into housing doesnt have a criminal record some property owners can look at that and some property owners can choose not to be concerned about that but many millions of property owners across the country do look at whether or not somebody has got a criminal conviction in determining whether or not they will rent them housing its not only to protect the property owner who has in many cases hundreds of thousands of dollars if not millions of dollars invested in that property but also to protect the other residents who are renting property at that apartment so this new rule thats come out jeopardizes the ability of those property owners to look and make sure that somebody doesnt have a criminal conviction on their record what this amendment would do would just ensure that if the department of housing and urban development goes forward with this rule that the rule wont prevent somebody from using a tool that has been in the hands of property owners for generations just to make sure that somebody doesnt have a criminal conviction when theyre moving into this housing unit that they own again i will use the example of a sex offender there are sex offenders in most states including my state of louisiana there are strict requirements of what somebody has to comply with if theyre a convicted sex offender they have to register and they have to do a lot of other things but if somebody doesnt comply with that lawand there are always cases we find of people who dont comply with that lawyou dont know if when youre renting property to somebody whether or not they are a sex offender but if you choose to do that background check and see if theyve got that criminal conviction on their record then you can say wait a minute youre not coming into my apartment complex and jeopardizing the safety of those young children that already rent from me because were going to make sure that if youve got that background check that shows that youre a sex offender youre going to be denied yet this new rule jeopardizes their ability to carry out what is a basic enforcement mechanism that property owners all across the country use every day to protect their properties we just want to make sure that as it relates to criminal convictions that property owners can continue to look at that and make sure that that is something that theyre not going to be found in violation of a law if they use that mechanism this is a simple amendment i would urge its adoption and i yield back the balance of my time the acting chair the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from louisiana"], [0.47190338373184204, 0.971903383731842, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i want to thank the chairman of the full committee mr issa for his staunch support of this bill and i also want to thank my good friend mr chaffetz for working so closely with us to craft this bipartisan bill and in working to get it to the floor today finally i want to thank the ranking member of the full committee mr cummings for working with me on this important bill there could not be a better time to move a measure like this one through the congress we are facing an unsustainable budget deficit and we must get our fiscal house in order one of the best ways to achieve muchneeded reductions in spending is to create efficiencies and cut waste this is exactly what this bipartisan measure accomplishes the federal government is the largest property owner in the world with an inventory of over 900 000 buildings and structures and 41 million acres of land yet we waste billions of tax dollars each year in maintaining properties we no longer need the federal government currently maintains 14 000 buildings and structures deemed excess and over 76 000 properties identified as underutilized in fiscal year 2009 these underutilized buildings cost us 1 7 billion to operate annually the gao has continuously found that many properties are no longer relevant to their agencies missions and that agencies could do a better job of identifying and disposing of unneeded properties h r 665 as amended will finally give agencies the tools they need to quickly and efficiently dispose of unneeded federal properties resulting in huge savings to the government first h r 665 creates a 5year pilot program to expedite the sale of unused highvalue properties the office of management and budget also with the general services administration will work with agencies to dispose of 15 highvalue properties this list of properties for disposal will be a rolling list meaning as properties are sold additional properties will be added to the list for disposal ninetyeight percent of the proceeds from the sale of these highvalued properties will go straight to the treasury for deficit reduction while 2 percent will be set aside for a grant to fund homeless assistance programs in addition to the 5year pilot h r 665 as amended modernizes the existing property disposal process and removes barriers to disposal h r 665 empowers gsa to provide agencies with much needed technical expertise to dispose of unused and unneeded properties the bill also allows all agencies to use the proceeds generated from the sale of property as authorized by congress to cover the costs of disposal currently property disposal costs can be hugely expensive without the ability to use the proceeds of a sale to cover the costs of disposal agencies have little incentive to dispose of these properties any funds not used to prepare and dispose of property would be paid to the treasury for debt reduction h r 665 as amended will also provide unprecedented transparency and accountability to the federal governments property portfolio the bill will require gsa to report to congress annually on the number value and maintenance costs of all federal property this information will be made available to the public at no cost in an online database finally this bipartisan bill reforms our property disposal process without creating a new bureaucracy and is at no cost to the federal government h r 665 as amended passed unanimously through the oversight and government reform committee i encourage my colleagues to support this commonsense bill designed to improve government efficiency and save the taxpayers billions again i want to thank mr chaffetz for his good work on a bipartisan effort toward this extraordinary bill i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.47651505656540394, 0.02348494343459606, 0, "let me begin by extending congratulations to my good friend from corning for his stellar management of his first rule on the house floor and to say that we have managing this two of my favorite members including my friend from boulder who serves on the rules committee with such distinction i have to say that im also glad to see that we have dr roe here who has over the past couple of years regaled us in the rules committee of the failures of massive even state government involvement in health care and the dramatic increase in costs that hes seen in his state of tennessee because of the socalled tenncare program that has existed there i know that we are going to look forward to hearing from him later let me at the outset respond as the author of h res 9 to the comments that my friend from boulder has just offered first i want to say that i believe that the measures before us are all about job creation and economic growth improving health care and improving education all three of the things that my friend from boulder indicated that he doesnt believe that we are successfully addressing here second i have to say that as we looked at the litany of those 13 items included within h res 9 mark my words the committees of jurisdiction are already working on and focusing on those priority items i believe that the purchase of health insurance across state lines needs to be a very high priority as we want to ensure that the american people have access to quality health care we need to make sure that we have pooling to deal with preexisting conditions that continues to be a bipartisan priority and in fact on the issue of the purchase of insurance across state lines and obviously on pooling for preexisting conditions president obama even though he opposed it in the measure has indicated his support of those items we need to expand medical savings accounts so that people can be incentivized to put dollars aside for the purchase of direct health care needs and or health insurance we also need to do what we can to expand something that actually passed the republican house of representatives but was killed by our colleagues in the other body 5 years ago that is associated health plans that allow for small businessmen and women to come together and actually get reduced rates as larger corporations and entities have done and the fifth item that of course we heard the president of the united states say in his state of the union message he supported but of course was not included in the measure and that is real meaningful lawsuit abuse reform because we continue to see the dramatic increase in health care costs because of the number of frivolous lawsuits out there we have a load of empirical evidence on that again the president of the united states stood here and talked about how important it was to deal with it and yet we hadnt those are five among the 13 items that are addressed in h res 9 and i will tell you that the committees of jurisdiction are today working on that why is it that we are here today well we all know that we did pass the repeal measure out of the house of representatives we felt very strongly that the need to focus on some of the most flagrant examples of abuse by passing legislation out of this house needs to continue to be a priority and thats exactly what were doing today now i dont like the use of the word slush fund to be thrown around it makes me a little uncomfortable i have to admit but that is a term that has been used by more than a few people to describe the funds that are granted such funds as may be necessary and openended without congressional oversight to the secretary of health and human services and it seems to me that one of the things we need to recognize in a bipartisan way is that enhancing congressional oversight of the executive branch is an institutional issue we have a responsibility to the american people to make sure that we scrutinize every tax dollar that is being expended and this legislation is designed to deal with one of the major flaws in the health care bill that being the granting without congressional oversight of such funds as may be necessary similarly if you look at the expansion in every way of expenditures which are not going to do anything to improve the quality of health care in this country it seems to me that this is the right thing for us to do now procedurally i know that my friend joins me im not going to ask him to join as mr dicks has repeatedly in the past in complimenting the work of the rules committee in providing for a process that allows for greater deliberation but these two items before us are in fact making in order every single amendment that was submitted to the rules committee that is germane complies with cutgo does not waive the rules of the house we had amendments that were submitted one of these measures is going to be considered under a modified open rule meaning that any member of the house will have an opportunity assuming that they submit their amendment it complies with the rules of the house they will be able to offer their amendment to this measure we had 13 amendments submitted to the rules committee five were made in order the other seven did not comply with the rules of the house whether nongermane or did not comply with the cutgo rule that was put into place at the beginning of this congress so what weve done procedurally here under the rule that my friend from corning mr reed is managing is we are providing for a chance for a freeflowing debate what speaker boehner indicated before the election last year was absolutely essential for us to do these are commitments that were made to the american people throughout the election process they sent a very strong message by sending 87 new members of the house on the republican side nine members on the democratic side 96 newly elected members of the house of representatives but their message was to deal with this issue ensuring that americans have access to quality health care but dont expand the federal governments involvement in it and ensure that since we had bills dropped on us in the middle of the night one very famous one the capandtrade bill a 300page amendment given to us that no one had seen at 3 oclock in the morning as the measure was being reported out they said read the bill they said make sure that you have a degree of accountability and transparency in your deliberations i will say that if you look at whats happened in the last 4 months we have had i believe more amendments considered more debate just take the beginning of our continuing resolution when we had 200 amendments debated here on the house floor 90 hours of debate more member involvement than we had had in the entire 4 years of the last speakership and so we today are on the right track in a very very responsible transparent and open way we are addressing an issue that the american people said they wanted us to address our priority with this legislation is to ensure that every american has access to quality affordable health care thats something that we want to make happen i believe that the legislation that is before us today will enhance our chance to do that as we seek to reduce the size scope reach and control of this behemoth our federal government which has a 14 trillion debt with one of these measures were going to be saving 14 billion a very important step in the direction which both democrats and republicans alike say they want us to achieve i urge support of the rule"], [0.47726234421133995, 0.02273765578866005, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume house resolution 491 is a closed rule which as we all know is customary under both democrats and republicans for a measure that has emerged from the ways and means committee but we have chosen in this rule to expand the debate time so that both democrats and republicans will have an opportunity to be heard so we have expanded the debate from 60 to 90 minutes a 50 percent increase in the amount of time because of the gravity of this measure because there are members who want to be heard we will have this hour debate on the rule itself which clearly will get at the substance of the legislation and then we will have an additional hour and a half so a total of 21 2 hours we all know what our job is here right now our job is jobs our job is jobs we have a responsibility to put into place policies which will encourage job creation and economic growth and thats exactly what this legislation is designed to do our fellow americans across this country are hurting part of the area that i represent in southern california has a 14 percent unemployment rate substantially larger than the national average we have people in my state of california and across this nation who have lost their jobs who have lost their homes who have lost their businesses we today are dealing very sadly with a chronic unemployment rate it has been sustained for a longer period of time than has been the case since the great depression and it seems to me that as we look at where were going on this we have to recognize what it is that gave us this positive number of a reduced unemployment rate from 9 percent to 8 6 percent it was because very sadly hundreds of thousands of americans decided to give up looking for work and thats what allowed the unemployment rate to drop but we know that it is not acceptable and especially as we go into this holiday season to have so many americans who are suffering is not acceptable and thats why we are here today to take steps to ensure that we first and foremost put into place job opportunities and second address the needs of middleincome working americans and those who are struggling to make ends meet and dont have jobs and thats why we have chosen to not only extend unemployment benefitsand were doing so im happy to say with very important reforms very important reforms that deal with things ranging"],

recovery and job growth and this real issue deserves a real discussion a discussion and agreement between the house and the senate and the president we have 6 days left to negotiate and yet here today instead of contributing to a solution the house republicans are bringing about a constitutional crisis on top of the funding crisis thats the last thing that our fragile economy needs yesterday in the rules committee and i think this might very well be the first time that this has occurred on the rules committee in my just over 2 years every witness that came to visit our committee was opposed to what were doing here today the witnesses were unanimous that this approach is unconstitutional and that this approach is illadvised now in my time on the rules committee i dont think weve ever had such unanimity among the witnesses that have come before us article i section 7 of the constitution which i will include in the record clearly states that every bill which shall have passed the house of representatives and the senate shall before it becomes a law be presented to the president of the united states now whats being done with this bill is entirely different id like to show our friends a very basic lesson in how a bill becomes a law this is our friend a bill for a bill to become a law it needs to pass the house and the senate before it goes to the president now we all know if there are differences between the house and the senate version they can be resolved through a conference committee or it can be sent with an amendment back to the other body to accept that as we routinely do what is being done in this case is this little guy this little guy is deeming from the house that it has passed the senate now this is particularly unusual because not only has this bill not passed the senate its actually specifically been rejected by the senate and now a bill is going to the senate asking them to deem that they have passed something that they have actually rejected its some sort of orwellian doublespeak of conforming some sort of alternate version of reality with regard to this deem and pass measure now there are some things we could be doing in this house and i hope we do in addition to the good faith negotiations which this constitutional crisis undermines we could be taking up senate bill 388 senate bill 388 would make sure that members of congress dont get paid during the government shutdown now this is news to most of the american people because you know what most federal workers theyre not going to get paid if the government shuts down but you know who does get paid those of us who are speaking here before you today thats the current law we can change that law today"]]}
