gentleman from texas for yielding and for arranging this special order to again call the attention of the congress and the american people to the plight of the sikh people in indias punjab state i want to emphasize my strong opposition to terrorist activities of any sort and deplore the tragic loss of lives in india that have resulted from the continued strife in punjab still i want to emphasize as well that i have spoken with dr gurmit singh aulakh president of the washington based international sikh organization as well as his excellency p k kaul indias ambassador to the united states to emphasize this point i further want to point out that dr aulakh speaking for his international sikh organization also deplores terrorist acts a point which should be of interest to ambassador kaul because of my concern over this issue and my concern over the degree to which the government of india has been a party to the violation of the rights of the sikh minority in the punjab i rise today to make several requests of the indian government i believe these requests would help greatly the indian government to prove its determination to respect human rights not only for the sikh minority in india but throughout the world first i would simply request that the indian government restore democratic government in the punjab and allow the freely elected officials of the punjab government which it has displaced to return to their posts i believe that these officials many of whom are sikhs have shown a determination to establish order in their homeland without trampling on the legitimate political rights of their citizens to participate in the political process second i would request that the indian government issue a directive to its police forces and other civil authorities that the individual rights of all indian citizens are to be respected including the right to a fair and speedy trial for any criminal charge and the right to be free of the fear of methods of torture while in police custody if india wishes to remain a respected member of the world community it must repudiate torture and detention without trial finally i would ask the indian government to illustrate its commitment to oppose terrorism by example through the implementation of indian foreign policy the indian government rightly condemns terrorist acts as barbaric and uncivilized however the indian government has curiously shown moral blindness by offering aid and encouragement to terrorists such as the palestine liberation organization and the communist sandinista government of nicaragua currently india maintains full diplomatic relations with the plo an organization dedicated to terrorism and an organization which has murdered american citizens in cold blood if the indian government wishes to repudiate terrorism let it sever its relationship with the plo moreover the indian government has granted aid and subsidized credits to the sandinista government of nicaragua which terrorizes its own people and is actively engaged in an effort to destabilize the governments of neighboring democracies in central america india no wealthy nation itself has given the communist nicaraguan government 5 000 tons of wheat this grant enabled the nicaraguans communist regime to funnel even more of their scarce funds to its armed effort to crush freedom in central america currently the indian government is offering the nicaraguans more than 10 million in subsidized sales i find it offensive that india a not too wealthy nation is willing to spread its scarce resources on the sandinista terrorists while denouncing those who urge humane treatment of the sikh people as sympathizers with terrorism to truly repudiate terrorism the indian government must immediately cease all aid to the sandinista government of nicaragua if the indian government does these things and commits itself to respecting the sikh peoples rights to self determination i am sure the unrest in the punjab will cease that should be our goal here today as it should be the goal of peace loving people of good will the world over i thank the gentleman from texas"],

federal financial assistance as a consequence more sectors of american society will be subject to increased paperwork requirements and random onsite compliance reviews by federal agencies even in the absence of an allegation of discrimination thousands of words of federal regulations will be forthcoming there will be costly accessibility regulations that can require structural and equipment modification the need to attempt to accommodate contagious persons and increased exposure to costly ptivate lawsuits that will inevitably seek the most expansive interpretation of the already

only controlled by but also those closely identified with the tenets of a religious organization to seek an exemption from title ix coverage when title ix conflicts with those tenets let me just read a part of a letter that was sent to our republican leader the gentleman from illinois from the president dated march 1 the bill poses a particular threat to religious liberty it interferes with the free exercise of religion by failing to protect the religious tenets of schools closely identified with religious organizations further the bill establishes unprecedented and pervasive federal regulation of entire churches and synagogues whenever any one of their many activities such as a program to provide hot meals for the elderly receives any federal assistance moreover and in further contrast to the preorove city coverage entire private elementary and secondary school systems including religious systems will be covered if just one school in such a private system receives federal

address the current status of the sikh community in india particularly in the state of punjab i rise today to note the importance of this region to the principles of international democracy it is important to consider how our legislative body may address what many sikhs feels is an inadequate degree of governmental action in fulfilling the promises made to the moderate akali dal party by prime minister rajiv gandhi in june 1985 an 11point accord was signed by mr gandhi and former party leader harchard singh longowal which addressed specific demands made by the sikhs that had risen out of the golden temple incident and the delhi massacres yet specific points of the accord such as the transfer of chandigarh city to punjab and the transfer of compensating territory of haryana state have gone unfulfilled i think that the efforts of the indian government to bring together the disparate peoples of india into one unified country are severely undermined by a lack of democratic treatment of the sikh community despite the fact that india is populated by 16 million sikhs a majority of the sikhs reside in the state of punjab where they have transformed a backward area into the model of agricultural efficiency that contributes to the selfsufficiency status in wheat consumption which india now enjoys in fact although sikhs account for only 2 percent of the enormous indian population of 750 million they produce 73 percent of the total indian wheat reserve 48 percent of the rice and 26 percent of the gross national product of india yet central government agricultural pricing and industrial licensing pollcies the subdivision of land into uneconomic units and shortages of irrigation water have fueled a sense among sikhs that punjab is being held back in favor of less developed but politically favored states the resourcefulness of the sikhs is demonstrated in this country by their presence in our communities where they have emerged from their original status as migrant farm and railroad workers to professional positions within the sciences and the academic world i believe that the sikh community must be provided with the opportunity to negotiate an independence and autonomy from the central government of india and that all necessary provisions for preventing further violence within the area and for ensuring peaceful cooperation between the states should be made june 6 marks the third anniversary of the golden temple incident which was provoked by the threats of separatist sikh leader jamal singh bhindranwale during simultaneous attacks ordered by former prime minister indira gandhi on the darbar sihb holiest of sikh temples and on more than 40 other sikh temples throughout the punjab bhindranwale and 259 of his followers were killed independent observers have estimated that a total of at least 1 000 sikhs including women and children were also killed during the incident the prime ministers political dexterity which had helped to mobilize ideological support for the attack from several politically and culturally oriented groups in india and elsewhere served as a catalyst for further unfair treatment of the sikhs and an impetus to the continued violence of the separatist sikh movement following the incident the indian army remained in punjab as the highest legal authority socalled black laws gave the military and civilian police nearly unrestricted arrest and detainment authority while foreign and american journalists and political observers were unable to observe living conditions within the area because of the information blackout which was also imposed nonetheless reports filtering out of the country documented religious and cultural persecutions arbitrary arrests and detainments and murders these reports conflicted sharply with official statements regarding the treatment of sikhs i believe it is imperative that congress act at this time to do whatever is in its power to help bring about the end of the violence in the democratic state of india this violence catalyzed by the golden temple incident has thus far led to the murder of prime minister indira gandhi on october 31 1984 by two sikh bodyguards the militant assassination of akali dali leader longowal just prior to the september 1985 punjab state election and the delhi massacre during which an estimated 3 000 people were killed and several thousand others were subject to brutalities while the government claims that less than 1 000 people have been killed in punjab during the past 2 years claims by sikh organizations cite much higher death tolls because of the persistence of the information blackout however these claims cannot be verified most recent the government of prime minister rajiv gandhi has reimposed central government control claiming its necessity in stemming a resurgence of terrorist violence yet there are currently extreme separatists within the ranks of sikh organizations and rival faction leaders who will undoubtedly be outraged at mr gandhis actions as well as his vow to use an iron fist in dealing with sikh secessionists i have faith that a political solution continues to be possible since sikhs have turned out to vote in countrywide elections despite the calls for a boycott by fundamentalist separatists but the expedience of this situation is made clear by the fact that since early 1987 a sufficient number of akali legislators have defected from the government to make it dependent on the opposition congress i party to maintain a majority the leadership of punjab chief prime minister surjit singh barnala who came to power following longowals assassination has also been accused of staging false murders of sikh youths and barnala has been excommunicated by the sikh high priests for disobeying religious edicts this crates a powderkegtype of situation which must be diffused as i have said before i believe that we must achieve a recommitment to restraint through the functioning of our democratic political systems there is no room for violence and terrorism in this process which serves merely to undermine the efforts to achieve a true and lasting peace between all peoples of india the serious questions we face affect not only the sikhs of the punjab and the worldwide sikh community but reflect upon the future directions of democracy in this critical region of the world i urge my colleagues to consider seriously the problems which lie before us and work with those of us here today to chart the best and most expedient course to peace in punjab and throughout india thank
