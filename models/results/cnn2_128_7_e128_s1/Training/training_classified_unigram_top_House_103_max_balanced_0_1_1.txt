on tariffs and trade t believe a vote for gatt is a vote for the american people f support the passage of gatt for four reasons more american jobs fairness in trade gatt is a bipartisan agreement and protection of american sovereignty jobs gatt will create hundreds of thousands of higi paying highskilled unitedstates jobs for every billion dollars of american goods that are exported 16 000 to 17 000 new jobs will be created this agreement will be even better for the american people than the extremely successful nafta agreement was under nafta in the first quarter of 1994 texas exports to mexicoincreased from 5 billion to 5 6 billion this is an 11 percent increase in exports to mexico in a single quarter gatt is as good for the american farmer as it is for the manufactures of america the new international trade language will lead to substantially improved access for unitedstates farm exports our country is relatively open and gatt will require others to reduce their tradedistorted support payments export subsidies and import protection laws more american exports mean more sales more sales mean higher prices higher prices mean higher profits higher profits mean higher net income and that is good for the american worker faimess for the first time ever in a multilateral trade agreement all 123 member countries will have to play by the same rules in our previous trade agreements any member country could pick and choose what part of the agreement applied to them gatt is different gatt will require all member countries to agree to and abide by the same rules and this will benefit the american worker bipartisanship this agreement is neither a democratic nor a repubrican agreement but rather both parties agreement to level the playing field with other countries this agreement was launched by president reagan fostered by president bush and concluded by president clinton throughout the negotiation process and this years legislative process all three administrations have consulted with congress in an effort to make this agreement bipartisan and this effort has better served the american worker sovereignty under the gatt agreement despite whet the critics say unitedstates sovereigntywill not be compromised the argument that the united states will be beholden to the whims of third world countries or faceless bureaucrats is completely false nothing in gatt affects the sovereignty of this country or any state the only governing body that can now or ever will be able to make unitedstates law is the unitedstates government the wto will not be able to dictate law to either the unitedstates government or any state government nor wil the wto have the power to overturn state or federal law any decision to adopt repeal or amend unitedstates law will remain ours alone to make to ensure that the united states is never at the mercy of a runamok antiamerican international body dominated by developing countries and powerful bureaucrats a final amendment was added to require congress to vote on wto membership every 5 years this amendment will ensure that the united states retains its sovereignty and this is good for the american worker while this is a solid trade agreement that will provide an increase in hundreds of thousands of jobs for americans this agreement may cause some temporary worker displacement and a drop in some individual wages despite this gatt will benefit the majority of the american workers our country is in an global market and our economy must be responsive to this fact as a congressman who will vote for this agreement i believe that we should look for new and innovative ways to put those displaced by this agreement back to work we must not leave these workers behind neither should we bring the entire train to a screeching halt in the face of progress we must vote for this agreement for the long term good of all american workers if the american worker wants to remain competitive in the future we as a country will have to adopt to the world economy before we can thrive within it the passage of gatt is the first step to thriving in the world market not just getting by it is for these reasons that
