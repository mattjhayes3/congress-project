security around ports but frankly without this amendment we will not really have any good way of knowing how the moneys are being spent we have learned through grant programs in other elements of the homeland security bill that we are finding that once states and localities get the money for these grants they are not spending them in a very wise way for example when converse texas got funds for homeland security they used it to spend 3 000 for a trailer which was used to transport lawn mow ers to lawn mower drag races in that county we found that in columbus ohio over 7 000 was used to purchase bulletproof vests for dogs in fact when the department of homeland security inspector general looked at one state indiana to try find out if the funds were being spent prudently they found that the county emergency preparedness coordinator had purchased a 30 000 emergency hazardous material trailer truck that he was using as a commuter vehicle back and forth to work we found out about a lot of these things not because the process was transparent but because often states and localities bragged about them my amendment would simply say ofice we give the money we have to hear back from

congress there didnt used to besuch a difference in fact president kennedy said a rising tide lifts all boats and promoted broadbased tax cuts to stimulate economic growth in the early 1960s upon taking office and it definitely worked i think with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle the democrats they tend to view it as what they call a zero sum game in other words if somebody wins in that situation that means somebody else has to lose and the thing i like about president bush and the republican policy is that we kind of harken back to the reagan era and the kennedy era where we try to provide broadbased tax relief to everyone recognizing that when we do that everyone will benefit rich and poor and that has happened by the way and in fact our standard of living is on the rise and real after tax income according to the figures i have are up by 11 percent since december of 2000 that is substantially better than the gains following the last recession and i also note just in terms of the effects of tax relief that despite the collapse of the stock market and the commencement of a recession in 2000 the terrorist attacks of 2001 which we just commemorated here earlier this week the fifth anniversary of 9 11 and the ongoing war against terror the economy has expanded by more than 1 trillion since president bush took office our speaker addressed this i wrote this down a couple of years ago he said our job is to leave this country a better place for our children and grandchildren and i think that is really what it is all about and this is something i think is really unfortunate that the two parties cannot come to better agreement on this because we have had that in the past and right now there is such sharp division with the other party constantly clamoring they are promising higher taxes that is one of the planks in their presidential platform it is one of the planks in many congressional candidates that are running this year and whenever we hike taxes it takes money out of the peoples pocket and puts it in the pocket of the government and puts the money out of the families control and into the hands of government bureaucrats it seems to me that our policies empower the individual taxes are way too high even after the bush tax cuts they are way too high and need to be cut further and that is something that we constantly try to do as republicans i think every year the republican majority we have introduced and passed bills to cut taxes we are still trying to eliminate the horribly unfair death tax that is nothing more than a vicious socialistic scheme to punish the rich that was enacted back in the early part of the 20th century we would be so much better off as the gentleman observed to change our tax system so that we are not all spending so much money to comply and i really appreqiate the gentlemans efforts in leading this discussion tonight and look forward to work with him to improve economic competitivehess to empower families and individuals to reduce the burden of government on their lives by the way the overwhelming impact of government regulation i think actually has a greater economic burden on families and individuals than direct taxation i think it is astounding to see what this is costing us when everybody wonders why are houses so expensive you have got to look at all the builtin government regulation that

as a deterrence that it encouraged good behavior and that is why some of us here on this side of the aisle are so passionate about the issue of sunsets it is my understanding that this morning in the

allowed and made in order this debate could have been cut in half in terms of the time i also want to speak to the issue of library records my good friend and colleague on the committee the gentleman from florida talked about some using the library provision if you will as a red herring well the reality is that library records under section 215 can be gleaned under section 215 yes according to the attorney general it has never been used which just leads me to ask the question well why do we need it but yes it ought to be a concern i would further suggest that in terms of if there is no concern

bipartisan amendment this amendment simply states that none of the funds in this act can be used to obtain evidence in contravention of the united states code pertaining to the knock and announce policy the history of the knock and announce requirement can be traced back to common law the rule requires officers with a warrant to knock and announce their presence before entering a private residence earlier this month the supreme court ruled in a 54 decision in hudson v michigan that evidence can still be obtained even if the officer or officers violated the knock and announce policy in that case justice breyer gave a passionate dissent among his dissenting objections were these he said as a result of this decision the court destroys the strongest legal incentive to comply with the constitutions knock and announce requirement and the court does so without significant support in precedent at least i can find no such support in the many fourth amendment cases the court has decided in the near century since it first set forth the exclusionary principle in weeks v the united states back in 1914 this ruling goes against the precedents set by the supreme court most recently in wilson v arkansas 1995 the court held that the fourthamendments reasonable search and seizure clause requires police officers to knock and announce their presence before entering a private residence just a couple of years ago in united states v banks 2003 the court held that officers must wait at least 15 to 20 seconds before breaking a door down again reaffirming the knock and announce rule this ruling by this activist supreme court will create a slippery slope unless we stop it justice breyer also mentioned in his dissenting opinion the slippery slope and in mentioning it stated that if a warrant specifies that you can search the home on monday can police officers arrive on tuesday we have a very serious issue before us and that is a supreme court which has taken it upon itself to enact new law in contrary not just to existing law but in contrary to the constitution of the united states and this particular decision against the knock and announce policy goes markedly against the fourth amendment to the constitution it is something against which this congress must stand up we cannot have a supreme court which continues to infringe upon the rights and privileges of american

people whom the fbi suspected of being members of terrorist groups tried to buy guns in all but nine instances the purchases were allowed to go through a background check of the wouldbe buyer found no automatic disqualification such as being a felon an illegal immigrant or deemed mentally defective there certainly hae been many more instances of suspected members of terrorist groups trying to buy these guns but since the justice department destroys background check records after only 24 hours we will never know so not only are we allowing suspected terrorists to arm themselves we are destroying the records indicating how many guns they actually have bought we are destroying critical intelligence in the war on terror and suspected terrorists are exploiting our pre9 ll gun laws the question many of my constituents ask me is why are these people allowed to be able to buy guns in the first place it defies common sense we are at war we saw what these terrorists are capable of armed vith only box cutters purchased at a hardware store then why do we make it so easy for our enemies to buy firearms and ammunitidn within our own borders since 9 11 we have adopted a multitude of new laws in the wake of the war on terror just try to fly out of reagan national airport no one is spared from the reach of these new laws senior citizens children and members of the house have been subjected to routine inspection before boarding a commercial flight it is an inconvenience perhaps for some but if it prevents one terrorist from boarding a plane it is a good law but our gun laws are dangerously out of step with the war on terror the same people who are prevented from boarding a flight can walk into a gun store and purchase a handheld weapon of mass destruction this is absolutely ridiculous let me set the record straight i am not out to take away the right of any lawabiding citizen from being able to buy a gun we need commonsense gun safety regulations that protect lawabiding gun owners while making it tougher for criminals and terrorists to obtain guns that is why i have introduced a bill that would deny those on the transportation security administrations no fly list from purchasing firearms why the no fly list granted the no fly list includes some lawabiding citizens who are on the list in error but it is the only federal terrorist watch list with a procedure to get innocent people off the list and the no fly list is the only watch list to have public scrutiny other lists without practical application may be just as inaccufate but afford no due process to those wrongly listed my bill will ensure that these people incorrectly listed on the no fly will be able to get their names off the list as quickly as possible they would then be able to complete their gun purchase no questions asked again an inconvenience for some but necessary steps to ensure terrorists are not buying guns in our country the federal government charged with protecting us from terrorists should put at least as much effort into making sure terrorists and criminals are buying guns as what senior citizens and childrefi might bring aboard a plane we are at war and the federal government has made it easier for our enemies to arm themselves i have written attorney general gonzales and asked him to endorse my bill and if he cannot endorse it i want to know why i understand the second amendment concerns of lawabiding citizens and gun owners but these laws can coexist with responsible peoples rights to hunt and protect their families responsible gun ownership is a right of all lawabiding americans but we also have to take the responsibility to protect lawabiding americans from acts of terror and crime we have seen unfortunately many many acts of crime and gun violence in the last few weeks each week for the next several weeks now i am going to bring this subject up i know a lot of the american people think democrats have given up on this issue i promise

action on china every single time we come up fqr a vote we get rolled we have to hold china accountable this is not perfect but a vote against this bill is a vote for china not for the united states it is a small step but a critical step without the data if they do not let their currency float how in the world do we measure how much they are manipulating the currency and those critics of those of us who have been putting pressure on china in the last few weeks said we could never get them to reevaluate their currency it was a little piddly step but 2 percent is 2 percent it is a big admission that they have been manipulating their currency so rather than declare victory and rather than saying we finally it looks like are going to pass a bill on china the other side wants to take it down or at least a few members we had better pass this bill or this is yet another victory for china and we will never get anything done except at critical moments when they need our votes i rise in support of h r 3283 the united states trade rights enforcement act the outcry from american manufacturers has never been louder china is destroying many american businesses for too long warnings of these businesses have been ignored the american government has negotiated with china talked to china cajoled china but has declined to act decisively and with concrete measures to combat chinas policies and help american manufacturers i applaud those at the united state trade representative office who have the daunting task of dealing with the chinese government but unless talk is backedup with action it really doesnt matter congress has also been reluctant to help where china is concerned although we have passed several resolutions condemning chinese trade practices they are meaningless and do nothing to actually help businesses often it seems that the piracy of music and movies is worth administration and congressional action but the piracy of manufactured goods or chinas deliberate undercutting of manufacturing through suspect trade policies does not warrant action the hollowing out of american manufacturing does warrant action although chinas economy is moving toward the free market china remains an avowed communist country the communist government and the army own countless businesses including the chinese national overseas oil company which recently made a bid for unocal they prop up many businesses with free or reducedcost energy low cost or nocost loans and financing and sometimes forced labor because of chinese government intervention in the economy chinese businesses are not subject to the same market forces as american businesses american businesses have also been enticed to setup shop in china in addition to cheaper labor costs businesses in china do not have to worry about clean air clean water osha or compliance with a crushing regulatory burden although these things put american businesses particularly manufacturers at a disadvantage the biggest distortion of the market is chinas currency manipulation until last week china pegged its currency at 8 28 yuan to the dollar despite huge growth in the chinese economy and explosive international trading the chinese government refused to revalue its currency estimates of chinas currency manipulation were anywhere from 2080 per cent this meant that chinese goods entering the united states were 2080 percent cheaper than they should have been and american goods were 2080 percent more expensive last week the chinese government revalued the yuan by slightly over 2 percent while i applaud this movement on the part of the chinese there is much more that needs to be done i realize that the chinese cannot adjust their currency overnight but i expect this latest devaluation to be the first of many i also expect the bush administration and future administrations to keep pressuring china to restructure their financial sectors and currency schemes so that they better match those of the marketoriented world their currency needs to flock and let markets determine the value not the government as american manufacturers have been severely damaged by unfair chinese policies the necessary tools to fight this unfair competition have not been available to them one important tool is the countervailing duty cvd countervailing duties are taxes assessed to counter the effects of subsidies provided by foreign governments to goods exported to the united states subsidies cause the price of such merchandise to become artificially low which may cause economic injury to unitedstates manufacturers one thing is sure the artificially low price of chinese merchandise has caused injury to american manufacturers unfortunately the most recent interpretation of american trade laws does not allow cvds to be applied to onmarket economies h r 3283 will explicitly allow them to impose cvds on nonmarket economies it will allow investigators to compare china with comparable market economies most likely india in order to see just how much the chinese government is unfairly aiding its businesses this will not save american manufacturing overnight but it will help to level the playing field and allow fair competition in the global marketplace this legislation comes to the floor at the same time as legislation to implement the central american free trade agreement cafta i am one of many members that withheld support for cafta in exchange for concrete action on china some have criticized the efforts to link china and cafta they argue that they are two different issues i disagree cafta has been sold with the promise that it will open up new and bigger markets for american manufacturers that may be but if manufacturers in my district are put out of business because of unfair competition from china whether or not they have access to markets in central america will be irrelevant because they will be out business i urge all of my colleagues in the house and the senate to vote for this necessary tool against unfair trade practices"]]}
