parental consent in pennsylvania we require consent of one of the two parents and in case there is a breakdown between the parents and the child we have a judicial bypass where the child can go before

reasonable drinking water standards but there is a consequence to these authoritative actions i oppose the epa requiring small rural community water districts to spend 10 million to 20 million to comply with the current arsenic standards when the epa is going to mandate an entirely new and more stringent standard in january of 2001 this tactic is simply going to force small rural water districts to unnecessarily spend millions of taxpayer dollars to build a new water treatment facility to comply with current standards and then 6 months later spend an additional 10 million to 20 million to build an entirely new facility to comply with the new epa standards if the epa has its ways these small communities will spend up to 35 million to comply with two separate standards would it not make sense for communities to build one safe and adequate facility that seeks to comply with the new more stringent standard rather than 6 months down the road spending an additional 20 million this situation occurs throughout my state it occurs throughout a number of other states i am sure that there are many communities around who are concerned whether they are small or large with the attempt to have to comply with the current existing arsenic standards facing the new future standards as well let me say that this is a wrongheaded tactic why should any community large or small be forced to spend that extra 1 million i stand here in opposition to this amendment we should oppose the hinchey amendment because it is unnecessary this is a commonsense report language and in no way

convoluted process that has brought us to this floor today the gentleman from arizona rose and said that this was never considered in the legislative bill to be added as far as i know it was never considered in the legislative conference not the conference that i par ticipated in at no time did the legislative conference meet and add this as a part of its bill i am on the legislative committee at least as far as i was invited to i do not know whether the gentleman from wisconsin was invited to a conference of the legislative committee or the gentleman from arizona but i think the answer to that is no notwithstanding that i and the gentleman from arizona have tried to work together to try to bring this bill to a point where we could all support it very frankly i think that that is possible i think it is still possible i talked to the speaker about it just an hour and a half ago i am sorry that we are here today in a mode of not being in agreement on this bill so first of all the process has been very convoluted the senate of course has not considered this bill on the floor and there was no real conference on a senate bill and a house bill and the differences this process from the very beginning has been a difficult one if not incorrect one in the committees report when we came to the floor on this bill the committee said we needed 1 3 billion more i think they were correct at least 1 3 billion more to meet the responsibilities of our committee and of the agencies that we fund that was the majoritys observation not mine but they brought a bill to the floor which was 464 million low on irs i am going to talk about that in a second it ended up being more than that because we cut 25 million on the floor to add to hidtas so it was 491 million low on irs when it left this house now we did n6t have convened a conference in the sense that we had two bills there were meetings that is correct there were invitations to come to meetings some of which were attended the final conference or whatever conference occurred i was not at the perception of the gentleman from arizona is that is by choice i think that is from his standpoint i understand that perception but it was also a choice that was made in the context that we really did not know what was going on and there were no discussions with us as to exactly what was to be added the gentleman from arizona represents there were discussions with the white house the white house is not for these numbers in this bill still thinks they are substantially low as i think the gentleman from arizona knows now the legislation bill comes back to us 1 2 billion over what the house passed mostly republicans but some democrats as well that 1 2 billion was added essentially without participation of a full conference that should not happen there were an additional 18 8 million that included projects and priorities of various members none of whom were democrats on this side of the aisle that should not happen let us deal now with the irs within the time frame that we have because that is really the most important issue that we deal with in this bill it is after all the agency that collects all the revenue that allows all of us who support a ready and appropriate national defense to fund it education health services law enforcement all the other items for which government is responsible irs has to collect the money now we adopted a vision of a new irs and the gentleman from ohio and others the gentleman from maryland a lot of others brought this to the floor we had a bill we passed that bill the budget recommendations of the portman report were and i quote the commission recommends that congress provide the irs certainty in its operational budget we recommend the irs budget for tax law enforcement and processing assistance and management be maintained at current levels why because they said in order to carry out our responsibilities in passing this reform and restructuring bill we need to have consistent and appropriate budget levels now around that time we hired a gentleman named rossotti charles rossotti i think the chairman respects mr rossotti i know i do furthermore the gentleman from texas does and mr roth does they believe he is doing the kind of job that they expected to be done if we were going to meet our responsibilities under the reform and restructuring act and have an irs that was taxpayer friendly that is to say that answered questions in a timely fashion responded to taxpayers and were able to go personally over tax returns with taxpayers who had a particular problem after the conference was brought back to the floor and i expressed my concern that i had not seen the conference had not talked about the conference i asked mr rossotti i said does this allow you to do what we expect you to do here was his comment in a letter to me of september 8 2000 please recognize that this level of funding that is the funding level that is provided for in this conference report would lead to a further decline in the already low levels of compliance activity i have an article which indicates that some people are saying that there is 300 billion in uncollected but due revenues why is that because compliance levels are so low and audit levels are shamefully low i think the chairman knows that mr rossotti who is a republican hired as a manager a business manager to carry out reform and restructuring and taxes modernization says without funding for the staffing tax administration for balance and equity initiative otherwise known as stable the irs effort to provide increased service to taxpayers and reduce the decline in audit coverage are at risk substantively the administration has a problem with th4s bill unrelated to politics i share that view so that in sum on the irs title of this bill we are dangerously low in providing services to the american taxpayer and i had a discussion with the gentleman from texas on this i think he shares my view that it is insufficient to carry out their duties courthouses the chairman mentioned the courthouses the administration asks for seven courthouses to be funded the conference report frankly without discussion as to what courthouses we were talking about came back and funded four courthouses now that courthouse list is an interesting list california washington virginia and ends with mississippi the next d c buffalo springfield miami there is a list of 19 courthouses that are in the mix and deemed not by any politicians for pork purposes but by the gsa and by the court administration as being priority needs we are not going to do all of those but the conference the socalled conference again without any discussion with me or other members on our side of the aisle decided that we were going to fund four and forward fund for others now forward funding adopts the premise that these are necessary but we are going to fund them next year so in effect we are using next years money this year that is what forward funding means that is somewhat of a gimmick a budget gimmick and i know many of the conservative action team has decried budget gimmicks but now guess what and i hope that my conservative action team friends are listening in addition to that we have now moved the dates for paying veterans compensation ssi and other pensions from one year to another the problem with doing that is we changed it in the supplemental the other way just a few months ago now i do not know how many people know that that is in this bill it surely was not in the bill when it left here it was never discussed in any conference in which i participated and it was never informed to me that this was happening i do not think there is probably a member on the floor that knows that that has happened maybe the chairman does it has not been discussed in addition we shift 2 billion in this bill out of defense into nondefense domestic discretionary spending so that we can solve a firewall problem in the united states senate i cannot believe that the contract with america that wanted to have a pristine process open and cleared to all without gimmicks that of course democrats were alleged to perpetrate on the congress would support these provisions in this bill obviously one could go on for a long time and talk about the necessity of these bills but one of the items that is not in this bill that the administration feels very strongly about and may well veto this bill on alone is the absence of the response to the counterterrorism initiative included in the administrations request there was some response in the conference report but we left out the largest part of the administrations counterterrorism request we think that is a problem the last thing i would indicate again in a process that is supposed to be an appropriations process we have added a tax provision to this bill that was never discussed in the legislative conference it was never discussed in any treasury postal conference and anybody who gets on this floor and says that was a conferenced item that was agreed to by any conferees on the democratic side in an open way is simply incorrect it was never ever discussed i would hope that my chairman would not make such a representation because he knows that would be not true i do not know how that provision became an emaculate conception on this bill but it is now on this bill so for all of those reasons i would hope that we would either recommit this bill to conference and sit down and discuss it and come up with a bill on which we could all

firearm that is not going to happen obviously but discussion earlier last week i think does define what is trying to be done in this agreement and that is a statement that was made by one of our colleagues that said quote this amendment and the one that preceded it earlier regarding the communities for safer guns coalition are really unnecessary and they fly in the face of incremental and reasonable and common sense attempts to protect our children from guns obviously that little 6yearold girl that was killed was not secured from violence and this agreement and everything affiliated would not have stopped that from happening but what is taking place is incremental gun control by actions of the executive branch implemented not only on dealers who deal in smith wesson firearms but on every firearm that goes through their inventory this is backdoor gun control through coercion and through threat of litigation and this congress should not allow that to happen i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.49144768714904785, 0.9914476871490479, 1, "i thank the gentleman i thank him deeply for the kind observations that he made about me and more importantly for the contribution he has made in terms of talking about the vital nature of the social security program and the importance of the debate before us i do not think it is the worst thing that ever happened that the parties find themselves now in an at least rhetorical debate in terms of who can best protect social security this is good competition this is good competition may the best party win in terms of protecting it and preserving it and strengthening it on into the future we could be in quite a different matter where all of this suriplus is coming in and rather than looking at the longrange responsibilities for our country like the families we represent look after their longterm needs when they might have an unexpected windfall we need to save this and commit it for the long haul because as we have talked about social security is a program that is on the books it is a vital program but it is going to run out of money in 2034 and benefits are going to fall 25 percent if we do not take the steps now to strengthen it so again this debate this little competition we are having in terms of who can best strengthen and protect social security that is a good competition one of the things that will make it good is whether or not there is actually any delivery behind all the rhetoric i see they are bringing out the charts now so i guarantee members in the next hour they are going to get an awful lot of rhetoric about democrats raiding social security and all the rest of it i would expect those listening to what might follow to know that the issue is not the rhetoric the issue is the performance ultimately that can only be measured by one thing that trust fund the trust fund that is going to go bust in 2030 is it preserved and strengthened is that trust fund date pushed back or is it not we have advanced a plan that would measure the interest savings to the federal government by paying down the national debt due to these social security revenues we would then take that savings reflected in general fund dollars and put it into the social security trust fund again the social security trust fund does not have enough money so there are three things we can do to strengthen the program longterm we can raise taxes i do not think we should do that we can cut benefits stop the colas raise the retirement age i do not think we should do that or we can interject additional general funds that i think we have to do because the other two alternatives are simply unacceptable so let us have that general fund contribution make sense if we consider the fact that this debt buydown that saves these interest charges of the federal government is directly attributable to social security in the first place that is a very good program for shoring up this program over the long haul i used to be an insurance commissioner for 8 years i regulated insurance in north dakota that meant that i looked at a lot of phony pitches put a lot of insurance agents out of business if they were lying about what they were selling and i fined the heck out of a lot of companies while i was at it i would just say that the efforts underway the rhetorical efforts of the majority to pose as defenders of social security would certainly not pass any ethical tests that are presently applicable to the sale of insurance in this country i have put people out of business for charges that were as false as what they are saying about what the democrats are doing relative to social security let me just sum up by emphasizing the core points we are operating under the budget passed by the majority the appropriations bills have been passed by the majority the congressional budget office asserts that the majority who is paying these ads to run in north dakota and other places accusing democrats of raiding the social security trust fund somehow that they have already spent into that trust fund those revenues from the cash flow on social security to the tune of 14 billion and going up so let us put aside the smoke and the tired political rhetoric and look for bipartisan ways to lengthen the life of the trust fun nothing else cuts it it is only looking at who is extending the life of the trust fund by which voters in the american public can determine who has been advancing the interest of this final program"], [0.4914839919656515, 0.008516008034348488, 0, "i move to strike the requisite number of words i am not going to take all 5 minutes i just want to rise in support of the work my good friend the gentleman from indiana has done and others have spoken to and want to say how pleased i am to offer this amendment i also want to mention the fact as others have and will that i am a firm believer that just throwing more money at many problems does not solve them i know the background of the gentleman from pennsylvania chairman goodling is in education i happened to have been a middle school teacher for 10 years before i came to work here in the congress and know that there are some problems we will never fix no matter how much money we throw at them or throw toward them or with them this is one though that works this is one where i think we are appreciative of the work that the chairman and the ranking member of the full committee and the chairman and the ranking member also of the subcommittee we appreciate that increase of 7 7 up to 8 3 we are suggesting another modest increase that will not solve all the problems will not be a panacea and there will still be some problems but i want to point out that there are some problems in this country in some schools where when and if we can get some additional funding it will make a difference i am convinced that this is one of those areas where that will work i am convinced that when we approach this in a bipartisan way we will have success we are willing to work with the committee and the appropriators to make sure that that kind of money is made available i urge all of my colleagues to support the

accomplished a great deal for america if we have been able to get across to the people in this country the idea that fica taxes coming into this government will be used for nothing else but social security if we can firmly establish this concept the lockbox concept we will in fact save americans well over 2 trillion in the next 10 years we will do it this way by assuring that those dollars comihg in for social security will actually pay down debt not go for new programs as they have gone for the last 34 or 35 years we have expanded government by using social security money and if we can stop just that one thing from happening and do nothing else here we will have accomplished an enormous amount so i ask my colleagues to please think about the future of the country and how much it

indicating to the people of colorado who are going through a very very difficult time and many of those young men and young women will have that scar with them for years to come that our thoughts and our prayers in the congress of the united states are certainly with them some years ago the state of pennsylvania introduced a program called communities that care they gave an opportunity to local school districts to join in that effort if they wished communities that care is a researchbased prevention program that identifies and seeks to reduce the risk factors that make children vulnerable to crime i am very proud of one of several of the districts in my district that took advantage of this opportunity i at one point was the president of the school board and the dallastown area school district joined in this effort they joined with the healthy york county coalition which is an affiliate of the york health systems because that system had determined that the greatest health problems that we faced in the area were those dealing with violence one of the things that the dallastown area school district did is started tracing early in the elementary career of a student just exactly what their attendance factors show it became very evident to them that as these early childhood children in elementary school were missing more and more school there certainly had to be a reason and a cause one of the things that they did was assign a high school mentor to each of these children that were having difficulty in elementary school and in 90 percent of those cases those mentors became very very positive role models for those children the whole effort was to steer them away from violence to keep them in school and to do well in school just a program that is working and a program that of course i think will be duplicated and replicated and is being replicated all over the country early intervention is very very important and those signs show up very very early in a childs life in elementary school we need to deal with those problems early on to prevent what we have seen happen yesterday and what is happening across the country on an all too regular basis"],

stand up and say that this is something that should not be done i have heard the gentleman from california and the gentleman from california obviously has not read the legislation because he says that it will go to monsters in countries who abuse human rights in the legislation it restricts money for those countries so i would simply say to you when you speak on this legislation have some understanding of it do not claim that we need things in the legislation which are already there and have been since the beginning of this legislation but despite that let me simply say this a consensus is building here tonight and whether it is on the floor of this house tonight or it is 2 weeks from tonight if everyone has spoken the truth on the floor of this house tonight with some exception some are not supporting debt relief some do not believe that it is a good idea and i applaud their honesty i applaud their honesty to say 1 20 is to6 much to h5930 co spend to save 40 000 people a day if my colleagues believe that say it and we will have a vote but sometime before we go home this year we should fund this if we believe that we should do something about 40 000 people a day that we could save a number of those people no one that has looked at this issue believes that it will not help there is no one that has looked at this issue that has said it is not the first step if we are not concerned enough for children half the children in these countries who never go to school not attend one day in school if we are not concerned that children in these countries are not vaccinated a 50 cent shot and as a result they are dying every day if 1 20 a year is too much then vote against debt relief but i would say that the majority of this body recognizes that it is not only in their interest it is in our interest it is in our best interest if my colleagues have looked at this if they have looked at this issue far more than anything else they are convinced that this is in our national interest we have diseases that were thought to be extinct that are now spreading across the globe because of conditions in these countries they are reaching our shores they are killing our people we cannot turn our backs on these conditions without them spilling over our shores we spend 400 billion and 500 billion making the world safe through arms yet we turn our back on 1 billion for food for security and peace why can we not do as eisenhower did with the marshall plan why can we not give peace a chance do we have to change the world only through shipping arms around the world and if we do it and it is necessary is it necessary to the tune of 400 billion yet we cannot find a billion for this those are questions we will all have to answer"], [0.49225023249164224,

to see on the charts that republicans are leading the way of investments and dollars in education confused i say because the media and our friends on the other side of the aisle have year after year tried to persuade the american people that we somehow are unconcerned about quality schools around the country we are not just talking about spending more money although in the case of these priority projects we are talking about spending more money but in the case of the individuals with disabilities and education act this is an acknowledged obligation we have under the civil rights act to carry out this program and the problem is that this administration is frankly not interested in spending dollars on a program that we are obligated to carry out they instead would like to keep the federal rules but have our local school principals figure out how to come up with the dollars to pay for it so in the case of the four examples that were just presented these are priority items for us the idea program is our highest priority in the education budget this year but i want to keep it all in the proper context again going back to the budget track record since the american people threw the democrats out of the speakers chair out of the majority and put the republicans in charge we have dramatically dropped the amount of deficit spending in the country what we are talking about today are the fruits of prioritization for too long in this town democrats when put in charge of our national budget talked about spending but only spending they did not talk about prioritization picking those programs that truly make sense that are truly in the best interest of the country and getting rid of lesser priorities that frankly we have gotten rid of and mostamericans have iiot noticed that they are gone that is the way we are able now to show and to establish for the house and for the american people that a republican majority in congress has delivered a balanced budget fully 4 years ahead of schedule we have eliminated these deficit spending blocks that my colleagues see here in red we have ended this business of borrowing money from the social security administration in order to pay for the rest of government which is represented in the blue blocks and nowwe are to the point where we are actually spending fewer dollars in washington than the american people send us which allows us to establish priorities to make priorities for the american people which the gentlewoman from new mexico just described with respect to education we have other priorities too not only do we want to elevate the stature of those priority programs that make sense for americas schoolchildren and for the defense of our country and for seniors and so on we also want to send a certain amount of that money back home to the people who work hard to earn it and we want to work harder to pay the debt down quicker and we can do all these things by just being smarter in washington that is what the american people believed we would do when they gave us the majority they understood that the democrats were incapable of building a responsible budget they threw them out they took the gavel out of a democrat speakers hand and put it into a republican speakers hand and we are here now in 2000 getting ready to bring a 2001 budget to the floor which keeps us on track for more responsible spending i know the gentleman from south dakota is one who has been instrumental in helping us fight the hard fights of bringing responsible budgets to this congress and helping to make the priorities not just to spend more money but to spend money on things that really and truly do matter and are in the category of legitimate functions of our government at the expense of waste fraud and abuse i yield the floor to him"]]}
