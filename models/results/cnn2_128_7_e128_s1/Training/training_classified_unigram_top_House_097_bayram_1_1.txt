got his pipeline into the federal treasury then the money would keep on flowing year after year after year the bill that is before the committee this afternoon attempts to restrict this automatic refunding provision but does not do so in an effective manner this amendment insures the discontinuance of the preference that existing grantees have over other legal delivery systems by completely repealing the automatic refunding provision the present act provides existing grantees with an automatic pipeline to the federal treasury when their grants expire section 4 b 2 of the bill grandfathers for the 1982 calendar year the supposedly repealed presumptive funding provision section 4 b 2 and a provision which retains some of the procedural requirements on termination and suspension of funding provide unnecessary roadblocks by making it too difficult for the legal services corporation to withdraw funding from a present grant recipient who does not comply with the grant contract the retention of the presumptive funding language makes it difficult to discipline or replace existing grantees my amendment strikes the grandfather section from the bill and removes the cumbersome procedural requirements for termination or suspension of funding this amendment puts the corporation and its grantees in the same relationship as grantees have with other federal agencies mainly the decision of funding or refunding rests entirely with the agency and no presumption favoring the grant applicant this legislation reduces the total authorization for the legal services corporation from the present 321 million a year to 260 million a year the conference committee report on the budget resolution provided 100 million for fiscal year 1982 for the legal services corporation the fact of the matter remains that there is going to be a substantial reduction in funding legislated by this congress for legal services irrespective of what framework the legal services reauthorization takes i believe very strongly that it is better to do away with the grandfather clause for fiscal year 1982 so that those legal services grantees that have been doing a good job representing the indigent can be refunded at an adequate amount rather than attempting to squeeze at least 61 million less into the existing grant arrangement so for the sake of the legal services corporation grantees some discretion has got to be given to the new lsc board on which grantees will be refunded rather than giving half a loaf or twothirds of a loaf or threequarters of a loaf to all of the grantees that have been on the federal gravy train i would ask the supporters of this legislation to think very seriously about the effects of trying to squeeze 321 million into 260 million or less with an automatic refunding provision for fiscal year 1982 it just cannot be done and for that reason i would urge this committee to repeal the presumptive funding provisions so as to give the new legal services corporation board the discretion to pick and choose which grantees will be refunded and to refund those grantees adequately rather than trying to stretch the dollar too far"],

mr mineta and mr mccloskey and i have introduced h r 6262 the joint research act of 1982 the purpose of this legislation is to clear away unnecessary antitrust uncertainty that may deter efficiencyenhancing joint research and development undertakings by firms in the united states joint research undertakings can avoid needless repetition of basic research and increase the return on available research dollars indeed with the path cleared for appropriate joint activities firms will have an incentive to increase total investment in research and development and undertake research projects that they could not finance on their own many of our industries are faced with ever more sophisticated foreign competition leadership in these industries requires not only that firms stay on top of the latest technological developments they must forge ahead with new discoveries of their own many of the foreign competitors of american firms benefit from government research or other subsidies not available to finance the research of our own companies this legislation will grant no government subsidy nor will it create any antitrust immunity it simply will create a certification mechanism whereby the department of justice can examine in advance proposed joint research and development activity and certify appropriate activity against public or private antitrust exposure if the certificate is erroneously issued or if subsequent antitrust violations are uncovered the department may after appropriate notice to the joint researchers lift the certificate and restore full antitrust protections even during the period of certification injured private persons could still obtain actual damages if they could establish violations of the antitrust laws an anomaly in our antitrust laws is that firms with a relatively small market share that could lawfully merge under our current merger guidelines may be fearful of undertaking joint research and development activities such joint undertaking among competitors could be viewed under some judicial holdings as per se violations of the sherman act notwithstanding the freedom of such firms to take the ultimate merger step in some cases where the cost of basic research is high a joint undertaking may offer the only opportunity for firms to undertake the research in such cases procompetitive results may attain from the venture even though the total size of the firms exceeds merger guidelines here again uncertainty as to antitrust exposure could deter firms from undertaking such a cooperative venture the antitrust division has tried in recent years to clarify some of the uncertainties by issuing an antitrust guide concerning research joint ventures in november 1980 while this guide has provided constructive counsel for some firms it can provide no assurance of how courts may ultimately interpret the antitrust laws in private antitrust suits which today constitute over 90 percent of the antitrust suits filed in this country the joint research act will allow the justice department to put its guide to work in a way that will provide concrete assurance to businessmen not only as to the departments views but also how those views will hold up in potential private litigation it will eliminate the harassment potential of private treble damage litigation without granting any antitrust immunity or

establishment of radio marti the administration proposed the creation of this new radio station for broadcasting to cuba as one of the few peaceful options available to the united states in confronting the insidlous penetration of cuban aggression in this hemisphere by broadcasting news reports and commentaries to the people of cuba radio marti would serve the same vital role as radio free europe and radio liberty serve in broadcasting to the soviet bloc in europe for tens of millions of east europeans the most reliable information about their country comes from the outside world there is no comparable source of news for those living in cuba the radio marti project is consistent with international law which is in contrast to the cuban governments practice of jamming unitedstates domestic stations the illegal cuban broadcasts have already continued more than 10 years and are a serious problem however we cannot base unitedstates policy on some threat from the cubans that they will increase their jamming activities the creation of radio marti is an important ingredient in bringing to the cuban people the reality of their governments failure at home and its subversive activities abroad the concept of radio marti is based on the right of the people of cuba to seek receive and impart information snd ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers in accordance with article 19 of the universal declaration of human rights nonetheless opponents of the measure have raised a number of questions some have questioned why an am frequency has been proposed for radio marti am receivers are common in cubasome 2 12 million receivers at last estimatewhereas shortwave receivers are not cuba does not use shortwave broadcasting domestically so the average cuban does not need to own one furthermore since the revolution shortwave sets have been very difficult to acquire shortwave broadcasts would thus probably reach only the political elite while the international radio regulations state that in principle the am band is for domestic service in practive it is well established that this band is also used for international broadcasting the bbc deutsche welle west germany radio free europe voice of america radio moscow and radio havana all use the am band in addition to shortwave for their international broadcasts another question concerns the reason for the 10 million authorization for the radio the cost of radio marti cannot be compared to the cost of establishing a commercial station for unitedstates domestic broadcasting radio marti can be compared with radio free europe and radio liberty its costs include not only expensive fourtower directional antennas but also high personnel and administrative costs required by its unique research and program development requirements these include spanish language requirements studios reporters and researchers based in unitedstates cities and overseas some have also asked why the voice of america could not serve radio martis purposes voas purposes and operations are radically different from those for radio free europe and radio liberty and thus from those proposed for radio marti voas mission is worldwide and its primary purposes are to present world news and to express and explain unitedstates official policy and american society and institutions the charter does not contemplate a surrogate home service like radio marti for the same reason radio free europe and radio liberty have maintained separate identities and operations from those of the voa attempting to focus on the news of one country such as cuba would violate the charter of the voice of america and would completely change the nature of its broadcasting efforts much concern has also been expressed about the problem of cuban radio interference with unitedstates broadcasters and whether radio marti will worsen this problem these concerns are addressed in this bill and were discusied extensively in committee but with recognition that the problem of cubn interference with unitedstates domestic broadcasting predates radio marti by at least 15 years and should be coiidered as a separate issue indeed the very broadcasters who today are most seriously damaged by cuban interferencethose in floridaare strongly in favor of the creation of radio marti the fundamental point is that cuban interference with broadcasting efforts in the united states will not cease if radio marti does not go on the air long before radio marti in the mid1960s the castro government embarked on a program to redesign its domestic am broadcasting system and to initiate broadcasting directed toward the united states and other neighboring countries new cuban plans to increase significantly the number and power of its am radio stations to meet both internal and external requirements were announced in 1979 as part of a 5year plan and were submitted to the international frequency registration board in may 1980 were cubas plans to be implemented its stations would cause greatly increased interference with unitedstates broadcasters cubas broadcasting plans were made known well before our announcement in september 1981 that we intended to establish radio marti the problem of increasing cuban interference is a separate and distinct issue which will remain whether radio marti goes on the air on not the question of how cuba would react to radio marti cannot be answered at this time although logic and technology dictate three possibilities one cuba may take no action at all the voice of america has been broadcasting to cuba for more than 21 years and cuba has not seriously tried to jam or interfere with these broadcasts two cuba may seek to prevent radio martis signals from reaching its cuban audience jamming by lowpowered transmitters cuban radio receivers this would have no appreciable effect on unitedstates broadcasters including those using the same frequency as radio marti it also would not prevent reception of radio marti in cuba three cuba may try counterbroadcasting however cuban intentions to broadcast with high power on 1040 khz and 1160 khz predate radio marti and are not in reprisal for radio marti in fact cuba chose 1040 khz as a broadcast frequency in contravention of the old north american regional broadcasting agreement of which cuba was a signatory before the united states chose the same frequency for radio marti there is no reason to believe that cuba will relinquish its interest in 1040 khz if radio marti does not go on the air or if radio marti broadcasts on another frequency in fact cuba is already broadcasting on 1160 khz with high power despite the rejection by the 1981 rio conference of cubas application to use that nd many other frequencies even if cuba uses frequencies not allocated to it the use of directional antennas could prevent interference with unitedstates domestic broadcasting furthermore cuba may broadcast to the caribbean and central or south america rather than to the united states even with the establishment of radio marti the united states will still remain far behind the soviet union and cuba in the amount of resourcc and time devoted to international radio broadcasts i believe it is essential that we meet this challenge and provide for the creation of this new voice of truth for the cuban people it is often charged and by many in this body that the united states is losing the battle of ideas and that we are not doing what we should to counter the soviet union unfortunately although we clearly

time for us to rise above the question of whether we are republicans or democrats whether we might obtain some partisan political advantage in our election campaigns this year and talk about the problem that faces this country although the absolute interest rates have declined from 21 5 percent to 16 5 or 17 percent we must admit to the fact that interest rates relative to inflation are the highest that this country has ever known in all of its history americans want to buy homes they want to buy cars survey after survey is taken of consumers in this country and they report back yes they want to make those purchases the question then is asked why are you not buying a home and why are you not buying a car and the answer is clear as a clarion bell because interest rates are too high then the question is asked what rate of interest would it take for you to buy a car and to buy a home the resounding answer is under 12 percent the rousselot proposal for a balanced budget is the only proposal before this congress that will reduce interest rates below 12 percent every other proposal involves a deficit of over 110 billion for fiscal year 1983 a deficit of that size when coupled with the offbudget borrowing of the federal government will consume 80 percent of the savings of the american people in the year 1983 there is no way for a significant reduction in interest rates under those circumstances and the problem before this country that must be unlocked is interest rates interest rates interest rates the other budget proposals cavalierly treat the deficit they cavalierly treat interest rates and they do not remove that blockage under this balanced budget proposal within a very short period of time we will see interest rates cut in half and we will unleash the greatest resurgence of economic activity that this country has seen in generations we will have the jobs we will have the productivity we will have the ability to meet the needs of both defense and the social programs but we will only have it if we reduce interest rates it is the only alternative available to this congress to reduce interest rates and that is to reduce the deficit and to get the federal government out of the borrowing market in competition with all of us who want to buy cars and homes because this is so important to the economic vitality of this country the national federation of independent business that represents over 500 000 small businesses across this country has signed on in active support of the rousselot proposal it is based around the concept of a freeze where everybody who receives a payment from the federal government whether they be active or retired will receive a freeze in that check for 1 year beginning october 1 the increases that are due to occur between now and october 1 would not be touched but it would evenly balance across the board all americans that in itself would save 25 billion in the deficit i am worried about the economy of this country i am worried so much that i do not believe that we can any longer talk about reelection or bandaids or minor changes we must talk about major surgery the boat is taking on water and turning on the power is not going to help if we do not stop the water that is being taken on there is no other proposal that will accomplish a reduction in interest rates and if i am correct that that is the no 1 priority that we should be considering in our deliberations we must adopt the rousselot proposal yes it is not going to be easy it is never easy to restrain spending at the federal level but i think it is essential and i think the american people are ready to halt these interest rates even though it will be a difficult thing young and old alike have a stake in this and time is running out it is up to us this year even in an election year to act and act responsibly"], [0.4983102083206177, 0.9983102083206177, 1, "i do not know where that leaves me but i thank the gentleman for yielding let me just suggest to the gentleman from south carolina that the question is not whether taxes are going to go up the question is whose are going to go up and whose are going to go down the fact is that we have an agreement around here that we are going to rely on the estimates of the joint tax committee in costing out and making assessments of different packages being proposed today the joint tax committees estimate indicates that a family making 10 000 a year will pay not more taxes but less taxes under our proposal than they will under the presidents package they estimate that if they make 20 000 a year or more adjusted gross they will get just about the same as they get under the presidents package the major difference is we will no longer be giving doubles kickers for high income people in tax relief we will no longer allow the notorious leasing provision under which corporations can trade their tax gimmicks for cash to remain in the tax code in its present form we have the temerity to suggest that the oil industry ought to be asked to pay its fair share of taxation in this country all in all we wind up on individual tax cuts providing 60 billion come july 1 rather than

us dealing with an issue which has not legislatively matured and that is our problem our arguments that are being presented here are like ships that pass in the night i was one of the members of the committee on the judiciary who supported the repqrting out of this bill favorably before may 15 so it would meet the deadline for authorization bills to be out of committee and so that we would not be faced with a decision that was not our decision on the providing of federal funds for legal services for the poor without some kind of an authorization bill out here there would have been a decision made by default i oppose the authorization bill that is before us on thd concept that it ought to go into the block grant approach but the administrations position is not all that clear our legislative progress on the block grant inclusion of legal services is entirely cloudy at this point as i understand it if anyone does understand it more clearly and can present a good clear argument that it is being taken into account in the social services block grant program not only with just a couple of words but in terms of how it would actually be a part or that funds were actually taken into consideration in some cloudy manner for legal services in addition to the funds that otherwise would have been considered as part of what we are talking about for social services block grants ok that is the kind of position a good many of us would like to be in to be able to vote for the inclusion of funding for legal services for the poor in a block grant program however we are subject to the argument at the present time that it is not really provided for and that is why some of us did vote for the legal services authorization bill to be reported out of committee and are still in a bit of a quandry as to how to vote on this bill at this point it would be my hope that the position of the administration and perhaps of those who are most concerned with getting this into a block grant program could be clarified before we even vote on this bill i think that would be the logical way to deal with this and we could get a clear view as to how people in this chamber really feel about the providing of legal services for the poor in a block grant manner i the chairman the chair will advise the gentleman from wisconsin"], [0.4986199140548706, 0.9986199140548706, 1, "it has been asked

the failure of reaganomics i do not blame him i would not want to campaign just on hope that runs out after a while he would prefer some billowing smoke the smoke of this amendment to obscure the reality of what his economic plan is doing do not be fooled economically there is another very good reason to vote against this we have goals in this country for our economy full employment stable prices economic growth that is achieved sometimes with a balanced budget and sometimes without a balanced budget let us not obscure the goals with one of the tools of economic policy andlastly if
