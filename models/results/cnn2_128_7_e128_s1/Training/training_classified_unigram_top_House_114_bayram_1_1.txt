229 years ago that the virginia general assembly ratified the virginia statute for religious freedom this was authored by thomas jefferson the statute serves as the model for the free exercise clause in our first amendment this is what it said no man shall suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief but that all men shall be free to profess and by argument to maintain their opinions in matters of religion religious freedom is a fundamental human right protected by our first amendment it is essential to our free and flourishing society our nation was found in part by individuals seeking refuge from religious persecution from religious discrimination for these pioneers and for all to come after america was meant to be a permanent fortress of liberty and freedom for all who live within its walls at its essence the concept of religious freedom is about much more than religion it is much more than just showing up to worship service 1 day or 1 night a week it is about our fundamental human right to hold our own beliefs and to live out our lives according to these faiths religious freedom quite simply is about freedom itself this is why the very first part of the very first amendment to our constitution is about religious freedom it is our first and most cherished liberty however our ability to be free to live out the convictions of our faith not only in the public square but also in the privacy of our own homes in our churches in our businesses is in jeopardy right here in our nations capital the misleading name rhnda is nothing more than a legalized

jones and barbara lee we introduced this bipartisan bill to force a debate on how congress has failed to carry out its constitutional duty to authorize our military engagement in iraq and syria last august the president authorized airstrikes against the islamic state in iraq and syria for over 10 months the united states has been engaged in hostilities in iraq and syria without debating an authorization for this war on february 11 of this year over 4 months ago the president sent to congress the text for an authorization for use of military force on combating the islamic state in iraq syria and elsewhere yet congress has failed to act on that aumf or to bring an alternative to the house floor even though we continue to authorize and appropriate money for sustained military operations in those countries this is unacceptable this house appears to have no problem sending our uniformed men and women into harms way it appears to have no problem spending billions of dollars for the arms equipment and airpower to carry out these wars but it just cant bring itself to step up to the plate and take responsibility for these wars our servicemen and women are brave and dedicated congress however is guilty of moral cowardice the republican leadership of this house whines and complains from the sidelines and all the while it shirks its constitutional duties to bring an aumf to the floor of this house debate it and vote on it this resolution requires the president to withdraw unitedstates troops from iraq and syria within 30 days or no later than the end of this year december 31 2015 if this house approves this resolution congress would still have 6 months in which to do the right thing and bring an aumf before the house and senate for debate and action6 months either congress needs to live up to its responsibilities and authorize this war or by its continuing neglect and indifference our troops should be withdrawn and should come home it is that simple two weeks ago general john allen the unitedstates envoy for the unitedstates led coalition that is fighting isil said that this fight may take a generation or more according to the pentagon we have spent more than 2 74 billion in the fight against the islamic state that is roughly 9 1 million each and every day we have approximately 3 500 boots on the ground and that number is rising if we are going to invest a generation or more of our blood and our treasure in this war and if we are going to continue to tell our armed forces that we expect them to fight and die in these wars it seems to me the least we can do is stand up and vote to authorize these wars or we should end them we owe that to the american people we owe that to our troops and their families we owe that to the oath of office that each of us took to uphold the constitution of the united states we are going to hear all kinds of crazy today about this resolution some members will say that it demands the withdrawal of our troops in 30 days that is true if you only read half of a sentence in the bill the other half makes clear that the president has until the end of the year to withdraw our troops some members will claim that this resolution will undercut our troops while they are carrying out bombing campaigns and training iraqi and syrian soldiers under dangerous conditions they will claim it will deny the iraqis and the kurds our critical support in the fight against the brutal terror and threat of isis they will claim that it will leave isis unchecked by unitedstates airpower and allow them to overrun the region the truth is that it is precisely these threats and these challenges that make this debate so urgent with such compelling issues at hand how can congress stand by and do nothing how can congress not have this debate and vote on an authorization for this war by setting a clear deadline congress cannot ignore this resolution provides a strong guarantee that congress will finally do its

emerging growth companies that raise capital from private investors have two options available to them to give their investors a return the first option is to take the company public and the second option is to sell the business the data overwhelmingly suggests that when companies go public the companies are very likely to take the capital they raise in a public offering invest it in the business create jobs and hire americans as compared to when companies are sold which are often done for strategic reasons that are based on consolidations and often result in jobs being lost so while companies are completely free to make whatever choices they want to make we as policymakers should certainly be trying to level the playing field as it relates to initial public offerings in order to make them more accessible for emerging growth companies particularly if they can be done without compromising investor protection i believe strongly that h r 2064 does in fact do that my colleague from tennessee went through the specifics in terms of the processes that are being improved by the bill i have some firsthand experience with this process in having started two businesses in the private sector and in having taken them both public on the new york stock exchange experiences that taught me that a companys initial public offering as it relates to due diligence and scrutiny and oversight is the day when they have the most focus by regulators and investors and underwriters so it is certainly a time where we have an opportunity for more flexibility around timing which i believe this bill does and will do successfully it will lead to more initial public offerings it will hopefully reverse the trends that we have seen across the last several decades where the number of
