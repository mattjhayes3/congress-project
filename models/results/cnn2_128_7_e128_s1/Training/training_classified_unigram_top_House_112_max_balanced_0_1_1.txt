choose this bill is unnecessary divisive and extreme and it saddens me that the republican leadership has chosen to bring this bill to the house floor when americans are struggling the american people want us to work together to address their top priority creating jobs as such we should be focusing on putting americans back to work not dividing congress on ideological issues and we certainly shouldnt be considering legislation that rolls back womens reproductive rights 38 years supporters of this bill claim it is amending the affordable care act to ensure unitedstates tax dollars are not used to fund abortions however the affordable care act already prohibits the use of federal dollars to fund abortions instead h r 358 will eliminate access to abortion care for many women by banning insurance plans regulated by the affordable care act from offering abortioninclusive coverage if they take even one federally subsidized customer so if a plan takes one subsidized customer then they cant provide abortion coverage insurance to anyone else in the plan whats even more concerning is that this legislation could place many women who need reproductive health care in dangerous potentially lifethreatening situations by expanding a lopsided policy that allows health workers and hospitals the ability to refuse to provide and refer for abortion care and even deny emergency abortion care so thats why i was so appalled truly appalled yesterday by comments that were made at the rules committee and i want to set the record straight this bill is not simply the stupakpitts amendment that was debated and supported during the health reform consideration during the rules committee i heard that over and over again from the republican sidethis is just the stupak bill all over again that is simply not true h r 358 goes significantly beyond the stupak amendment the stupak amendment limited its reach only to qualified health plans and had no effect on completely private plans but h r 358 affects any health plan the stupak amendment limited its reach only to federal funding and insurance coverage of abortion h r 358 includes access to abortion services a much broader term with farreaching effects and the stupak amendment limited its reach only to state conscience protection laws that deal with abortion but h r 358 expands that protection to those covering health and medical services outside of abortion the stupak amendment did not create any exception to the obligation of hospitals to comply with emtala instead it left that obligation intact so as my colleagues will see no one should be fooled by the argument that this is simply stupak because its simply not i want to emphasize the effect of this amendment would mean that effectively women would not be able to get any kind of health insurance for abortion coverage either because they wouldnt be able to get a comprehensive plan on the exchange or because they would be forced to try to buy one outside the exchange just for abortion services which isnt going to be available so practically speaking what the pitts amendment does is make it impossible for a woman to exercise her right under the constitution if she chooses to have an abortion because she wont be able to get insurance coverage for it at all h r 358 is a massive overreach of womens health it extensively restricts womens access to reproductive health services and lifesaving care it is a step towards eliminating a choice that our supreme court has deemed legal and remains legal to this day now if you want to overturn roe v wade and i know that there are members on the other side of the aisle who feel that way then they can try to do that but dont do it in a sneaky way by denying women insurance and effectively saying that they cant exercise what the supreme court says is their right under the constitution women need and are entitled to safe affordable health care options this bill only serves to create health and financial challenges that i think are going to be impossible to overcome its dangerous to womens health i urge my colleagues to vote nay on the legislation i reserve the balance of my time"],

yesterday by the speaker when he said so be it in response to the likely job losses that will occur as a result of this continuing resolution an independent analysis by the nonpartisan economic policy institute indicates that this bill will result in the direct loss mind you of 800 000 private and public sector jobs instead of doing everything we can do to halt the loss of jobs and put people back to work this bill takes the wrong approach putting our economy and our country back on the path to recession for every job opening in this country we have 4 7 unemployed people who are looking for work why would we want to add to their numbers so be it cannot and should not be our response to this economic crisis not with a 9 percent unemployment rate and over 15 percent in communities of color and record layoffs and furloughs at the state level and especially not when republicans have the temerity to demand tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires paid for through borrowed money this is just wrong and its immoral as a member of the house appropriations subcommittee on labor health and human services and education i am in strong opposition to these cruel cuts budgets are moral documents and they are a reflection of who we are and what we value this spending bill makes it clear that the poor the young women the elderly teachers firefighters cops and the communities that they protect and serve are not valued make no mistake this bill will harm the most vulnerable among us and it represents a wrongheaded approach to reducing the deficit or expanding job growth in our country i am especially concerned about the proposed cuts to education and training programs among the range of cuts include workforce investment act programs which last year helped over 8 4 million job seekers find jobs they got additional education and job training support this is being cut all told when counting rescissions of prior funding elimination of the requested fy11 funding and the advanced funding needed to run these employment and training programs they will experience nearly a 5 billion cut republican cuts in job training will only prolong the recession keep unemployment high and keep more americans collecting unemployment instead of training and getting ready for our 21st century job opportunities how can we justify cutting job training programs in the middle of an economic crisis how will my republican colleagues respond to the unemployed in their communities who come to them and ask them for help will they just say so be it pell grants pell grants provide vital funds for students who wish to attend 2 and 4year colleges but who need help to pay their expenses in my district alone there are 16 institutions that provide pell grants to over 18 000 recipients this proposal would cut pell grants by 845 making college less affordable and accessible for lowand moderateincome students more than 8 million students benefit from pell grants and many would be hurt by this cut especially as schools are raising tuition fees to meet rising costs and to deal with tighter budgets the bill also entirely eliminates federal funding for supplemental educational opportunity grants which colleges and universities use to assist undergraduates who have the greatest financial need that program assisted 1 3 million college students last year head start under this proposal is cut by nearly 1 1 billion this will effectively knock out 200 000 children mind you in republican and democratic districts from participating in this critical early education program this helps provide health nutrition and supportive services to prepare our children for school the job corps program this program is cut by 891 million which will result in 21 384 jobs lost in communities in every state the majority of which are in the private sector there will be 1 7 billion lost in economic activity as a result of this and 36 000 atrisk young people will be turned away from job corps costing the government and the economy as much as 17 billion over the course of their lifetimes additionally the cuts will guarantee the closure mind you of 75 job corps centers across the nation in your districts and in our districts slashing one of the most effective accountable and marketdriven solutions for millions of youth who leave our schools unprepared is really the wrong move at the wrong time the majority has stated that they want to cut the deficit but in effect they are cutting the social safety net lifeline for those who need it the most this cr leads us down a

for 15 months to issue a reproposal the courts rejected that request and thus epa was forced to issue the rule on time in february of 2011 however epa immediately instituted an administrative stay on several major rules within the regulation saying that they would begin reconsideration with new information that had been made available in the last few months ive met with many industries and companies that expressed concern with the provisions in this final rule ive listened and even helped foster ongoing conversations between those industries and epa as they worked toward a reproposal of the boiler mact rule then we were offered this bill the epa regulatory relief act we were told that this bill would simply give epa the time that they had already asked for to work on the rule and repropose a new final rule after the conversations i had had with companies in my district i thought this would be a good solution the problem is when you dig a little deeper ive said for a long time

was passed last year i am delighted because first of all when it came to the floor last year this bill affected every aspect of health care in america and we did not have the opportunity to offer one amendment on the floor in addition to that this bill takes 500 billion out of medicare which means less money to nursing homes hospitals and medicare beneficiaries then the claim that this would reduce the deficit by 138 billion was calculated by including 10 years of tax revenues under this bill but only 6 years of expenditures how can you claim that we are supporting insurance companies by repealing this bill when the insurance companies supported the bill and they supported the bill because it mandates that small businesses and individuals buy health insurance so i would urge the repeal of this legislation and then we can fix health care the way it should be fixed"], [0.9769907593727112, 0.9769907593727112, 0, "we went from there and we talked about the democratic budget drafted by mr chris van hollen and then of course the progressive caucus budget came up the black caucus budget came up i think mr mulvaney came up with a budget proposal they put the presidentsa very very watered down and inaccurate version of the presidents budget up there and weve been talking budget when we talk about the budget what were talking about is the values and priorities of america its important to keep this in mind what shows up in your budget is what you care about what does not show up in your budget is what you dont care about now i always caution people not to just take their family budget and the united states budget and assume theyre basically the same thing one just is bigger than the other thats not exactly accurate there are important differences and we shouldnt mix up the two but in this way they are similar in that they reflect what it is that people value if you have a family and their budget you can look at their budget they spend a lot of money on entertainment you can pretty much figure they value that if they put a lot of money into food you can figure they definitely think that is a priority for them you can go through the family budget and see what people spend their money on see what people dont have in their budget and then you can pretty much figure well maybe thats not a priority for them of course they may not be able to afford it at this time but if you talk about reasonably middle class people their budget reflects what they care about what matters and what doesnt and for our nation that certainly is true if our nation puts more money into warfare than it does into social uplift jobs and the economy and infrastructure that says something about who we are if our national budget puts more money into infrastructure and jobs and putting people back to work then that says something about who we are the various budgets that have come up reflect what the various caucuses think is important and project a vision for our country i want to talk about that today i want to start by talking about paul ryans budget paul ryan is the republican budget committee chair hes a nice guy i dont have anything bad to say about him personally because he is actually a nice person but the fact is we disagree in a significant way about what the priorities of america should be for example the republican budget 20 children will lose access to head start to pay for one millionaires tax cut thats their budget just if you want to understand what their tax cuts represent it means 20 kids dont get to go to head start so that a millionaire can get a tax cut150 000 equals 20 times 7 500 so if you look at this tax cut a millionaires tax cut which will amount to about 150 000 these little guys dont get to go to head start now what is head start head start is a great program for lowincome kids to make sure that they have a chance at getting a quality education and dont fall behind in school and so this is a great program it has great results these head start kids 20 of them going to head start versus what a millionaires tax cut would be which is 150 000 now this is the choice were making we should not act like were not making choices we are making choices we are deciding my friends on the republican side of the aisle like to say oh we shouldnt pick winners and losers were always doing it they just pick the rich people and weipick the kids in head start also if you just want to get a sense of what the republican budget what it does and what the tax cuts that its calling for mean republican budget 150 college students will have their pell grants cut by 1 000 to pay for one millionaires tax cut so one millionaires tax cut 150 000 but 150 times 1 000 all these kids these college kids trying to make something of themselves their pell grant is going to get whacked by 1 000 bucks so again choices do we want to make sure the country club set is doing even better or do we want to make sure that these aspiring engineers these aspiring doctors and teachers these aspiring police officers these aspiring workers of tomorrow will have a shot at an affordable college education this is what were talking about these are the choices that were making and i think its very important that americans know it its critical that we know it now lets just not stop there lets talk about other critical choices being made because i think it is so critical that as were talking budget week and all the budget decisions that we are making that we make it real clear to the american people what it is were choosing republican budget 216 pregnant or postpartum women infants and children would lose access to wicthats the women infants and children program and it provides food for poor women and their kidsto pay for one millionaires tax cut so 150 000 tax cut for a millionaireagain this is the country club setequals about 216 pregnant women or postpartum women and the amount of money that americans give them so that they can have good nutrition for their kids these are poor women these are women who are struggling economically but just because theyre struggling economically we dont want their kids to go without good nutritious food so as americans we have the wic program well theyre going to get slashed out of the program because a millionaire needs a tax cut thats the choice that were making i want to talk about why were making that choice in a minute but i want to give one more example republican budget 25 seniors paying 6 000 or more for medicare to pay for one millionaires tax cut so if youre a millionaire and you get a tax cut under what the republicans want to give youyoure already doing good but they want you to even do betterthat will mean that youve got about 25 seniors who have to pay 6 000 a piece more for their medicare so mom dadif youre my age mom and dad are senior citizens if youre younger theyre not but if your parents or grandparents are on medicare and theyre doing all they can on their fixed income to make it theyre going to need a little extra help because weve got to make sure that that millionaire gets his 150 000 tax cut these are the choices that were making now my friends in the republican caucusgod bless themits not like they dont like poor people many of them are very charitable they give in their different walks of life maybe their faith community or whatever they just dont think government should do it this is what they say they think that government needs to get out of that and let churches mosques synagogues and other folks do it of course that would mean that it wouldnt get done because even though churches mosques and synagogues do great work they can never possibly come up to meet the need thats out there what theyre really believing isthis is what they really believe they believe in something called trickledown economics they believe that if you give this millionaire 150 000 more dollars than he already has he will maybe hopefully perhaps invest it in plant and equipment and maybe somebody will get a job because of it or maybe not or maybe he will invest in china hell improve jobs but just not in america nobody knows what they will do with this tax cut but this is what the republicans believe they think that if you give rich people more money they will invest in plant and equipment create more economic activity and it will trickle down to the rest of us the only problem is that it has never worked it doesnt stop them from saying it but its never worked in fact the gop budget will destroy more than 4 million american jobs in the next 2 years according to the economic policy institute the economic policy institute estimates that the shock to aggregate demand from nearterm spending cuts would result in roughly 1 3 million jobs lost in 2013 and 2 8 million jobs lost in 2014 or 4 1 million jobs through so a little bit more than 4 million jobs over the next 2 years now people might think well keith is that right well yeah its right and ill tell you why its right its right because when republicans say we need to cut government waste we need to cut government cut government cut government they act as if theres just some big government thing over there like its a big giant piece of styrofoam and they can just cut it and it doesnt change anything what theyre talking about cutting are federal workers theyre talking about laying off federal workers and theyre very derisive about government jobs and act like people who work for the government dont do anything of valueof course this is not true at all but if you look on this chart right here it says i earn less than 45 000 a year explain to me gop how cutting my pay creates jobs this particular person is named paul and he is an army depot worker i think we need army depot workers teresa is a nurseand this is her right here she lives in my district and she says twelve percent of the salary i earn caring for veterans goes to my retirement explain to me gop how cutting my retirement puts people to work well one of the things that they do in the ryan budget is cut into federal workers retirement they act like oh the government no the government is people the government is nurses the government is army depot workers and what about federal prisons that keep dangerous criminals behind bars i pay more than 9 000 a year for my familys health insurance explain to me gop how cutting my takehome pay lowers unemployment this guy is a corrections officer and thank goodness for correction officers or the streets that we live on wouldnt be so nice the bottom line is when republicans say oh were going to shrink the size of government what they mean is theyre going to lay off and cut the pay and cut the employment benefits of federal workers people who work in prisons at risk to themselves nurses who care for our veterans people who are army depot workers and people who work in our parks and people who fix our roads and a whole lot of other people heres a chart for you if you look at the ryan budget if you look at the gop proposal if you look at it and it could do what they want it to do it could cause a loss of up to 7 million jobs by 2016 because it would cut federal workers and then they wouldnt be able to have the money to spend in the neighborhoods they live in anymore that would then have a ripple effect in their neighborhoods because theyre buying less for example if that young nurse at the va in minnesota if she doesnt have the same pay as she had before then she cant buy as much as she bought before then the company she shops at doesnt sell her as much as they have before you do that enough multiply it times enough people and that company then needs to start laying off people so its a ripple effect what the republicans are asking for but if you look at what they wantedand im talking about going all the way back to h r 1 which is their proposalyou would see repealing health care reform that would cut about 2 million the gop budget that would cut about 3 million cuts to the federal workforce that would cut about 285 000 the socalled jobs act that would cut a lot the fair tax that would cut and they would just cut on down the line what theyre basically proposing is by shrinking government and by doing all that stuff theyre getting rid of people now i just want to be on the record because your words do get twisted if there is a federal program that is not justifiable and its so poorly run that its of no value to anyone im okay with cutting it i just want to say that on the record on the house floor im all right with cutting programs that dont work but when youre talking about va nurses and youre talking about corrections workers in federal prisons we need these people they do good stuff and i believe that we should stand by them as they stand by us the gop budgetnow going back to the budget we addressed todaywill shift costs to seniors for the medicare guarantee according to the aarp and whats aarp thats the leading organization representing retired persons and the cbowhats the cbo that is the congressional budget office and for folks who like to watch cspan id just say you need to know what cbo is because this is very important congressional budget office theyre the nonpartisan group that says whats really going on with the numbers at the same time it is raising the seniors cost this gop budget gives those making more than a million a year an average tax cut of about 394 000 so i put 150 up there a moment ago that was the generic millionaire the actual number is about 394 for the average millionaire per year on the average tax cut and also the tax breaks for big oil companies you know they get about 4 billion a year im talking about if you look at conoco exxonmobil and all the big oil companies they get about 4 billion a year now how much did you pay for gasoline im not saying that theyre not good people im not saying that they dont run a good business and supply an important product im just asking you this does exxonmobil really need your money through a tax subsidy do they i think that they dont need your money i think their 4 a gallon is taking care of them just fine and i think its outrageous that the republican budget that we dealt with does not eliminate that tax break in short the big oil companies who are gouging americans at the pump and the wealthiest americans win while middle class and working class families get the short end of the stick last year oil profitsand this is an exact number or close to it last year big oil profits totaled about 137 billion but you dont need to remember 137 billion all you need to remember is big oil profits were the biggest ever that the oil industry ever had and yet were forking it over to them through our tax money not through the pumps some people might think well of course were paying them keith through the pump they give us gas weve got to get to work so we need to buy the gas im not talking about that im saying they getthey can apply for grants and subsidies and it all adds up to about 4 billion a year with soaring gasoline prices big oils 2012 profits will even be bigger yet republicans want to give big oil more money in our tax dollars and it just doesnt make any sense now of course you shouldnt expect the big oil companies like exxonmobil to say we dont want the money of course they want the money who doesnt want money everybody does including them but the people who have a public responsibility to look out for the american people should be willing to say no to public subsidies for the exxonmobils of this world and again if you work for exxonmobil im not running you down im just saying that youre doing well enough and you dont need the help of the american people you can do fine on your own now those kids on head start need help they need help those college kids need help but not exxonmobil executives the major consequence for medicare and medicaid the ryan budget the republican budget has big consequences for medicaid and medicare many seniors will be forced to pay sharply higher premiums to stay in traditional medicare and keep their current choice of doctors new medicare beneficiaries would pay more than 1 200 more by 2030 and more than 6 000 by 2050 before more seniors would gradually shift to private health insurance plans over time increasing privatization of medicare more than 47 million americans would lose health care insurance over 10 years because they would get rid of obamacare now my friends in the republican aisle when they say obamacare they dont mean it in a nice way its an insult but you know what obama does care so i dont mind them saying obamacare i hope they keep saying it because theyre just reminding americans that obama cares about them and that the people the republicans want to look out for apparently do not states under the republican plan would be forced to slash medicaid eligibility benefits and payments to health care providers their budget shreds the medicaid safety net and shifts health care costs to states and beneficiaries blocking medicaid this shifts all risks including future recessions health care cost increases and disasters to states and beneficiaries so heres the thing this ryan budget this republican ryan budget it helps and takes care of the rich it ignores everyone else and it hurts the middle class the republican budget would weaken the middle class in important ways first and foremost their plan ends the medicare guarantee of decent health insurance in retirement it also slashes critical middle class investments such as education and infrastructure by 45 percent and 24 percent respectivelyeducation by 45 percent infrastructure by 24 percent now look the american society of civil engineers has told us that we have crumbling infrastructure in this country to the tune of about 2 2 to 3 trillion a lot of money and if you are living in any city across this country you can drive over 75yearold bridges you can drive over potholes our sewage systems need upgrade i am from minneapolis minnesota a city i love so much but back a few years ago we had a bridge fall into the mississippi river because the gusset plates which are those plates that hold up the bridge gave way because the adequate maintenance just wasnt maintained over time now it happened to us but it could happen anywhere there are many structurally deficient bridges across this nation literally thousands we could put people back to work if we put the money into taking care of them and not only would we have people working wed have to save bridges to go over but the republican majority to use their phrase kicks the can down the road and doesnt deal with this looming infrastructure crisis so let me just say this ive talked a little bit about the socalled ryan republican budget i dont want to spend all my time talking about it but i do think its important for americans to know that this is a budget for the 1 percent this is a budget for people whove got it well who are doing fine now let me just tell you i swear i am a big fan of welltodo people i wish i were one of them but my point is that you dont need to help people who already have a lot of help on their own but you do need to help schoolkids head start kids pregnant moms pregnant lowincome moms seniors these people we should help people who are doing fine they dont need our help they should do the helping in my opinion and yet the ryan budget says were just going to help the country club set and i think thats not any way to have a budget im going to talk about the progressive caucus budget but i just want you to know first that the ryan republican budget is no good budget for america in fact its premised on the theory that rich people dont have enough money and poor people have too much really thats the animating organizing feature of their budget that if we gave rich people more money then they might invest it in plant and equipment and then itll trickle down to the rest of us and poor people have too much stuff we cant afford it we cant afford head start cant afford wic cant afford home heating oil for seniors cant afford medicare cant afford medicaid the poor folks are just theyre getting treated too well and thats basically what the theory is of the republican budget and so thats fine and i respect them for being real honest about what they believe in because a budget is a reflection of our values so now that weve talked about what theyre talking about lets talk about a real budget not for the 1 percent but a budget for all the progressive caucus budget has a name the name of the progressive caucus budget is the budget for all thats the name of the progressive caucus budget because unlike the republicans budget which is a budget for the 1 percent this is a budget for all let me tell you what it does it creates 3 3 million jobs in the first 2 years it cuts the deficit by nearly 7 trillion 6 8 trillion no benefit cuts to medicare medicaid and social security the budget for all makes the american dream a reality again for the vast majority of americans by putting americans back to work the budget for all enhances our economic competitiveness by rebuilding the middle class and investing in innovation and education our budget protects medicare and medicaid social security invests in americas future and asks those who have benefited the most from our economy to pay their fair share now as i said you cant have a budgetyou can have a budget that cuts taxes for rich people if you then cut services for poor people and you can have a budget that pays for infrastructure and education but the money has to come from somewhere and we ask people who already have lots of it to do a little more for their fellow americans were not hiding that fact yes we would raise taxes on the wealthiest americans not to punish them because we dont think taxes are punishment but because its necessary to meet the needs of the nation and any selfrespecting patriot would do so if they could in fact there is a group out thereand i would urge you to check them out mr speakercalled patriotic millionaires who understand that they may need to pay higher taxes if you already are making a million dollars a year would you pay a little extra just to make sure that lowincome pregnant women got some food for their kids if you are already making a million or more a year would you pay a little extra to make sure that little kids had head start to go to if youre already making a million dollars a year would you pay a little extra just to make sure that the federal workers dont have their pensions cut to pay for your tax cut thats just my thinking i dont want anybody to think the republicans are mean they do charitable work in their individual lives and thats a fact and i think people ought to know that but they dont think government has any role in helping people i disagree with that and call on americans to look carefully at the choices that they offer the budget for all is not a budget for the 1 percent its not a budget for the 99 percent but a budget for all because we care about the 1 percent too we want even the 1 percent to live in a good nation with fairness with economic opportunity with economic mobility with good roads good bridges good education clean water clean air we want this for everyone the budget for all attacks americas persistently high unemployment levels with more than 2 4 trillion over 10 years in jobcreating investment this plan utilizes every tool at the governments disposal to get our economy moving again including directhire programs that create school improvement corps park improvement corps student jobs corps and others targeted tax incentives that spur clean energy manufacturing cuttingedge technological investment in the private sector widespread domestic investment including an infrastructure bank a 556 billion surface transportation unlike this thing that they tried to pass today which is a 3month extension by the way can you believe it the republican caucus is always going on and on about uncertainty what did they do they created uncertainty by passing some 3month transportation bill my goodness it boggles the mind actually back to the budget for all there is approximately 1 7 trillion in widespread domestic investment unlike the republican budget the budget for all substantially reduces the deficit and does so in a way that does not devastate what americans value we achieve these notable benchmarks by focusing on the true drivers of our deficit unsustainable tax policy wars overseas and the policies that helped cause the recent recession rather than putting the middle class and the social safety net on the chopping block the budget creates a fairer america it ends tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of americans on schedule at the years end extends tax relief for middle class households and the vast majority of americans creates new tax brackets for millionaires and billionaires in line with the buffett rule principle eliminates tax code preferential treatment for capital gains and dividends abolishes corporate welfare for oil gas and coal companies eliminates loopholes that allow businesses to dodge their true tax liability creates a publicly funded federal election system that gets corporate money out of politics for good it responsibly and expeditiously ends our military presence in afghanistan leaving america more secure at home and abroad it also adapts our military to address 21st century threats through modernization the department of defense will spend less and stop contributing to the deficit but they will have what they need to keep america strong which is very important to all of us it provides a makingworkpay tax credit for families struggling with high gas and food costs extends an earned income tax credit and child dependent care credit invests in programs to stave off further foreclosure invests in childrens education by increasing education training and social services the budget for all is a budget for all i know that sounds repetitive but its important to note that the name of our budget reflects the reality of our budget and the reality of our budget is that we want to see rich poor and everybody in the middle do well in america that means a budget for all as i begin to wind down i just want to say that it is an honor to come before you to talk about the budget for all but its also an honor to talk about the ryan republican budget because the ryan republican budget offers a very different vision of america than the budget for all the ryan vision says that if we just could get rich people more money they might create some plants and equipment that will hire the rest of us the budget for all says no were in this together and were going to ask the wealthiest to pay more to invest in health education transportation and infrastructure so that we can have a stronger better greater america two visions of a nation one says austerity for the middle and working class and the poor and one says investment one says if you are out of luck youre on your own and one says as americans were all in this together i want to thank you for allowing me

the wonderful group of volunteers that serve in the united states peace corps the peace corps was the idea of john f kennedy he went to the university of michigan way back in 1960 and he started encouraging those college students to get involved in other countries and helping those countries in their social development and their cultural development in the name of peace a wonderful idea when he became president in 1961 president kennedy signed an executive order establishing the now important peace corps by 1966 there were over 15 000 young americans all volunteers that were working in the peace corps throughout the world since those early days of the peace corps 200 000 americans mostly young people 60 percent female have volunteered for their 2year service in the peace corps to work in third world countries on everything from health to farming to small business just helping other people throughout the world in a way that not only benefits them personally but benefits the recipients in these foreign countries they really are in my opinion along with our united states military the greatest ambassadors we have from our country to show that we are concerned about the welfare of other nations and they help build a better life for not only the people that they come in contact with but their generations and the children that they have as well i think they are really volunteer angels the work that a peace corps volunteer does is hard work its important but its very difficult theyre in a place far from home sometimes very remote and primitive areas and yet they on a daily basis are working to improve the lives of these individuals like i said i think its one of the best things that we do in this country as ambassadors are those young people in the peace corps its tough work its hard work i wouldnt do it its so difficult and you know there are people in our country a lot of them mainly young people who choose that as a calling to help other people in other countries ive got four kids and theyre all kind of wanting to save the world too theyve been to mexico and lived in orphanages in trinidad theyve been to honduras theyve been to africa and zambia all with that mentality of helping other people but the peace corps volunteers are people like that who spend at least 2 years in service to their country and sometimes when they are in those foreign countries they stick out they are noticeable by the people who live in that country because of that occasionally more often than it should be they attract crimes that occur against them that is the issue i want to address tonight over the last 10 years 1 000 americans mainly women have been sexually assaulted raped or assaulted in some other way in a foreign country representing the united states in the peace corps between 2000 and 2009 the peace corps themselves say there were over 221 rapes and attempted rapes almost 150 major sexual attacks and 700 other sexual assaults sexual assault is anything from groping to fondling to conduct that is offensive to that peace corps volunteer once again 1 000 crimes against peace corps volunteers recently the peace corps has announced that there is an average of 22 rapes a year against american peace corps volunteers this is not acceptable we are talking about real people they are real stories and they are real victims and i want to mention just a few of those tonight in the limited time that i have the first of those is a person that i have gotten to know personally a wonderful person jess smochek she joined the peace corps in 2004 on her first day as a peace corps volunteer in bangladesh a group of men started sexually groping her as she was just walking to the home that she was supposed to live in but no one really did anything she told the peace corps staff over and over again that she felt unsafe in bangladesh in the situation she was in but nobody did anything months later she came in contact with some men who kidnapped her they beat her and they sexually assaulted her but they werent through they abandoned her and threw her in a back alley somewhere in bangladesh according to jess the peace corps did everything they could to cover this up because they seemed to be more worried about the officials in bangladesh and what they thought might happen to their relationship with the united states than they did about caring for this victim of crime jess says that the peace corps blamed her for the conduct of others they blamed her for being a sexualassault victim a rape victim is never to blame for the crime that is committed against her it is the offender that is always to blame and we need to understand that these precious people who go overseas and represent us when a crime is committed against them we take their side and we dont assume they did anything wrong because they didnt they were just a victim of crime and the criminal is the one that should be held accountable for that conduct rape is never the fault of the victim its always the fault of the perpetrator but jess got no satisfaction from the peace corps according to her when she got home she was told to tell other people that she was coming back to the united states for medical reasons to have her wisdom teeth pulled out her case and a few others were brought to light recently by abc news and 20 20 bringing her story and others there are more and i will try to cover as many as i can in the time that i have laurel jackson was sent to romania a peace corps volunteer she was constantly harassed both physically and verbally she couldnt walk to her house where she was staying without verbal assaults and things being thrown at her she was spit on she was punched and rocks were thrown at her and her life was threatened several times this took place on a weekly basis they told her that a young american with blonde hair would stand out and that she was going to continue to be a victim she was fondled over 10 times when she tried to ride public transportation so she quit riding public transportation in romania and she started walking to help these folks in romania she said that the peace corps knew that these crimes were happening against her but she says they didnt take it seriously and no legal recourse was offered she was exposed to young men who exposed themselves and she was told well dont be around those people no one did anything and no one cared when she was followed home by some men she did talk to the police and they gave her some bodyguards she requested a new location but she was turned down and her transfer was denied when she returned home she tried to get counseling but she received no counseling for the crimes committed against her and here is what she has to say she said i would have liked the peace corps to have never put me there they knew it was unsafe for me they should have communicated with the police and the school in their own investigation i would have liked them to take me more seriously when i reported these crimes i would have liked to have had counseling when i returned but once again no one did anything when she left romania she told the peace corps not to send anybody else over there but they did and the person who replaced her was also racially abused with swastikas drawn on her residence because she was a jewish american the next individual im not going to use her real name because she doesnt want us to know her true identity but she grew up on a ranch she now lives in texas and she went to lesotho in may of 1996 to convince farmers to plant trees and show them how to do that but mary jo as i will call her stuck out the 2 years in this location even though it was difficult she lived in a small village in a string of villages that were about 80 miles south of maseru she had arranged her ticket back to the united states when she was attacked because she felt unsafe but here is what happened to her on an evening in 1999 mary jo and her neighbor left a village shop and were headed down a dirt a path to their home her neighbors exboyfriend followed and after a confrontation struck mary jo with a rock the blow knocked out six of her teeth destroyed her eye socket and left a palmsized crater in her face the rock had crushed the bones in her face and blood had started coming down the back into her throat she ended up alone in a deserted section of the hospital when she was finally found she says it was dark i was scared and i didnt know where anyone was taxis only ran from her village at night and so she couldnt really reach the peace corps so some neighbors found someone to drive her 20 miles to a local hospital she remembers a young woman stitching her up and she remembers being once again left alone abandoned she felt abandoned by her own country the next day she was moved to another hospital in south africa where a surgeon installed a metal plate to hold the bones together around her left eye and her chin and cheeks and nose the peace corps brought her back to her home base but she said they didnt help her in her recovery mary jo and her sister who had flown in from the united states had to sleep in a hotel because the agency wouldnt let them stay in a transit house and they had difficulty getting back to the united states she even had to beg the staff to take her to the airport at no time according to her did the peace corps ask her what they could do to help she said it was terrible i was so messed up she has had 10 operations in 21 2 years and surgeons put metal plates in her face and she also has false teeth mary jo being the remarkable person she is she wasnt really angry at the peace corps because she was attacked in this village by villagers she was angry because nobody in the agency seemed to care once again no one did anything it was like i was never in the peace corps she said and when she got home no one contacted her from the peace corps to check on her to see how this victim of crime was doing the attacker went to jail for 3 weeks but he was later released because mary jo had come back to the united states kate puzey was another angel from america who had gone to help a country that most of us have never heard of or would be able to locate on a map benin where she went in 2007 she was a teacher at a local school she formed a girls club to help empower the young women that were in this school its hard to be a girl in that part of the world according to kates cousin ms jacobs and the girls started speaking about some of the issues they were facing and they were starting to communicate that to kate before long the girls began to tell kate about another person who worked for the peace corps but wasnt an american he was a citizen of benin who was paid by the peace corps to help work with the peace corps his name was constant bio and these girls had said that this person was sexually assaulting these young girls she had started hearing that he had been sleeping with some of the girls he had gotten some of them pregnant and some of them had been raped at the request of several teachers kate sent an email to the peace corps in benins capital recommending that this person be fired from the peace corps she said please believe me im not someone who likes to create problems but this has been weighing on me heavily this was in an email that she sent that was found later and turned over to abc news this man is not someone i want representing the peace corps to this community bios brother worked as a manager in the peace corps office and she asked her role to be kept secret because she didnt want this criminal this rapist of young girls in this country to know that she had reported him but he found out about it anyway and so when he found out about it this is what happened on march 11 2009 the day after the peace corps authorities had fired this criminal bio and just 2 months short of completing her 2year commitment to the peace corps kate was found dead on her front porch with her throat slit the puzey family says the peace corps was insensitive in its treatment of them until officials had learned about the abc news report and then they got more involved unfortunately it was too late unfortunately no one did anything or paid attention before the news reported this murder this homicide the puzey family believes and states that the peace corps did little to show compassion or interest kates father harry says this she was my hero i thought maybe a representative would come to the house to talk to us or at least a letter in the mail but that did not happen because just a box showed up with my daughters belongings that came by deliveryman this is disrespectful to the life of this wonderful person and to her family now the peace corps has changed some of their procedures and we will get to that in just a minute the fifth example i want to talk about is jill hoxmeier she was a peace corps volunteer in guyana which is in south america she was a volunteer and she had created ways to help young women combat and understand the disease of hiv aids and other functions and other diseases she was teaching them lifeskill courses and wanted to help build stronger relationships between the mothers there and their daughters in 2007 a year into her service she was riding her bike home from work when she was assaulted dragged in the bushes and sexually assaulted by a man who had been following her for some time he choked her so hard she couldnt breathe or even scream she believes the peace corps needs to do more to help victims cut through the bureaucratic red tape and get the care they need it was too hard to navigate the problems that i had been going through all by myself once again insensitivity and nothing seemed to happen jess and other victims who are members of the peace corps who have been victims have formed an organization a support group but it is going to be a group that is going to be active they call it the first response action group and we will see more of them hopefully here on the hill today i met with the director of the peace corps aaron williams who happened to be in the peace corps years ago he is now the director i explained to him and talked to him about these issues and other cases that have come to light and he and i discussed this problem we are going to have hopefully a foreign affairs committee hearing on this very issue the peace corps and the relationship it has with its volunteers throughout the world how to make them safe how to take care of them once a crime is committed against them and how to take care of them after that crime has been committed against them the peace corps director mr williams assures me that they are going to develop a victim advocate program and hire a victim advocate they are going to help these victims of crime get counseling services they are going to help them medically even after they have been discharged from the peace corps unfortunately the bureau of labor has issues in dealing with these peace corps volunteers who are no longer in peace corps service who still have issues that they need to be taken care of and the peace corps is going to work with the department of labor to work out this bureaucratic nonsense every victim he says is going to have access to medical counseling and legal services and when a crime is committed against an american in the peace corps overseas the ambassador of that country is going to contact the highest ranking official in that country to let them know that america wants some results and wants to take care of the victim but also wants the perpetrator held accountable one of the most important things that director williams has agreed to do is to set up a victims advocacy program a victims advocacy advisory board made up of different groups like rainn and other ngos to give advice to the peace corps on how to take care of victims of crime so we are not going to let this issue die we are going to continue to promote and understand the peace corps but we want these wonderful people in the peace corps who have in the past been harmed and had crimes committed against them we want to rescue them as a nation we want to take care of them and the director of the peace corps says we will go back and help those people we want to take care of peace corps volunteers now that are being assaulted twentytwo a year that is 22 too many we dont want it to happen to anybody but we want to take care of them and we want to have procedures to make sure the peace corps is listening and takes care of victims of crime as well you know i spent most of my life at the court house in houston i was a prosecutor and criminal court judge for 30 years i saw many of these victims of crime sexual assault rape to me is the worst crime that can be committed against a person you can understand why people steal you can understand some crimes but that crime of sexual assault is a crime not of sex but a crime of power but it is also an attempt by the perpetrator to destroy the inner soul of the victim we need to understand that and we need to take these people these victims these wonderful volunteers of america and take care of them we are doing a better job as a nation in taking care of our wounded warriors in the military another great group of ambassadors that represents the rest of us they come home with all kinds of injuries and we are finally taking care of them we need to understand that these peace corps volunteers are just as precious and take care of them as well people cry peace peace but there can be no peace as long as there is one american peace corps volunteer that has no peace and thats just the way it is"],

defense appropriations actfrom being used to carry out section 526 of the energy independence and security act of 2007 section 526 prohibits all federal agencies from contracting for alternative fuels that emit higher levels of greenhouse gas emissions than conventional petroleum sources this means that if a federal agencyparticularly the department of defenseattempts to utilize an alternative fuel that even has one scintilla more carbon emissions than conventional fuels it is prohibited from doing so as a result section 526 limits innovation from dod to improve clean carbon capture technologies for alternative fuels thereby increasing our dependence on foreign oil and will only further increase fuel costs the amendment intends to remove the handcuffs placed on the agencies under this bill by section 526 this means that the dod will still be able to purchase canadian fuels with traces of oil sands that may create more of a carbon footprint than completely conventional fuel mr chair i support a full repeal of section 526 because the cost of refined product for dod has increased by over 500 in the last ten years when volume only increased by 30 furthermore within the last month the unitedstates navy spent 26 per gallon and the unitedstates air force just spent 59 per gallon for biofuels used for the administrations great green fleet demonstration while conventional fuel bears less of a cost on the pentagon when defense spending is already facing 600 billion in sequestration cuts we must find commonsense ways to best utilize taxpayer dollars this amendment takes a very important step of achieving this goal by prohibiting funding to carry out section 526 for the upcoming fiscal year at the dod with that in mind i commend my colleague from texasbill floresfor his
