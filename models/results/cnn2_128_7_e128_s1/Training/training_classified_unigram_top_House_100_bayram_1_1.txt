from illinois for the leadership that he has taken in this matter in trying to solve a very difficult situation madam chairman today we face another difficult decision on the public debt limit we can vote to increase the ceiling for 60 days or for a fiscal year we can aigue about the choice but we must do one or the other to do nothing would be to court disaster specifically before us is h r 2360 providing a temporary increase in the statutory limit on the public debt to 2 32 trillion this legislation would expire at midnight on july 17 and fur ther action on the limit would be required before that time we also have an opportunity to vote on a ways and means committee amendment which would raise the statutory limit to 2 578 trillion this is the amoun which the treasury department estimates would be sufficient to last through fiscal year 1988 the amendment responds to the administrations request for a clean longterm debt limit extension and would avoid disruptions caused by the prospect of a series of shortterm extensions the current debt limit of 2 3 trillion will expire at midnight on may 15this friday at that time it will revert to its permanent ceiling of 2 111 trillion which will be about 160 billion above actual outstanding debt after may 15 the federal government will be unable to borrow from the public to finance any current obligations or to rollover existing treasury obligations which mature after the current situation is very different from what has happened in the past in recent years debt limit extensions have been required as the government bumped up against the ceiling under those circumstances treasury had some administrative flexibilityincluding deferring investment inor disinvestingtrust fundsin order to continue on a shortterm basis to borrow from the public to pay bills due make benefit payments and meet other obligations those circumstances do not apply today when the debt limit expires on may 15 it will revert to a level that is 160 billion below actual debt subject to limit treasury spokesmen have testified that there is no administrative flexibility to manage cash when the debt is well in excess of the permanent limit no new treasury securities can be issued and maturing issues must be redeemed as long as cash is available officials have testified that the treasury will run out of cash on may 28 on that date treasury bills totaling 14 7 billion will mature and in the absence of an increase in the debt limit treasury will have to refund those maturing obligations from its current operating cash balance a similar refunding will occur on may 21 treasury has reported that it will not have sufficient cash to refund those obligations and that the unitedstates government would then be in default such a default would be unprecedented and one could only speculate upon the adverse reaction in financial markets to such an occurrence with regard to social security and other benefit payments due in june treasury has stated that it would be unable to make those payments even if the trust funds were disinvested this is because the debt is so far in excess of the permanent limit that disinvestment of the trust funds would not provide sufficient additional borrowing authority to allow treasury to raise the cash needed to pay benefits i should make it clear that i do not favor disinvestment because it costs taxpayers a lot of money in the long run and it confuses beneficiaries but that is not a real alternative now in any case according to treasury disinvestment would not work this time the requirement for increases in the debt limit is always a contentious issue and this year is no exception particularly when our fiscal house is so badly in need of repair there are tremendous pressures to try to resolve budget policy and budget process issues with the debt limit bill held hostage to that effort i cant quarrel with those who argue that the budget process doesnt work and perhaps should be completely reworked or with those who argue that we need to correct the constitutional flaws of the grammrudman law and restore its effectiveness i would only say that we have limited time in which to resolve these issues if they are linked to the debt limit extension and i would hope that we can start that essential process today the simple truth madam chairman is that the way to control our public debt is to control our tendencies here to authorize and appropriate more than we can afford by the time we are asked to raise the legal ceiling the money already has been spent and creditors are knocking on our door i understand that many of my colleagues feel that a vote on the debt limit is the only lever available to express their opposition to congressional spending excesses but unfortunately the bill for past expenditures are being presented and we are honor bound to pay madam chairman until a few years ago i did not vote for extensions of the debt limit but times and economic conditions have changed today i can see that we face potentially a very catastrophic time and i want to see my social security recipients and my veterans receive their checks when they are due if members are opposed to this i presume that they would vote against the debt extension but i for one am certainly going to support my chairman my committee and my president madam chairman i

house a compromise on the important national issue of plant closing notification the act states that american businesses have a moral and ethical responsibility to their workers and their families and to the communities which surround their facilities it says that business should provide reasonable advance notice of a plant closing or large layoff because it is good corporate citizenship and makes good common sense it should be the policy of all american businesses plant closing notification should not be a partisan or contentious issue in that vein this legislation is offered in the spirit of cooperation and compromise so that we may take affirmative action to assist american workers their families and their communities to effectively deal with the important transition period as a plant closes its doors we all are very aware that this plant closing notification issue has become the focus of debate and controversy in this years trade bill deliberations indeed it has become the center of fierce partisan fighting in the house my friend and colleague senator dan quayle the distinguished sponsor of this bill in the senate also indicates mandatory plant closing notification also has become the object of fierce warfare in that body this is a tragic situation for the working men and women of this nation for proponents of mandatory notification it has become an all or nothing push to have 60day courtenforced inflexible mandatory notification ofboth closings and layoffs proponents have said on the floor in the media and to me personally that they are willing to sacrifice the entire trade bill if the plant closing notification language is removed from the conference report opponents of the plant closing notification language in the trade bill are likewise fighting tooth and nail to completely do away with the notification language they say it will hurt job growth and our competitiveness and encourage the type of illogical hiring behavior we have seen in europe where employers have done some strange things that is the well known french companies known as forty niners in order to circumvent the notification requirements it is common knowledge both in and out of the white house that the president will veto the trade bill at least in part because of the mandatory plant closing notification provisions we all know that a nasty override fight has been threatened where proponents have promised to scuttle the entire trade bill and hold this issue over the heads of the president the vice president and those opposing mandatory notification however what has been lost in the partisan bickering and infighting has been the need to be concerned with the welfare and lives of those affected by plant closings or large permanent lay otis no one should come to work in the morning to find the gates locked no one should learn through a notice stapled on the company bulletin board that the next day the facility will close its doors forever it is time that we stop this counterproductive political warfare and compromise it is time to make peace and help the working men and women of this country who face this problem especially if there is a reasonable alternative which can bring us all together virtually everyone in this chamber and nearly everyone across the nation agree that businesses should give notice several groups including the general accounting office and the ota agree that early notification helps promote the efficient retraining and placement of dislocated workers and eases the burden of adjustment in the community it also substantially reduces the costs of unemployment for the public sector what we are in disagreement over then is what the appropriate role is for the federal government in promoting adequate notice this initiative comes half way between government inactionwhich is intolerable and mandatory inflexible courtenforced noticewhich would damage our competitiveness and hurt job creation this initiative calls upon and motivates the business sector to develop and articulate notification policies as part of the collective bargaining process in their communities in two important ways first by setting an example through written advance notice policies in government contracts and second by utilizing the effective tool of publicity to encourage both the development of and adherence to such a policy this act if passed would give the secretary of labor the authority to investigate plant closings assemble information on what was and was not done and publicize those instances where flagrant abuses of reasonable advance notice were found in addition this proposal would require any contractor who must file a written affirmative action statement to specify a notification policy in writing in a contract appendixincluding those instances where the policy would not apply that is if it would impede the continuation of operations at the facility mr cheney and i believe this proposal is a reasoanble compromise that will resolve the problems associated with courtenforced notification once the trade bill is vetoed this initiative solves one of the biggest obstacles to passage of a trade billa trade bill that will be good for trade and good for the american worker moreover this language could be adopted without delay to those who say that it is mandatory notice or nothing at all what they really are saying is that they do not want 980 million in job training money for the estimated 1 5 million people per year who lose their jobs to plant closings to those who do not want any notification at allvoluntary or mandatory what they really are saying is that all is fair they must believe that business moral and ethical responsibilities end at the plant gate most of us reject those positions and want to make a reasonable peace for the good of the country this compromise is a means to achieve an endto help assist american workers their families and their communities to receive reasonable

reduction in the coming fiscal year of about 36 5 billion half of that deficit reduction would be achieved through spending restraint and i am not using the word spending reductions because in fact we are reducing the level of increase in most spending categories we are not really making reductions in any spending categories so spending restraints under that budget resolution will save about 18 billion or 19 billion in fiscal year 1988 the other half of that deficit reduction plan is contingent on the passage of a tax bill this house must go about the work of deciding what elements should be in that tax package and it will not be an easy task if my colleagues have doubts that we can agree on that kind of tax revenue they certainly ought to be looking at amendments of this nature to cut back spending bills when those opportunities arise if my colleagues think the tax bill can pass but have doubts about it being signed into law then they ought to take a very careful look at each appropriation bill when amendments of this nature are offered in the new york times today an article points out that leaders in congress acknowledge that if the president holds to his promise to veto tax increases there may be no significant reduction in the federal deficit this year if he does hold to that veto threat the only way we can meet our deficit reduction objectives is to cut a little more as each opportunity arises that is what this bipartisan task force is all about i will call on my colleague the gentleman from iowa in a few minutes to speak to this issue as well because he cochairs this group with me but the amendment to this bill the energy and water appropriation bill which appropriates 16 2 billion addresses that spending level by asking for a 1 7percent acrosstheboard cut we have in this bill a 1 1 billion increase over last years spending level we have factored out a 700 million transfer from fiscal year 1987 the unexpended uranium enrichment moneys into fiscal year 1988for use in energy research and development on the understanding that that is a onetime transfer and it will not increase the baseline for those programs but we are still left with a 542 million spending increase in this bill the 542 million of additional spending that will have to be borrowed because we are still running a deficit in the neighborhood of 160 to 170 billion all we are asking in this amendment is to cut this increase in half save us from borrowing another 270 million it is a reasonable modest approach 1 7percent reduction in all the accounts in this bill i urge its adoption"], [0.49885988235473633, 0.9988598823547363, 1, "my colleagues and the american public in the next couple of days we are going to vote on a variety of amendments all of which will probably have more significance in the newspapers across the country than this one this amendment may in the long run be the most important amendment that we pass in this whole bill for two reasons pirst of all as colleagues and as members of the congress we must put on record that we are not going to allow the black programs of this country to grow and to allow the building of defense programs without our close scrutiny both technologically as well as financially second we are in the midst of developing what could become in history the most expensive weapons system in our country and that it would be improper for us to allow this project to continue and not to represent the people at home without the type of information this amendment grants us to see i think it is important to point

might have been better for the american public than never now never might have been better by all means during our one meeting we had three but two were to get the speeches that we heard every year when that was finished we had one more budget meeting where the minority was invited during that time we heard the term over and over again we cant continue to borrow and spend i agree with that that is a bad policy but what they also said they did not put it in writing but we will continue the business of taxing and spend then they said mr president pay as you go that is a good policy i agree with that the fastest growing part of our budget if you look at each one individually happens to be one on the domestic side and i notice we are not paying as we go on the domestic side to the public i am sorry we did not meet 108 billion as a deficit i did not believe that we could i happen to be one of those who did not think it was realistic but i am also sorry we did not meet 134 billion or 136 billion we said we played around with rea we were getting all sorts of money from that but cbo says that it is not true then we get to reconciliation and what do we do then we have supplementals

cutting the dollar amount equal to 3 2 percent of the total bill i would say to him rather than just slashing it across the board and in effect taking a slice right through that 2foot stack of

best position to take i think that the committee position is a bipartisan position i think that it is one that is based on fact as revealed in the hearings and i think that it is one that we should continue to support the argument lies by those of my colleagues who are going to support the bennett amendment that because of the differences between the house position and the senate position we will normally go halfway and we will end up at a higher level i am not so sure that that argument holds today because traditionally the difference between the senate committee position overall and the house has been fairly signifcant this year they are closer together and because of that i do not think that we are going to have the options of going halfway i think that we are going to have to realistically look at those programs and decide what it best what is the most reasonable level given the scarce resources that we have accordingly i think that there will be an increase over the committee position but i do not think that it is going to be of the magnitude that we have had in past years because of that i think that the committee position is sound a number of us are going to

as has been customary did not submit the chairmans mark they did not make a proposal but i would like to get to what the gentleman from wisconsin said just a moment ago about what is the real problem that we face today the real problem apart from the budget process is that you are telling me what we have to do that we have to go to the omb instead of sharing in the budget staff that is available and that tells me that we are shut out right there but the real problem today is spending and in violating the budget act after the budget has been accepted we violate the budget act and the problem is too much spending the fact is that your side has been in control of this house for so many years the deficit we are facing that you are having to fight with this budget and the cuts that we are all

alcoholism history or a physical problem whatever was covered and all of those are covered but if the individual posed a direct threat to the safety or the health of others we are making it explicit
