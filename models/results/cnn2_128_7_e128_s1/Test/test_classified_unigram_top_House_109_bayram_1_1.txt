before they should be honoring them would be even more appalling than it already is if it were not so commonplace in fact this pattern has repeated itself throughout president bushs tenure in office the unitedstates invasion of iraq in march 2003 coincided with the sharp decrease in veterans health care and other benefits for those who have bravely served in our nations military the backlog at veterans hospitals had never been greater than when the united states went to war in iraq now with more than half a million soldiers having served in iraq the burden on the va will only increase and while the unitedstates has spent over 200 billion for military operations and reconstruction in iraq over the past 2 years during this same timeperiod the bush administration and the republican

this letter to the leaders of the house budget committee to urge them to oppose the administrations budget request and to encourage them to find alternative funding for rural schools and roads finally if we are unable to block this sale on the front end by having the administration withdraw this proposal the plan would still have to be approved by this congress and i would encourage all of my colleagues to vote not just no but heck no in closing i am very optimistic we will be successful in blocking this reckless fire sale of our national forests and that our children and grandchildren

despite modern medicine it is heartbreaking when americans die because of modern medicine medical errors take lives medical errors waste money and medical errors are largely preventable based on available data medical errors kill up to 100 000 americans every year that number for sure is a ballpark estimate because we know that medical errors are underreported that is disturbing but hardly surprising the reality is that the consequences of reporting medical errors can be onerous which deters some who commit or witness medical errors from documenting them this legislation is intended to overcome that obstacle to reduce the number of medical errors we need to understand what causes them and address those causes accurate and complete information on medical errors is the first step h r 3205 or s 544 creates a secure voluntary medical error reporting system the system is carefully crafted to encourage informationsharing without undermining the ability of patients to obtain justice

foreign operations for their leadership in crafting this important legislation and for their work in ensuring that crucial national security priorities are appropriately funded even as our troops are still engaged in combat in afghanistan and iraq new challenges to our nations security and diplomatic interests are emerging this bill does a good job of meeting these challenges within the confines of an extremely tight budgetary environment i am particularly pleased that the conference agreement includes 75 million in assistance to armenia and 3 million for nagomo karabagh the conferees also agreed to maintain the military assistance parity between armenia and azerbaijan by approving 5 million in foreign millitary financing fmf and 75d 000 1i international military education and trainifi imet for both countries through these appropriations the conferees have continued to advance the political and economic development of the caucasus while also increasing stability in the region i was also heartened to see that the conferees continued this countrys longstanding support for our democratic ally israel by providing 2 5 billion in assistance for israel including 2 3 billion for military grants and 240 million in economic assistance at the same time the congress has wisely met the presidents request for 150 million for development programs for palestinians in the west bank ard gaza 75 million more than the current level only by helping the palestinian people to break the cycle of poverty and hopelessness can we hope to realize the vision of a twostate solution to decades of conflict between israel and the palestinians i believe that it is wise that our assistance to the palestinians goes to private voluntary organizations 20 percent or to contractors 80 percent all of which are selected and monitored by usaid while i hope that abu mazen will be able to end the corruption in the pa i think that it is prudent that the unitedstates forego direct transfers to the pa until there is greater transparency and accountability this has been a difficult year for our relationship with egypt even as cairo has proven a valuable partner in helping to facilitate the israeli pullout from gaza the countrys moves towards democracy have been halting i think that this bill properly funds our priorities by appropriating 1 8 billion in aid for egypt 1 3 billion for military grants and 495 million in economic assistance with 50 million of the economic assistance directed to programs that promote democracy and human rights and 50 million be for education including 5 million for scholarships for disadvantaged egyptian students at a time when the united states is viewed with skepticism and outright hostility in many parts of the world foreign

leadership and their really tireless efforts on this bipartisan bill that we reported out of committee it is really tragic that it has unraveled and that the spirit of bipartisanship has been totally eroded sadly the bill that i supported like all of us supported coming out of the committee a product that struck a fair balance a fair balance between regulatory oversight and the gses housing mission and goals would be turned on its head and gutted by the undemocratic provisions of the managers amendment that would be offered today it is rare that this house considers housing bills given our enormous housing crisis in our country it is shameful especially given those left homeless by katrina that our bipartisan efforts to support increased home ownership andi wealth building through the creation of an affordable housing trust fund have fallen victim to the rights wings ongoing assault on democracy and programs designed to help the poor the elderly the disabled the communities of color and our underserved community once again we have found ourselves in a situation where some of the republicans giveth and then they taketh away they give us a vote on a housing bill but then they ensure that it will be undercut by an extremist provision inserted into the managers amendment at the bidding of rightwing ideologues then just to ensure that these provisions prevail the republicans deny a fair vote on the frank amendment to strike it the nonprofit gag provision is not only extreme and undemocratic it is possibly unconstitutional it would gag nonpartisan speech and civic engagement and participation in our most fundamental of democratic activities let us be clear about the exact consequences of this outrageous gag provision it prohibits nonprofits that build affordable housing from engaging in nonpartisan voter registration it prohibits nonprofits from engaging in nonpartisan getouttovote efforts it prohibits nonprofits from engaging in nonpartisan election activities period what does that mean forexample it means a preacher whose church received affordable housing funds would be prohibited from calling on his parishioners to vote or even identify voting locations it means that residents of a building constructed with affordable housing funds will not be able to host a debate or an election watch party if their housing units are affiliated with the supportive housing program these measures are unconscionable they hurt the very people we are trying to help the poor the lowincome communities the elderly the disabled agd our underserved communities it is a testament to just how far right this house has tilted that the gentleman from massachusetts and democrats have been denied a fair vote that is all we ask for is a fair

also want to recognize the outgoing chairman and my good friend mike oxley for all of his work on this and the many pieces of legislation we have worked together on in a bipartisan way and particularly barney frank who saw through all of this cut through the politics and right to the chase and worked very hard in seeing that this important bill passed today h r 5337 works to keep the flow of direct foreign investment in the unitedstatesa strong while putting national security first this is a good jobs bill probusiness it is prolabor and this bill does all things to help to secure our nation yet not stop investment here in the united states i am pleased to say this bill enjoyed unanimous support in the committee on financial services passing on a 640 vote this bill enjoys the support of everyone from the center for american progress to the chamber of commerce this bill is about keeping the flow of foreign investment coming to the unitedstates and not driving these funds and their subsequent jobs out of the country but h r 5337 includes new tough safeguards put in place to ensure the security of america first this entire legislative initiative which has been pursued in a bipartisan fashion is a result of the botched handling of the dpw transaction the dubai ports deal that transaction involved a governmentowned company from dubai buying into various port assets here in the united states as a result a significant and appropriate focus of the committee has been to toughen the scrutiny for acquisitions by governmentowned companies since some governmentowned companies will make decisions based on government interests and not commercial interests no job no deal no transaction is worth threatening the safety of americans and this bill puts those conditions in place we all know this to be true but being from new york city it is even more true this bill will provide strong new safeguards to ensure our nations security and protect critical infrastructure but also continues to give cfius flexibility to exercise discretion allowing cfius to focus on the deals that raise real national security issues and not get bogged down into those deals with no national security implications at all for example this bill will allow cfius to go straight to an investigation phase if cfius so decides that the concerns are so serious as to merit this this is a good bill protecting national security guaranteeing the flow of direct foreign investment in the unitedstates and ensuring we will not have another dubai ports debacle and i therefore urge its passage in the house today and finally i understand the senate is in the process of moving their bill forward and i look forward to a constructive conference with the senate but this issue is far too important to compromise our national security or our nations economic security on backroom wheeling and dealing we in the house in a bipartisan manner recognize the diligence that went into crafting this bill and we will work for this to be the lead text in any conference the senate bill does not meet our important threshold on national or economic secufity this bill does and i know we in house who have worked as hard as we have will fight in conference for a good bill or we will take no bill at all i urge a yes vote on this bill it protects national security enhances the ability of more

and no one knows where it is that is not running government like a business when you look at all of the waste this government is being run like it is 1950 with misleading information now we are moving into a new economy knowledgedbased and informationbased and the government has not changed at all all of the guys who came in here with newt gingrich in 1994 you may remember the big republican revolution we are going to balance the budget we are going to run this thing like a business we are going to have a smaller government you are talking about a trillion dollar medicare drug program and you have to go back to your conservative base and you have to tell them that you passed it without any ability to negotiate down the drug prices good luck in the next 5 weeks you have to go back to them and say we are for free markets but when we ask to get reimportation into this country from canada and some of the g7 countries to drive the prices down you all were against it that is not worshiping the free market like you normally do there are a lot of contradictions going on here and i think we need to point this out to the american people another thing that i think is even more important as you guys move away from what your rhetoric is is that this president and this congress has borrowed more money from foreign interests than every single president in congress before you that is not conservative republicanism that is not running your government like a business if we dont get past all this rhetoric and doing something else we are not going to be able to move the country forward all of these games we are now competing with 1 3 billion citizens in china and 1 billion citizens in india hardcore brutal competition and we are not investing back into the american people we cannot even give them a slight pay raise when you guys have given this congress 30 000 in pay raises you cant even raise the minimum wage we have to invest in these people you cant compete with 300 million people against the whole globe and say just a small fraction of our society ip going to be able to compete if you can afford to go to a good private university if you can afford the tuition then you are going to be just fine if you are a trust fund baby you are going to be just fine let us invest in the american people we need everybody on the field playing for us and i think mr

section 1207 small and disadvantaged business utilization sadbu program through september 2009 i am very pleased to see this program extended in this bill because it has proven to be extremely effective in fighting discrimination in the defense contracting process and has been tremendously successful in ensuring that african americans latinos asians and native americans are able to compete more effectively for government contracts the goal of the sadbu program is to provide opportunities for all americans to take part in the defense contracting process since its inception in 1987 the sadbu program has helped to level the playing field for small and disadvantaged businesses however there is still a lot that needs to be done years of congressional hearings have shown that minorities have historically been unfairly excluded from both public and private construction contracts in general and from federal defense contracts in particular and a retent study by mgt of america revealed that minorityowned and womenowned businesses in new jersey still faced significant challenges in obtaining state contracts many business owners and representatives stated that their opportunities to perform work as subcontractors on state contracts decreased after the suspension of the states minority and women business enterprise program if the federal sadbu program were to end a lot of the progress we have made to this point would likely be erased thats why this extension is so important the 1207 program helps to correct the problems of discrimination without imposing an undue burden on other businesses it is not a quota it is not a setaside it is not a guarantee of contracts or dollars it is simply about fairness and the ability of minorityowned businesses to compete more
