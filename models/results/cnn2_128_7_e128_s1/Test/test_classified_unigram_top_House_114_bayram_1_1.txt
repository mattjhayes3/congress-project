offer an amendment to reauthorize the exportimport bank for three reasons one it is the will of the united states congress two it does good three if we dont do it great harm will be visited upon the

republicans no matter how conservative or how liberal the united states has reauthorized the exportimport bank it does good that is why they do it in fact i would respectfully suggest that the votes were there in rules committee yesterday to allow this amendment the good gentleman from texas who chairsand he is a gentleman he is a good gentlemanopened up his comments by saying 9 000 jobs in and around his district in the state of texas attributable to the exportimport bank they hang in the balance it does goodlast year 164 000 jobs supported by the exportimport bank 675 million transferred

protections but i understand and appreciate the chairmans goals here we all support the goal of increasing capital formation we just disagree on the best way to accomplish it my view is that the best way to stimulate investment is to treat investors well and protect them and that means strong investor protections i firmly believe that markets run more and better on confidence than on capital unfortunately this bill goes in the wrong direction it strips away protections that investors want in order to feel comfortable investing in startups and small companies i have particular concerns with title i of this bill which would allow very small and thinly traded companies to sell securities using the faster shelf registration process this raises serious market manipulation concerns let me explain why shelf registration allows companies to register securities in advance and then sell them later on short notice without getting sec approval traditionally shelf registration has been limited to larger wellknown companies like ge or apple that are already widely followed by the markets in other words companies that investors are already very familiar with in 2007 the sec decided to expand the number of companies who are eligible to use shelf registration in doing so however the sec was very careful to balance this against the need to maintain strong investor protection the sec was comfortable allowing certain very small companies to have a limited ability to use shelf registration to offer securities but only on the condition that the company have at least one class of securities listed on the exchange this was because the exchanges have their own standards that companies must meet in order to get their securities listed on the exchange these listing standards provide investors with sufficient assurance that the company is legitimate has a reasonably wide investor base and will have enough trading interest to assure a reasonable amount of liquidity in the stock without the comfort provided by the exchanges initial screening procedures for these companies however i am not sure we should be comfortable allowing these very small companies to use shelf registration but that is what this bill would do it would allow very small companies that trade in overthecounter markets to sell securities using shelf registration allowing a small company whose stock is very thinly traded to quickly sell a large amount of securities under the shelf registration raises real concerns about potential market manipulation a company could easily bid up the price of its stock and then immediately dump a large amount of new stock to investors at the artificially inflated prices as columbia professor john coffee noted in his testimony before the financial services committee on this proposal last congress letting a small company with a modest 50 million public float use shelf registration to attempt to sell 150 million in securities invites potential disaster and investor confusion mr chair i include in the record his entire very critical testimony of the dangers of this legislation"], [0.0050920844078063965, 0.4949079155921936, 0, "i thank the gentlewoman during my 15 years as a federal prosecutor in syracuse new york i witnessed firsthand on a daily basis the devastating impacts of drug use in general and of heroin in particular and the terrible impacts it had on the wellbeing of our children on the lives of those directly involved and on the safety of our community tragically the devastating impact of heroin and other opioids has gotten much worse in recent years as a federal prosecutor i have seen every possible drug known to man on the streets i have never seen anything that has had the devastating effects that heroin has had on our communities literally fatal incidents are happening on a regular basis one of my top priorities during my time in washington has been to facilitate a community dialogue on this public health epidemic to discuss ways of treating and preventing addiction at every forum at every town hall at every business i visit at every hospital i visit i hear from my constituents of the devastation this epidemic is inflicting on our communities i hear tragic stories about friends or family members succumbing to heroin addiction i hear from medical workers and first responders about the strain this epidemic is placing on their resources i hear stories of pain and loss and i want to share a few of those with you to illustrate what i am talking about during the course of the six town halls i have conducted or have participated in throughout my district over the last several months we have routinely heard of the stories of victims in particular families have told of the loved ones they have lost one individual really caught my attention they all caught my attention but this one was pretty devastating morgan axe was a beautiful young woman and a great athletejust a great kid overallwho battled addiction with heroin for several years at 24 years old she became pregnant and she stopped taking heroin completely in order to protect her baby she stopped taking any drugs that would have helped her with her cravings and she was doing great at the fifth monthat 5 months of being cleana boyfriend thought it would be a good idea to give her a dose of heroin we have the telephone records to show it she took that heroin and she died as did her baby her mother had to come to that forum and talk about this i applaud her for the openness with which she talked about it for the pain that she shared with us and for the lessons that can be learned from this it can happen to anybody it is not an inner city drug when we were growing up we used to think of heroin users as individuals who would be under a bridge somewhere or in an alley but that is not the way it is it affects those in the suburbs the wealthy the poor and everyone in between i have one other quick story when i was renting my congressional office the individual who was showing me the office had a sad look in his eye he began to tell me the story about his daughter who was the final four mvp for the ncaa junior college lacrosse the year before she died of a heroin overdose because she got into heroin after that championship it is an epidemic with enormous consequences and it is getting worse the epidemic of addiction is claiming the lives from every age class and race like i mentioned i know that society doesnt like to talk about drugs addiction and overdose but this is a problem that we can no longer ignore and it is one that we must absolutely positively address the scourge must be stopped i am absolutely proud to be part of the house action that is being taken this week on several measures that will help to fight against this growing opioid epidemic and through the passage of my drug kingpin bill earlier today much remains to be done and i hope that congress will build on the actions this week and will continue to work on efforts in a bipartisan manner so we can fight back and save people from addiction"], [0.0067598819732666016, 0.5067598819732666, 1, "i thank the

play by the rules we cant allow cheating to hurt our workers their wages our businesses or our economy and the american people get it that is why they are so apprehensive about any trade deal this

if some foreign company is going to have access to our markets they are going to play by the rules when i take a look at this trade promotion authority legislation i ask myself how can you ever get a good trade deal out of this when the rules are rigged against america one simple example everyone agrees we have had a bipartisan consensus in this housemore than 230 members have signed on to a letter in the past saying we have got to stop countries that manipulate their currency to try to make their products produced by their companies look cheaper than american products yet this legislation would prohibit us from going after the countries that are cheating to prevent the companies in those countries from cheating so how are we going to stop the companies that we know are pirating that are stealing that are cheating against us how are we ever going to stop them if the rules require us to go through those countries to try to get those companies to abide by the rules when the country is cheating i guarantee you the companies are going to cheat and that is not the way you get foreigners to access our market we can do much better we have to do much better because
