organizations that take advantage of the significant disparity between the taxes levied on cigarettes across the states for example a pack of cigarettes that costs 13 in a hightax state like new york will cost only about 5 in a lowtax state such as virginia these differences create a highly lucrative market for individuals to evade the local sales tax and purchase cigarettes in one locality and

amendment to h r 2076"]], "top_unsure": [[6.693601608276367e-05, 0.49993306398391724, 0, "were at the end of another week of session here you know the presidents been trayeling around the country i know that costs millions and millions of dollars to put air force one in motion hopping all over the country ive also seen what it takes from a security standpoint to prepare for a president to come anywhere because of the sniper weapons available these days they have to be so thorough the secret service has to go along and check anything they can see they have to check out well that takes several days so to the average person you think well gee the president just comes in hes gone in 30 minutes no big deal but for those whose lifes work it is in the government to make sure that things go properly it is an extremely onerous task we owe so much to those who protect those who are leaving the country not so much the people in congress i know we had people in congress who were advocating that we all ought to have our own security detail but as one of my constituents said one morning at 2 in walmart wow you really dont have any security and i said no its just you me and the syrup here i dont think we should have to have security if it comes to that this country is in such trouble that im not sure well have it back in any proper form anyway in the meantime i am an advocate of letting people in washington d c who arent prior convicted felons and who meet the requirements of being able to carry let folks carry not here in the capitol of course you dont need one here weve got the finest we could hope for i know you know the capitol police are fantastic weve got some up in the gallery who make sure that things are orderly up there and as we know from the last 20 years there are times theyve had to lay down their lives to protect the public here so we are greatly blessed but it all comes back to this that were talking about millions and millions of dollars for the president to go anywhere ever since 1 week ago we were chastised by the president here on the house floor as he spoke from the podium here that we needed to pass his bill somebody else counted them i didnt weve got to pass this bill right now right away right now pass this bill now it turns out the whole time the president was saying this bill there was no such bill which brought back memories of exactly 2 years before when at that time the president demanded to come address a joint session of congress under the rules of congress the laws of the land no one can demand to come speak to the senate or house unless theyre invited but that was overlooked back in september of 2009 the president was not doing well in the polling with his health care ideas he figured if he came and spoke here on the floor because he is such a gifted reader that he might be able to persuade people to support a bill they otherwise didnt like so he came and he spoke he spoke of this bill my bill this plan my plan i couldnt find a bill i couldnt find a plan anywhere it was even 2 weeks later that i asked the cabinet member charged with health and human servicesits her areasince the president was so accusatory and said if any of you misrepresent my bill i am going to call you out i wanted to make sure i didnt misrepresent anything i asked the secretary of health and human services where do i get a copy of the presidents bill she said these words i think he was talking about a set of principles ah it couldnt have been he said this bill my bill this plan my plan he didnt have a plan he didnt have a bill he was talking about a set of principles how could he condemn us for misrepresenting a bill or a plan that he didnt have not then it turns out he didnt so as i heard the president say repeatedly to pass this bill pass this bill to do it right now right now i wondered if yet again 2 years later he was making the same errordemanding we pass a bill that didnt exist it turns out my concerns were wellfounded he had no bill he had no plan he had a speech but as weve learned from cbo generally speaking unless theyre chastised sufficiently by the president or the white house cbo cannot score a speech if theyre chastised sufficiently then cbo will give them some sort of scoring because there are pressures that can be brought to bear from the white house that somehow apparently make them sensitive which is another whole point i really dont believe that we will be able to fix the problems of the massive overspending the overtaxing the dramatic problems with the overvexation the overburdensome laws and regulations until we change a number of things one of those is we eliminate the congressional budget office and eliminate the rules under which bills are scored those rules were put in place in 1974 by the same congress that forced the military to rush out of vietnam leaving many report around 2 million people who had helped us to be wiped outmurdered killedbecause the congress didnt care that same congress put in rules that would require that a bill be scored as to the effect it would have on our economy on spending on revenue it required it would be scored under rules that do not allow the scorer to take into consideration reality history facts all theyre allowed to do is to consider the formulasthe rules under which theyre bound by that 1974 congress thats it now weve gotten horrible scoring and it cant be blamed on cbo or on the joint commission on taxation its the rules that are the problem but when a group comes back with a score of around 800 billion and then later they have to confirm in reality its more like say 1 1 trillion then you realize on an 800 billion bill that the score really should put boldly that you have to consider that with a 30 to 40 percent margin of error plus or minus so here is the score plus or minus 30 or 40 percent and thats about the best we can do since that is the best that cbo can apparently do its time to have some massive changes in this place its time to use reality its time to use history and not some 1974 liberal congress idea of how we get the government taking over everybodys lives thats no way to run government unless youre in some country besides the united states of america theres an old saying in this town mr speaker no matter how cynical you get its never enough to catch up in my 61 2 years here in congress ive found thats certainly true because you want to trust everybody you want to believe that when people say things in this town its true but then you find out for example that you can have a leader of the country tell everybody that we need to go after the big oil companies theyre having massive profits and were going after those companies then you find out that the bill thats produced to go after those companies has no adverse effect on those companies whatsoever and in fact it will make them even bigger profits than they might have ever imagined now i know there have been some issues about the bill title american jobs act of 2011 and yes i am the one who filed the american jobs act of i think it will be a wonderful thing when we in this body can work together we can have our disagreements i found in a deacon body even though there was a lot of nasty mean things said that if we had prayer together and we came together we had meals together we could work together one of the things thats so troubling on this floor is when people come so close to impugning the integrity of other people i know some people that have diametrically opposed views of how this country should work but i know in their heart they want the country to work well and succeed i just believe from history theyre wrong but there are people in this body who you might think we were so far from each other politically that we wouldnt want to have anything to do with each other dennis kucinich is one of those people that is quite far afield from me on so many political issues but dennis has never lied to me he has always been up front i find him to be a man of conviction and i find him refreshing marcy kaptur and i disagree on many issues maybe most issues but i know she is a person of integrity she has never lied to me she has never been anything but honest with me there are numerous people bill delahunt and i would spar in judiciary committee many many times other committees subcommittees here on floor but i always found bill delahuntwhat i would call a liberal from massachusetts a democratto be an honorable man a man of integrity and i believe with all my heart that he had a heart for this country and he wanted to see it work we ought to be able to work together when people realize that we have got common goals the common goal being the good of the country so lets at least find things we could agree on when i was engaged in trialsand i have been involved in many trials as an attorney and as a judge and then oversaw them briefly as a chief justice but engaged as a lawyerthere were many times when we started in the discovery process that i told opposing counsel we can do this one of two ways we can fight scrape and fuss over every question over every interrogatory over every deposition but we both know the rules require certain things will need to be produced that certain things will need to be disclosed so i would prefer to do it that way amicably and the people that win are the clients because they dont have to pay near as much money because it doesnt take near as much time if you can agree on the things that you know you are going to have to produce and quit having a motion to compel a motion to protect all this kind of stuff sometimes we had attorneys that could work together well and sometimes they would hit me with a discovery demand out of the blue that was so grossly unfair but not illegal that you would find out okay this is the way you want to go i didnt want to go this way but i believe so strongly in the interests of the person i am representing and believe so strongly in the process itself that if you want a fight you will have a fight if somebody is going to travel around the country condemning me and other people in this body for refusing to pass a bill knowing that that bill does not exist it is not in existence because legally it has not been filed then we are going to do some battle over that if i am going to be condemned for a week for refusing to pass an american jobs act of 2011 well after 6 days or so its time to have an american jobs act that we can pass or at least that i could go along with i would certainly like the president and others to know i am flexible but the corporate tax is one of the most insidious taxes that we have in this country because its not an honest tax governments had represented to voters for years and years that we have got this tax over here we go after the mean evil greedy corporationsand some do have greed as a material factor in their businessbut the thing is thats not what a corporate tax is about a corporation cannot stay in existence if they dont have their customers or clientele pay the corporate tax so a corporate tax is not actually a tax on a corporation a corporate tax is instead requiring the corporation to be the collection agent oh make no mistake that tax will come from the rankandfile people across this great country theyre the ones that are going to pay that tax the corporations are a collection agent they collect the tax from their customers and then they pass it on to the federal government the trouble is in this country now we have the highest corporate tax in the world any developing nation for sure 35 percent in china 17 percent and they do cut deals where they will reduce it to zero tax for 5 years i have been told by some people there you get a dealzero tax for 5 years and then gradually work up to 17 not here in the united states we are going to slap a 35 percent tax on anything a company in america produces that sure makes it tough to compete in the global market now that we have got planes ships that move so quickly rail that goes across borders it is important that we be able to compete in the global market and if we are going to slap a 35 percent tariff on everything an american company produces in this country they are going to have to move and go to a country where there is not such a high collection fee that corporations are required to collect in this country they are going to go to a country like china that charges a lot less for a collection fee from the customers but if people could get their mind around the fact that it isnt making the greedy corporations pay in fact the greediest corporations are the ones that dont pay anything you know we found out that the close cronies of the president at ge are able not to pay any tax but the momandpoptype small business corporations they are having to pay the tax gibson is employing a lot of people i got a gibson guitar when i was 8 years old a fantastic guitar we are going to send in armed agents to harass those people thats no way to draw business back into this country you reduce the corporate tax if you reduce it at all the more you reduce it the more jobs are going to come back because that means more and more corporations will be able to compete in the global market and theyll be able to come back here union members not the government union membersand that seems to be where union leadership wants to go these days forget the manufacturing unions we are driving those jobs out of america but any historian will tell you when a nation that is protecting other nationsand we are we are protecting the free worldthat requires that nation to have a military any nation that cannot provide its own military with the things it needs to protect itselfthat means steel it means all kinds of metal it means gunpowder it means actually uranium as we have nuclear subs and ships it means wood products it means tires we are buying tires for humvees from china these days excuse me we have to be able to have no supply line to be able to provide the things that we in this country need to defend ourselves and provide them in this country its time to quit driving companies including manufacturing jobs out of the country this bill drives more jobs out you have got to have energy those that are familiar with the battle of the bulge can dispel the myth that some think gee the war was won before the battle of the bulge some say they buy into the russians explanation that we had whipped the germans all by ourselves we didnt need the allies otherwise but if you really study the battle of the bulge what won that for the allies was the fact that the germans were running out of gasoline so what does the president do to help us he said go against and take the profits of these massive big oil companies instead page 151 through 154 he rips the heart out of the independent oil and gas industry in order to drill a well in america you have to raise capital if youre one of the majors like exxon like british petroleum the dear friends of the president if youre one of those big companies youve got enough money of your own youre capitalized you can do these things but for over 94 percent of the wells drilled in the continental united states theyre raising money they have to raise capital well this knocks the fool out of their ability to raise capital not only that it repeals the deductions that are not even available to any company that produces more than a thousand barrels of oil a day thats the majors so all this will do is eliminate over 94 percent of the wells drilled in the continental united states the result will be a higher cost of oil it will make even more profits for the presidents friends at british petroleum british petroleum is friends of the president they love the capandtrade idea and theyre going to love this bill by the president also we know weve heard complaint after complaint from state after state and theyre saying you are giving us so many unfunded mandates we just cant take this any more stop already we just cant stand this kind of help much longer so if you look through this bill you end up finding out there is a little provisionand like i say i was up until about 5 tuesday going through this lovely thing but there is a provision at the bottom of one of the pages rather obscure and my staff made copies ive got the best staff in the world but i dont believe they got my tag back on that page the title of the little section is federal and state immunity but then you read the section it has nothing to do with federal immunity under the law the federal government and the state government are immune from being sued but in that provision it actually says that gee if a state accepts any money at all from the federal government any money at all then they have effectively waived their sovereign immunity and are therefore subject to suit i just found it its page 133 a states receipt or use of federal financial assistance for any program or activity of a state shall constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity under the 11th amendment to the constitution or otherwise to a suit brought by an employee or applicant for employment of that program or activity it goes on so at a time when states say we cant afford any more unfunded mandates the president proposes a bill to let them get sued a bunch more by people who are unemployed thats just got to be great news and were seeing the hearings go on about solyndra this administration it appears from the evidence well get the final verdict later but they rushed in to give them 500 million of stimulus money so crony capitalism could occur and certain people could engorge themselves and all at the taxpayers expense and it turns out that probably future generations will be paying for that if you like the way that was handled youve got to be reassured because in this bill there are a number of references that green programs like solyndra will have priority and well rush a lot more money out there there are a lot of things we could agree on in that bill that the president never had anybody willing to file there was a provision for a payroll tax holiday well you would figure id support that im the guy who proposed it 3 years ago and personally explained it to the president and larry summers in january of 2009 but it sure wouldve been better if we did it before this administration squandered 4 5 trillion more than we brought in we couldve given everybody in the united states who pays income tax a tax holiday for 3 years and it wouldve only run up 3 6 trillion we would have saved 900 billion if you dont think that people having all of their own income tax from 3 years wouldve stimulated this economy then you need to embrace this presidents bill because youll love it nonetheless there are things that we could agree on both houses both parties i think agree that we were willing to sell some more broadband spectrum thats there in the bill but then he uses that as a platform to create another bureaucracy a big brother coming into your computer because its the public safety broadband corporation thats created and will just really make sure that big brother government intrudes in your life when you boil it all down we have a moral problem in america the founders continually pointed to god and said thats where we need to have our focus as ben franklin said without his concurring aid we will succeed in our political building no better than the builders of babel well be confounded by our local partial interests and we ourselves shall become a byword down through the ages so whether anybody believes in god or not as the founders did over a third of the declaration of independence signers were not just christians they were ordained ministers to take ones eyes off of self and put them on something higher and greater avoids the kind of engorgement the selfsatisfaction the selfemphasis that weve gotten into thats the reason you run up trillions of dollars of debt without any regard for the children the grandchildren and the generations to come i have to make this personal note reference it breaks my heart to see that in college football nobody loves college football more than i do i attended texas a m and i know a lot of people are excited about texas a m perhaps going to the southeastern conference for money all about money the traditions of texas a m make it unique and i think the greatest public institution of higher education in the country im very proud of it but its the traditions and now we see that over a hundred years of tradition going back to 1876 are ready to be thrown away for money just money greed money forget tradition that makes your institution great forget it all forget the state rivalries forget it all were talking about cash isnt that what got us in trouble in this country in the first place when we put cash greed for ourselves above the interests of the country or the institutions we represent to close with this example my senior year in the corps cadets i was the second level below the corps commander i was one level right below the commander there were four of us at that level major unit commanders there was a corps commander he didnt get along very well he didnt play very well with others and the first meeting we had all of the senior leaders in the corps cadets he had his staff put together tables end to end he got up there with a corncob pipe like macarthur walked up and down and condescended and cajoled all his classmates like they were 2yearolds i approached him after the meeting and i said man these guys have seen you naked were all classmates were all friends you need to try to work together dont just condemn everybody and i think if we could get to that level in herenot that we run around naked togetherbut just where we can work together as friends disagreeing on issues but unless one person has a 100 percent lock on gods truth 100 percent of the time we should listen to each other not condemn each other and we can get these things worked out put greed aside and help this country last 200 more years with that i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.0004762411117553711, 0.5004762411117554, 0, "today i

would ever get if we would just simply give him about a trillion dollars to give away to his friends that that would make it all better well it didnt what weve seen over and over from this administration is a complete disregard for the rule of law when you look at all the people who have been drawn into this country illegally in violation of our immigration lawseven though there is no country in the world that allows the immigration that this country does and the wide open gates that we do but we do have parameters weve been told there may be a billion billion and a half people who want to come to this country if they did all at once they would overwhelm us and there would be no country for others to come to why do so many want to come here its because weve always had regard for

done a better job of being fair across the board than any other country in history thats why so many want to come here because weve had more jobs a better economy and made more advancements than any country in history yet on the issue of immigration this president stands up and announces were going to ignore the law just as he did on marriage there is a proper law that was signed into law by president bill clinton enacted by congress upheld and he says were going to ignore that because we dont like it there goes the rule of law when it comes to obamacare weve passed this law but you know what so many of the people that pushed this through and rammed it down the throats of america theyre asking for waivers and theyre good friends so were going to give them waivers so they can ignore the rule of law how about the auto bailout ignored the bankruptcy law it ignored the constitution and took away dealerships and gave them to others this was a place where the rule of law was completely ignored then this president stands up and says not only are we going to ignore the rule of law duly passed law but as i speak i will create law i now speak into effect new work visas and work permits that have never existed but just as the ancient pharaohs or the leaders of the ancient world as i speak so it must be im speaking into effect new work permits im speaking into effect an

meetings in this matter on what basis did you take this action on what other matters was such action taken look the rule of law required that when it turned out there were possibly thousands of abuses of the national security letter in a republican administration i picked up the phone called the chief of staff of my president and said this is unforgivable we need a new attorney general where is my friend across the aisle who will step up and say the rule of law is too important we have justice kagan who is ignoring law 28 unitedstatesc 455 that says you must disqualify yourself in any case in which your impartiality might reasonably be questioned it must be reasonably expected that either she ignored the law did not do her job as solicitor general was totally negligent or she did her job

rules committee last night and here on the floor this morning it reminds me that people who have been here a long time love cookie cutters and so many of the people that are opposed to this bill are opposed to it because they like cookie cutters they like to say that this program works here and there and everywhere as opposed to giving flexibility to the states cookie cutters are used in education funding they are used in medicaid funding they are used in this particular funding for transportation and theyre used to limit the flexibility of states who really know what their program is its far better for the district five mpo in central florida to put together a program build it from the ground up determine what their needs are and what modes of transportation they would like to have build that program send it up to the state the legislature passes it and it becomes law but no right now there are so many different little programs that you have to put money into that you cannot devise your own program you have to live within the constraints of a federal government that believes in cookie cutters and its sad so when you start talking about people who have been around for 35 years and theyve never seen a program like thisno because they love cookie cutters they love it the way it is because it promotes the federal government making decisions for the states and local communities as opposed to the local communities being able to develop their own programs so let me tell you what they did to florida in florida at one point in time back in the times that were talking about we got 69 percent of our money back while states in other areas of the country including the northeast got maybe two times that amount of money so the money and the funding and the flexibility were all nonexistent why if i were on the take i would have liked to have kept it the way it was but when we begin flattening it out and giving every state a chance and returning more moneys back to the state and with that return also allowing them to make their own choices on how they would fund their transportation projects and what kind of needs they have and being able to with

the committee if it is adopted the bill will immediately proceed to final passage as amended my amendment contains three components that will ensure we continue to provide the best security to our nation first it would instruct the head of each element of the intelligence community to take all steps and precautions to ensure that the intelligence and military capability of the united states is not improperly transferred or stolen by a foreign nation or a state sponsor of terrorism we live in a time where information is readily available and transferable at the click of a mouse or the stroke of a keyboard while the advantages of such readily available information have helped spur economic opportunities and growth it has also opened the door for one of the many intelligence challenges we face as a nation we already have in place a number of protocols that dictate how and under what circumstances our military can transfer technology goods and services to our allies across the globe but it is imperative that we do everything we can to ensure this information doesnt end up in the hands of unfriendly foreign powers or state sponsors of terrorism within the past few years we have seen foreign nations attempt to steal our nations military technology and sensitive information through the use of joint ventures and other techniques we must do everything that we can to ensure that our military and intelligence secrets remain our secrets many of those same capabilities reside in are accessed through or are enabled through cyberspace reliable access to cyberspace is critical to unitedstates national security public safety and economic wellbeing but cyberthreats continue to grow in scope and severity daily tens of thousands of new malicious software programs originating from iran or china are identified each day threatening our security our economy and our citizens no longer do we need to just worry about foreign spies infiltrating our military and intelligence agencies our worry must now extend to the young man or woman sitting in their apartment 6 000 miles away utilizing a laptop to tap into our government mainframes secondly my amendment would direct the head of

information remain protected from improper transfer theft or cybersecurity attack finally my amendment would ensure that we continue to promote american businesses and keep jobsespecially one of such crucial importancein america as the number of threats to our nation has grown and the required response has put a large demand on the intelligence community we have increasingly relied on contractors to perform tasks to ensure the safety of our nation this amendment would instruct our intelligence community to always put american workers first and not outsource these jobs to foreignowned companies i have witnessed the detrimental effects that outsourcing has had numerous areas of our country have also seen the ugly effects of outsourcing and we must put american workers and businesses first especially in the critical sphere of intelligence compounding the economic damage outsourcing has done to our country the national security risk posed by allowing foreign companies to operate our

these problems in the next 10 days so we have a choice 2 months of certainty or a few days of total uncertainty who knows whats going to happen economists have said if we dont extend the payroll tax and unemployment compensation that it will have significant adverse effects on the economy so we should do this we should do it for 2 months and work on it for 2 months and hopefully well have a solution at the end of 2 months we certainly wont have a solution at the end of 2 weeks so thats the choice when people talk about certainty this is a group that talked about certainty and then changed the regulations on light bulbs that have been in effect for 4 years on a 2week notice here we are with certainty for 2 months and they say well uncertainty is a problem so lets do it in 2 weeks lets have some certainty 2 months of certainty lets work on it and we can get a fullyear solution were not going to do that the way were headed i would hope that we would adopt the senate amendments leave town send the bill to the president and be finished with it rather than invite all of this uncertainty which is certainly going to befall us if we dont do that"],

national flood insurance program while i rise today in support of this shortterm extension i have to be frank and honest and tell you that i am disappointed that we havent found both chambers coming together to reauthorize this program for 5 years what this does is to create uncertainty in the market for the individual who may have a home in a floodplain or for a community that has many of its pieces of property in a floodplain without having a longterm bill it creates uncertainty for them it creates uncertainty in the housing market which has obviously gone through some very strenuous times since the 2008 financial crisis this legislation a longterm fix would help breed certainty in that market as well as we look back at last summer we passed this legislation with both sides of the aisle coming together it doesnt happen very often it was one of those great moments in the house where it was a vote of 40622 both republicans and democrats joined hands in passing this legislation now were just waiting for the senate to act its a bill thats going to save 4 2 billion over the course of 10 years it includes reforms that are going to save taxpayers money by eliminating unnecessary rate subsidies and encouraging the development of a private flood insurance market i support the shortterm extension but i also encourage the senate to act"], [0.011200875043869019, 0.488799124956131,

and ranking minority member of the committee on rules thatll be yours truly and ms slaughter and 30 minutes will be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on ways and means and 30 minutes will be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on the budget since 1962 there have been 74 increases in the debt ceiling at this moment we begin what is clearly the single most historic debate on any measure that addresses increasing the debt ceiling why because for the first time we are working to get at the root cause of why it is that the debt ceiling needs to be increased as the debate negotiations over the looming debt ceiling limit have proceeded over the last weeks and months people across this country are asking how did we get to this point how was the crisis created and how do we resolve it as is often the case we cant hope to reach a solution without understanding the fundamental problem at the very start of this process several months ago many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle advocated strongly and worked very very hard for an increase in the debt ceiling that had no strings attached to it at all had nothing attached to it at all they argued that the debt ceiling had been increased 10 times over the last decade and it was just a perfunctory legislative act that should be done without any broader debate or accompanying policy changes that approach is precisely the fundamental problem and that approach is one that has throughout the past several decades led to what for all intents and purposes was little more than a blind increase in the debt ceiling itself for years and years and years the federal government has spent money that it does not have expanding the size and scope of government and its reach without regard to the longterm fiscal consequences when the tax dollars ran out it turned to borrowing voraciously each and every time the borrowed money ran out the federal government just borrowed more it was always clear that catastrophic consequences would ensue if the unitedstates government defaulted on its obligations so congress took the path of least resistance and simply raised the debt ceiling but sometimes the path of least resistance is in fact the road to ruin raising the debt ceiling without taking measures to address the underlying issues merely put off the crisis for a short time making it larger and more entrenched in the process thats how we got to the point where we are today and thats why from the very outset republicans have insisted that this time would be different we refused to contemplate yet another debt ceiling increase without addressing the underlying cycle of reckless unaccountable spending and borrowing yes we absolutely must avert the looming crisis that could force the united states government to default and put our ailing economy into a tailspin but we cannot and will not do so in a way that creates an even bigger crisis down the road republicans put washington on notice that the era of unchecked spending was coming to an end at the start of this congress with the passage of h r 1 which dramatically cut spending for the current fiscal year we continued the process of imposing new levels of fiscal discipline with the passage of our budget resolution for the coming fiscal year this measure outlined not just spending cuts but longterm reforms that would help to prevent entitlement programs from collapsing into insolvency and dragging the rest of the economy along with them in may of this year at the economic club of new york speaker boehner once again outlined the republican agenda for creating growth and opportunity creating jobs and opportunity for our fellow americans through greater fiscal discipline and more rigorous accountability for the size and scope of government from the very start of this new majority and at every step of the way since republicans have been fighting for real solutions to the fiscal mess that the country finds itself in we promised that we would start a new course and it is with a great deal of pride that i stand here and say we have done just that todays underlying legislation this underlying measure is a dramatic stride forward in our ongoing quest while we have steadily laid the groundwork over the last 6 months this plan represents the single most significant most fundamental reform to our fiscal situation in the modern era it makes immediate enormous cuts in federal spending these cuts are greater than the corresponding increase in the debt ceiling ensuring that action taken to avert an immediate crisis is coupled with a massive down payment on dealing with the longterm crisis it sets caps on spending in order to impose discipline and accountability on the process going forward it establishes a joint select committee that will be directed to identify at least 1 8 trillion in additional cuts and guarantee an expedited vote on those cuts later this year this is a critical component to the longterm solution you know very well that weve had countless commissions over the years that have proposed ideas for cutting deficits some ideas have had more merit than others but their merit has been immaterial because no serious proposal has been afforded congressional consideration this measure before us ensures that congress will address the proposals that we receive now for the last 6 months the house of representatives has taken a number of key steps to rein in spending and ensure greater accountability and discipline in the use of taxpayer dollars yet they have been held up indefinitely by our friends in the other body todays underlying measure would eliminate the challenge by guaranteeing a clean upordown vote in both chambers of the work product that emerges from this joint select committee the entire congress will have no choice but to consider real solutions each and every member of the house and the senate will have to go on record no deficit commission no deficit commission no plan no proposal that has come before has had that kind of guarantee the kind of guarantee that is included in this measure thats before us todays underlying measure also moves the process forward on a balanced budget amendment taken together these proposals represent a radical departure from the status quo they fundamentally alter our federal spending process in order not just to avert an immediate crisis but to diffuse the ticking timebomb of our 14 3 trillion national debt global markets unitedstates job creators and most importantly the american people are watching what we do here today they want to see bold and credible action that restores confidence in our economy now and in the future this legislation delivers that very action that the american people that unitedstates markets and the global markets are seeking its a plan for the short medium and long term it fundamentally alters the current landscape and helps to ensure that we never get back to where we are right now and that is as we all know on the brink of a fiscal and economic catastrophe i urge my colleaguesand i hope very much that we will be able to enjoy bipartisan support i urge them to support both the rule that allows for consideration of this measure and the underlying legislation with that i reserve the balance of my time"]]}
