electoral fraud all you have to do is look at the way labor is not able to freely organize in order that they can increase wage standards or they can increase safety standards for their workers to understand that until you have a society in which you have free elections in which labor can organize and help raise the standards for the workers you will not have a society in which you will develop a middle class for a freetrade agreement to work you have to have a middle class on both sides as we do in canada and the united states as the european communities have developed so what i believe will happen is that if this treaty is adopted if we pass the implementing legislation we will institutionalize the existing political and economic structure in mexico and those millions of mexicans

japanese and the germans and the italians and the french our competition i say to the gentleman from ohio they limit the length of a strike the japanese and the italians limit it to a matter of hours

voting for made in america for american products for american jobs not to see those jobs go overseas not to give our japanese german french and italian competitors a leg up for that reason i want to urge all members to vote against this antistriker bill and against giving the japanese and the germans an unfair advantage there has also been a lot of talk this session about creating jobs i am convinced that the key to the future of our country is the creation of more jobs and that the key to our prosperity and that of the american people lies in creating a strong economy and therefore more jobs in the private sector creating real jobs for real americans for that reason i will be voting against the striker replacement bill if adopted this striker replacement bill would certainly be bad news for the american worker the immediate impact of this bill would be an increase in strikes certainly not something those of us who believe in creating more jobs would welcome more strikes would lead to higher labor costs higher unemployment and a drop in the productivity of american industry as the prices of american products go up those products would become less competitive on the world market american businesses would be left with only two options shutting down their businesses or moving those jobs overseas in both cases the losers again are the american workers one argument that proponents of this bill have tried to use in the case of striker replacement and other issues is the comparison with other countries organized labor and other supporters of the striker replacement bill would have us believe that the united states is alone in the world in permitting the use of replacement workers well what they dont tell you is there are several industrialized countries that allow employers to hire permanent replacement workers including australia hong kong ireland norway and the united kingdom another thing that they wont tell you is that strikes in countries like france italy germany and japan are severely limited in fact in japan and italy strikes by law are only allowed to last a matter of hours instead of weeks or months our foreign competitors have realized that more strikes and longer strikes mean higher costs for their products and lower productivity for their workers they know that higher costs and lower productivity mean that their products will be less competitive worldwide thars why this bill is good news for our foreign competitors and bad news for american workers it would come as no surprise to those of us in this body that the combination of
