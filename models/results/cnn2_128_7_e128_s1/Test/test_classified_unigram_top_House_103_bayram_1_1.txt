would not be complete without the observance and acknowledgement of the profound contributions and achievements of this truly distinguished leader hindered by numerous obstacles countless confrontations and seemingly insurmountable challenges justice marshall always seemed to rise to the occasion he was forced to valiantly display his cunning ability to persevere in spite of all odds and forces working against him early on in life after completing high school justice marshall went on to attend lincoln university in pennsylvania in 1925 and upon graduation applied to the state law school in baltimore however because of the segregated time in which he grew up thurgood marshall was not admitted because of the color of his skin as a result he registered at howard university law school whereupon he graduated at the top of his class in 1933 and began a solo law practice in baltimore during the depths of the depression with an undying passion in his heart for justice and equality for all justice marshall was selected as general counsel to the naacp legal defense fund in 1936 where for 25 years he traveled throughout the nation representing the interests of black citizens who were systematically denied their constitutional rights provided in the constitution itself thurgood marshall made it his life ambition to eliminate all forms of racial discrimination he fought hard to protect individual and minority rights one of marshalls most important victories occurred in 1954 when he successfully argued before the supreme court the school desegregation case brown v board of education the court ruled that separate educational facilities are inherently unequal justice marshall also valiantly represented the black students vho sought to gain entry to central high school in little rock ar he also fought to protect the civil rights of many of the students who staged lunch counter sitins and integrated the southern bus lines in freedom rides justice marshalls fervent dedication to and belief in the constitution of the united states gained the attention of more than just a few then president john f kennedy appointed him to the unitedstates second circuit court of appeals in new york in 1961 four years later former president lyndon b johnson nominated him for the position of unitedstates solicitor general and on june 13 1967 thurgood marshall was catapulted to greater prominence by being nominated by president johnson to be the first black to serve on the supreme court through thurgood marshalls professional career he sought to enhance and secure equality in the personal lives of all americans his legacy is one for all to recognize and acknowledge marshall so aptly used our constitutional september 15 1993 c traditions to revive our

their incomes increase at a rate of about 136 percent as a result of trickle down economics during this same period middleclass families incomes fell the clinton plan restores progressivity and tax fairness and asks that the wealthiest do the most to help reduce the deficit middleclass families are asked to pay only about 1 a week in the form of the gas tax and every penny of that weekly dollar

peace between israel and the plo at long last there is a real chance for peace but the arab leagues boycott is an obstacle in the path of lasting peace in the middle east on a bipartisan basis our subcommittee has for years strongly opposed the boycott today at this critical juncture in the peace talks we are restating our belief that ending the boycott is an essential step toward peace therefore i urge all members to join in this resolution in sending a strong message to those who are standing in the way of resolving this conflict in the middle east actually our subcommittee found that all countries involved would economically benefit from lifting the boycott and this is an enlightened resolution and i congratulate all those who worked on this resolution especially its author the gentleman from florida and all the people who have helped in bringing this resolution to the floor i ask everyone strongly to support this resolution as a strong step and a big step toward getting

they have the answers for trade for the united states while those raising the issues of domestic economic needs are equally convinced of their cause the answers to this argument are in the research of what others have said on this subjectand in the events of trade history today in beginning my remarks i want to add another voice out of the past to our current debate about free trade and its benefits to the country since free trade is the primary government policy affecting our economy the following quotation from professor alfred e eckes whom i will mention again later may explain some of the problems now occurring in trade in 1848 there was a rally on free trade in brussels belgium and the speaker at that rally said something interesting he stated the protective system of our day is conservative while the free trade system is destructive it breaks up old nationalities and pushed the antagonism of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie to the extreme point in a word the free trade system hastens the social revolution it is in this revolutionary sense alone that i am in favor of free trade that speaker was karl marx when i read that marx quote i thought there certainly is nothing new it sounds like some of our social problems today this is an old story and perhaps there is a glimmer of truth in the quotation it is something to bear in mind now in trade debate with the recent change in administration yet another chapter is being written in the continuing 45 yearold trade debate since the united states signed gatt in 1947 the record is being written now for the administration but one thing has not changed regardless of any reasons given the real debate is about foreign policy versus domestic economic interests not free trade versus protectionism professor alfred eckes ohio eminent research professor at ohio university wrote about these differences in his article trading american interests in the fall issue of foreign affairs translated that means the debate is about industries and jobs for americans the industries and jobs that were sacrificed by the unitedstates government for foreign policy reasons in this 45year period according to professor eckes includes shoes fish machine tools tableware ferrochromium toweling linen handkerchiefs clothespins automobiles lead and zinc canned hams copperand the list goes on the same story is continuing today not much has changed since this policy was first initiated in geneva swit zerland at the gatt talks 45 years ago each succeeding year has meant a loss of american jobs you need to look no further than the wall street journal to find out what this foreign policy means today to working americans and to our excellent professionals who are suddenly facing a bleak future in a march 10 1991 story by g pascal zachardy and bob ortega they spelled out in their series down the up escalator why some workers are falling behind to understand just what those american workers have lost in this race of globalization quoted in the wall street journal article was the harvard economist james medoff who said today people who lose their jobs are history the authors explained that the quality of jobs is eroding and according to medoff only 38 percent of all new jobs offered health benefits compared with 43 percent in 1979 and only 15 percent offered pension benefits down from 23 percent just what this means in a global market place was explained in the article by milton friedman the nobel prizewinning economist he said its not widely recognized how enormous this effect is youve got a billion people in china who suddenly are available for use with capital you have a half billion behind the former iron curtain let me remind you this does not include the population in latin america so american jobs are on the line in the globalization race and certainly they are in our trade talks not much has changed has it since we first signed gat in 1947 now additional american business and government sectors are subjects on the negotiating table and working americans and their jobs are again the subject of the debate in the unfolding events between the 12 nation european community and the united states this current disagreement between ec and the united states over procurement rules offers a clear cut opportunity for federal government officials to explain to the american people just what is the agenda of the european community and the general agreements on tariffs and trade has pointed out another facet of the current dispute with the european community over government procurement in a letter to ambassador kantor the national association of manufacturers expressed a concern that the european community utilities directive itself violates the gatt that the directive applies to all operating entities in the four utility sectors that operate under public policy supervision regardless of ownership public or private the provision that the 3 percent preference for contract bids containing more than 50 percent noneuropean community products the national association of manufacturers pointed out is that it is contrary to gati which prohibits contracting parties from dis criminating against imports in favor of domestically produced goods the association also expressed concern that there is no historical or legal justification for the coverage of the procurement activities of the unitedstates private sector companies under gatt in other words under gatt private sector procurement would be subject to government procurement this movement to control private business under international organizations is disquieting and worrisome to many businessmen even our elected officials are concerned about the effects of our trade agreements on american business govenor william donald schafer of maryland wrote me recently about his concern for unitedstates companies to successfully compete against government owned and subsidized ventures particularly in the context of a freetrade agreement his immediate concern was about the canadian governments intention to build a linear alkylbenezene plant for sfg which is a corporation wholly owned by the quebec government although there is more than enough production in north america of lab which is a cleaning agent used in detergents and cleaning products canada will build another plant at risk is a maryland plant vista chemical co which employs 200 people in baltimore which will be up against the competition from a subsidized government company in fact the governments of canada and quebec provided s50 million in 2 successive years to an sfg affiliate for their losses i wrote the unitedstates trade representative about this matter what is important with this case is what we will do if the government pis subsidizing against business remember that in the bihational dispute resolution panels under the canadian freetrade agreement that american business has not fared well in twothirds of the decisions the canadians have ruled against american business on pork swine and timber there in a nutshell is but a small part of the problems that american business is experiencing in these trade agreements and i believe i can safely say it will only get worse not better private citizens and companies will not have the right for redress before these binational panels or gati dispute resolution panel only a country under the rules an appealing country must accept the decision of a gatit panel and change its domestic law or accept gait sanctions remember professor eckes explained in his paper why the united states embarked on this course to open up our industry and jobs to foreign companies and governments he said to strengthen fee world economies and help contain soviet expansionism the executive branch has rolled back tariffs and removed trade restrictions opening the giant american market to the worlds manufacturers he went on to explain freer trade has its costs the record suggests that for diplomatic and national security reasons the unitedstates government sacrificed thousands of domestic jobs to create employment and prosperity elsewhere in the noncommunist world this policy has not worked as well as the advertisements for it have claimed according to the professor from 1893 to 1970 unitedstates exports consistently had exceeded imports but beginning in 1971 the united states generated merchandise trade deficits in 19 of the next 21 years professor eckes wrote about the consequences of such trade imbalances and the reaction of senator russell long of louisiana to this gat policy i believe that senator long was right professor eckes wrote that senator long warned secretary of state henry kissinger in a 1976 finance hearing that if we trade away american jobs and farmers incomes for some vague concept of a new international order the american people will demand from their elected representatives a new order of their own which puts their jobs their security and their income above the priorities of those who dealt them a bad deal so ambassador kantor has a great opportunity not t repeat the mistakes of the past the prospects are not hopeful in this current dispute over government procurement the ambassador pointed out that he is a practical person im neither optimistic nor pessimistic about the ability of the two sides to reach an agreement he will shortly have to decide what he is he must be elther fish or fowl but he cannot be neutral the ec trade commissioner sir leon brittan has stated that the ec is focusing their marketopening efforts at water and transport contracts offered by states and municipalities he said we are really interested n their transport market ambassador kantor wants us all singing fromthe same song sheet according to the financial times well we should all study professor eckes article and then make sure that our government negotiators sing off the same song sheet as working americans who want jobs in trade negotiations the point should be jobs for americans so they can hope and dream and plan for their future care less for the art of the deal americans are angry with their government policymakers and i do not blame them it is time for the government to take a stand to benefit americans not just a select few and to provide jobs in this country if not the piece anyone you

from louisiana who has replaced our old friend mickey edwards as the ranking republican on the subcommittee this year i would also like to thank the staff terry peel and bill schuerch mark murray lori maes karen brown mike marek and the minority staff dean sachett jim kulinowski and bob lester and all of the associate staff who worked to make this bill the bipartisan product it is today a vote for

committees budget ceiling under the 602 authority for budget authority and i think it represents an effort to do things in a very different way from past bills two examples one is the fact that this bill makes excruciating cuts in a number of accounts in the bill for example when the administration finishes setting aside the funding that it is planning to use for the middle east we will be cutting for the rest of the world for economic support funds by 37 percent and we will be cutting our foreign military aid by 52 percent for those same regions of the world it will mean that this bill which has been cut about 30 percent since i became chairman a number of years ago is being cut by another 1 billion from last years level and yet within that squeezed bill we are able to meet the administrations request to fully fund assistance for the former republics of the former soviet union we did that by receiving the cooperation of the defense appropriations subcommittee chairman the gentleman from pennsylvania mr murthai and the ranking republican on that subcommittee the gentleman from pennsylvania so we were able to take 979 million in allowed but unappropriated defense money and use it instead to fund the 1993 supplemental for russian aid i would simply make one other point before yielding the floor i know this is not a very popular bill to vote for it is probably the most difficult appropriation bill with the possible exception of the legislative appropriation bill to bring before the house but the fact is that there is a price for participation in the world there is a price for leadership of the world if you intend to play a leadership role we are the only remaining superpower in the world and it is in the interest of our taxpayers it is in the interest of our young people who might otherwise have to fight in foreign wars for us to be making these limited kinds of expenditures to try to stabilize the economic and social conditions which could otherwise lead to chaos and lead to conditions around the world which would require our direct military involvement i have never understood people who are willing to pay 200 or 300 billion a year to build the weapons of war but are not willing to spend a tiny fraction of that amount 1 percent of the budget in order to try to create the economic and social conditions that can avoid the use of war as a tool of national policy so i would simply say that if members want to cast a vote for deficit reduction vote for this bill the russian aid which we are providing supplements something which has been going on since the iron curtain fell under president bushs administration the fact is we have been able to save well over 900 billion in military expenditures because gorbachev and yeltsin have been running the soviet union rather than the old boys who ran it before this is a tremendoug savings to our taxpayers it is a tremendous blessing to the entire world this bill for a tiny fraction of those savings

out some unvarnished facts here we have both voluntary and assessed contributions we are talking about the assessed contributions they are established as a result of a treaty and these assessments are the law of the land they are owed until the treaty is changed about 10 years or so ago there were only a few peacekeeping operations for which we were making assessed contributions one of those was 18 million for the u n interim force in lebanon but then the united nations with our vote and support voted to establish peacekeeping forces for many world problems then they would say well we have solved that the last 4 or 5 years our subcommittee has been demanding that the u n establish criteria and that they not vote for all of these peacekeeping operations every time a problem came up we were the ones that in our subcommittee tried to do something about this these criteria were not established until the last month these criteria mean that the united states will not support new peacekeeping operations unless certain requirements are met after ambassador albright took office a year ago last january i went up to the united nations i spent a day or two up there and i know that she wants to do something about reducing unitedstates assessments she came to my office she came to our subcommittee hearing and she has indicated she i 3952 wants to do something about negotiating a better deal that we have now secretary general boutrosghali came to my office he started telling me about how wonderful these peacekeeping operations are i explained to him that he did not need to go through that process the facts were we did not have the money and were not going to have the money and were not going to contribute the amount of money that he wanted for peacekeeping operations when he left i think he understood better what the situation is we then did not appropriate all of the requests for the unitedstates assessed contributions so we would get some leverage the arrearages will amount to 1 2 billion by the end of fiscal year 1994 and we have the leverage so that we can negotiate the kind of a deal we need i was one of those who suggested we get credit for the expenses that our troops incur in participating in peacekeeping operations and i think it was the right thing to do but i never did think that you could completely offset the unitedstates assessment after all if we completely offset our assessment it would be extremely difficult to maintain these peacekeeping operations but it is the right approach to take in our negotiations we generally do not provide unitedstates troops for a good reason troops from the third world countries are generally more politically acceptable than troop provided from the major world countries but the troops that are provided for peacekeeping operations have got to be paid it is in our interest to curtail any new peacekeeping operations to make sure they meet the new criteria but it is not in our interest to make it impossible to have any more peacekeeping operations that is what this amendment would do for example the gentleman from california mentioned u n peacekeeping operations in georgia in georgia if we do not have u n peacekeeping forces the russians will furnish all the troops and we do not want the russians to have all the troops in georgia it is better to have a u n presence there than to have the russians have all the troops in georgia so this amendment i say to you has some appeal probably with some people but it is too severe you cannot say you will not have any more peacekeeping

an amendment which cuts the budget i implore my colleagues on my side of the aisle to give this president the chance he needs to look at what is happening in the international arena and perhaps next year bigger cuts would be made but he has asked in light of the current conditions in the world not to make further cuts i would ask in that context that you not support the amendment"],

themselves in fine fashion coming up with facts and figures and a very credible budget the same applies for their work product this year that is why i rise in strong support of the budget offered by the gentleman from ohio which we in the republican leadership adopted as our official position once again they provided us with a credible and complete budget proposal let megive the members the three major reasons why i support this budget first it is a complete one the democratic leadership budget makes some adjustments to the discretionary portion of the budget but that is only onethird of the budget controlled by the appropriation process what about health care reform and welfare reform the democratic leadership tells us we will be dealing with them this year sometime how come they are not in the budget not even sherlock holmes lieutenant colombo or the entire cast of l a law could find a single clue in the democratic leadership budget as to how these initiatives will be financed the kasich budget on the other hand reflects the priorities and initiatives that we republicans seek to further this year and details exactly how those initiatives would be financed are the members looking for specific health care welfare reform and crime control proposals they will find them in the kasich budget what about reforming foreign aid or a family tax credit they will find them in the kasich budget do they seek specific information on which lower priority programs must be reduced they will find it in the kasich budget the second major reason for supporting the kasich budget is this it is the only budget alternative that contains a more realistic level of defense funding the democratic defense figures arenot sufficient to fund even their own defense program as determined by their own defense departments recent bottomup review if they will not take their own program seriously enough to fund it then what are the rest of us supposed to be thinking furthermore the democratic budge~t figures do not support a full military pay raise as we do finally the kasich budget provides approximately 150 billion more in deficit reduction over the next 5 years when the kasich budget is adopted and implemented a real budget with real savings is that not a refreshing idea compare it with a democratic leadership budget that has as many holes in it as the new york mets infield the kasich budget is a reality the democratic budget is only virtual reality i would urge my colleagues to vote for the only real budget in town as exemplified and reflected by the good work and handicraft of the gentleman from ohio and his colleagues on the republican side of the committee on the budget"]]}
