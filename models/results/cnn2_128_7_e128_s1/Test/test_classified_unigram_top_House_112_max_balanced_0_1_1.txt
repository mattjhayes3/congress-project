presidents request to the commodity futures trading commission the cftcs mission is to protect the american public from fraud manipulation abusive practices systemic risk related to derivatives including speculation in the oil markets that drive up gas prices and to foster open competitive and financially sound markets funding the cftc at the presidents request will put 159 more cops on the beat will provide the agency with the updated technology it needs to properly regulate the multitrilliondollar derivatives market in order to protect american consumers and will curb excessive speculation by wall street banks and oil companies the current version of the bill by gouging the cftc by as much as 136 million makes it clear that the majority is putting profiteering and special interests above the basic commonsense priorities of the american people three years ago we suffered an economic meltdown brought on by greed corruption and a total lack of regulation in the wall street derivatives market we are still dealing with the economic ramifications of that collapse today millions of jobs disappeared millions of homes foreclosed on millions of families are struggling every day to get by if that were not burdensome enough the same families are paying excessive prices at the pump right now because of dangerous oil speculation goldman sachs has found that unregulated speculation adds over 20 per barrel to the price of oil even exxons top executive recently conceded that the price of gas has been surging due to speculators who now make up nearly 70 percent of the market because of all the bad behavior by wall street we passed the doddfrank financial reform bill in the congress last year which would reintroduce transparency and accountability in commodities markets and protect the public from future malfeasance among these reforms was the strengthening of the commodities futures trading commission their ability to regulate derivatives and to prevent speculation in oil yet in this appropriations bill the majority is now trying to starve the cftc of the resources that it needs to do the job the decision helps wall street firms and big oil companies if it passes wall street can continue the risky manipulation of derivatives that brought on the last collapse big oil can continue to enjoy inflated profits every year due to artificially swollen oil prices the losers are americans families forced to pay more at the pump with this decision or worse eviscerating the cftc here the majority is setting up taxpayers to pay for yet another costly bailout of wall street the choices made in this legislation are reckless and disturbing more to do with ideology than basic economics yet it is part of a pattern by this majority under their watch gas prices reached an average of around 4 a gallon across the country up dramatically from the 2 78 national average in 2010 and yet they still rush to protect billions in oil company subsidies even as they cut the budget of the agency we know can do something about this speculation cftc has already made a difference earlier this year they charged five oil speculators with manipulating the price of crude netting them more 50 million even as oil prices climbed towards record highs of 147 a barrel in the summer of 2008 we need this type of accountability in our oil markets to protect american families what we do not need is a congress that puts the profit margins of wall street and oil speculators over the needs of american families and the american economy we came here to represent the

what should we do about the 5 6 trillion surplus over the next 10 years bush got elected they enacted the bush tax cuts which they said would stimulate the economy and pay for themselves what happened we had the slowest economic recovery of any economic recovery after any recession in the history of the united states the only 8year period in which we did not gain one net new job even before the

agencies have the resources and authorities they need to do their important work passing an annual intelligence bill is vital to keeping the laws governing our intelligence operations up to date the

hightech investments which is our competitive advantage in intelligence while the bill denies most of the administrations requested personnel increases it adds some key positions in high priority

violence against women act improves upon many of the programs that are designed specifically to aid native american women and it also includes new provisions to improve congresss response to potential problems they may run into furthermore to better ensure that native american women have improved recourse against abusive individuals i worked with the chairman of the judiciary committee and the staff to include language in this bill to empower native american women to either petition individually the federal courts or through their tribal courts for a federal restraining order ensuring that these women have the ability to obtain a protection order is a vital step towards stopping the cycle of abuse that many of them suffer through it impacts disproportionately those in indian country over other areas of the nation those who have suffered from violence and abuse have gone through enough lets not cause more harm by putting politics before victims and lets support and reauthorize the

million dollars and then will try to bring class action lawsuits against these financial institutions in very tough economic times so this legislation has been developed to address this and to fix this so that our banking industry and our financial services industry will not have this threat over them what it would do is repeal the requirement for both a physical placard as well as an electronic notice disclosing the transaction fees on the atm screens currently as it works now if an atm machine does not display a physical placard a financial institutiona bank a credit union or our retailerscan be subject to a class action lawsuit which would potentially amount to as i said one half a million dollars or 1 percent of its net worth this penalty has the potential of prompting bogus lawsuits against financial institutions simply due to a lack of the physical placard even when the electronic notice is shown to a customer perhaps because the placard was removed by a third party so you can see that this is not fair for these institutions to be faced with up to a half million dollars in penalty fees especially in these tough economic times at the same time many of these institutions continue to struggle to maintain standard operations while being faced with our current economic climate let me just talk about that for a moment because there have been 31 bank failures in this country this year alone about 3 weeks ago three banks shut their doors including the security exchange bank in marietta cobb county georgia which is located in my district as a matter of fact in georgia alone 78 banks have closed their doors since our crisis began georgia leads the nation unfortunately in bank closures thats why i am so particularly concerned about it and so pleased to have this measure pass because this sensible legislation that we consider today would remove the threat of legal action against financial institutionsa bank or a credit unionsimply for the lack of the physical placard at one of its atm machines passage of this bill as mr luetkemeyer pointed out will still provide the consumer with the protections that they need because a notice informing them of any fees will still be required upon the start of a transaction on the atm screen in addition consumers will still be able to benefit from the convenience that the estimated 445 000 atms in operation in this country provide im very proud to have worked on this bill its very timely its very important for our economy that we move with this bill the bill certainly deserves the strong bipartisan support that we have and its been a pleasure to work with mr luetkemeyer on it i urge my colleagues to support this measure today with that i reserve the balance of my time"]]}
