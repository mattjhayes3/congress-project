professes that natural gas is a cleanburning gas and that there would be little to no risk to expanding that drilling well when one is a representative from the state of florida and we have 77 million people who visited our state just last year alone and 56 5 billion in taxable sales is generated by tourism most of which is the result of our beautiful beaches and our pristine coastline one can clearly see why most floridians would have a significant problem with the possibility of there being oil rigs off our beaches within the eyesight of tourists or our residents and mr peterson of pennsylvania has continually represented that natural gas is a potential alternative energy source well just off the florida coastline the minerals management service which is a government agency under the department of the interior has documented that there is only about a 70day supply of natural gas off the coastline of florida in the gulf under current consumption rates in the united states that to me does not appear to take us into the rest of the century in terms of dealing with our energy needs what we should be doing is uniting as members of congress representing this country and dealing with our longterm energy crisis by exploring alternative energy sources not going to the same old energy sources and trying to drill our way out of this problem drilling is not the solution there is far too much environmental risk to drilling whether we are drilling for natural gas or drilling for oil and the proposal that we will be considering that is attached to the budget reconciliation bill the budgetcut document that we will be considering at the earliest next week includes a terrible proposal that would expand drilling off the coastline of florida and bring drilling within 125 miles of floridas coast on the gulf that is a totally inappropriate proposal it makes absolutely no sense it would jeopardize our environment and i am hopeful that my colleagues from florida and other colleagues who represent coastal communities which will also be in jeopardy if this provision passes will join us in opposing this budget reconciliation bill not the least of which because there are many other reasons why it should be opposed because of the dire cuts that are in the budget that are going to rain terror down on americans across this country but to add insult to injury it also has a terrible provision in it that would allow drilling off the coastline around our entire country so with that having been said i want to talk a little bit about what we talked about in the previous hour and turn the conversation back to the budget reconciliation bill there are a number of significant problems with the budget cuts that the republican leadership is proposing but one of the things that i wanted to turn to is what democrats think we should be doing in terms of the budget democrats want to bring the budget back into balance what we proposed in the budget committee today included a proposal that would bring the budget back into balance by 2012 the democratic budget also has a smaller deficit than the republican budget every year and would accumulate less debt and waste fewer resources on interest payments that are needed to service the national debt we would include budget enforcement measures to protect social security we would do more for education the democratic proposal provides 4 5 billion more for appropriated education and training programs than the republican budget for 2006 and 41 billion more over the next 5 years we also reject the 21 billion in cuts that the republican budget requires the education and workforce committee to make over the next 5 years those are cuts that could fall on students loans and school lunches these are not the same old tired complaints it is insulting to suggest that cutting school lunches and financial aid are tired complaints if one is struggling to be able to give their children breakfast and lunch on a daily basis and make sure that they are provided with nutrition and they do not financially have the ability to ensure that they can do it themselves staring down budget cuts that take that opportunity away from them is nothing short of cowardly this is a cowardly budget reconciliation bill it does not show any guts at all and it abandons the american people let us talk about housing in the previous hour we talked a little bit about the housing cuts that this budgetcut bill would hand down and i am joined by my good and close friend whom i had an opportunity to serve with in now three different chambers the gentlemanfrom florida his district and my district were hit badly by a category 3 storm last week hurricane wilma and we were talking in the last hour about housing and the issues related to affordable housing that our constituents were already facing i want to just point out this picture here over the weekend i had an opportunity to go door to door in my district because there are so many senior citizens trapped in their homes without power we still have half a million people who do not have power in south florida and unfortunately whether it is because of hurricane fatigue or just the fact that there was so much damage in the gulf coast region that it may be difficult to feel the pain that we are going through in south florida and understand it but there is not nearly as much attention as we need focused on what happened in south florida when i was going to door to door in my district to try to help some of the folks who have trouble getting out of their houses and i am talking about people who are in their 80s and 90s one of the apartments that the building captain in the condominium brought me into included this kind of damage this is the result of hurricane wilma and this is just one example there are hundreds and hundreds of condominium units and apartment buildings and homes and mobile homes that look just like this there is a perception whether it was created by the media or created by the lack of attention by the national media on what happened with hurricane wilma that everything is fine in south florida everything is not fine in south florida this is the third floor apartment and that is the ceiling of the apartment and as we can see we can look right through the ceiling at the sky this is this womans master bedroom and literally during the storm 1 minute after she walked out of that master bedroom the roof caved in on her bed a minute earlier and it would have caved in on her when we talk about the affordable housing problem that we already had now we have thousands of people in south florida whose homes have been condemned who are faced with nowhere to go because the average price of a house just in broward is 348 000 a year the rental units the monthly rent is sky high and fema has literally only 300 inspectors in our state going through these homes to determine whether these

rooftops in flooded gulf coast coastal communities after the hurricane hit the gulf coast and as the enormity of the disaster became apparent every coast guard air station in the country began sending helpaircraft or crews or bothto the devastated areas to conduct search and rescue missions the numbers speak for themselves across the region the coast guard saved or evacuated 33 500 people one helicopter crew rescued 150 during a single shift on duty another crew rescued in new orleans alone working day and night for seven days coast guard helicopters saved close to 6 500 lives 4 700 of

guard facilities in the disaster area had been damaged by the storm and floods and many coast guard men and women had lost their own homes they pushed past all obstacles to carry out their mission it

i have been here we have passed two very meaningful tax bills we have passed the jobs and growth tax relief act in 2005 and we also passed the economic growth and tax relief act we have to look at where we were in my opinion where we were was we were post 9 11 we had a corporate scandal we were in the beginnings or in the middle of a recession in our economy and we were having difficulty pulling ourselves out for alot of different reasons with the leadership of the president we followed through in congress to pass those two tax relief acts i think i would like to go to the numbers and talk about some of the things that i think are significant in terms of the numbers and how it has influenced americans i always like to personalize everything to my state so i have gome state numbers as well for instance this year who will gain tax relief 111 million taxpayers will see their taxes decline by an average of 1 877 significant numbers five million total individuals and families will see income tax liabilities completely eliminated because we moved the tax the lowest tax bracket down to 10 percent fortyfour million families with children will receive an average tax cut of 2 493 that is because we have moved down significantly the child tax credit fourteen million elderly individuals will receive an average of 2 000 and 25 million small business owners will save an average of 3 641 so those are the numbers in terms of what could possibly be saving average savings through the tax relief but i think we need to look at where we are right now we have an economy that is moving in excess of 3 5 percent in gross national product we have created over the last several years 1 85 million jobs over the last 12 months alone and 5 4 million since augustof 1993 what i think this translates to is more small business owners having more money to create jobs to buy more equipment which creates more jobs i think we also have individuals who have more discretion over their own dollars they can say what they want to buy when they want to buy it because they have fewer federal taxes to pay i think that empowers them to consume more goods which then translates to more business to more jobs so i see it as an engine that is moving in the right direction i believe that the tax relief package and the tax cuts that we passed are a large part ofthat"], [0.9995158773672301,

he has said about our current involvement and engagement in iraq perhaps as a mere oversight perhaps conveniently those good folks omitted the following and i am quoting directly i noticed most of those folks quoted from their own notes these are from general mccaffreys own reports after his return in this case to iraq he did similar analysis in afghanistan under the bottom line observations from iraqi freedom written in april of 2006 before zarqawi before the appointment and the filling out of the entire permanent government the morale fighting effectiveness and confidence of unitedstates combat forces continue to be simply awd inspiring in every sensing session and interaction i probed for weakness and found courage belief in the mission belief in the mission enormous confidence in their sergeants and companygrade commanders and understanding of the larger mission a commitment to creating an effective iraqi army and police unabashed patriotism and even a sense of humor he goes on to say many have reenlisted to stay with their unit on its return to a second iraq deployment many planned to reenlist regardless of how long the tvar went on he then went on to observe the tiraqi army is real is growing and is willing to fight and then on the last page of his analysis he said and i quote there is no reason why the united states cannot achieve our objectives in iraq our aim must be to create a viable federal state under the ruleof law which does not enslave its own people threaten its neighbors or produce weapons of mass destruction the last sentence of general mccaffrey that my friends also failed to quote the american people are far safer today than we were in the 18 months following the initial intervention i think in fairness to general mccaffrey

pay subsistence charges for those brave members of the military who are hospitalized we now pay an allowance to reimburse for the cost of life insurance and in the bill we passed this year that cost will be totally paid for by the federal government for the first time in our nations history we authorized a new payment of 430 a month to combat wounded servicemembers who are hospitalized and on and

and i believe them they are all patriots some extraordinary patriots on the other side that i have the honor of serving with but i dont think they are serving the troops in some of this debate tonight like the troops want to be served they want to see this mission through because they understand the terrorists believe this is the real deal this is where they have drawn the line in the sand and the troops understand if we dont take the commitment they have made there and win this war on terror in iraq where will we fight next it will be right here at home it is a proud army we have a proud navy

other times that we have deployed our troops in fact even when we were told back in 1997 the year after we entered bosnia that our troops would be home by christmas i did not rise to bring them home we were told in christmas of 1998 they would be home and christmas of 1999 the fact is we still have troops in the balkans they have been there 10 years even though it was not part of the original plan all of us support our troops but i want to tell my colleagues in my 19 years i learned a lesson of supporting the troops from the gentleman from pennsylvania he took me under his wing when i came here as a freshman 19 years ago i have traveled with him around the world i have seen his personal dedication to the men and women who serve now there are many others in this body on both sides of the aisle that we can say the same thing about but i want to stand up as a representative from the other side of pennsylvania and tell the story of jck murtha who epitomizes what our militarys all about i wish i could say i have been to landstuhl a medical facility in germany as many times as jack murtha has been there i wish i could say that weekly i would go over to walter reed hospital and meet with the troops as jack murtha has done week after week after week i wish i could say i have gone and held the hands of th wives and the children of the sailors at bethesda as jack murtha has done i wish i could say that i have done all that but i cannot jack murtha is one of a kind he is an example for all of us in this body and none of us should ever think of questioning his motives his desires or support for our american troops i also want to say i have been here 19 years i have been here with republican and democrat presidents yes jkck murthas been there he stood up when bill clinton tried to cut the funding for our troops and he stood with us on some very tough votes he stood up with us on the tough policy questions he was with us on missile defense he was with us when others in his party would not be with us on defense and security issues on some very tough leadership spots jack murtha was there and for the 5 years that president bush has been president i cannot count on my hands the number of times jack murtha has stood with our president in supporting our troops in supporting more money in supporting the policies that give us the kind of capability that we need we are in a sad state today we are in a tough time with our troops they are wondering what isgoing on back here it is not about jack murtha trying to undermine anyone just as i and others would not hi1006 have tried to do that in the other 40 deployments in the 19 years that i have been here bdit it is wrong that a gentleman with the reputation and leadership of jack murtha should have to wait 5 months to get a response to a letter expressing his concerns to the administration that is not right so i would hope we would all come together and i would hope that our commander in chief would invite the good

than this i thought he learned let me say the defense part of this and maybe the rest of it is probably the most bipartisan bill one could ever find the gentleman from florida chairman young the gentleman from california chairman lewis and i have been traveling to these various bases we found shortages every place we went all kinds of problems that they brought to our attention that needed to be rectified we found problems so severe that many of the units that were on their way to iraq were c4 the gentleman from california my good friend the hero from vietnam knows what i am talking about when i say c4 i am talking about they are not ready to go to combat because the equipment is so bad as a matter of fact the equipment was so bad at one base and i think it was fort stewart where the troops did not have radios to train with did not have small arms ammunition did not have mortar ammunition to train with and that means that when they get there they are not at the cutting edge of where they should be now they get equipment when they get there and that overcomes the c4 so the gentleman from florida chairman young and i what we did was put 2 3 billion into the budget we first checked the staff checked with the army to make sure that that is where it ought to be put the army came back and supported us usually they beat around the bush the gentleman from california chairman lewis knows what i mean we talk to them and because of other people over there they do not want to admit that they need the money this time they were very emphatic that they needed every cent and they needed it as soon as they could get it so we added money for the types of things that they need having said that what i have said to the services because we are having such a problem we see the recruiting problem we are looking into that right now the subcommittee i serve on we realize and we have said for a long time they are going to have a recruiting problem as this war gets unpopular and we were trying to figure out how do we overcome that most times i disagree with those bonuses because i feel so strongly that people ought to join the armed forces for the good of the country but we have to give bonuses to send them over there we putmoney in for those kinds of things we increased the amount of money somebody gets when they are killed in action we expanded it so that when they are killed in action they are taken care of retroactively as well as prospectively we take care of somebody who is wounded we added money to it some veterans group called me and said they were not happy with the way we added that money they felt like there ought to be more study and i cannot disagree with that but when the four of us sat down the gentleman from florida chairman young and senator inouye and senator stevens we came to the conclusion that we just did not think we could wait so we put money in to take care of people who were injured so severely as well as the ones that were killed and i got so many letters from the people at home and i have had 12 killed in my district how pleased they were about what we are doing because it helped them get through a very difficult time what we have tried to do over the years is make sure that the people that were in the armed forces had what they needed that the people in iraq have what they need our subcommittee brought to the attention of the country that they were without a lot of equipment in iraq we are working right now new trucks we are trying to figure out how to put new trucks in that are encapsulated because we have taken care of the humvees but we need to take care of the trucks now so we got some commercial trucks which were recommended which were 100 000 less but it was so late we could not get it in the bill we are going to ask for reprogramming for that amount of money so this bill is taking care of equipment shortages not all of them but it is taking care of as many as we could possibly squeeze in it is taking care of reset we forced the military to ask for reset the minute that this war is over and the money starts to dry up reset will be the first thing they do not do so we have to do it now and i have said to many of the industrial leaders in this country the minute the war is over there will not be any supplementals there will be a lot less money to be spent and we have got to spend this money now in the supplementals to make sure that that gets done armor modularity there is some argument about that but we think it ought to be done and we have pushed this many of the programs that the army has today have come about because of the defense subcommittee chaired by the gentleman from california and chaired by the gentleman from florida many of the things that have happened have happened because we see it out in the field we go out in the field talk to the people make sure that we are doing the right thing and then we try to send defense in the right direction so i urge

year 2007 does not fully fund the help america vote act hava hava was passed in the wake of the 2000 election and authorized almost 4 billion to improve the administration of elections in this country the 2004 election was a strong indication that there is much work yet to be done in the area of election reform in this country and yet here we are fast approaching federal elections which are to be the first ones that take place under virtually all of havas requirements and hundreds of millions of dollars in funds authorized under the bill remain unappropriated although the appropriations bill

funding whatsoever to help states meet their voting system requirementsespe cially the disability and language access requirementsunder title iii of the act hava authorized 3 billion in socalled

unappropriated and not one dime of that amount has been requested in the presidents fiscal year 2007 budget nor provided for in this appropriations measure hava also authorized 100 million to promote

"in 2003 the unitedstates general accounting office released a report that was done at the request of myself and the gentleman from michigan and i believe other members of congress that found with regard to terrorist threats that no federal agency has assessed the extent of security preparedness at chemical plants and that no federal requirements are in place to require chemical plants to assess their vulnerabilities and take steps to reduce them i wanted to talk briefly tonight about this issue of the need for security at chemical plants i was very pleased to note yesterday in the new york times the lead editorial addressed this issue i wanted to read from some sections of that editorial and comment on it in one part of the new york times editorial yesterday it says there is no way to guarantee that terrorists will not successfully attack a chemical facility but it would be grossly negligent not to take defensive measures the question americans should be asking themselves says rick hind legislative director of the greenpeace toxics campaign is if you fastforward to a disaster what would you want to have done and this is what the new york times and what greenpeace say should be some of the priorities first tighter plant security there should be tough federal standards for perimeter fencing concrete blockades armed guards and other forms of security at all of the 15 000 facilities that use deadly chemicals second use of safer chemicals refineries when practical should adopt processes that do not use hydrofluoric acid the chemical that is now putting new orleans at risk some plants that once used chlorine such as the blue plains wastewater treatment plant in washington d c have switched to safer alternatives third reducing quantities of dangerous chemicals an important reason that chemical facilities make such tempting targets for terrorists is the enormous quantity of chemicals they have on hand the industry should be encouraged and in some cases required to store and transport dangerous chemicals in smaller quantities fourth limiting chemical facilities in highly populated areas many chemical facilities were built long before terrorism was a concern and when fewer people lived in their surrounding areas there should be a ngtional initiative to move dangerous chemical facilities where practical to lower population areas fifth government oversight of chemical safety the chemical industry wants to police itself through voluntary programs but the risks are too great toleave chemical security in private hands facilities that use dangerous chemicals should be required to identify their vulnerabilities to the environmental protection agency and the department of homeland security and to meet federal safety standards now those are the five points that were are mentioned by the new york times yesterday in their editorial and also by greenpeace but i wanted to say that more than 3 years have passed since 9 11 and congress has yet to seriously address the need to secure our nations chemical plants we are finally seeing some movement in the senate but not yet in the house and it is time to take serious action to reduce the threat of an attack on a chemical facility which would endanger millions of lives last month i reintroduced the chemical security act h r 2237 which requires the epa and the department of homeland security to work together to identify highpriority chemical facilities once identified these facilities would be required to assess vulnerabilities and hazards and then development and implement a plan to improve security and use safer technologies within 18 months senator corzine has introduced this bill in the senate now since the legislation was first introduced in the house in 2002 i have tried to get the republican leadership to conduct a congressional hearing on chemical security and i welcomed the announcement last week on the house floor during the discussion or debate on the homeland security bill there was an announcement that the house select committee on homeland security chairman the gentleman from california mr cox said his committee would hold a hearing or start a series of hearings on chemical security beginning june 14 i would also like to see my own committee the house committee on energy and commerce which has jurisdiction over chemical facilities to follow the gentleman from californias mr cox lead and schedule hearings or begin to have hearings this summer hopefully we will see some positive signs some movement in the house at least to have hearings on the issue but it really is a very important issue not only for new jersey my home state but throughout the country i am also pleased that the new york times has pointed this out greenpeace of course has talked about a number of initiatives even beyond the ones that were mentioned in the new york times and i plan to spend some time over the next few weeks talking to greenpeace about whether additional
