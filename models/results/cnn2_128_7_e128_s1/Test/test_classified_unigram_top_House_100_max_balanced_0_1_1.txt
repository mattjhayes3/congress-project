today during the period for 1minute speeches the house was given an opportunity to hear two sides of a very important argument the argument on whether we ought to have a policy toward central america that is in opposition to the soviet attempts to colonize nicaragua and have that policy thereby support the contras or whether or not the policy of this country ought to be to cut off all aid to the democratic resistance in nicaragua and thereby assure the permanency of the sandinista communist regime and thereby the permanency of the colonial empire of the soviet union in central america we discussed this on the floor earlier today utilizing on this side of the aisle the slides prepared by colonel north for his presentation to americans who were looking to provide some private help to the rebels in nicaragua during that period of time when congress refused to provide help to those people fighting for their own freedom on the other side of the aisle they too had pictures pictures that they brought out of what they called contra atrocities that had taken place within nicaragua i think the contrast between the two sets of pictures and the arguments become very clear on this side of the aisle many of us believe that the threat posed by soviet intervention in central america is a threat to the people of nicaragua is a threat to the democratic nations of central america and ultimately is a threat to this country on the other side of the aisle based upon the presentations we heard today there are many who sincerely believe that what the contras are doing there is not worthy of our support and therefore the acceptance of the communist sandinista regime in nicaragua is a more palatable option than continuing to back the contras i do not doubt their sincerity i do not doubt their patriotism i think that many of the people who hold the view that the sandinista communists are a reasonable alternative are people who want the best for this country and for the world however i must say that i think that they are sadly mistaken and that in terms of the longterm security of this country they are terrible wrong what i think is particularly disappointing to this member of congress is that too often i find that they bring to the debate of this body propaganda that has been developed by the communists themselves in order to try to influence the debate within this chamber and i must say that i am afraid that during the course of our debate today that is precisely what we have had presented to us i say that because as those pictures were being presented and as the presentations ended i went to members on the other side and asked them where those pictures came from what was the source of those pictures i would personally like to get ahold of those sources i would like to have the commentary and the pictures that were presented on the floor today for my own reference since it was a part obviously of their debate i was told that that information would be gotten to me immediately and would be sent over to my staff all i was asking for is where do i go to find the sources of those pictures and that commentary so far i have not heard back i think the reason why i have not heard back is because i started through some other independent channels to try to locate where those pictures have come from and what i have now discovered is that the pictures

often than not sided with trent on the important issues i have every confidence that his voice will continue to be heard his judgment heeded and his impact felt far beyond the chamber at the other end

work with him on some of these issues and pleased to learn that in tarn we conservatives had an ally who could eloquently make our case here in the house and with the national media there is also alway a problem for anyone who serves in the leadership to balance the demands of the national reputation with the commitment that we all have to make to make sure we look after the people in our

over the past few weeks and that is the contra military offensive or lack of progress therein last week the contras staged a major attack in northern nicaragua on san jose de bocaythe site of the most important military operations base of the sandinista army in northern nicaragua the contras claimed they had destroyed the military barracks and occupied the airstrip at bocay and heralded the attack as their biggest victory in their 6year war against the nicaraguan government if this was one of the greatest military successes of the contras then the american people should meet with grave skepticism future reagan administration claims that the contras are about to march into managua according to a july 19 article in the new york times it appears the only success of the attack was the killing of nine soldiers and four innocent civiliansthree children and a pregnant woman there was no evidence of damage to either the towns dirt airstrip or the small collection of shacks that serves as the local headquarters for the nicaraguan army the rebels who have never managed to seize and hold a nicaraguan town in 6 years reached the edge of san jose de bocay but advanced no further in contrast the damage wrought on civilian property was very great more than a dozen homes were burned and cattle and other private property was stolen by the contras the three dead children ranged in age from 3 years to 13 years the woman 18 was in the fifth month of her third pregnancy of the 30 wounded in the attack 18 were civilians among them was maria cecilia novoa fonseca a 12year old girl who was hit by shrapnel which lodged in her throat adolfo novoa described the death of his 13year old daughter as follows a bunch of contras just shot machine guns into my house as they ran by my little girl was hit and died right away i cant overemphasize the importance of this attack and the lessons that can be drawn about the contras and their methods two weeks ago lt col oliver north described with great fervor and elan the contra cause and the legitimacy of their battle with the nicaraguan government many people in this country were moved by the sincerity of norths testimony and were favorably impressed by his description of the contras but the portrayal north gave of the contras is pure bunk the bottom line is in 6 years of combat 6 years the contras have still not been able to capture and hold a single nicaraguan town or piece of territory not a single town contra attacks kill more civilians than soldiers too often the victims are women and children the contras seem more interested in seizing food and personal property than military bases the only targets the contras have had any success at destroying are soft economic targets that are difficult to defend targets such as electric pylons or grain cooperatives even health clinics have been torched by the contras san jose de bocay is one of the poorest settlements in nicaragua even under the best of circumstances the townspeople are barely able to survive many of its occupants had already come down from the mountains to escape the contras after the contra attack they have no food no clothes not even a home one of the stolen cows had provided milk for an entire family with seven children if the refugees were to return to their homes in the mountains now they would most certainly be killed how can the contras ever hope to win the hearts and minds of the nicaraguan people if they continue to use tactics such as these in january this year retired army general paul gorman the former commander of unitedstates military forces in central america told congress that the contras were incapable of defeating the sandinista army in a january 29 1987 washington post report gorman said the 100 million approved by congress last year for the contras is not going to do it the money youre going to spend this year isnt going to do it i must ask my colleagues how we can contemplate continued funding for a rebel force which claims the killing of three children and a pregnant woman as its greatest military success it is immoral for the unitedstates government to continue funding a guerrilla force that has no hope of military victory that destroys civilian lives and property indiscriminately that has no base of popular support among the nicaraguan people and in fact would not exist were it not for the support of united states tax dollars the june 1 issue of newsweek contained an eyewitness account by reporter rod nordland who spent a week with the contras traveling through the jungles of northern nicaragua nordlands account paints the most vivid picture to date of the contras it explains why they will never win the war with the nicaraguan government and why they will never win the hearts of the nicaraguan people nordland says of the contras during their march together in may of last year perhaps from frustration as much as fatigue the march corroded both discipline and comradeship the quest for food outweighed any hunger for combat every campesino hut became a target often other contra units had cleaned out houses before we got to them there were no eggs because the hens had become contra fryers no milk because the cows had become contra beef frequently there werent even beans the contras made a show of paying for these things when they took them but that was little solace as the men in the column grew hungrier fewer bothered with the nicety of paymentespecially after they lost wads of their food money gambling why not make me a gift of this chicken one would ask no one ever refused fright ened peasants become instant if temporary collaborators when scores of heavily armed hungry men drop in for breakfast there is not overt coercion the physical appearance of the contras is usually sufficient many of the men have skulls and crossbones tattooed on their arms or painted on their shirts or boast names like exterminator and dragon hard pressed by sandinistas on the hunt the contras also forced campesinos to scout for them and worse to walk on their point the first man in the column to make sure we werent falling into a trap they bragged that these men were their collaborators but when we talked to them privately it was clear they felt more like human mine detectors the contras were great at retreating attacks they never quite managed one after another we abandoned targets assigned us by the high command the conduct of the sandinistas made a striking contrast with the contras their discipline held firm after many months many told us they hadnt seen a paved road or had a cold drink in 15 months of steady action where it had taken a mere 3 weeks for the contras we accompanied in the same mountains to turn into an unruly scourge sandinista troops on the march never even stopped at a peasants house except with permission from an officerand then only to wait outside for drinking water when they did requisition food the campesinos told us they always paid that is the end of the quote of mr nordlands description of what it is like being with the contras in the middle of a war and it was done last january we cannot expect the american people to support indefinitely a war the contras can never hope to win six more years of hundredmilliondollar installments would still not result in victory for the contras the sandinistas are surviving and are likely to do so for some time continued unitedstates funding of a rebel force which has no hope of military victory would surely be the most detestable atrocious immoral crime that has yet been committed in this long ugly struggle i call upon my colleagues for their help in drawing a swift and a final conclusion to this ugly spectacle now i was in a meeting and i did not hear the previous special orders i understand questions were raised about photos that scores of my colleagues showed here earlier in the day photos i might add of women children teachers maimed wounded during contra attacks and where they came from well they came from witness for peace program and as usual some of my colleagues attacked that organization and the people they represent the people on their board as having leftist leanings and questioning their patriotism is it not sad in the year in which we celebrate the constitution of this country its bicentennial the ability to speak freely on this floor or in villages and cities throughout this country that opponents of this program that we are trying to bring forward to the american people supporters of the presidents program will try to stifle that free speech would paint a dark gloomy red picture of those who take exception to their concept of what is happening in central america but they should know when they do that they not only attack me and my staff and the people that work for me and the people in the witness for peace program and the 2 500 people that witness for peace has sponsored in their witness to the war in nicaragua but they attack the board of the witness for peace they attack the american religious community they attack the two catholic bishops who serve on that board they attack representatives of the presbyterian church the united church of christ the episcopalian church the president of the conservative baptist seminary and if they are comfortable stifling those voices i think they make a tragic mistake witness for peace has sent 2 500 american citizens to central america from every state in this union representing 24 religious traditions volunteers travel at the invitation of central american churches the group is committed to nonviolence and neither receives or gives any aid to any government in the region the pictures we used are from welldocumented contra attacks documented by at least two eyewitnesses the bulk of the pictures were taken from a landmine attack on october 20 1986 this incident has been documented in the new york times on october 23 as well as in the americas watch report of december 1986 contra abuses my friends and colleagues are real they are well documented and as much as people would like to paint them over as red and deny that they ever happened they are

right to speak about them time and time again this administration has tried to silence its critics by resorting to smearing the names of those who dissent from this policy the american people will not stand for this we will not see our own religious and political leaders names publicly stoned i say to you and i say to my colleagues and friends that we have reached a shameful point in american politics when the ability to speak freely without our patriotism being questioned is raised to the level that it has been raised in the past couple of weeks it only tells me the fear in the hearts of

to imagine the workings of this body without bob berry expertly managing the procedings which at times can resemble a case study in the laws of confusion through it all bob never lost his composure or his patience when others would have understandably thrown up their hands in despair it will be relatively easy to fill the vacancy left by bob berry however i doubt that we will ever be able to replace him on the other hand i am extermely pleased that bob is moving on the new challenges and new horizons in his position with the american gas association i am confident that bob will prove to be of immediate benefit to that organization it is my great pleasure to join the with the rest of my colleagues in wishing bob berry the brightest of futures and the happiest of holidays we are all

more symbolic than real however h r 4561 makes an important statement for the first time we will be authorizing funding for nasas programs for 3 years this is an important first step in providing the necessary commitment and continuity the space program has lacked this bill also provides the long term direction needed to plan the nations future civilian space program ever since that day that nell armstrong first stepped on the moon a manned mission to mars has been a dream of most americans this bill is the first small step in turning that dream into reality the administrator is directed to initiate a focused program of exploration before the end of 1992 that will lead to a manned mission to mars moreover this bill recognizes the importance of a strong research and technology base to support such an ambitious mission therefore it establishes for the first time a 5year capital development plan for developing the advanced technologies needed to support both manned and unmanned missions for the future this legislation is consistent with the presidents space policy and not only supports the goal of expanding mans presence in the solar system but also articulates the goal of establishing settlements in space these are long term goals to be sure but goals none the less that i believe most americans share the legislation also establishes 5year capital development plans for space science and applications space transportation and aeronautics research and technologyall important elements of nasas charter in addition the important contribution of the private sector is recognized and the administrator is directed to encourage commercialization and increased private sector participation this bill authorizes the release of an rfpa request for proposalsfor the lease or purchase of a commercially developed space facility by offering to lease space on this facility we can make it possible for a company to secure the necessary private financing to develop a small mantended platform which can serve as an interim microgravity laboratory it is critically important that we develop and early capability for microgravity research this in no way diminishes our support

education and training for those who must begin by acquiring the very basics in order to reach higher the family welfare reform act of 1987 h r 1720 is a major adjustment in federal welfare policy and i am glad to be a supporter of this new direction as an original cosponsor to h r 1720 i had hoped to express the needs of my district as well as the feelings of our nation that the current welfare system is cumbersome and lacked the incentives that would usher welfare participants away from federal support and onto selfsupport the system we have today has not been entirely ine fective if the goal was to simply maintain millions of americans at or below the federal poverty level but it has been a failure if the objective was to move these people out of poverty and onto selfsupport h r 1720 appropriately moves us toward a strengthened foundation for our public welfare policy if one of five children in america today lives in poverty it may be a reflection of our weak economy but it is more a sign of our failed public assistance policies hl11522 twenty percent of all of the children in america are raised in poverty and the chancesthat their children will also grow up with poverty as part of their heritage is very likely among all black children in this great nation about onehalf are living in poverty these statistics are striking but in my delta district the second district of mississippi the numbers are exaggerated twentyseven percent of all the people in my district live below the federal poverty level this represents nearly 136 000 people and reflects an average annual unemployment rate of 13 1 percent is more than twice the national average several of the 22 countries in my district have annual unemployment averages above 20 percent and the outlook for improvement is poor but slowly improving as we begin to reexpand our economic base in the delta our concerns become focused and committed to growth beyond the business community and stretches into the common community we realize that economic development can change a community a town and a region and very important in that equation are the changes in the lives of our people the individual changes and personal triumphs are where the battles are won and the new direction of public welfare reform runs tandem to these efforts as much as we must include the element of compassion the design and structure of our welfare reform must include accountability and attractive incentives that urge participants to become selfsupporting what can be more motivating than the selfdignity that is the light at the end of the welfare tunnel guiding people out of poverty and dependency and into the habits and routines of working people is the process and goal of h r 1720 i have seen too often the desire of a people slowly deminished by failing hopes i have seen firsthand the dispair of repeated failure and needs unmet surely the family welfare reform act is not a panacea but i believe it is a very positive step and holds great promise for all americans including those who support it those who need it and those who are on the margin and hope never to need it it becomes a giveandtake safety net that will obviously require initiative on the part of all parties most importantly welfare recipients the features of h r 1720 make it attractive and workable while replacing the existing aid to families with dependent children program with a new family support program an initiative designed to encourage families to support themselves by working and with payment of child support by absent parents states would be required to establish education training and work programs that include a variety of services including remedial education job search assistance skills training onthejob training benefit subsidies for work and community work experience it is practical and appropriate that welfare recipients be required to participate in the national education training and work program network if space is available however it is just as reasonable to exempt parents with children under 3years of age and the elderly and provide a modification of parttime participation for parents with children ages 3 to 6 when adequate child care is guaranteed just as there are exempted categories there should also be targeted priority groups such as teenage parents and parents who did not graduate from high school and those who have been on welfare for more than 2 years or more based on 1980 census data 48 percent of the adults in my district were without a high school diploma and among those who attempted to enter one of the unitedstates armed services 35 percent were turned away because they could not pass the written entrance exams i know that many ofmy constituents will fall into one of the high priority categories but since the single highest source of personal income in my district is through public assistance transfer payments i am not surprised during my campaign for congress in 1986 i often spoke of the need to reform our welfare system now we have the chance to pass and implement a system of support and transition for people on welfare moving them from the welfare roll on to the payroll in support of the transition states will be required to subsidize day care expenses for working families for 6 months after leaving afdc or fsp there is one provision in the bill which is long overdue to prevent needy twoparent families from having to split up to gain eligibility for welfare benefits effective january 1 1990 all states will be required to extend benefits to these families when the principal wage earner is unemployed until now the incentive for unemployed twoparent families was to split up so the singleparent household could qualify for benefits too often the economy of circumstances forced the ablebodied man to leave in order to insure the benefit entitlements for his family we are moving forward and casting out this disincentive and replacing it with a hopeful and compassionate requirement many of my colleagues and opponents of h r 1720 have said the price tag on this bill is too high outlays totaling 1 7 billion over 3 years fiscal year 1988 fiscal year 1989 fiscal year 1990are estimated to fund this new thrust in welfare reform h r 1720 does not only create a new direction in serving welfare eligible families it does so without adding to the federal budget deficit h r 1720 includes financing measures that are expected to raise all of the funds for the 3 years of authorization the financing measures offset the direct spending costs in the bill by the following measures the costs for the welfare reform provisions will be offset the bill includes modifications to existing tax credit laws for child and dependent care expenses under h r 1720 the credit would be reduced for households with adjusted gross incomes exceeding 65 000 and be entirely eliminated for incomes above 95 000 the bill also eliminates the credit entirely for expenses incurred to send children to overnight camps also contained in the bill is a measure that denies any tax credits or deductions for amounts incurred while carrying out illegal activities the state of mississippi is the poorest state in our great nation the percentage of welfare recipients in mississippi is higher than any of our sister states and the second district is the highest in the state i am not ashamed of my state or my district for this dubious distinction but i am made painfully aware that a new policy and a new philosophy of public assistance is needed and now as an early supporter of h r 1720 i am heartened with the prospects of moving the spirit and broadening the opportunities for our poorest americans let us work together in the passage of this revenueneutral

military assistance could have a dramatic and regrettable effect upon the fragile peace process the foley substitute is certainly not perfect however its clearly preferable to the resumption of militaryrelated assistance and far better than settling into a series of votes on military aid over the next few months i am encouraged that this approach would shift delivery of all humanitarian assistance to the international committee of the red cross or other international relief agencies as soon as hostilities cease the substitute also prohibits delivery of currently stockpiled military supplies further this proposal encourages both sides to reach a formal ceasefire agreement by providing for continuation of humanitarian assistance through the end of the year in that event let me
