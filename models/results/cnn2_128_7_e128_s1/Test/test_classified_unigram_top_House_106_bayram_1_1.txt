this deadline this year however it is also true that keeping our fiscal house in order does take a little longer than the freewheeling bigspending days of the past because we must ensure that all funding is spent efficiently and where it is needed the most the conference report before us this afternoon not only holds the line on the presidents additional spending requests but also responsibly funds areas important to every american citizen and protects the american people from waste fraud and abuse across the entire federal government earlier this year the republican congress made a commitment to end the 30year raid on social security and according to the congressional budget office we have now completed that task the president began the budget negotiations by taking a large step toward our position on the social security issue and joined us in locking away every penny of social security we worked with him in a bipartisan fashion to protect retirement security we were determined to protect american seniors and this congress and its leadership denied any piece of legislation on the house floor that spent one penny of it to achieve our goal of protecting american seniors and responsibly funding important programs we are including in this bill a plan to direct every federal agency to reduce spending by less than onehalf of one percent 38 percent of 1 percent by routing out waste fraud and abuse surely the government can save less than about half a penny out of every dollar this republican congress is simply asking those who run federal agencies to make fiscally responsible budgeting decisions with the money taxed out of our paychecks we all know the agency directors and executives know where the waste is and i am relatively certain they will be able to weed out at least that much in savings with this sensible plan in addition to meeting the fiscally responsible objectives this conference report also ensures that our principles of quality and flexibility in the funding for teachers have been met in the laborhhs section of the bill this congress ensures that funding may no longer be used to hire unqualified teachers provides that schools will have more flexibility in using their funding for improving the qualityof uncertified teachers and increases the amount of funding that may used for professional training for teachers the administration pushed for a onesizefitsall mandate in which washington controlled the 100 000 new teachers program not every district needs new teachers some need bettertrained teachers other districts need books hightech equipment and updated math and reading programs i think it is foolish for the washington bureaucracy to tell every school district in america that washington knows best how to spend tax dollars to educate our children the debate in washington is not only about money it is also about how that money should be spent this bill moves us closer to the right balance of education funding by providing additional funds for americas students through programs like pell grants and special education while lowering the bureaucratic burden imposed by washington through programs like goals 2000 the commerce justice state section of the conference report maintains our commitment to enhancing local law enforcement without involving washington bureaucrats we also provide funding for 1 000 new border patrol agents funds for increased criminal and illegal alien detention and the resources necessary to end the severe naturalization backlog at the ins the district of columbia continues to receive the high level of funding provided in each round of this process the conference report paves the way for dramatic improvement in the education of washingtons children

appropriations bill because it severely cuts programs that are extremely important to the education of our children and because it hurts displaced workers i urge my colleagues to oppose it the first

fact that this bill would eliminate head start for some 53 000 children and cut 1 3 billion for urgent repairs to schools across the country these are critical issues for my district and for many districts across the country this bill will also eliminate school counselors serving 100 000 children this action will deprive schools of the professionals they need to identify and help troubled children this bill also does considerable injustice to bilingual and immigrant education the amount included in the bill for programs addressing these issues is 54 million below the budget request the professional development of our bilingual education teachers is critically important the labor hhs and education bill in its current form provides an amount that is 28 5 million below the budget request for the important programs of bilingual education professional development the grants that are provided for the development of our teachers in bilingual education are needed to increase the pool of trained teachers and strengthen the skills of teachers who provide instruction to students who have limited english proficiency these funds support the training and retraining of bilingual teachers the disparities in minority education will be increased if this bill is passed secondly this bill severely shortchanges programs that assist displaced workers this is a major issue for my constituents in el paso as i know that it is for many of you in your home districts in el paso and in other areas along the unitedstates mexico border nafta has created many displaced workers and this bill does an injustice to programs that could help them for example the bill cuts assistance to over 215 000 dislocated workers and it cuts the dislocated worker program by 207 million below the 2000 level these cuts will make it more difficult for these workers to find jobs this bill also cuts adult job training for almost 40 000 adults the cuts in adult training programs equal 93 million or 10 percent below the request and 2000 levels finally this bill provides only 9 6 million for employment assistance to another class of displaced workers our homeless veterans there are over a quarter million homeless veterans in this country and the provisions in this bill will deny employment assistance to thousands of these americans who have faithfully served their country this is unacceptable

full day of work in the congress this week the republicans will send us home tonight and we will not be back again until next tuesday night and i think the republicans should be embarrassed they simply cannot govern keep in mind that between today and next tuesday the republicans are deploying their members to go out and campaign they are not hunkered down in some room trying to figure out

discipline great for a learning experience but no the republicans do not want to do that they do not want to provide the money the second education initiative the democrats have stressed is that they want to provide some funding back to the local school districts to help defray the costs of school modernization we know that many schools are falling apart they need renovation some october i9 2000 need to be upgraded for computers for the internet many times there is overcrowding and new schools need to be built well the democrats have been saying and the president and vice president gore have been saying let us provide some money back to the towns back to the local school districts to accomplish that goal but no the republicans do not want to do that basically they are saying that these are not important we should not provide money to reduce class size to hire more teachers to provide for school modernization democrats are saying let us stay here and get the job done we are not going

reasons why our steel industry and its workers find themselves in this serious crisis we have been through that in the months leading up to the vote on march 17 what i am here to say and to join the

know that when those goodpaying jobs disappear they disappear forever the need for our steel bill was clear on march 17 and today it is even more clear 289 house members believed that something must be done to stop these imports as we continue to see higher rates of steel entering the country each and every day the administration may argue that the amount of steel imports for the month of march represents a 30 percent drop in imports since november of 1998 and while that may be true shipments from countries such as brazil and japan showed a significant increase it is important to point out that just yesterday the president warned japan that the united states will take action if the steel imports are not returned to their precrisis levels i believe that is an absolute positive step in the right direction and i applaud the president for this action we must continue though in our action to make sure that passage of the bill that the house sent over is approved in the senate and

tonight i am the cochair person of the congressional advisory committee to prevent teen pregnancy but i think we all should be cochairs of that i think that is a subject of huge importance to everybody in america today we still in america have the highest rate of teen pregnancy higher than some of the third world countries in the world which is pretty amazing when we consider the advances which have been made in american society in so many other ways because i consider this to be frankly a high negative we are doing better our statistics in the last 3 or 4 years indicate that we are starting to go down in the rate of teenage pregnancy it is a tremendous problem obviously because we have a lot of unwed very young mothers with absolutely no income sources whatsoever with young men out there who do not have a clue about how to do anything about a family or earn any income or whatever it may be so it is almost a direct descent into some sort of economic help from the government in the form of welfare or something else in fact the statisticsoare something like that if you graduate from high school and you wait until 20 to get married and you never have a criminal record the chances are something like 80 percent you will never be in poverty but if indeed any of those things happen if you get pregnant early or do not graduate from high school or have a criminal record the chances are almost overwhelming that you are going to live in poverty at some time during the course of your life so it is very evident with perhaps a few exceptions it is evident that we are all far better off if we indeed wait with respect to the concept of giving birth and getting pregnant obviously i guess we would preach abstinence first that has a lot of good tones to it in terms of what it means in the sense that you do not have any of the mental concerns of having been sexually involved and of course you are going to prevent disease because you have not been involved and obviously no pregnancies are going to take place but at some point it often goes beyond that with our young people and they do get involved at that point we need to talk about planning and contraceptives i think we have a more open approach the idea is to avoid pregnancy by avoiding pregnancy you avoid all of those problems and of course avoid the horrible problem of abortion which is something that is abhorred by practically everybody in the country whether they are prochoice or prolife so we have to do these things i see it i see it in my state of delaware i have seen it in dover high school at a wellness center just last week last friday i talked to four or five kids who are going through programs there to help deal with the subject of pregnancy they are talking with each other we have wellness programs in all but one high school in the state of delaware now that we did not have before they have sessions in which they can actually get together and begin to talk about these issues that is why i think we are starting to make an impact with respect to the rate of teen pregnancy in the united states of america which again is a positive sign but there are still as i said other things that we have to do to continue to build on this recent record of success so i know a lot of the members of congress are vitally interested in this subject and we thank them for their time and attention on it hopefully the public will weigh in as well if we do we can prevent a lot of the hardship a lot of the problems a lot of the stress and strain on individuals and families that occur in

the farm economy in north dakota i have with me today some auction bills we have been seeing a lot of these auction bills consider that each auction bill represents a sale of a family farm the end of literally generations of tradition of farming the land it goes on for pages recently ag week periodical which covers the red river valley the most prosperous part of agriculture in my state published 150 farm auctions this is 150 individual operators throwing in the towel ending again the tradition handed down for generations of making a living off their land in each case it is a tragedy and something to be avoided one friend of mine and i am going to offer this for the record who is selling out after 120 consecutive years of production on this family farm wrote an oped to the newspaper and he has on the title of it now at least we do not have to wonder anymore there are an awful lot of families wondering tonight whether or not they will be able to get a crop in the ground this spring imagine we all deal with career uncertainty surely as members of the house up for election every other year we really never know until the election is over what we are going to be doing but we have people at this late point in the spring not knowing whether they will be able to put a crop in the ground right now obviously if they cannot get the financing to get a crop in the ground they have no idea what they are going to do to put shoes on their kids feet to put food on the table we have got a fullblown crisis in agriculture directly related to the financing capital farmers need to get their crop in the ground this spring for that reason the administration advanced several weeks ago emergency funding requests so that we might have additional loan authority funded the request is for 152 million and it is part of the supplemental appropriations bill sent up by the white house 109 million of that would make 1 1 billion in additional lending authority available to farmers 42 million so that the usda could actually hire additional staff to process these applications and get the money out here is what has happened in light of the collapse in commodity prices farmers have had terrible losses as they sit down with their regular bankers they are unable to show cash flow and therefore unable ineligible in many cases for the financing that they had otherwise expected now there are programs available for these farmers fsa lending programs direct lending programs usda loan guarantee programs but because so many have had trouble in lending in the normal course they have come to the usda and overwhelmed the resources available for those usda loans right now north dakota we have a backlog we do not have enough money to meet the loan need now and it is anticipated that that loan need is going to increase dramatically over the next few days there is 4 4 million in unmet loan need that has come into the north dakota fsa offices over the last 2 days alone this is a crisis and it is a crisis with a very narrow window of time for us to address if a farmer cannot get the crop in the ground in the spring the money coming along here in july or august is not going to do a lick of good the window is gone they have lost the chance to plant and for these operators that means they have lost the farm i would say to my colleagues please let us move this supplemental appropriation request along everyone knows of the urgent straits in farm country not just in north dakota or south dakota but throughout the country and we must respond to this by getting that loan guarantee money replenished so that it can get out to the farmers so they can get their crop in the ground this spring so they dont lose their farms it is as simple as that it is very straightforward

lower prices in canada the savings realized by these persons was nothing short of astonishing elsie saved 650 or 47 percent of the cost of her prescriptions nancy saved 48 percent or over 450 francis saved 60 percent for all of the men and women who went the savings amounted to a significant proportion of their monthly income now i should point out that these persons were only allowed to buy medications for 2 months and so those significant savings were for only a 2month period of the year mary takes nine different medications and she spends 73 percent of one months income for 3 months supply she speaks for many seniors when she says do you stop taking your medication to buy food it is intolerable that the wealthiest nation in the world allows this situation to persist however it is even worse to see the lengths to which the pharmaceutical industry will go to defeat any effort to make these drugs more affordable citizens for better medicare a group funded primarily by the largest
