crosscurrents that accompany national emergencies poland was so blessed in the person of cardinal stefan wyszynski a courageous prudent farseeing and temperate spiritual leader who adroitly headed the polish catholic church of some 30 million souls for more than a generation the reach of this amazing prelates influence extended well beyond poland with the advent bf the papacy of john paul ii who at his inauguration indicated that it was because of his mentor wyszynski that the roman catholic church has its first polish pontiff 0 this symbol rept sents the time of day during the house proceedings e g o 1407 is 2 07 cardinal wyszynski spent much of his priestly life under the harsh anticlerical tyrannies of nazism and communism yet thanks to his brilliant leadership the polish catholic church today is far stronger than it was when he became primate of poland in 1949 in fact i believe it is fair to say that of the various current power centers in poland only the catholic church speaks for the vast majority of the polish people given what has transpired in postworld war ii poland that is a remarkable turn of events on a number of occasions during this period poland was rocked by domestic political troubles in each instance cardinal wyszynski played a pivotal role in the resolution of those problems primarily because he possessed the uncanny ability of knowing just when and how much to resist totalitarian rule and when to compromise without repudiating his principles adhering to those principles i might add cost him time in prison throughout that ordeal his paramount concern was that the church would never reject the will of its people for the better part of the last year the worlds attention has been riveted upon poland as we all know there have been moments when it appeared soviet intervention was imminent miraculously that has been avoided to date and much of the credit for that must go to cardinal wyszynski always able to keep things in perspective he skillfully served as a bridge between labor and government in a manner that inspired the confidence and trust of both parties i had the distinct honor and privilege of cochairing with our colleague clem zablocki the presidents delegation to the funeral of cardinal wyszynski the other members of the delegation were his eminence john cardinal krol archbishop of philadelphia aloysius mazewski

of detroit who was accompanied by the reverend stanley milewski chancellor of orchard lake schools orchard lake mich mrs helen zielinska president of the polish womens alliance and mr joseph drobot president of the polish roman catholic union of america the outpouring of sympathy we witnessed for this towering religious figure has left me with poignant and lasting memories it also has caused me to realize what a legacy he leaves behind the poland we see today in many ways is the result of his efforts therefore while saluting his memory i pray that whoever is chosen as the next primate of poland will be able to build upon the wyszynski legacy and in so doing move poland toward a permanent solution to its most difficult internal problems"], [0.0015957951545715332, 0.9984042048454285, 1,

unmatched since world war 11 inflation is driving millions of hardworking citizens into tax brackets traditionally associated only with the very wealthyto the benefit solely of the federal treasury in

budget resolution which will soon be adopted by this body will in a large measure determine the future course of this nation this administration contends that the american people on november 4 1980 gave ronald reagan a mandate to reduce federal spending cut taxes and slow inflation op february 18 1981 the president reacted to this socalled mandate by producing perhaps the most revolutionary budget document which this nation has ever seen the budget revealed by the presidentnow embodied in the grammlatta substituteprovides millions more for the most prosperous in our nation while pennies are taken away from the poor in the name of 1econamic recovery the budget revealed by the president would pad the pentagon with over 50 billion in new money for ships and other weapons for which we lack the skilled manpower to build and operate in the name of national security the administration budget would take away a 46cent meal from a food stamp recipient household or a ceta job from a high school dropout in the name of reducing inflation it is hard for me to understand the nature of a mandate in which a cold and callous insensitivity for the poor the disadvantaged the handicapped the elderly and the unemployed in our society is disguised as maintaining a social safety net for the truly needy to this date no one in this administration has yet defined this illusory term truly needy i do not believe that the american people mandaited the dismantlement of government by thiq means indeed ihe cbc has met the president headon by accepting his challenge to propose measures which offer a greater chance of balancing the budget reducing and eliminating inflation stimulating the creation of jobs and reducing the tax burden most importantly the cbc substitute accomplishes the economic goals which president reagan purports to address except that we do it with humaneness and compassion our substitute offers a greater chance for addressing the economic ills of this nation time and time again we have heard administration officials members of congress and bureaucrats recite how federal deficit spending causes inflation yet the administration budget or grammlatta substitute provides for a huge 50 billion deficit while the congressional black caucus does not subscribe to the tenet that a deficit creates inflation the cbc substitute amendment provides for a 7 85 billion surplus in fiscal year 1982 in a fiscally sound manner the cbc substitute offers the taxpayers a greater chance by rejecting the reagan administration tax cuts under the reagan plan 19 percent of the taxpayers with iincomes of 30 000 and above receive 61 percent of the tax relief while the 63 percent of the taxpayers with incomes below 20 000 receive only 18 percent of the tax relief the cbc rejects this economic shell game which redistributes income from the poor and middle class to the rich our substitute takes bold new steps toward innovative and comprehensive tax reforms our substitute offers the largest and fairest tax cut for the working poor and the middle class by increasing the standard deductiontaken by 60 percent of american taxpayersby indexing the tax code to control bracket creep and by increasing the earned income tax credit our substitute provides for a different approach to business incentives to stimulate capital formation and productivity by adopting a firstyear capital cost recovery system for business which has been endorsed by fortune magazine the new york times and the public interest tax research group our substitute generates ovvr 44 billion

have forgotten that our government is here to serve the peopleall the people in this nation somewhere along the line we have gotten lost in a maze of cold statistics and numbers and

care spending let me elaborate in this area a bit currently over 28 million elderly persons receive health care under medicare the elderly are sick more frequently and for more prolonged periods of time than the rest of the population of every 100 persons age 65 and over 80 suffer some kind of chronic ailment 10 suffer from impaired vision and 17 have hearing impairment sixteen of every one hundred persons age 65 and older are hospitalized one or more times annually the elderly require three times as many days of hospital care every year as persons under the age of 65 for most of our senior citizens illness strikes most often and with greatest severity at the time in life when incomes are most limited millions of our older citizens cannot afford the health care that they need it is a sad commentary on our society when many of our aged are forced to choose between seeing a doctor or getting a prescription filled or whether they will spend the money for food or warmth the cbc substitute protects funding for medicare since the enactment of medicaid in 1965 life expectancy of all races and sexes has increased and infant mortality rates have decreased clearly the medicaid program has helped nevertheless 23 million black americans still endure poorer health care higher death rates lower life expectancy and a reduced sense of wellbeing than the white population the shocking fact is that only half of the poor people in this country are eligible for medicaid benefits thirteen million children are supposed to receive physical checkups medical and dental care under medicaid yet 1 out of 3 american children has never seen a dentist one in seven has no access to regular health care the caucus substitute protects medicaid benefits for the poor andsick in our society under the grammlatta substitute which incorporates a cap on medicaid spending many states if not most would have to slash medicaid eligibility and benefits in fact many states are already doing so our nation leads the world in terms of biomedical research in fiscal year 1981 we will spend over 3 billion for this purpose yet we still do not have adequate treatment for cancer we have not found a way to cure diabetes we do not know how to prevent a myriad of diseases which cripple and debilitiate our people our substitute protects funding for these important research activities millions of americans suffer from the wrenching problems of mental illness alcohol and drug abuse a presidential commission on mental health acknowledged and lamented the fact that we have neither adequate services or trained manpower to properly treat these problems our substitute aussumes that we at least maintain current levels of spending for mcntal health services research and training minorities are severely underrepresented in the health professions for example blacks comprise fewer than 3 percent of lhe nations physicians and dentists and pharmacists less than 4 percent of podiatrists less than 1 percent of veterinarians and optometrists the cbc substitute provides funding for the federal programs which were designed to address thes~e fundamental inequities let me say

including the endangered whooping crane enhance the quality of ground water and other beneficial uses the study would evaluate the availability of water resources in the area for all beneficial uses

feasibility studies for water projects the willingness of the potential beneficiaries to bear that cost is indicative of the strong support in the local area and will serve as an example for future

the section 5 preclearance provisions of the committee bill in its 16year history the voting rights act has proven to be the most important civil rights legislation ever passed by congress largely because of this law registration and voting by minority citizens has increased dramatically as has the number of minority elected officials the discriminatory practices of an earlier era have been largely eradicated and more and more americans are being given a real opportunity to exercise the most important right and responsibility of citizenship nevertheless the recurring theme in testimony by more than 100 witnesses before the committee was that threats to the political equality of minorities continue to exist for this reason i believe it is essential that congress approve the preclearance provisions of the legislation in a form which will make them effective and enforceable the committee bill provides that formit requires that those local jurisdictions with a proven history of voting discrimination seek d partment of justice approval bwfore making changes in voting laws extending the preclearance provisions to all 50 states would do irreparable damage to the laws effectiveness rather than making enforcement more equitable the amendment before the house would make the bill largely unenforceable in this time of programmatic and budgetary reductions the

bill apply to local governments in 24 states from coast to coast they discriminate against no state or region if indeed the encompassed jurisdictions can demonstrate that they have followed the letter

would be more helpful to older americans today than to demystify the issue of social security minimum benefits the administration and members of the house of representatives and the senate decided to eliminate the minimum benefit in the budget reconciliation process this change was not undertaken without considerable research about its potential effect on older citizens removal of the minimum benefit was recommended precisely because it is an unearned benefita welfare type of income supplement that a recipient is not entitled to from his or her payroll tax contributions maintaining these unearned minimum benefits will cost 7 billionputting unnecessary pressure on the already stresseoi trust funds it is important here to recognize that there are two different kinds of minimum social security beneficiaries one group of beneficiaries has worked for years under social security but at low wages the formula that is used to determine their benefits is purposefully weighted so that they can receive more than they actually should based on their payroll tax contributions these longterm lowwage earners receive benefits that are higher so that they can have a better standard of living after retirement these people who have worked at least 19 years under the system are completely protected as they should be from any benefit changes there is a second group of persons who receive a minimum benefit and who are the subject of current discussion this group has as a rule worked for a short time under social security at high wages based on total lifetime earnings the average individual receiving this minimum benefit could have paid less than 355 in social security payroll taxes over their lifetime and receive a benefit of 2 122 in 1982 this amount would also be increased annually to reflect changes in the cpi in certain instances a couple could receive at least 3 183 in 1982 by paying as little as 3 in payroll taxes over their entire working lifetime it has been found that on the average a husband and wife getting an initial minimum benefit in 1982 would be paid more than 100 000 during their retirement lifetime from the social security trust funds for this average couple that would be about 300 times what they paid into the system these cannot be considered earned benefits now it is important that we are all clear about those that will be affected by the change there are presently 3 million persons receiving the minimum benefit research undertaken byf the general accounting office shows that only 17 percent of the minimum benefit recipients are truly needy and that 74 percent do not depend primarily on social security for retirement income the general accounting office also estimates that 450 000 minimum beneficiaries are already receiving federal pensions averaging 16 000 annually in addition 50 000 have retired spouses who are estimated to receive an average of 18 500 in federal pensions and 300 000 have spouses who are earning an average 21 100 this accounts for 800 000 of the 3 million current minimum benefit recipients another 1 2 million are only technical minimum beneficiaries actually these individuals received more than the minimum benefit because they are entitled to dual benefitstheir total benefit payment is based not only on their own low earnings but on the earnings and social security taxes of their spouse their total benefit would be unaffected by elimination of the minimum benefit also in this group are 200 000 persons who have earned benefits that are equal to the minimum benefit because earned benefits would not be affected these people would not lose any benefits of those receiving the minimum benefit 500 000 are also receiving supplemental security income which is adjusted for receipt of other income therefore those people who would lose the social security minimum benefit would have that same amount replaced under the ssi program an important step was taken to eliminate possible hardships for many of the needy persons receiving social security minimum benefits under the present law one is not eligible for ssi unless he or she is 65 blind or disabled under our new proposal when the minimum benefit is eliminated people who are between the ages of 60 and 64 will be considered eligible for benefits under ssi if they meet other eligibility requirements i think it is particularly important to understand all these facts in light of the charade undertaken by the democrats in the house of representatives today the democrats introduced a resolution that strongly urges that the necessary steps be taken to insure that social security benefits are nor reduced for those currently receiving them they did this knowing that this resolution is not binding and has no force to bring about any change it was used in a partisan effort to improve the popularity of the democratic party statements were continually made that 3 million needy older persons would be hurt by the elimination of the minimum benefit even though this is clearly not the case beside the availability of ssi needy individuals will also be eligible for other federal programs such as food stamps and medicaid benefits the administration and the republican leadership of the house did not want to make this important effort to improve the system an emotional and partisan issue they did not want to be ~placed in a negative role for their attempts to strengthen the system for the wage earners to diffuse this growing bitterness most republicans including myself will vote with the democrats in support of the resolution in closing because of what i have just said i will fully understand the proposal to eliminate the minimum july 21 1 981 co benefit because it is not accomplishing the purpose for which it was originally intended most of the people who receive it were not the low wage earners for whom it was developed moreover many beneficiaries receive adequate income from other sources i believe that it is in the broader national interest to stabilize the system and keep it viable for current and future beneficiaries in doing so we must continue to honor our 46yearold contract wvith the american worker without jeopardizing senior citizens who depend on social security as their primary means of support if high unemployment and high inflation continue to have a negative impact on the social security system we

6 everylody in congress wanted to see it work for two big reasons the first one was that we would get our budget done very early every year we would know exactly where we were going the first thing that this law mandated was that by april 15 of every year congress would have completed the budget that was april 15 now we are out here knocking on the door of june and we have not yet passed or gone to conference the second thing is they said we would be able to effect tremendous savings in cutting spending because by doing all of this planning that we would be able to do we would be able to make its operation much more efficient we would be able to cut spending everywhere i looked back then to see where we were in 1974 when we started this budget process congress was spending 270 billion i think 269 8 billion or something like that to be exact 270 billion we were spending at that time now we are talking about 750 billion so obviously the budget process was a complete failure in cutting

upon whichl the economy of the state depends those who would seek to delete the sugar section from the farm bill are intent upon making this nation a have not nation as far as sugar is concerned we are presently the only major sugar producer that does not have a legislatively mandated sugar program without this protection there soon may be one less sugarproducing nation we see the evidence of a steady loss of sugar processing plants as the industry is asked to continue its operation without a sugar program without our domestic producers it would be necessary to import all of the sugar we use presently domestic producers meet about half our needs the rest is bought on the socalled world market that market is volatile and unstable in the absence of a dependable domestic industry we could find ourselves at the mercy of foreign interests who could manipulate the market for their own gain we need look back no further than 1974 for a clue as to what can happen when we are not fortified with a viable program the price of sugar on tile grocers shelves reached at least 45cents a pound the chlances of this happening again are greater by far without a program for our domestic producers when it does we will have more have nots among the consumers who will not be able to purchase sugar at inflated prices our past experience has shown that sugar prices are more stable and reasonable in the united states when a domestic program is in effect you need only look at the years 1934 through 1973 when a sugar act was in force to see the consistent stability compared to 1975 through 1976 when we had no program and raw the domestic price double for 3 years 1977 1978 and 1979 a sugar loan program was operating the average price during these years was about half what it was in 1980 when no loan program was offered it would appear to be clear that the best possible arrangement for consumers and producers alike is a nonrecourse loan program for sugar as incorporated in the language of h r 3603 despite the propaganda to the contrary this is not a costly giveaway instead experience has shown that little of the sugar under the loan program is forfeited and even when it is the government has been able to not only recoup its investment but to realize a profit on it as well the overriding necessity as i see it is to insure that consumers and manufacturers have a dependable supply of sugar reasonably priced and available when needed we can have that insurance by making sure we have a viable industry of domestic producers it will survive under the loan program outlined in this bill so we must not give in to the pressure to dismantle the sugar industry in the united states for any fleeting price advantage we might gain on the world market i assure you such an advantage will not last long it never has and none of us should count on it we must defeat the amendment to delete the sugar section i respectfully ask my colleagues to join me in voting against the amendment"], [0.00425952672958374, 0.49574047327041626, 1, "the difference the gentleman well knows is not a slight difference what the gentleman is proposing to do in his amendment is to allow the secretary a legislative carte blanche to make any changes in the law that he finds are necessary without referring that to congress except through the legislative veto process may i just answer the gentleman because this is a critical question if we say the secretary may do anything he wishes in order to carry out this policy subject only to a veto we have handed him the legislative authority and we have taken the executive veto on our side that is the reverse of the constitutional arrangement we should have the responsibility of makiiig legislative changes subject to an executive veto i think it wvould be a very bad precedent for us to say the secretary shall develop agricultural programs that provide adequate food and fiber and suit the needs of farmers and then we will veto what he does with respect for the gentlemani know he has over the years been concerned about excessive administrative power as well as having an interest in good manageable programs i do not think most
