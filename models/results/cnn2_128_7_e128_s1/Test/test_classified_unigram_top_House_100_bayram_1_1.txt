shambles because of their need for longterm care i have heard testimony attesting to the need for a system that will provide worryfree care for the elderly in homes across the nation senior citiiens are being forced into poverty by their needs for health care indeed they and their families are becoming slaves to the need for professional qualified home health care these votes come on the heels of the catastrophic health care bill passed last week the passage of that bill is an essential part of the package of health care for seniors its passage alone was predicated on the promises of the 100th congress to do more for the elderly the promises made by this congress and by past congresses have reached a do or die stage if we do not act on our promises we will lose the opportunity to help once that opportunity is lost millions will suffer the significance of this bill is more than procedural the days of the 100th congress are coming down to the wire after today there will be less

today in support of the defense conference agreement i would like to commend the conferees for the outstanding work they performed in reaching in agreement authorizing 299 6 billion for defense consistiint with last novembers budget summit agreement and the fiscal year 1989 budget resolution i am particularly grateful for the excellent work of the distinguished chairperson or the military personnel and compensation subcommittee mrs byron for her leadership in shepherding legislalion i introduced earlier this year h r 3975 which directs the secretary of defense to establish a permanent rental housing program involving military personnel and their civilian landlords this program will remove perhaps the largest financial burden on our military families this legislation will make permanent the pilot program which has been in effect at fort ord over the last 15 months the program has been implemented with a high degree of success resulting in the solution of problems with military residents with respect to payment and landlords obtaining guarantees on security deposit payments although the senate defense authorization measure did not contain a similar provision h r 4264s housing lease indemnity program was adopted by the senate with two amendments i support both amendments the first amendment clarifies the due process provlsions of the program regarding each participating service members obligation before reducing that members pay for breach of the lease or damage to the rental unit and the other amendment outlines the extension of this program to our service members overseas i would like to take a few minutes to describe what this legislation will do first of all it authorizes the secretary of defense to make the program permanent each military service would then have the option of whether and at which inst llations to institute participation in this program in the united states second civilian landlords who rent to military personnel would agree to waive security deposits when renting housing units to military personnel for the guarantee of rental deposit security from the military in return the military post would agree that if for any reason the service member leaves without making final payments for rent or damage the post would make such final payments these payments could not exceed the amount of an ordinarily required security deposit any outlays of the military post would then be deducted from the service members paycheck for example a service member wants to rent an apartment for 500 per month under this legislation the landlord would agree to accept only a first months rent without any required security deposit or last months rent right away we are saving the service member up to 1 000 if the service member if transferred to another post or is assigned to onpost housing and leaves his apartment without paying his last months rent the post to which he is assigned would meet the last months rent payment of 500 this 500 would then be deducted from the service members paycheck all of my colleagues are aware of the tremendous financial and emotional pressures inflicted on our military personnel and their families this already tense situation is made even worse during a permanent change of station move travel and relocation expenses come out of the pockets of our servicemen and women reimbursement comes later although in the past only 1 out of 4 spent on a pcs move has been reimbursed according to an air force study and when the military families arrive in a new location they must meet the immediate costs of security deposits first and last months rent utility deposits and more before you can even blink a military family can be thousands of dollars in debt and 2 years later the entire process is repeated it is important to note that no appropriation of funds is necessary because the service member would be ultimately responsible for meeting the costs of any damage or breach of lease i know that the landlords on the monterey peninsula have benefited from the pilot program the favorable comments from the civilian landlords show that the vacancy rate has dropped considerably in their particular apartment complexes since participating in the program also a housing referral office representative available when requested during moveout inspections provided the verification necessary to resolve any disputes or misunderstandings that arose at that time they realize the hardships imposed on the military family and they understand the progam guarantees payment for damages and breach of lease up to the amount of the usual security deposit this program gives landlords one point of contact for all their military tenants and a source of information regarding military personnel who may soon be transferred thus enabling landlords to prepare for a change in the lease soldiers have been very happy with the program because without it they could not afford a place to live and would therefore be forced to live apart from their families until onpost housing became available the program has also kept soldiers from getting into serious financial difficulties which is often associated with a pcs move this program should solve one of the major problems facing our military personnel and do away with certainly one of their largest financial burdens what is more no one loses in this program everyone wins landlords are guaranteed payment our military personnel are able to use their hardearned dollars for necessities and the services are guaranteed reimbursement for any outlays to landlords when the house voted in the 99th congress to accept many proposals to ease the burdens on our military personnel servicemen and women all over the world breathed a sigh of relief now this legislation will resolve one of the most pressing and financially disabling issues by making permanent this highly successful pilot program permanent so that one day our military men and women will not look on military service as a financially crippling experience again i want to thank the conferees for their excellent work on reaching this conference agreement and express my

lakes this legislation clearly bears the mark of the public works and transportation committees chairman jim howard ranking republican john paul hammerschmidt and subcommittee chairman henry nowak through their hard work and leadership we are able to bring before you today a truly bipartisan and widely supported bill i also want to commend congressmen tom ridge jim oberstar and bill clinger for their efforts they have certainly been instrumental in mobilizing congress to reform the disaster relief program in addition i would like to thank the other committees for their cooperation in moving this legislation swiftly h r 2707 has three titles title i the disaster relief and emergency assistance amendments of 1988 contains needed reforms to femas disaster relief program it makes very few substantive changes to h r 2707 the bill which congressmen ridge clinger oberstar and i introduced last june and which has received over whelming support title ii the great lakes erosion damage assistance and prevention act of 1988 addresses erosion and flooding problems in the great lakes states due to high lake levels title iii increases the appropriations ceiling for a project in new york harbor to collect and remove drift and debris in july 1987 the water resources subcommittee held an extensive hearing on h r 2707 and possible amendments to the disaster relief act title i of the committee reported bill contains h r 2707 virtually unchanged except for various perfecting amendments and finetuning provisions to reflect the views and comments of emergency management officials the new bill builds upon the strong base of h r 2707 clarifying the federal governments response authorities and financial responsibilities and establishing a stronger partnership among federal state local and private entities it strengthens femas existing program by adding needed uniformity consistency timeliness and above all else fairness in general title i reorganizes the disaster relief program to clearly define presidential authority to respond to major disasters and emergencies major disasters would include primarily natural catastrophes or in certain instances nonnatural catastroplies while emergencies would include any occasion or instance in which federal assistance was necessary the committee however does not intend for emergency declarations to be available in responding to public health problems such as aids epidemics or environmental or nuclear catastrophes for which federal assistance is already available nor do we intend to interfere with existing federal emergency authorities or the comprehensive crime control acts law enforcement emergency assistance provisions perhaps most importantly the bill clarifies cost sharing requirements under the law establishing a minimum federal share of 75 percent for major disaster expenses the bill also details what eligible assistance state and local governments can expect to receive besides improved cost sharing requirements the bill provides greater recognition of hazard mitigation by encouraging measures which would prevent a recurrence of a major disaster or minimize the damages that might be sustained the bill authorizes federal grants for hazard mitiga tion and increases the amounts of money available for disaster prepared ness grants to the states this small increase in federal funding should provide enormous dividends in the future since local governments and even private homeowners will find greater incentives to prevent rather than merely react to disasters the bill also injects greater discipline into the planning procedures of state and local governments by conditioning future federal disaster assistance upon flood insurance requiring floodprone areas to obtain flood insurance and participate in the national flood insurance program should save the federal treasury millions of dollars in the future h r 2707 also makes administrative reforms in response to femas 1986 proposed regulations this legislation contains important provisions on eligibility of communities for federal assistance the date of eligibility and the ability to advance payments and wave cost sharing requirements when necessary we recognize fema should have flexibility in determining threshold questions of eligibility however we do not condone and will not allow arbitrary decisions based solely on sliding scales or mathematical formulas involving population or income h r 2707 will also help to cut the redtape experienced by individuals and state local and private nonprofit entities people should be able to receive assistance when they truly need it and without endless hassles this bill helps ensure that happens without creating a drain on the federal treasury or unnecessarily increasing the federal governments role title ii of h r 2707 establishes within fema a 5year grant program to help the great lakes states prevent or reduce shoreline damages attributable to high lake levels the bill encourages wise shoreline development and environmentally protective responses but steers clear of any kind of federal land use planning the basic message in title ii is we know we cant completely control the lake levels just as we cant control mother nature but we can minimize or prevent future damages by establishing incentives for improved lake shore management and environmentally sensitive development thus title ii conditions federal assistance upon certain state and local activities to receive funding a state must provide a plan for assisting shoreline homeowners and local governments describe present and future efforts and meet 70 percent federal and 30 percent nonfederal cost sharing requirements no funds however can be used in an area where the state or local government does not enforce 30year erosion setback and 100year flood plain requirements frankly i had hoped for even tougher requiremenits such as 50 or 60year setbacks gut to be consistent with newly enacted provisions in the national flood insurance act we have agreed to the 30 year setbacks this is not a federal bailout nor is it a reward to states for previous failure to participate in the national flood insurance program or the coastal zone management program if the great lakes states want federal assistance they should be expected to do their part first they should participate in the coastal zone management program they should adopt tough erosion setback requirements and they should not build in the flood zone title ii also authorizes the corps of engineers to provide emergency assistance to prevent erosion or flooding damage to provide technical assistance to compile and disseminate information on water levels and to demonstrate lowcost methods of damage prevention in addition title ii encourages where feasible the use of natural nonstructural measures to control shoreline erosion this is an important environme tally protective policy and i am proud to support it title ii also encouragesbut does not requirethe use of dredged material for beach nourishment when feasible and mutually acceptable to the parties nothing in this bill however conditions the issuance of a section 10 or section 404 permit on using dredged material for such purposes i urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation h r 2707 is timely and important we need to pass

give prompt reconsideratioi to a vetoed bill that we are to vote on it and that an override should require twothirds of our number and that the vote is to be recorded for public inspection how can anyone in this body argue that we are complying with that instruction when we are referring the veto to a committee without the question of reconsideration being the question of highest privilege

mind when they wrote section 7 the founding fathers gave us the power in section 5 to right our own rules but they did give us the power to write rules so we could subvert the constitution they gave us the power of rulemaking to implement their good work and not to subvert it and if the founding fathers had intended that whoever sat in the chair at any given time could do whatever he or she

do here today on this subject matter is going to impact that negotiation next we are told that somehow nuclear weapons will become unreliable if we pass this amendment that too is now clearly proven not to be the case the chairman of the committee on armed services has received from the iawrence livermore national laboratory a re ort commonly known as the kidder report dealing with a low threshold test ban specifically at the one kiloton level that report states it is found that a high degree of confidence in the reliability of the existing stockpile is justified and that it is sufficiently robust to permit confidence in the reliability of remanufactured warheads in the absence of nuclear explosive prooftests then it is argued that somehow we shall lose all the technicians
