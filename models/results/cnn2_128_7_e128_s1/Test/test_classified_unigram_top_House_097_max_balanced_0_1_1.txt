investigation by the comptroller general into competitive bidding practices with respect to highway and mass transit construction in this country our sole reason for dropping this provision is that it has proven to be unnecessary this is because since the time our highway legislation was first developed this past spring the study has been requested and is now under way the deletion has been discussed by both the house and senate sides with full agreement that whether initiated by statute or otherwise this investigation is urgently needed has the support of both the house and senate committees and should be completed expeditiously the purpose of the language in section 108 dealing with resurfacing standards under section 109 of title 23 united states code is to assure that enhancement of highway safety result from the carrying out of any project for the resurfacing restoring or rehabilitation of any highway tc iwntent of this provision morever is to provide some
