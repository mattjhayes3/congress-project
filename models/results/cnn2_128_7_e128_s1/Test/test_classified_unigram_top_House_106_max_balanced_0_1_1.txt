speaker and i have read this bill and i cannot find where it says what he says it does in that bill it is the most amazing thing i have ever heard i am not a lawyer thank god for that but i do not read it that way what i am hearing as a committee on resources chairman frankly is to help protect the fifth amendment of the united states constitution the taking of private property unfortunately all too often the various governmental bureaucrats involved in land use decisions use their regulatory authority to take private property and then blame other levels of government for their actions i think maybe this is what the gentleman was speaking about the federal bureaucrats through their efforts will take private property and then blame someone else as a result i support h r 2372 because it will ensure that landowners landowners little landowners yes big landowners but mostly little landowners the largest percentage of takings by this government is from little landowners will get a fair chance to have their cases heard in federal court no matter which government bureaucracy is involved h r 2372 will also ensure that land dispute cases are heard expeditiously in order to resolve these disputes very promptly as a result of the expeditious court proceedings taxpayers as well as the private property owners legal costs will be reduced these prompt court proceedings will give even the poorest of our citizens the ability to defend their land finally h r 2372 will level the playing field between private property owners and the government landowners who wish to protect their legal and civil rights will now be able to afford court proceedings and the government will no longer be able to pressure landholders into taking their land i want to stress this that right now the bureaucrats take their time slow it down use undue pressure and finally get the land away from the private property owners let us ensure that the smallest and the poorest landowners can have the same rights as the biggest corporations and the environmental groups i urge support of h r 2372 and oppose any amendments to this legislation because this is the constitution the basis of our society is private land not government land when we have private land we have something to do with our government when it is owned by the government we have nothing to do with the government i urge members to pass this

firsthand on these committees i can tell you that the united states maritime and shipbuilding industries have had no greater friend he not only received the propeller club of the united states maritime industry salute to congress award in 1995 but after announcing his retirement earlier this year he was awarded the first ever herbert h bateman award by the american shipbuilding association and the helen delich bentley award by the propeller club of the port of washington in his own district he worked hard to see that the port of hampton roads remained competitive and introduced legislation which ultimately became law to deepen the channels there to 55 feet during his tenure on the merchant marine and fisheries committee he served as the ranking member of the oceanography and merchant marine subcommittees on the oceanography subcommittee he successfully shepherded through legislation that created the national oceanographic and atmospheric administrations noaa chesapeake bay office and authorized the sea grant oyster disease research program that research has led to the first small steps that are now being taken to restore oyster populations in the chesapeake bay much

unitedstates troops were treated fairly and that the readiness of unitedstates forces was maintained herb fought to secure construction of new nuclear aircraft carriers and new attack submarines the

occurred in the waters just off the virginia peninsula the battle of the monitor and merrimac or as the confederates called it the virginia this oneday battle changed the course of naval warfare forever unfortunately the monitor was lost soon afterward off the coast of north carolina the monitor was located in 1972 and became the first united states national marine sanctuary the sanctuary headquarters is located at the mariners museum only a few blocks from herb and lauras newport news home at herbs request congress required the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa to prepare a report on the longterm conservation of the monitor as a result of that study a multiyear project is underway to stabilize the wreck and recover conserve and display historically significant portions of the vessel i am sure herb will be pleased to know that these important historic artifacts will be protected and displayed so near his home also near his home is the monitormerrimac

unitedstates coast guard that is directly responsible for the oil pollution act of 1990 and all of its provisions around this country since the oil pollution act went into effect and since the coast guard has been monitoring this issue and enforcing this statute oil spills in the world have dropped by 60 percent it is through much of the effort of the unitedstates coast guard in this area that is responsible for that drop i have visited prince william sound the sight of the exxon valdez spill and the infrastructure put in place mainly because of the coast guard activities is phenomenal fifty percent of the cargo transported across our oceans is considered hazardous and it is the coast guard that deals primarily with that particular issue it is the coast guard which leads the unitedstates delegation to the international maritime organization that deals with 153 countries around the world that ensures that not only our coastal waters and not only our coastal waters out 200 miles of our coastlines but the international regime of the imo of these 153 countries that enhances the quality of our international waters it is the coast guard that is directly responsible for patrolling the north atlantic in something called the ice patrol so that not only the unitedstates ships traveling in the north atlantic can be safe from icebergs but the international community can be safe from icebergs the coastal fisheries out 200 miles off our coasts not only off the florida coast or the california coast but the oregon and washington coast in the frigid waters of the north pacific 200 miles of the alaskan coast 200 miles off our coast we monitor the coastal fisheries and the unitedstates coast guard ensures that unitedstates law is enforced out that far and they do a great job interdiction of drugs on the high seas just imagine the coastal waters of the united states the pacific coast the atlantic coast the gulf of mexico the caribbean we have the technology we have the resources to interdict almost all the drugs if the coast guard is given those resources within 5 to 7 years i am convinced that we can interdict up to 85 percent of those drugs if the coast guard is given the right resources we talked about safety at life at sea not only is the coast guard responsible for safety at life at sea for unitedstates fishermen but they also do a good job in the international arena on every river looking at the mississippi river the great lakes our estuaries the coast guard is responsible for safety at life at sea who inspects vessels domestic and foreign it is the coast guard who inspects these cargo ships these container ships these oil tankers thebulk carriers the small vessels it is the unitedstates coast guard who interdicts illegal immigrants being carried through to this country on the high seas it is the unitedstates coast guard who cuts ice in the great lakes who cuts ice in the estuaries like the chesapeake bay around this country it is the coast guard who cuts the ice leading to mcmurdo station in the antarctic it is the unitedstates coast guard who cuts the ice in the arctic ocean it is the unitedstates coast guard the point i am trying to make is that the unitedstates coast guard does all of this with a force smaller than the new york city police force i urge my colleagues not only to support this legislation but to think about the silent service that does a magnificent job and all they ask for from this body is that we know something about the magnificent job that they and that we vote for this legislation h r 820 was developed in a bipartisan manner and deserves the support of all the members the primary purpose of h r 820 the coast guard authorization act of 1999 is to authorize expenditures for the unitedstates coast guard for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 section 101 of the bill authorizes approximately 4 6 billion in the coast guard for fiscal year 2000 and 4 8 billion in fiscal year 2001 the amounts authorized for fiscal year 2000 include funding for coast guard programs at the levels requested by the president with certain increases the funding increases over the levels requested by the president are primarily for drug interdiction and commercial fishing and recreational vessel safety specifically h r 820 contains an additional 380 million for drug interdiction consistent with the provisions of the western hemisphere drug eliminatibn act which was enacted by congress last year h r 820 authorizes an additional 142 million in operating expenses for fiscal year 2000 and 148 million in operating expenses for fiscal year 2001 these funds will allow the coast guard to operate 15 additional coastal patrol boats a regional law enforcement training center in puerto rico several maritime patrol aircraft and six medium endurance cutters the bill further allows the coast guard to construct 15 coastal patrol boats for 81 million and to begin construction of six medium endurance cutters for 100 million in fiscal year 2000 these new assets will allow the coast guard to execute its role under the western hemisphere drug elimination act i have supported increases in the coast guards drug interdiction spending because i am convinced that the level of coast guard drug interdiction has fallen well below what is necessary to fight the war on drugs effectively the 46 million increase in drug interdiction resources requested by the president for fiscal year 2000 is not adequate to respond to the alarming level of teenage drug use in this country the bill also contains additional funds for voluntary fishing vessel safety personnel and 100 million to accelerate the national distress and response system modernization project also h r 820 authorizes 128 million in fiscal year 2001 to acquire a replacement icebreaking vessel for the great lakes section 102 of h r 820 authorizes an increase of coast guard military personnel to 40 000 by the end of fiscal year 2000 and 44 000 by the end of fiscal year 2001 to allow the coast guard to aggressively fight the war on drugs in the caribbean finally there are a few noncontroversial provisions in the bill including a provision to require vessel operators to give notice to the coast guard 24 hours before they enter unitedstates territorial waters i thank the ranking member"], [0.002552509307861328,

drug activity in and around elementary schools in the wake of the columbine incident and in the wake of countless acts of school violence in this country i know that all of my colleagues are eager to join in support ofthis amendment there are millions of children in this country who go to school every day eager to learn and to simply be among their peers how devastating that these children should have to fear fort their lives while in a learning environment those children who go to school should not have to fear for their lives while they are in school school should be sacrosanct the community oriented policing services program is only part of aprogram that funds hires and rehires for police and at the same time pays for equipment the school violence initiative is only a drop in the bucket of what we in the congress should do to stem the rising tide of school violence but it is an important drop inthat same bucket why do we in congress cry out in anger and in sadness when there is a school shooting why do we wait until a story hits the evening news before we decide that we must do something about violence in schools why do we wait until another child dies before we do what we

most of the opposition that has been expressed on this this afternoon has been more on the process we have had the complaints that there have not been adequate hearings in the committee on the judiciary et cetera that is usually a leading indication that they really cannot argue the policy all one has to do is read the constitution where it talks about freedom of expression and freedom of speech freedom of religion i do not believe anybody in everyday america thinks that a public prayer before a football game or some sort of a public event is establishing an official religion if one goes back to our founding fathers time and one looks at why they put in the prohibition against establishment of an official religion it was because in many of our states the anglican church was the official church if one goes even down to the great state of texas before it became a state the catholic church was the official church of mexico one had to convert to catholicism to come into texas in the 1820s saying a public prayer before a football game is not the establishment of a religion it is the acknowledgment that there is a supreme being and that those in attendance and those in participation wish the protection or the blessing of the supreme being as they engage in the contest as a united states congressman i have given public prayers before football games in texas as a football player way back in the dark ages of the 1960s i have given public prayers during football games i strongly hope that we will pass this resolution by the twothirds necessary to suspend the
