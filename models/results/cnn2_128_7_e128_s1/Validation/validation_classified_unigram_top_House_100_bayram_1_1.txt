need to offer effective alternatives to our health care delivery system by providing skilled medical assistance to those who can be properly treated outside the hospital or nursing home setting these agencies recognize the demand for new health care options and conserve tax dollars currently expended on needless placement in these institutions this valuable concept of care provides a serviceable answer to the needs of our health care system and offers a comforting dignified environment for patients alternatives to our health care programs must be offered and home care agencies have proven very effective in answering that need as you know one of the most critical issues to face our nation today centers around our health care system while the growing elderly population expected to total well over 30 million by the year 2000 places greater demand on our current system home care agencies have helped many of the elderly remain at home and in their communities this creates an atmosphere

investigation into what the federal aviation administration could do to better assist the drug interdiction and enforcement efforts of local state and federal authorities what this investigation revealed was that the faas system of registering aircraft and certificating pilots should be changed in order to make the false registration of aircraft more difficult it is also clear that there is need to improve the faas information of pilots and aircraft ownership to facilitate investigations of and legal actions against drug smugglers when drug enforcement authorities learn that a particular aircraft is being used in drug smuggling activities it is sometimes difficult or impossible to discover the identity of the true owners the difficulty is cause by the ease with which the faas aircraft registration and pilot certification requirements can be circumvented by smugglers in addition there are some significant holes in the faas system of registering aircraft and pilots even when a pilot

requires that ablebodied afdc recipients participate in workrelated activities aimed at increasing their employability but it exempts those people who realistically cannot work it provides training

crimes we need this information it will help local jurisdictions solve these crimes and hopefully prevent their recurrence what is true for all criminal acts is also true for hate crimes the more light we shed the harder we make it for criminals to hide in the darkness that is just good police work i think that is why the letter was cited by the gentleman from michigan stating that this

aids threat it is dangerous to jews hispanics arabs asians and african americans who are often the target of hateful acts and it is dangerous to the american community we can reverse thid trend the first step is to lift the rock to shine the light in the corner to gather as much information as we can about this threat to our nation i urge the passage of this perfecting amendment to make clear

encompasses northeast wisconsin over 65 percent of the hay crop and 45 percent corn crop have already been lost a ton of hay selling for 50 last year is now selling for over 150 the feed costs for next year will eat up an additional 12 000 to 15 000 of the farmers budget thats a lot of money for a wisconsin dairy farmer who normally has a profit margin of only 10 000 to 15 000 the emergency drought legislation will help farmers make it through the remainder of the year and ensure that they will be able to plant their crops next year the measure will preservo the economies of droughtstricken rural communities and prevent a sqrious disruption in the supply of food to american consumers the drought assistance act provides relief to all sectors of our nations agricultural economy including crop producers livestock producers dairy farmers and agribusinesses wisconsin farmers will directly benefit from many of the provisions in the bill specifically the feed assistance

as a bill which will totally destroy the moral fiber of this country in any judgment that interpretation is a little heavyhanded the opponents grassroots campaign to defeat the bill has been impressive hundreds of calls have poured into my office and i assume to many others as well interest groups which support the bill have been active as national organizations but they have not developed a grassroots campaign of their own the number of calls into my own offices and the concern of my constituents have forced me to scrutinize the bill even more closely i have tried to determine whether the legislation would result in the changes feared ii 1067 by its opponents but i have found no such language in this bill many citizens fear that federal courts will misinterpret the law one should always be nervous about people in black robes but if we let nervousness turn into paranoia we could never pass another bill this legislation does not change our current civil rights laws other than to restore the application of those laws to cover an entire institution rather than a program of an institution if federal funds are received this was the way civil rights laws were administered prior to the supreme courts grove city decision over 4 years ago none of the fears being expressed now were realized before grove city churchrelated schools were not forced to hire homosexuals and farmers and small grocers were not covered and abortions were not forced upon churchrun teaching hospitals the bill has been designed to narrow the coverage of the civil rights laws to ensure that the laws would work as they did before the court decision the congress has been debating this issue for 4 years it has not proceeded this far without plenty of discussion and debate we all knew this legislation was coming and there have been some opportunities for imputs of course i prefer the regular order in the house i would be happier if the house had moved the bill under its regular procedures i cannot defend the procedures under which it passed the house but in a matter of this importance i cannot let procedure stand as a more compelling argument than substance the need to overrule the grove city decision is too great first of all many of the interests expressing opposition to the legislation would not even be covered by it it is well to remember that an organization is covered only if it receives federal funds there is language in the bill which excludes such ultimate beneficiaries as farmers welfare social security medicare and food stamp recipients from coverage under the bill there is a religious tenet provision which would enable churchcontrolled organizations to refuse to perform abortions or to refuse to hire homosexual teachers the intent here is to interpret this language as broadly as possible as a result many of the major religious organizations have supported s 557 to date no religious group applying for a religious tenet exemption has been denied an exemption to be sure i would prefer the language affiliated with to the language of the bill controlled by in the religious tenets section but the history of the current law is that the religious tenet language has been interpreted well there is a restatement of current law that companies or organizations receiving federal funds would not have to hire a person with a contagious disease such as aids alcoholism or drug addition if there would be a direct threat to the health or safety to others rthere is in addition a small provider provision which exempts small businesses from expensive alternations of their businesses for excess by the handicapped if they can provide services to the handicapped in some other way homosexuals are not covered under any of these laws now and there is nothing in this bill that extends any rights to them there have been attempts for many years to amend civil rights laws to include sexual preference but congress has shown no interest at all but for more important than any defense against attacks on this bill is the need to make our rights laws work to accent the positive the urgent need to guarantee the rights of american citizens far outweighs the objections to s 557 and where are civil rights more important than in our institutions of higher education young americans preparing themselves for leadership roles in our society
