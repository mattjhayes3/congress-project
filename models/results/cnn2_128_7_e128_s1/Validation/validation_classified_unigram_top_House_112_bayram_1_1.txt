rebels the varying presidential statements that seemed to shift like the wind the level of unitedstates involvement the possibility of qadhafi retaliating against american interests outside of libya and whether unitedstates ground troops might well be requested at some point although the resolution seems to clearly say that that would not be authorized by congress in the course of the debate over the constitutionality and viability of the war powers resolution these questions have remained unanswered the president has refused to seek congressional approval of his action or even to provide a full explanation of his decisions as the nato campaign continues new questions have arisen about unitedstates participation and what is now natos involvement in libya let me just say mention was made a moment ago by mr levin about kosova and that somehow the republican opposition to military action in kosova was political it absolutely was not i remember because i was very involved in trying to mitigate the balkan troubles i visited there many times visited with milosevic the dictator in belgrade actually i was in vukovar right before it fell so frankly the statement that was made earlier i think did a disservice to those of us who were not supportive of the kosova operation there was no plan to war protect the kosovar albanians we used air power milosevic invaded with ground trops if members will remember that countrys population was literally literally pushed out into macedonia and elsewhereabout 1 6 million refugeesbecause there was no plan when milosevic sent in the ground troops and killed thousands of people because we had no plan to protect them an estimated 10 000 people were killed so the revisionism that somehow republican opposition to the war was a political calculation falls very very far from the truth and its a cheap shot i actually chaired hearings during the war and stated my oppositions based on principle as did other members so i expectand hopeunfounded revisionism would be avoided and that there would not be that lookback that does a disservice on the issue at hand to principled republican opposition so who exactly are we backing in

necessarily representative of the people of that country we dont know in addition a senior nato official told cnn on june 9 that qadhafi was a legitimate target of the bombing campaign even though

other small states i know youre a delegation of two were a delegation of one i represent the whole state of delaware i tell my constituents that we have two senators and one member of congress that means that i have to work twice as hard to serve the people in my state im pleased to join my freshman colleagues on the democratic side of the aisle this afternoon for our discussion about small business and job creation and id like to talk for a little bit about the situation in my state the state of delaware all of us are coming off a district work week where we spent our time im sure meeting with constituents talking to business owners small business owners large business owners and working our districts and i did the same thing in delaware not too far from the capitol here i would like to highlight two meetings that i had in particular one was a job fair that we held in georgetown delaware which is the county seat in the lower part of our state many people from the washington d c area know georgetown as they pass through it to go to our lovely beaches during the summer time to enjoy time with their family at the beach this particular day we sponsored a job fair in georgetown along with senator carper and senator coons this was a program that senator coons championed in wilmington initially and weve moved it now to the other two counties of our state and had a job fair in dover and a job fair in georgetown this past week really helping to connect those folks in our state who are unemployed or underemployed people looking to move up with employers who are looking to hire and even though we have over 9 percent unemployment nationally and a little bit over 8 percent unemployment in our state of delaware there are still a lot of jobs that go wanting mostly because the employers are not able to find people that have the required skills for that particular enterprise so the good news about this job fair is that we had 55 employers there many of whom were prepared to hire people and offer them jobs certainly take resumes and interview people or set up interviews but we had over 8 000 people who came seeking employment or seeking an upgrade in their current job situation and thats a lot of people in the small state of delaware in the least populous area of our state so it tells us the very serious problem that we have with the lack of jobs and the lack of skills that people might have to do the jobs that are out there later on in the week i met at pats aircraft which is an airplane manufacturing facility at georgetown airport theyve been hiring airplane mechanics over the last several years in fact when i was lieutenant governor one of the biggest problems that they had was finding workers that had the requisite skills to do the jobs that they had now they have since lost some of that work but they were looking ahead and anticipating with some assistance from the faa to extend the runway there at georgetown airportgoing back to your point about the need for infrastructure to stir business development business growth and job creation if we were able to extend the runway there at the airport pats would be able to hire more mechanics but there are a lot of people out there while they might want those jobs would not have the skills to do the work and so delaware technical and community college with the help of the state government has developed a training program specifically to prepare workers for that facility and other airplane manufacturing facilities in our region we have a dassault falcon plant which does airplane maintenance and mechanics at the new castle county airport as well as a large boeing facility over the line in southeastern pennsylvania so these are jobs they are highly skilled jobs they are jobs that require mechanical ability they are jobs that require training and there are certainly lots of folks out there that are looking for employment and these are the kinds of jobs that we need to prepare people for one of the press conferences we had this week was at delaware technical community college where we highlighted a federal grant that was going to delaware tech to create training programs for businesses basically to enable people to upgrade their skills to take the jobs that are available one of the problems obviously that we have in our countryand the presidents employment council has identified this problemis that we have jobs that are out there but we dont have people with the right kinds of skills for those jobs so we need to have programsand this is where the public sector comes into play particularly technical and community collegesto provide that training and those skills for those folks later on in the week i met and spoke with the georgetown chamber of commerce and the georgetown chamber of course is comprised mostly of very small businesses they had a really simple message for me as a member of congress and that is that they see their businesses struggling because of a lack of confidence among consumers and when you think about the unitedstates economy at large about 70 percent of economic activity is consumer driven so when consumers dont have confidence either in their employment situation in the presentthey may not be employedor their future employment situation theyre not willing to spend money on small business services or products in the community and therefore these small businesses suffer so their message to me was really a simple one twofold one is do no harm in washington dc do the work of the people solve the problems that we have and inspire confidence and i think one of the ways that we can do thattheres a lot of discussion most of the discussion that i hear from my constituents in the state of delawareand weve had town hall meetings were going to have a telephone town hall meeting tonight im sure i will hear the same thing enough with the partisan bickering back and forth across the aisle lets focus on the challenges that we facecreating jobs and strengthening businesses creating a business climate in the short term where businesses can thrive where consumers can have confidence so theyll be willing to spend on small businesses and other procurement and in the long term address our deficits our debt and our budget imbalances if were able to do that well at least provide some confidence to the people that we represent that those that they send from delaware the members of the house of representatives here and our senators across the capitol are doing their part are working together are focused on not the politics of where we all stand in relation to the next election but on solving the problems that face our country i think the vote that we have coming at the end of this year which will be the result of the work of the committee on the budget will be maybe one of the most important votes in a number of years i have heard our majority whip steny hoyer refer to it as the most important vote here in the last 30 years and i think thats right in many respects because people out there my constituents your constituents ms hanabusa in hawaiii see our colleague from rhode island has joined us as wellour constituents are asking us begging us to do our work to inspire confidence and to do the right thing for the country and that involves giving people the skills they need to be able to do the jobs that are available out there creating confidence so businesses can make investments so people will be willing to spend money and consume so our economy will get back on its feet again in the long term well set up a fiscal situation with our government so that the economy can be strong and create jobs for my children and their children so i want to thank my colleague from hawaii for leading our dialogue this afternoon on job creation on small business development across our country in our respective districts and i look forward to sitting here with you

amended the psob program many times since its inception some of the changes have resulted in inconsistencies within the law or have unintentionally resulted in a delay in the psob benefit process for example each psob claimant must be examined by an impartial medical examiner who then advises the justice department regarding their decision to award benefits but the psob statute and its regulations require that the medical examiner be hired from the city where the officer was killed or injured this causes significant delays and adds expense in processing psob claims and in administering the overall program the department spends significant time and resources to find a medical professional who is familiar with the psob program and its requirements that medical professional must also be available and agree to perform the necessary medical exam this process can take weeks if not months to complete this bill provides a solution to this inefficiency it allows the department to develop and draw from a pool of trusted qualified medical professionals to perform the necessary examinations across the country this is similar to how the psob program authorizes their hearing examiners this simple change saves valuable time and taxpayer dollars it also ensures that the public safety officers and their families receive these muchneeded benefits more quickly h r 4018 also clarifies who are eligible beneficiaries when an officer is killed in the line of duty currently the payment of benefits is often postponed sometimes for years while the issue of who is the proper beneficiary is litigated this bill creates a new category of beneficiaries adult children of deceased public safety officers to clarify eligible beneficiaries in certain cases where there are none these cases include when a public safety officers children are all adults there is no surviving spouse no applicable designation of beneficiary is on file with the public agency and the officers parents are

been doing those things the tough decisions the things that will create jobs if the senate and the white house would join with us on those things so that is simply not accurate to say that we havent been focusing on jobs because we have done that since we started this year and we will continue to do so and encourage and urge our colleagues over in the senate to bring these matters up they include

manufacturing vehicles in derby city since the model t in 1913 the louisville assembly plant opened in 1955 and since then has produced the ford ranger the bronco ii and the explorer to name just a few across town the kentucky truck plant has been operating since 1969 and employs nearly 5 000 workers for years both plants thrivedand with them families just recently a woman who now works at ford told me that her dad had worked there for 50 years stories of ford careers that span lifetimesand generationsarent rare in louisville there are fathers and daughters who have built careers sidebyside on the line but by 2008 the louisville assembly plant was outmoded and the unitedstates economy was in crisis the plants future was clouded with uncertainty workers came to work everyday not knowing whether their jobs would be there tomorrow ford needed to innovate it needed to produce vehicles that the american people could afford that were sleeker and more fuel efficient and that met a changing desire among car buyers who wanted more dynamic economical vehicles but the company needed a financial bridge to do it in congress i worked to include the advanced technology vehicles manufacturing loan program in the energy independence and security act of 2007 ford received a 5 9 billion loan through the program which allowed the company to invest 600 million in the louisville assembly plant and to remap their future in 3 years the louisville assembly plant has gone from uncertainty to a complete retooling last month i was proud to join ford officials and hundreds of workers to unveil what is now the biggest most flexible highvolume ford plant in north america the plant has added more than 3 000 jobs and the increases in production have led to thousands more suppliers of which there are 500 for the new escape model alone ford also worked with the uaw to renegotiate its contract and add a third shift at the plant by the end of this year the company will employ more than 8 000 people in louisville the positive relationships forged between organized labor and ford in louisville should serve as a model of compromise and cooperation for the rest of the nation the escape is a success story of american ingenuity and innovation for the private sector for organized labor and for the federal government and its a victory for kentucky fords new investments at the louisville assembly plant and the kentucky truck plant are expected to contribute more than 800 million to our commonwealths gdp lets be clear this happened because of the leadership of ford uaw and our unparalleled workforce but none of it would have been possible without key government investments to advance largescale innovation there were some who said we should let the auto industry fail in louisville that would have meant putting thousands of ford workers out on the street it would have meant that the thousands of workers at supply companies who provide parts for the new escape would have been updating their resumes instead of assembling fords newest and most advanced models and it would have been an admission that in america our best manufacturing days are behind us were proving that wrong every day in louisville and across the country over the past 28 months american manufacturers have created nearly 500 000 jobs thats the strongest period of growth in manufacturing employment since 1995 and its because we are using strategic federal investments to spur innovation and leverage private sector investment just this month the ap reported that ford motor company sales rose 7 percent in june the reason strong demand for the new escape which is selling at a higher rate than ever before there are still plenty who say government is part of the problem not part of the

debilitating our enormous debt would be and has become ive shortened the words a bit and provided them here as they express my heart more exquisitely than my own written words could when letters took a month by sea and the records of the united states government could be moved in a single wagon pulled by two horses we had great statesmanship we had men of integrity and genius washington hamilton franklin jefferson adams madison monroe these were men who were in love with principle as if it were an art which in their practice they made it they studied empires that had fallen for the sake of doing what was right in a small country that had barely risen and were able to see things so clearly that they surpassed in greatness each and every one of the classical models that they had approached in awe now lost in the sins and complexity of a xanadu when we desperately need their high qualities of thought their patience of deliberation and their unerring sense of balance we have only what we have which is a political class that in the main has abandoned the essential qualities of statesmanship with the excuse that these are inappropriate to our age they are wrong not only do they fail to honor the principles of statesmanship they fail to recognize them having failed to learn them having failed to want to learn them in the main they are in it for themselves were they not they would have a higher rate of attrition falling with the colors of what they believe rather than always landing on their feetadroitly but in dishonor in light of their vows and responsibilities

not from our resolution or lack of it but from elsewhere where in patient and infinite ranks they simply wait to be called they can be read in history they arise as if of their own accord when in the face of danger natural courage comes into play and honor and defiance are born things such as courage and honor are the mortal equivalent of certain laws written throughout the universe the rules of symmetry and proportion the laws of physics the perfection of mathematics human will that not only natural law but our own best aspirations have a life of their own they have lasted through far greater abuse than abuses them now they can be neglected but they cannot be lost they can be thrown down but they cannot be broken each of them is a different expression of a single quality from which each arises in its hour of need some come to the fore as others stay back and then with changing circumstance those that have gone unnoticed rise to the occasion rise to the occasion the principle suggests itself from a phrase and such principles suggest easily and flow generously you can grab them out of the air from phrases from memories from images a statesman must rise to the occasion democrats can do this harry truman had the discipline of plowing a straight row 10 12 and 14 hours a day of rising and retiring with the sun of struggling with temperamental machinery of suffering heat and cold and one injury after another after a short time on a farm presumptions about ruling others tend to vanish it is as if you are pulled to earth and held there the man who works the land is hard put to think that he would direct armies and nations truman understood the grave responsibility of being president of the united states and that it was a task too great for him or anyone else to accomplish without doing a great deal of injury if not to some then to others he understood that therefore he had to transcend himself there would be little enjoyment of the job because he had to be always aware of the enormous consequences of everything he did contrast this with the unspeakably vulgar pleasure in office of president clinton truman absolutely certain that the mantle he assumed was far greater than he could ever be was continually and deliberately aware of the weight of history the accomplishments of his predecessors and by hum ble and imaginative projection his own inadequacy the sobriety and care that derived from this allowed him a rare privilege for modern presidents to give to the presidency more than he took from it it is not possible to occupy the oval office without arrogantly looting its assets or nobly adding to them may god bless the president who adds to them and may god condemn the president who loots them america would not have come out of the civil war as it did had it not been led by lincoln and lee the battles raged for 5 years but for 100 years in the country both north and south modeled itself on their character they exemplified most perfectly churchills statement public men charged with the conduct of the war should live in a continual stress of soul the continual stress of soul is necessary as well in peacetime because for every good deed in public life there is a counterbalance benefits are given only after taxes are taken that is part of governance the statesman who represents the whole nation sees in the equilibrium for which he strives a continual tension between victory and defeat if he did not understand this he would have no stress of soul he would merely be happy about money showered upon the orphan taken from the widow about children sent to day care so that they may be long absent from their parents about merciful parole of criminals who kill again whereas a statesman knows continual stress of soul a politician is happy for he knows not what he does it is difficult for individuals or nations to recognize that war and peace alternate but they do no matter how long peace may last it will end in war though most people cannot believe at this moment that the united states of america will ever actually fight for its survival history guarantees that it will and when it does most people will not know what to do they will believe of war as they did of peace that it is everlasting the statesman who is different from everyone else will in the midst of common despair see the end of war just as during the peace he was alive to the inevitability of war and saw it coming in the far distance as if it were a gray wave moving quietly across a dark sea the politician will revel with his people and enjoy their enjoyments the statesman in continual stress of soul will think of destruction as others move in the light he will move in the darkness so that as others move in darkness he may move in the light this tenacity that is given to those of long and insistent vision is what saves nations a statesman must have a temperament that is suited for the medal of honor in a soul that is unafraid to die electorates rightly favor those who have endured combat not as a matter of reward for service as is commonly believed but because the willingness of the soldier to give his life is a strong sign of his correct priorities and that in the future he will truly understand that statesmen are not rulers but are servants it seems clear even in these years of squalid degradation that having risked death for the sake of honor is better than having risked dishonor for the sake of life no matter what youre told by the sophisticated classes that see virtue in every form of corruption and corruption in every form of virtue i think you know as i do that the american people hunger for acts of integrity and courage the american people hunger for a statesman magnetized by the truth unwilling to give up his good name uninterested in calculation only for the sake of victory unable to put his interests before those of the nation what this means in practical terms is no focus groups no polls no triangulation no evasion no broken promises and no lies these are the tools of the chameleon they are employed to cheat the american people of honest answers to direct questions if the average politician for fear that he may lose something is incapable of even a genuine yes or no how is he supposed to rise to the great occasions of state how is he supposed to face a destructive and implacable enemy how is he supposed to understand the rightful destiny of his country and lead it there at the coronation of an english monarch he is given a sword elizabeth ii took it last and as she held it before the altar she heard these words receive this kingly sword brought now from the altar of god and delivered to you by us the bishops and servants of god though unworthy with this sword do justice stop the growth of iniquity protect the holy church of god help and defend widows and orphans restore the things that are gone to decay maintain the things that are restored punish and reform what is amiss and confirm what is in good order that doing these things may be glorious in all virtue and so faithfully serve our lord would that we in america come once again to understand that statesmanship is not the appetite for power but because things mattera holy calling of selfabnegation and selfsacrifice we have made it something else nonetheless after and despite its betrayal statesmanship remains the manifestation in political terms of beauty and balance and truth it is the courage to tell the truth and thus discern what is ahead it is a mastery of symmetry of forces illuminated by the genius of speaking to the heart of things statesmanship is a quality that though it may be betrayed is always ready to be taken up again merely by honest subscription to its great

by february 17 i believe is the date thats been suggested we would like to act in fact we await an alternative from the senate the conference committee has met and led by our very capable chairman dave camp of michigan weve held i believe three or four open joint housesenate republicandemocrat conference discussions meetings which hadnt happened around here certainly in the last congress i dont think it ever happened and were doing it in the broad daylight and weve had four of those and our staffs are having some discussions but youve got to go back and understand that the house under republican leadership actually passed a 1year extension of the unemployment benefits the house republican led passed a 2year doc fix which meant for seniors who are on medicare that the physicians they rely so much on for their health care those physicians would continue to be able to afford to see them and not face a 27 4 percent cut in the reimbursement rates now heres the deal we passed that and we funded it and we did it for 2 years not 2 months2 years we did the payroll tax as its called by my friends on the other side of the aisle payroll tax middle class tax workingamerican tax cut for a full year now theres a debate about whether that should be offset or not because our party has said you know when we reduce the tax burden on hardworking middle class americans families and job creators we shouldnt have to go raise somebody elses taxes to do that now the difference on this if were talking about social security taxes this is about reducing the amount of money that you and i you and i pay into social security and every working american that pays into social security were saying you get to reduce how much you pay into social security by this 2 percent now those of us on this side of the aisle believe that the social security trust fund has been raided once too many times by both parties over time but that should stop and so if were going to reduce how much goes into social security we should offset that somehow so that the fund is not drained and that can be done in a multitude of ways but it should be done because otherwise its less money going into the social security trust fund and i think wed all have to admit as the actuaries do that at the end of the day the social security trust fund is not the best funded trust fund on the planet and we are going to need to do some work to secure the retirement of future generations in social security so back to the point here the house passed all of that we did a 1year payroll tax reduction so that hardworking middle class americans would have tax relief theyd have that extra money in the pocket and lord knows they need it especially when you see whats happened under this president with energy costs i think gasoline was 1 86 a gallon when president obama took office and we now go to the pump and its somewhere between 3something or 4 and pushing over 4 depending on where you are in america youve got to have a little extra money just to try and keep up and take your kids to soccer and go to school and go to work its hard out there so we passed that a year extension of that and a full year extension of unemployment for those who have struggled in this horrible economy there have been 11 recessions since world war ii this is the worst in terms of a recovery from a recession when ronald reagan was president we had a horrible recession in the early eighties we came out of that recession and if it were at the same pace now as then youd create something like 15 million 16 million new jobs which means virtually everybody whos unemployed and still uncounted because a lot of people who have fallen off the unemployment rolls arent counted all of them would have jobs if we were growing at the same pace we did when president reagan was in office and we came out of that recession but were not the policies really havent worked the socalled stimulus that the american taxpayers were told if it would just pass somehow unemployment would never get above 8 percent now a trillionplus dollars later with interest payments that the next generation will get to pay back were somehow supposed to celebrate unemployment thats dropped to 8 3 im glad to see the improvement im glad to see the job gains in the private sector for goodness sakes my wife and i have been small business owners since 1986 in oregon i understand what its like to sign the front of a payroll check and the back and to grow a business and to deal in good times and in bad but the long and short of this is this is a horrible recession so coming out of this we need that bridge we put some reforms in unemployment to help people to lift them up to give them incentive when theyre out there for a year year and a half 2 years that maybe we could help them get a better education encourage that allow states to encourage that to help them get a ged because all of the data shows that if you have a high school diploma if you have a ged the odds of you getting hired are much higher then we gave the states the opportunity to do drug screening ive heard from a lot of employers in my district out in rural oregon that say we do drug tests and congressman youd be shocked at how many people apply for the job and cant pass the drug test well if you cant pass the drug test then maybe you really arent actively seeking work in a way thats legitimate because you cant get hired and yet youre on unemployment so why dont we do some sort of screen figure out that problem that you have and help you then get treatment so we said to states were going to do away with a federal decision thats i dont know 20 30 40 years old that said states dont have this authority i think states could actually manage this pretty well that was in the bill the house passed so we did all of these things a 1year reduction in the taxes people pay into social security the payroll tax deduction a 2year fix for your physicians who treat our families on medicare both of my parents theyre gone now they were on medicare my wifes parents whove also passed away they were on medicare this is an incredibly valuable program but we passed a 2year fix for them the 1year for unemployment and the 1year for the middle class tax cut all of that went over to the senate and this is probably something maybe we can agree on here what we got back from the other chamber was a 2month extension of those things now some of us stayed around here when the house said really a 2month when this is a 1year and 2year problem why dont you appoint some negotiators so the speaker of the house mr boehner appointed the negotiators through the house side we hoped that the senate would appoint negotiators they didnt they didnt appoint anybody in fact they left town eventually when nobody showed up after wed been here for a week trying to see if we couldnt bring both sides the house and the senate together republicans and democrats work out something more than a 2month deal they wouldnt show and we ended up passing a 2month extension which by the way puts us right back where we are right now which is why we have this motion to instruct from my friends on the other side of the aisle calling on the conference committee to get its work done by the 17th so we have worked for that in fact the last time this was voted on here it was overwhelming i think there were only 16 no votes in the house so we want to get this done too now the republican conferees have met today as weve done over the last week or two the democrat senate conferees by the way they had a retreat today down at the nationals ballpark in some meeting room there was a planning retreat both parties have had these in the house but it just sort of caused a pause in the effort because the democrats were all off at a policy retreat today from the senate so we werent able to accomplish much today but we hope to get something from the senate because you see they go into the conference and they had this 2month effort against our 1year so we cant negotiate against ourselves so were waiting for a proposal back from the senate which we hope to get soon if we do tomorrow well meet at 10 oclock republicans democrats house and senate to try and work this through we want to get this done the american people deserve to have us get this done were working on a way to do that i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.010927557945251465, 0.5109275579452515, 1, "i thank the gentlelady from new york for her kindness in yielding i thank the hard work of the appropriations committee i thank the gentlelady from virginia for managing and i thank mr dicks as well for accepting the challenge in these very difficult times its not a happy time to come to the floor and indicate that this is what we have to do but its important to acknowledge some challenges that we still have and those challenges are the many food programs that have to be capped in spite of the numbers of people who are hungry in this country the dumbing down of food resources in particular as my colleague from colorado mentioned listing tomato paste and french fries as vegetables and then an issue that i hope that i will be able to continue to work on with the unitedstates department of agriculture and that is food deserts where there are pockets in rural and urban centers where we have no food access good healthy food vegetables but i am glad that the new starts under the transportation bill includes the north and southeast lines for the city of houston creating jobs putting people to work and improving mobility some 94 616 000 i am also delighted that tiger grants are in at 500 million but disappointed in the community planning that we have lost some 830 million for community block grants 1 6 billion below the president thats where we help rebuild communities and jobs the legal services corporation that ive been a supporter of and actively was on our local board board of directors now has been reduced by 348 million but it has been reduced which creates what we call the justice gap i also am concerned about providing more developmental training for our law enforcement that covers our federal sectors in particular i am concerned about the police in the supreme court and the chief of police there and the concern for the lack of professionalism and the need for training i believe that in the capitol police scenario there is an orderly process of the chief the sergeantatarms and we work wonderfully together with these outstanding men and women its a shame for those who have to protect the other body of government the supreme court to have individuals who do not recognize ids are not professional in their handling of their business and i will be raising this issue with the department of justice and relating it to the funding which i think is necessary to either provide them with more funding or to put more stringent guidelines in their hiring policies and the way they train people so i rise today to say that i am glad that we will have the government open and that we have funded agriculture programs not at the best weve funded infrastructure but we can do more and i believe we should not adhere to any cuts going forward and i hope the supercommittee will not do that i ask for support of the underlying bill"],

budgetary fiscal activities of this last year it was after all a republican choice to halt the operation of the other body essentially shutting down the senate by requiring supermajorities on everything we started the year with the threat of government shutdown you recall we went to just minutes away from having to shut down the federal government over a basically theological argument on the part of my friends on the other side of the aisle over things like planned parenthood and big bird then this summer we had cast doubt for the first time in history about whether we were actually going to honor the requirement to pay the debt for obligations wed already incurred this summer the republicans were willing to leave town and we actually shot the hostage when it came to the faa 70 000 people were idled on construction projects for aviation 4 000 employees laid off then this fall and into the winter we had the spectacle of what should be a relatively routine effort and has been a routine effort for republicans and democrats alike dealing with things like the extension of unemployment insurance and avoiding a draconian impact with the sustainable growth rate the sgr the doc

cooperative federalism act of 2011 almost four decades ago when it enacted the clean water act congress established a system of cooperative federalism by making the federal environmental protection agency the epa and the states partners in regulating the nations water quality and allocated the primary responsibilities for dealing with daytoday water pollution control matters to the states for most of these almost four decades this system of cooperative federalism between the epa and the states has worked quite well however in recent years the epa has begun to use questionable tactics to usurp the states role under the clean water act in setting water quality standards and to invalidate legally issued permits by the states epa has decided to get involved in the implementation of state standards secondguessing states with respect to how standards are to be implemented and even secondguessing epas own prior determinations that the state standards meet the minimum requirements for the clean water act epa has also inserted itself into the states and the army corps of engineers permit issuance decisions and the secondguessing state and other agencies permitting decisions the epas recent actions increasingly are amounting to bullying the states and are unprecedented h r 2018 was introduced to clarify and restore the longstanding balance that had existed between the states and the epa as coregulators under the clean water act and to preserve the authority of states to make determinations relating to their water quality standards and permitting the bill was carefully and narrowly crafted to preserve the authority of states to make decisions about their own water quality standards and permits without undue interference on secondguessing from epa bureaucrats in washington with little or no knowledge of local water quality conditions the legislation reins in epa from unilaterally issuing a revised or new water quality standard for a pollutant adopted by a state and epa already has approved a water quality standard for that pollutant h r 2018 restricts epa from withdrawing its previous approval of a state npdes water quality permitting program or from limiting federal financial assistance for a state water quality permitting program on the basis that epa disagrees with the state further the bill restricts epa from objecting to npdes permits issued by a state moreover the bill clarifies that epa can veto an army corps of engineers clean water act section 404 permitting decision when the state concurs with the veto these limitations apply only in situations where epa is attempting to contradict and unilaterally force its own one size fitsall federal policies on a states water quality program by limiting such overreaching by the epa h r 2018 in no way affects epas proper role in reviewing state permits and standards and coordination pollution control efforts between the states epa just has to get back to the more collaborative role it has long played as the overseer of the states implementation of the clean water act detractors of this legislation claim that the bill only intends to disrupt the complementary roles of epa and the states under the clean water act and eliminate epas ability to protect water quality and public health in downstream states from actions in upstream states in reality these detractors want to centralize power in the federal government so it can dominate water quality regulation in the states implicit in their message is that they do not trust the states in protecting the quality of their waters and the health of their citizens this bill returns the balance certainty and cooperation between the states and the federal government in regards to the environment that our economy job creators and permit holders have been begging for well over 100 organizations representing a wide variety of public and private entities support this legislation just to name a few these organizations include the
