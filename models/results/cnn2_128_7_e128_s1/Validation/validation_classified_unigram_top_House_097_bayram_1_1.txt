only in chinese and antiques and gold coins those features of the fauntroy substitute measured alone save us 10 billion in deficit spending a vote for the congressional black caucus is a vote to reduce taxes for 96 percent of the people of this country this is the peoples house and we ask you to give them a chance to receive what they want and what they need meaningful real tax relief the people of this country want relief from the enormous budget deficit that has resulted from last years tax giveaway to the rich and the gigantic increase in military spending of last year the people o this country now know that those large deficits mean continued high interest rates and thus continued small business and small farmer failures and continued high unemployment at record levels such as we have achieved in this past year the people of this countryand remember this is the peoples housewant a strong national defense but they do not want domination of the world they want an end to nuclear proliferation and your vote for the fauntroy substitute will give them that they know with former secretary of the defense ielvin laird thatand i quote him our true strategic military needs have little to do with military weapons except to deter their use against us he points out that we must be able to keep open the sea and air links that bind us to our allies and that we need to be able to hold ground on the borders of europe and elsewhere and to protect and sustain power at great distance none of these objectives as i continue to quote former secretary of defense melvin laird none of these objectives requires nuclear weapons your vote for the fauntroy substitute will acknowledge that fact ii12689 the caucus budget also anwers a number of concerns raised by amendments offered for consideration under the rule today for those of you who have offered amendments to raise the cola caps in the jones budget for federal employees and retirees and to all of my colleagues who intend to support those amendments i say that a vote for the caucus amendment does just what you want the fauntroy substitute does not require such amendments since it incorporates the cbo baseline levels which preserve current service costofliving adjustments for federal pay and pensions a number of members have offered amendments to increase funding for function 500 education above the level recommended by the house budget committee the fauntroy substitute also as proposed raises funding for education above the house budget committee level and indeed it includes funding to restore programs to the present fiscal year 1982 reductions as passed in grammlatta let me now briefly outline the details of the congressional black caucus substitute before concluding my remarks you first ought to understand that the cbc budget reduces the deficit substantially in fact the congressional budget office has estimated that our budget will produce a 92 8 billion deficit in fiscal year 1983 which is lower by at least 10 billion than the deficit estimated by cbo for any other substitute and half the 183 billion deficit that will exist if nothing is done to rectify the errors of last years budget moreover our budget will lead to steadily shrinking deficits of 60 billion in fiscal year 1984 and a 18 billion surplus in fiscal year 1985 bringing interest rates down and providing the basis for genuine economic recovery in our country second you ought to know that the fauntroy substitute is fair and humane we not only prevent that many additional cuts in human needs programs as proposed by the president we return funds to social programs that were lost by the enactment of the reagan fiscal year 1982 budget reductions these programs must remain federal priorities if we value human potential and care to meet human needs because of savings generated by our alternative tax and defense policies several education health housing and urban programs can be restored to fiscal year 1981 funding levels adjusted for inflation for example the fauntroy substitute adds 3 3 billion to title i 600 million to pell grants for disadvantaged college students increasing funding for health care programs it adds 600 million in social services funding including child welfare programs and 1 billion more tlan reagan for pollution control it retains eda and the legal services corporation and lowincome energy and other conservation programs the third thing that this budget does is that it stimulates and creates jobs a centerpiece of our budget proposal is the creation of a major 6 billion to 8 billion federal jobs vocational education and training package this is a response to both the nations unemployment rate generally and to the catastrophic unempioyment in the black community specifically the fauntroy substitute also includes a 4 billion urban infrastructure proposal which will create 50 000 to 80 000 jobs directly and more indirectly a 4 billion expansion in mass transit and highway construction programs which will create an equal number of jobs in this country it also includes home ownership assistance and rental housing construction programs that will stimulate employment in residential construction finally the budget insures adequate social security and other support for the nations poor both the elderly and the nonelderly this budget maintains the costofliving adjustment for elderly on fixed incomes and expands unemployment compensation benefits at a time when we have 10 3 million people out of work the program triggers in the caucus budget increase eligibility for the unemployed to 52 weeks in our view this restoration of benefits is necessary at a time when we are experiencing the levels of unemployment which have not been endured since the depression our budget also provides increased funding for other programs to assist the poor including 3 2 billion more than reagan for aid to families with dependent children 5 billion more for food stamps 3 billion more for medicaid and medicare 1 2 billion more for six health programs and 400 million more for supplemental social insurance as my colleagues in the congressional black caucus follow me they will give you more details about the caucus budget resolution i simply want to remind you again that this is the peoples house and we ought to give the people the life support programs that will cushion them through these difficult times we need to give 96 percent of the people of this country the kird of tax relief that we have pr45mised in the generalized language about tax relief for all of the people we need to give the people relief from the enormous deficits and the high interest rates that have robbed the people of this country of homes and farms small businesses and 2 5 million jobs just since july of last year a vote for the fauntroy substitute the economic recovery program of the congressional black caucus will do just that at this time i would like to add the congressional budget offices reestimate of our budget proposal and yield time to my distinguished colleague from new york the third ranking member of the ways and means committee to

act the main purpose of this bill is to authorize federal agencies to contract with private debt collection agencies in order to collect delinquent federal debts my colleagues are already aware of the massive debts owed to the federal government and of the enormous amount of this debt that is delinquent mismanagement on the part of bureacrats has permitted these delinquent debts to accumulate the details of the problem are described in the recently issued report of the office of management and budget debt collection project on may 18 1981 the house passed h r 2811 a bill designed to help agencies manage their debts in a more businesslike fashion and to make agency debt collection activities more effective that bill was only one step in the effort to improve debt collection practices and to increase the revenue from delinquent debts because agencies have such a poor track record in managing their debts we must recognize that there may be times when agencies need assistance that is what the bill i have introduced today will do it will authorize and regulate the use of private debt collection agencies by the federal government i hope that use of private debt collectors in appropriate circumstances will increase the repayment of debts owed to the federal government i am convinced that use of these private collectors can be done in a way that is consistent with the right to privacy the rules that govern the contracting out of government functions and the laws that regulate debt collection practices this bill is necessary because it is not clear under present law that agencies have the authority to enter into contracts for debt collection services for many years the general accounting office took the position that federal agencies could not legally delegate the debt collection function to private contractors in order to overcome this restriction congress found it necessary to expressly authorize the use of private debt collectors for a specific category of debts in the education amendments of 1976 public law 94482 i was surprised when the general accounting office and the department of justice reversed this interpretation and amended the regulations for the federal claims collection act the amended regulations require agencies to consider contracting for debt collection services this rule change appeared in the federal register for april 17 1981 no adequate reason for the shift in legal position was cited by the general accounting office and the justice department in the explanation that accompanied the rule change i asked the congressional research service to take a look at the issue of the legality of contracting our for debt collection services crs found no clear legal explanation for the change in the opinion of the general accounting office and the justice department it seems to me that if an activity was once considered to violate federal law then it takes a legislative change in order to make that activity legal neither the comptroller general nor the attorney general has the authority to amend federal statutes because of the tremendous uncertainty engendered by the change to the federal claims collection act regulations we need to clarify the law no agency can responsibly rely on the newly revised rule i am concern ed that any action based on this questionable interpretation will lead to significant

weaken the bills provisions i am one who firmly believes that the federal government should zealously guard this right of american citizenship in this connection i believe that extension of the protection that this landmark legislation affords is absolutely essential to preserving the voting franchise for those who may otherwise be deprived of the rights guaranteed to them under our constitution morelver extension of this act is critical at this particular moment in our history the federal government through changes in philosophy and budgetary priorities has found it increasingly easy to turn its back on safeguarding the civil and human rights of its citizens we must not let this trend sway us on this issue protection of the voting franchise a constitutional right is the

a sound piece of legislation which would eliminate voter discrimination when congress passed this bill many of our citizens praised it as one of the most significant pieces of clvil rights legislation in the history of our country now the act is again before congress for reauthorization although we in this country have made great strides in ridding our land of this form of discrimination it is clear that this statute has not outlived its usefulness there is still racial and language discrimination in this country there is still dissatisfaction and unrest and according to a study made by the unitedstates commission on civil rights we still need the voting rights act although this legislation has been effective its accomplishments are fragile we must continue to protect the rights of our minorities in 1965 minorities simply did not enter our political system in 1965 our minorities were virtually disenfranchised from free participation in our political system although the conmmission on civil rights found that substantial progress had been made as a result of this act the commission also found that persistent and serious obstacles to complete participation in our political processes still remain the fact is that minorities continue to constitute a small percentage of elected officials despite increased political participation by minorities in many areas of the country the fact is that minorities continue to face a variety of problems that this act was designed to overcome the commissions report has documented white resistance and hostility by some state and local officials officials who are hostile to increased minority participation in almost every aspect of the voting process the fact is that there are still some areas where locai jurisdictions do not believe in equality before the law there are still some areas of this country where local jurisdictions violate either the letter or the spirit of the lawor both in many ways we in this country are lucky poll taxes and literacyr tests are no longer a requirement of participation in the voting process but the facts are very clear if we do not extend this act we willgive reluctant localities avenues of opportunity to use very sophisticated ways of disenfranchising the minority voter if we do not extend this act a municipality could certainly redistrict or annex a surrounding suburban area to dlute minority voting power or a municipality could very easily change public offices from elected to appointed seats indeed the opportunities for violating both the spirit and letter of the law are virtually limitless we need to extend the voting rights act for the sake of what has happened to the minorities in this country in the post and to protect them from what may happen in the future it is not enough to say that we have made great strides in the area of minority discrimination and simply leave it at that we are not a stagnant nation our demography is constantly changing in fact the demlography of this nation has changed more since 1965 than it has in 50 years for the last two decades we have opened our arms to the worlds homeless we have given shelter to men and women fleeing economic oppression and political persecution more often than not these immigrants and refugees run the risk of being politically disenfranchised the rights of all citizens regardless of where they live or their nation of origin must be protected for that is precisely what a democracy is all about the voting rights act of 1965 has been hailed as the most important civil rights bill enacted by congress without doubt it has been the most effective tool for protecting the right to vote in this country and as such we owe it to ourselves to grant this tool another 2 years of life because this act provides evidence of this nations commitment to assure that none of its citizens are deprived of the basic right guaranteed by thle 14th and 15th amendments i urge my colleagues to support

years ago literacy tests and poll taxes were common to many parts or our nation they were the crude discriminatory practices which kept blacks and hispanics from votinguntil the advent of the voting rights act the impact of the act was immediate and farreaching in just one decade black registration in the south nearly doubled and since 1965 the number of black elected officials across the united states has more than tripled it is true the minority community no longer faces blatant practices such as literacy tests and poll taxes but we face just as serious a threat to our ability to elect representative public officials this threat comes in the form of gerrymandering and annexation schemes aimed at limiting the voting power of minorities this threat is in fact a reality for example within the past 2 months the justice department struck down a reapportionment plan in virginia because it would have crippled the voting power of blacks more than 500 such justice department objections have been made in the past 6 years they demonstrate the need to extend the voting rights act and to extend it intact there is yet another compelling reason for us to renew the voting rights act it goes beyond the fact that the act is a protection and an incentive for blacks and hispanics to vote and play an active role in the political arena i refer to the new politics of the 1980s with its blatant disregard for the disadvantaged and economic disaster for poor and minority families we already know that the administrations safety net has many large gaping holes in it and isin the words of david stockman termof art given this reality the only real safety net which minorities can count on is our own capacity to participate in the political system the voting rights act to a major degree has made this participation possible and meaningful if you remove or water down the voting rights act then you remove the most basic safety net in a democracy i urge my colleagues to consider

on the gentlemans remarks on the aviation title of h r 4961 it is a comprehensive measure and one which if it were not included in this particular bill would be most worthy of my colleagues support if the conference report on h r 4961 is adopted it would mark the third time that the basic airport and airway development programs have been extended by the congress since their adoption back in 1970 the original statute was enacted because the congress realized the critical importance of developing and improving our nations airports and airways so they could safely accommodate increased levels of air traffic since that time much has been done to help this country retain its position as the world leader in aviation more airports are equipped with more sophisticated navigation aids than ever before and countless projects have been completed which enhance safety and increase the capacity of the system to handle future growth notwithstanding these positive developments the national air transportation system can and must be improved we have all heard about near midair collisions occuring in the crowded airspace the all too frequent computer and radar outages at our air route traffic control centers and the need to restrict operations at some of the busier terminals in the country sometimes these problems result from limited airport capacity while at other times the culprit is an air traffic system which is in serious need of a major overhaul granted the patco strike has exacerbated the situation and has required faa to limit operations to the extent the system can safely accommodate them recently released forecasts prepared by the faa demonstrate that notwithstanding the current shortage of air traffic controllers the recession and high fuel prices aviation activity will increase substantially over the coming years therefore if we do not address the chronic longterm problems of congestion and delay at many of our airportswhether in this bill or in subsequent legislationrestrictions such as those being imposed today will continue to be required and will become even more widespread in the future it is these serious problems which title v of h r 4961 is designed to address as the chaftrman of the aviation subcommittee has indicated title v of the conference report would authorize funds through fiscal year 1987 for the four programs financed out of the airport and airway trust fund total authorizations for these programs are 4 8 billion for airport development adap just over 6 billion for facilities and equipment p e 1 1 bil lion for research and development r d and a maximum of 6 6 billion for operations and maintenance 0 m this latter amount which represents the user contributions to the operations and maintenance of the airway system will be substantially reduced if the adap and p e authorizations are not spent for their intended purpose many of my colleagues are aware that although f e r d and 0 m are currently being funded out of the trust fund for fiscal year 1982 pursuant to the dot appropriations statute public law 97102 the adap program has been dormant since october 1 1981 therefore if the conference report is adopted adequate funds would once again be made available for critical projects to increase the safety and capacity of our national airport system another major part of title v would authorize funding for the facilities and equipment program through fiscal year 1987 these authorizations were requested by the administration to begin implementation of its national airspace system plan which would modernize our air traffic and airway systems during the coming decade and beyond like the adap program it will be financed entirely by taxes imposed on aviation users the main objective of this modernization effort will be to enhance safety through increased equipment reliability while increasing system capacity according to the administration lower labor costs should eventually result due to reduced personnel requirements for air traffic controllers and maintenance technicians in addition substantial fuel savings are expected as increased levels of automation are introduced into the atc system although the faa plan is not perfect it still represents the most comprehensive statement we have seen to date on how to deal with the problems associated with the current system moreover the public works committee as well as other committees of the house and senate will carefully monitor the faas progress as it undertakes these important programs consistent with this obligation section 504 b of h r 4961 requires the administration to update its plan as necessary every year so that it can be adjusted to meet new problems which may arise in the future finally i am pleased that the tax conferees decided to terminate all trust fund taxes on december 31 1987 this will assure that aviation users will not be taxed as they have been since october 1 1980 unlessthe authorizations for these important programs are renewed it will also permit the congress to renew both the tax levels and the authorizations in light of the capital and revenue needs prevailing at that time in closing i want to emphasize to my colleagues that if the conference report on h r 4961 is adopted needed airport and airway improvements will be permitted to go forwardimprovements which will unquestionably benefit the traveling public while being funded entirely by taxes imposed on aviation users if this conference report is defeated the public works and transportation committee is prepared to accomplish the

administrations proposal to sell highly sophisticated offensive weaponry to saudi arabia i am concerned on more than one level first i am concerned because the administrations action is a reversal of unitedstates policy as stated when we first sold the f15 fighter bomber to saudi arabia at that time the carter administration in consultation with the congress determined that the f15s would not be outfitted then or in the future with the sophisticated offensive tools which the reagan administration now seeks to provide it would appear to me that the proposal to sell advanced missiles bomb racks an aerial refueling capacity and the airborne warning and control systems awacs completely reverses the established policies reached 3 years ago such a reversal might very well prove detrimental to the security of the state of israel but to the general stability of the entire middle east second i am concerned because i fear that this proposal is born from the regrettable tendency on the part of the new administration to view foreign policy issues within the context of the eastwest conflict the end result is that we are pouring more and more cargoes of sophisticated weapons into this and other regions of the world at a time when international rhetoric is becoming increasingly strident and when such arms can be seen as only a challenge to peace third i am concerned because although i recognize the administrations claim that this upgrading of the f15s is necessary to maintain the friendship of saudi arabia we have yet to secure an adequate answer from the administration as to what we are getting in returi 1ir this sale are we getting a huge reduction in the price we pay for foreign oil are we getting assistance for unitedstates peace efforts in the middle east are we getting assistance in combatting international terrorism are we getting an end to the call for a royal war or jihad against the nation of israel no i fear that at this time we are getting none of these and i would suggest to the administration that friendship is a twoway street it is based on some sort of mutuality which we must continue to build between our two governments and people whatever the immediate benefits might be in terms of improved relations with saudi arabia they will be no bargain for the united states unless we get some positive answers to these questions and certainly they will be no bargain if such alleged benefits come at the expense of israels military or economic security e"], [0.0013355612754821777, 0.4986644387245178, 0, "mr chairmnan parenthetically in response

makes us coequal with the president all 435 of us as secretaries of state and presidential envoys in discussing the very important nuances of aid whether military or economnic to a country that is developing a nuclear capability i think this injects a note of great uncertainty it is erosion of the authority of the president to do what presidents have historically and constitutionally done it is an aggrandizement of power by this house that i do not think is constitutional i think it does invert the roles between the executive which has the power to veto what congress does and we have now

with good intentions and i think it is appropriate here i am sure that the committee on appropriations worked very hard to help the armed services personnel secure the pay raise they so justly deserve i think the committee should be given an e for effort i think they really are concerned with the problem of retention of senior enlisted personnel but i feel they went overboard in trying to resolve a problem that does not really need the attention they gave it the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee my good friend the gentleman from new york made the quote just a couple of minutes ago that new recruits are earning almost as much as oldtimers that statement is true compared to what the situation was before the allvolunteer force but it is not really true when we compare it with the civilian sector before the allvolunteer force there used to be a huge disparity in pay between the e9 and e1 perhaps as much as 9 to 1 there was a very steep pay grade differential but since the allvolunteer force we have had to offer the e1s more money to come into the service we have had to give them more pay so that we could attract them now the ratio is back to 3 to 1 which is about the way it is in the civilian sector for similar levels of responsibility after 2 years of service then the ratio resumes its rather sharp curve to what it used to be which is what the gentleman was

concerned let me read a list of those wvho support the house version the 14 3 percent acrosstheboard increase we have the secretary of defense mr weinberger and i assume the whole administration wve have the secretaries of each of the military services the chief of naval operations admiral hayward the personnel chief of the air force general osway and we have most of the military associations the fleet reserve the national association of uniformed services the air force sergeants the veterans of foreign wars the united states army warrant officers association all of them like the 14 3percent accesstheboard increase even though general meyer likes the senate version the trouble with the appropriations committee bill or the senate version is that there is a targeting provision and this is the keystone of their program this is the thrust of their bill but it tends to create chaos and confusion and inequities the sad part of it is that it is not even needed to address the problem of retention they are solving a problem thiat does not exist because our bill solves this problem but in spending so much money and targeting so much to solve the retention problem they create a very serious problem with recruitment that is the other side of the scales retention is on one side recruitment is on the other we do not need any additional targeting under the house bill we permit up to 25 percent of the 14 3percent acrosstheboard pay raise to be targeted if it is needed i seriously hope that the administration does not target 1 of it because it is not necessary but the flexibility is there in the event we do wani to do that then too we already target about 2 billion almost as much as this whole bill represents for many different areas of shortages we target for sub pay we target for sea pay and we target for flight pay hazardous duty pay and proficiency pay we pay extra money for health professionals nuclear qualified officers and enlisted men and we also pay enlistment and reenlistment bonuses we can expand this procedure if necessary if we have shortages in certain areas we can target further this is the preferred method to target to skills not target to grades as the senate version does let us take a look at retention both bills solve the retention easily with 50 000 or 80 000 people left over in a very short period of time it is true that the senate version does it a little faster maybe by 3 months 4 months or 5 months as one speaker suggested he was going to support the senate bill because it would provide us with 4 000 more senior enlisteds the first year that is true it does provide 4 000 more but it is 4 000 out of 790 000 it is less than 1 percent it is sixtenths of 1 percent to get a mere 4 000 additional out of almost 800 000 they would seriously hurt the recruitment effort when they allocate huge sums to the senior enlisted portion of the bill they have to take it from some place they have to rob peter to pay paul and who do they take it from they~ take it from the little guy the new guy the junior enlisted man in fact they are going to take 50 percent of what they would get under the 14 3percentpay increase that is 50

actual deflation the primary cause of the deflation will be the result of the largest money transfer in history the greatest redistribution of wealth ever seen this money transfer will occur for three reasons first high extremely high interest rates transfer money from the mass of consumers and taxpayers who pay the high interest rates on the cost of the products they buy and on the interest on the

more per capita dollars to those same affluent few meaning a net taking away of money from the rest third federal state and local government spending cuts reduce money going to lower economic groups

from the pockets of the middle and lower income groups to the more affluent whether the more affluent wvill invest this added wealth or how they will invest it i do not know but those who make up the mass of consumers and who do spend almost all the money they receive will have hundreds of billions less to spend pressure will be taken off our economy less goods will be made and sold businesses will be cut back many will fail unemployment will increase eventually causing lowver wages and inflation will be stopped deflationlower priceswill occur"]]}
