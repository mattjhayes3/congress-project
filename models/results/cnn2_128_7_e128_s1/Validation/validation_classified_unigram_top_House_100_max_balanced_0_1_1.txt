the chairman of the committee mr de la garza and the subcommittee chairman mr paneita for supporting this important amendment i also want to note that this amendment is supported a wide range of

unitedstates catholic conference the united farmworkers of california and texas the farm labor organizing committee of ohio and michigan the east coast farmworkers support network the american friends service committee and cata which represents puerto rican farmworkers in the united states the legislation before us today is intended to assist the victims of drought who are suffering economically as a result of agricultural losses this is a national calamity and it deserves a national response from the congress we need to respond to the economic needs of farmers and those in farmrelated businesses but let us not in our haste ignore the urgent needs of the most vulnerable drought victims americas farmworkers across this nation in ohio in michigan in the farm belt in the southwest there are thousands of homeless jobless and stranded farmworkersmany of them childrenwho are special drought victims they cant lose their farms they own no farms they cant lose their housing they have no housing they cant lose their unemployment benefits and their health care coverage they have none and in addition to homelessness and destitution they face another urgent crisis malnutrition that is something we can do something about today in this legislation that is what this amendment is about this special plight of farmworkers may sound familiar because the congress in 1982 enacted special rules to expedite the processing of food stamp benefits to migrant farmworkers but the reagan administration issued regulations last fall which severely underminded that law leaving thousands of farmworkers stranded without the ability to secure the food stamps they and their children desperately require and for which they are eligible those regulations say that vendor paymentslike emergency housing for destitute farmworkerscount as income and can deprive them of eligibility for food stamps as a result thousands of farmworkers must choose shall they endure homelessness to qualify for food stamps or nutritional deprivation in return for temporary shelter is that what this congress intended is that justice for farmworkers i am reminded of the proposed regulations by the reagan administration to deny supplemental security income benefits to the elderly who own a car or their home those regulations were withdrawn because of protests from elderly groups and their supporters in the congress i remember the refusal of the reagan administration year after year to require sanitation facilities and clean drinking water for farmworkers finally the courts and congress rose up to demand that the rules finally be issued i recall the proposal of governor reagan to reduce food stamp allocations to a pregnant woman because she was providing housing for her baby the courts threw out that twisted logic now in 1988 the reagan administration tells us that the poor family of a migrant worker must choose beween rudimentary housing and food between homelessness and starvation is it possible that we are describing america in 1988 sadly it is all time this amendment will restore the original intent of the congress action in 1982 by excluding emergency housing assistance to destitute migrant and seasonal farmworkers such as housing from designation as food stamp income and it should also be noted that under the law such emergency allocations as fuel car repairs and transportation home must be excluded as well this amendment deserves the support of every member in this chamber this amendment will also assure that migrant farmworkers will receive food stamps for their entire month in which they apply with any overpayments being subsequently deducted this will assure that a destitute farmworker family is able to buy necessary food immediately rather than await the start of a new month throughout this country there may be 50 000 farmworkers or more who are stranded by drought without crops to pick and therefore without an ability to support themselves or to return to their homes i want to commend chairman de la garza for taking the initiative of writing to secretary of labor mclaughlin requesting that she utilize the national activities account to direct emergency transportation and financial support to farmworkers and i call on secretary mclaughlin to act immediately if anyone doubts the emergency nature of this amendment or its appropriateness to the drought relief bill let us recall this fact a field which is not harvested this year will spring back again with next years rain a farmworker family decimated by impoverishment a child deprived of adequate nutrition a pregnant mother denied basic foodsthese drought victims cannot recover with a rainfall they will bear the scars of the drought of 1988 for a lifetime for amelia chavez a single mother of two stranded in liberty center oh for the six members of aurora ruiz family in texas rio grande valley for frank mcqueen a migrant fruit picker in the midwestfor these drought victims who have no voice to speak for them except this congress let us pass this amendment even in good times these farmworkerswho pick the crops and provide all of us with our foodlive close to poverty and

would emasculate the title ix prohibition against sex discrimination in a federally funded education program by exempting hundreds possibly thousands of schools from compliance with this

will find itself in the march 2 1 988 untenable position of providing federal assistance to programs that discriminate against minorities women the handicapped and the elderly the amendment opens up a giant loophole in the existing title ix religious tenet exemption since its enactment in 1972 title ix has permitted very narrow exceptions from the prohibition against genderbased discrimination in any federally funded education program one of the exceptions is available to an educational institution if it is controlled by a religious organization and there is a title ix requirement which conflicts with the religious tenets of that organization since this bill was introduced in 1985 supporters cf this loophole amendment have argued that such a change is necessary because otherwise these institutions which they claim are no longer religiously controlled will have to pay for or perform abortions they can no longer make that claim in light of the danforth amendment now at last they must confess their true motives which is they simply want to be exempt from title ix coverage in fact they have lobbied for this change each time title ix has been amended congress in its wisdom has rejected this effort during consideration of this bill a few weeks ago the senate rejected their claim by a vote of 56 to 39 the house refused to accept this proposal during floor consideration of the restoration bill in virtually every private school can establish some affiliation with a religious organization adoption of such a loophole would defeat the purpose of title ix not only is such a proposal unacceptable on policy grounds it is also unnecessary proponents of this amendment cannot cite a single instance in which legitimate exemptions have been denied it is critical that the control test remain in effect and enforced seriouslyfor that aspect of the test is the linchpin for assuring that only a limited number of institutions may discriminate with federal funds the proposed change to the corporate coverage section in s 557 is unacceptable and unwarranted the corporate coerage provision in the bill represents an accommodation which democratic supporters in the house made

second when the corporation is principally engaged in five business areaseducation health care housing social services or parks and recreationservices which in the past have been provided by the government but through increased privatization are likely to be available through the private sector adoption of this amendment is likely to encourage entities to create discriminatory schemes which will go unchecked by federal civil rights enforces for example under the gentlemans substitute a nursing home chain could create racially segregated facilities free from federal review by confining

collectively make some very cogent points with respect to the operation of the house of representatives as we begin this review of the performance of the house in recent years we see some very disturbing trends we see a less thoughtful process sloppier laws declining productivity and an emphasis on the frivolous as against the substantive the average citizens life is made more complicated more difficult by poorly drafted and often contradictory laws tile problems run deep i would like to start with the committee system traditionally the committee system has been the heart and soul of the house it is in the committees where legislation begins its journey where hearings are held where we search and background information is developed and where legislation is refined to theoretically make it more workable many of us have been here for some time have placed great stock in the committee recommendations feeling that the committee members have developed the knowledge and information base necessary to make responsible recommendations it is precisely because of the important role that committees have played and must of necessity play in the house that it is so disturbing to see their decline in productivity in the nearly 32 years that i have been in congress we have seen a fivefold increase in committee staff but a 70 percent decline in legislation moved out of conmmittees the bigger we get the less we do now one might say that it is not all that bad for the committees to report out fewer bills since it might limit the mischief government gets into i think many of us on occasion have applauded that however the logical question is do we need such large numbers of committee staffs and so many more subcommittees to act on such limited number of bills there are not many private companies which could survive a continuing high overhead with such a loss in production and there is more as you will note from the chart that has been displayed the amount of committee hearings has declined rather dramatically over the past 10 years in essence a 41percent drop from between 1977 and 1986 what this means is that the committees are doing considerably less in developing background and obtaining public input on the various pieces of legislation all the while committee overhead costs continue to rise what the committees are doing more of are media extravaganzas called field hearings where generally the only purpose is to enhance the reelectability of committee members the next chart the second chart shows that an increasing number of bills are being taken up and adopted in the house without even having been acted upon by a committee in the 95th congress the ratio between bills reported from committee and bills passed by the house is roughly equal which is the way it should be by the 99th congress however over 300 bills were passed by the house that were never acted on by committees in other words on those bills the house was forced to make judgment without benefit of committee research committee hearings committee refinement or committee recommendations in some cases of course this superseding of the committee results when the leadership of this house rams legislation through mostly for political purposes the socalled pepper health care bill comes immediately to mind which we will probably have on the floor of this house i was advised by the distinguished chairman this afternoon june 7 or 8 we will be dealing with it on the house floor without it having gone through the normal committee process on the other hand and ever too frequently the committees are often bypassed because they do not act they particularly fail to act on authorization bills necessary to continue expiring programs and when they have acted they have all too frequently crammed reauthorizations into huge mega bills or continuing resolutions authorization bills are the backbone of the legislative process the authorizations come first in the cycle they provide the legal framework for most major federal programs and activities and once a program has been authorized it is then funded by an appropriation bill that is our traditional twostep process in this body and when authorizations or reauthorizations are not acted upon as individual measures we are denied the opportunity to reform and improve the programs involved and when we fail to do so we shortchange the american people out there who sent us here in the first place to do a good job the continuing resolution last year contained over 44 billion in unauthorized programs comprising 45 major laws that had not been reenacted we have been in session almost 4 months now this year and we have not moved on the vast bulk of those programs and on top of that we have 228 billion of expiring programs this year for which new authorization legislation has got to be provided otherwise we are operating outside the law the energy and water appropriation bill we passed in the house last week had 4 4 billion in unauthorized items and that would not be an isolated example it is one thing for the committees to fail to act on legislation developing new programs it is quite another for them to fail to move essential legislation the fact is that the committees are not doing their jobs and when the committees are not doing their jobs the congress has failed in its obligation now going a step further in chart no 3 this chart here shows that even when the committees and the congress do act they are more and more acting on nonsubstantive rather than substantive legislation the chart shows that of the legislation approved by congress that an evergrowing percentage is commemorative or noncontroversial such as a national sewing month or snow white week or national fishing week my colleagues just look at it what a dramatic shift in the worthwhile meaningful pieces of legislation versus those that we would characterize as simply commemorative in fact almost half the legislation enacted into law these days falls into this category compared to less than 10 percent only 10 years ago this kind of legislating could be done by folks sitting at home punching computerized preference buttons and what does that say about our dealing with substantive issues before the nation the more difficult the problem the more we seem to be moving into the realm of irrelevancy and flight of fancy at the same time as we spend more time on frivolity we are doing a bad job on the items that really count and as you will hear from my colleagues later in this hour we are putting more and more of our major laws into huge omnibus packages that no one can read or understand and who pays the cost for this chambers increasing lack of seriousness not you or i members of congress the people who pay for all of this are our fellow citizens of the united states that is why we think it is important to the american people to understand what is going on herc if they want better laws if they want a

everything everyone has said here indicated that we agree about the need for fairness in the law one important aspect of fairness in the law is a concern for the need for expeditious treatment of those cases which fall under the independent counsel statute that is what the last amendment was intended to go to i do know that members were concerned about its reach and were concerned that it might interfere perhaps with investigations while i think that fear is not well placed nonetheless that was the majority vote here my amendment goes in a different direction one of the arguments that i think held up in the last debate was the fact that the time of an investigation by the independent counsel is a time during which the individual who is being investigated does have his or her reputation placed under a shadow of public doubt regardless of their eventual guilt or innocence in this regard it has come to my attention that independent counsels right now are not required to act

chairman of the committee on interior and insular affairs for his assistance and leadership in helping to bring the legislation before this chamber for the benefit of our colleagues i intend to briefly describe the background of this legislation and its major provisions this bill is identical to legislation which passed this body last july sixteen years have now passed since the alaska native claims settlement act of 1971 was signed into law by president nixon the settlement act of 1971 was a bold farreaching land claims settlement act it represented an important change in traditional federal indian law since congress chose to have the act administered by native corporations organized under state law instead of creating reservations found in other states under the law the land would be transferred to these corporations which would be given 20 years of protection from sale and certain property taxes this 20 year period was intended to provide the corporations with time to develop economically without the pressure of corporate takeovers the intent of the settlemnt act was stated in section 2 b of ancsa which is not changed under this legislation section 2 b states in part the settlement should be accomplished rapidly with certainty without litigation the protections of ancsa were for 20 years but the law also called for expieditious conveyances without extensive litigation sexteen years after ancsa lands remain to be conveyed and litigation still hampers some selections and conveyances it is important to remember that the land title claims were settled immediately and completely and were not limited to 20 years as the 20 year deadline draws near there has been a great deal of concern in alaska native communities that the unrestricted sale of stock could result in the loss of lands conveyed under the settlement act as the committee report notes the possible loss of land from native ownership is of paramount concern it is the reason for this legislation to address this concern the legislation would provide for the continuation of restrictions contained in ancsa unless an individual native corporation takes certain actions to eliminate or modify the sale restrictions dissenters rights are provided where the corporation elects to continue stock restrictions in addition to clarification or corporate share ownership rights the bill provides for land ownership protections in the form of statutory protections similar to those now in alaska land bank program finally as i have stated throughout consideration of this bill this legislation does not deal with governments it deals solely with stock and land ownership these are ownership issues of private individuals and corporationsnot governments the bill does not affect government powers it does not grant new lands or funds and does not have any significant fiscal impact on the federal government many individuals and groups in alaska have spent a great deal of time and effort over the past 2 years in considering responses to the 1991 deadline through a series of village meetings and special conventions alaska natives have deliberated and made many difficult decisions which resulted in proposals to congress from there this legislation was considered changed in some respects and then was the subject of congressional hearings in anchorage fairbanks and washington dc over the last 2 years these amendments are intended to respond to a real concern in rural alaska and to maintain the intent of the alaska native claims settlement act nothing more nothing less it is my belief that we must act to provide flexibility for the villages in rural alaska if the intent that brought us the settlement in 1971 is to be maintained we have the opportunity to make the settlement act work better to meet the needs of alaska especially rural villages finally i will restate my conviction that removal of the 1991 deadlines in ancsa is of great importance to future generations of alaskans to the extent that groups and individuals seek to manipulate legal definitions to achieve control over the use of lands owned by native alaskans through opposition to 1991 remedial legislation they jeopardize a way of life in rural alaska which is a fundamental strength in the state alaskans in rural communities who have thrived quietly and privately through good and bad economic times will not suffer yet their children and grandchildren will if land ownership is not protected for future generations for these reasons i urge my colleagues to support this
