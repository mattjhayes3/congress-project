in indiana to determine their own environmental destiny this legislation will enable states and local communities to impose limits on solid waste from outofstate the residents of my district feel dumped on literally they have norecourse to restrict the flow of solid waste coming into their communities from outofstate in 1991 20 percent of the waste disposed of in indiana came from outofstate this amounted to over 500 pounds of outofstate trash for every man woman and childover an extra bag of trash per day for the average family indiana is not a vast pit that can accept unlimited trash from other states we have our own difficulties twelve years ago indiana had 150 landfills today we have 70 by 1996 31 additional landfills will close at that time 54 indianacounties will be left without a landfill the indiana department of environmental management predicts that existing landfill capacity will be reached in 5f years this is a problem that my state is struggling to address local authorities under solid waste management districts are dealing with this problem but they need relief to continue to receive outofstate trash in unlimited quantities will make that task much more difficult if not impossible two landfills in my district one in wabash county and one in miami county have accepted outofstate trash both sites are rapidly approaching capacity due in part to accepting outofstate trash at the site near peru in wabash county last year semitractor trailer trucks filled with outofstate trash were lined up on the county road waiting to dump their loads the

landfill that did receive outofstate waste but does not meet state landfill standards at landfills that are in compliance with state standards the governor may freeze outofstate municipal waste at the actual amounts received in 1991 or 1992 whichever is lower the governor may also restrict the amount of outofstate municipal waste to 30 percent of the amount received in 1991 at large landfills those that received 50 000 tons or more of outofstate waste if it represents at least 30 percent of the total waste received for 1991 in 1998 that amount can be lowered to 20 percent and to 10 percent in

the conference of the transportation bill there were several issues that were left somewhat unclear and i am taking this opportunity to clarify my concerns regarding two issues there is a small but very important provision in the conference report regarding section 13 c of the federal transit act this language attempts to down play and even ignore the delays experienced in 13 c processing by the department of labor put simply this language ignores the fact that significant delays have occurred and continue to occur in obtaining 13 c certification delays that have caused numerous transit properties to wait substantial periods of time to receive capital and operating assistance for transit services even the department of labor itself recog nized earlier this year that a problem existed finding that over 57 grants amounting to roughly 300 million were held up due to 13 c processing the concern voiced by the original house report h report 103643 that an identifiable problem existed was echoed in the senate on a bipartisan basis at the time the fiscal year 1995 dot appropriations bill was considered by the senate several senators expressed disagreement with the notion contained in the senate report s report 103310 that the 13 c program was not broken senator bumpers stated that this language quite frankly does not adequately reflect the experience in my state and i am sure many others the senate language stands in stark contrast to the house report which indicates that numerous transit grants have been delayed due to 13 c and that hese delays frustrate the effectuation of the committees spending priorities and allocation of scarce resources for important transit projects one of the fundamental problems in the 13 c program is the lack of time frames for the negotiation or development of 13 c protections or for certification action by the department of labor similarly senator kassebaum stated that the current process is not working ana ourlocal transit system cannot afford these needless and costly delays senator bond also commented that not only were considerable delays experienced in receiving transit funding but the department of labor has issued determinations of questionable validity which directly conflict with state law and the process initiated for establishing terms and conditions of employment senator bond concluded by stating that for the senate report to say that the 13 c program is working well simply ignores these very real and considerable problems i believe that these statements verify that it is undisputed that important transit projects have failed to be promptly obligated because of delays in the department of labors section 13 c case processing there is a clear need for the department of labor to develop a more time sensitive process for certification of transit projects by establishing time frames for the negotiation and mediation process and by making its own determinations on contested issues as promptly as possible and in accordance with clearly articulated legal standards further to avoid unnecessary delays in the issuance of section 13 c certifications the obligation for negotiating new 13 c protections should only be triggered by a showing of potential employee harm tied to the specific federal project involved with such changes to the 13 c processing of grants the congress spending priorities can be fully effectuated and important transit projects can be promptly undertaken my second concern has to do with a commitment that the federal aviation administration has made with regards to the dallasfort worth international airport first and foremost i want to encourage the faa to continue to oblfgate federal funds in a manner that will provide the greatest benefit to the national air transportation system in this regard the faa should honor its commitment to allocate 75 million over a 3year period to complete the eastside runway now under construction at the dallasfort worth international airport this project will substantially increase the capacity of the unitedstates air transportation system thereby benefiting the system as a whole the funding plan for the new runway was eventually finalized after numerous internal discussions and iengthy negotiations with the airports tenant airlines the funding program was based on certain assumptions one of these assumptions was the use of an 82 7 million amended letter of intent that was issued by the faa in 1989 a second source of funds is the 75 million in joint revenue bonds that were sold in november 1993 the airport was also assuming funds from passenger facility charges the final source of funds was contingent upon the faas assurance to commit an additional 75 million in the form of a letter of intent through efforts of several of my colleagues it became apparent that the faa had agreed to commit the additional 75 million in federal funds to dfws eastside project at that time it was understood that the 75 million would be paid to the airport from the alp discretionary fund over 3 years specifically in fiscal year 1994 the airport would receive 12 5 million in fiscal year 1995 25 million and in fiscal year 1996 37 5 million since this announcement the faa indicated that some of the funding might be allocated over additional years this is not necessarily good news i feel that

rights for 7 years this approach has failed it is time to change our course of action with the chinese government the future of asia and the trade of the united states should be inextricably linked to the nurturing and development of human rights and democracy i fully support the decision by this congress and by president clinton to link chinas mfntrading status with substantial progress in human rights in china and tibet i commend the president for his faithful implementation of this policy and for the administrations strong stance with beijing should june come without substantial human rights progress in china and without actions to preserve the culture of tibet i will support the president in his decision to revoke beijings preferential trade status from the new york times mar 16

an excellent job in guiding this bill through the house and negotiating a conference report with the senate they heard from a number of committee members and there is obviously a diverse amount of opinion amongst those of us on the committee and i think bringing that all together into something we all can support deserves a great of credit on monday president clinton addressed the united nations general assembly in that speech to the world body the president stated that putting our economic house in order cannot mean that we shut our windows to the world i agree with the president but i think it is tough to do when we have so many priorities here at home frankly i have rather mixed feelings toward this bill i do accept our international responsibilities but i cannot help but think we can do it better as a new member of this subcommittee i was disappointed by the enormous waste of money largely because of some dubious congressional earmarks for example earlier this year i listened to the defense department explain to us how they were going to spend the equivalent cost of five new american made aircraft to refit 20yearold aircraft and donate them to botswana as part of a program to give african countries excess military equipment this program was forced upon the defense department by an earmark in the other body i do want to commend the gentleman from wisconsin and the gentleman from louisiana imr livingsron for removing all of the earmarks but those most important out of the bill this year i am also disappointed by an administration that has still failed to produce a foreign aid reform plan the fall of the soviet empire does mean that we must reorder our aid priorities but the issue has been studied to death and it is time for the administration to pick one and present it to the congress this is the last foreign aid bill i will support without a comprehensive plan from this administration they are talking a good game about empowering aid workers but now i think it is time to let them do it finally i want to briefly discuss the russian aid package the stakes are high in russia and throughout that entire region not only is democracy at stake but with thousands of nuclear weapons our safety as well as other countries of the world helping people to makethe peaceful transition by un derstanding the market economy through contracts and through marketing i think is one of the things that we should be working on beyond that however i am not sure if the situation is beyond our ability to help i do support the bill but i believe we can do better i believe we must watch carefully in russia to make sure our enthusiasm for helping them make the democratic transition does not overrule common sense in closing i again commend both the gentleman from wisconsin and the gentleman from louisiana for a job well done not just in getting the bill through this house but for what it represents in a changing world"], [0.005591154098510742,

these arguments i mr horn it is the fear of losing their seat it is the intmidation it is a little bit of antihispanic antilatino et cetera that is also there i am not saying all opposed are saying that but we pick up a few here a few there that obviously have different motives for what is ruling their behavior for those of us that believe in term limits if we go after 2 years it will not matter to us in california law you will go after 6 years and in the proposal most of us want in this chamber you would go after 12 but as the gentleman knows some members feel the whole nation and statecraft of american will collapse if their presence is not in this chamber and therefore it becomes very easy to rationalize when they feel the pressure at home which i am convinced does not represent the majority of most constituencies just as the gentlemans experiences show i had the same experience i listened to a lot of shouting and yelling one night and all i had to do was look at the eyes of the

about the umpteenth time i sent around a dear colleague letter to make this narcotics committee and in great measure because of its fine leadership a permanent select committee i stand by that dear colleague letter i also sent around a dear colleague within the last few days saying to authorize the committee for the full 2 years i hate to go back on a dear colleague when the ink is hardly dry but i have listened to the debate here to this wonderful gang of 110 new members i hope they will find there are occasions when we literally come to the floor with our minds made up one way and by the quality of debate change it l ut i am going to vote yes on the previous question not a no because i think the gentleman from new york makes a compelling case that what maybe should come out of this discussion is real reform and a full debate on making the select committee on narcotics abuse and control permanent there is something unique about the select committee on narcotics abuse and control when we look at its budget and its staffing and it is only no 3 in both cases out of the four committees and that is there is no movement in this country to legalize or accept hunger here or anywhere else in the world nor is there any movement to legalize child abuse or abuse of families or children there is certainly no effort to legalize ignoring the aged in this country each of us with each breath is terminal and one second older god is taking care of the problem of aging we are all heading there so we should address this with some selfinterest and some human kindness and mercy but there is a movement in the united states far more than any other country in the world no nation in the united nations has intelligent people that i admire like the mayor of baltimore recommending that we legalize drugs i have friends that i look to as a mentor or an authority in a myriad of other areas i defer to no one in economics as i do to milton friedman and yet my friend milton says run up the white flag and surrender william f buckley is one of the reasons i came into politics he says to throw in the towel or any other cliche my colleagues want to give up legalize narcotics our chairman on this committee is like a oneman army dealing with the mayors and those intellectual conservatives or liberals who have given up i say vote yes on the previous question and then vote to make this great
