without spending one penny of seniors social security trust fund for nearly 4 decades the raid on social security has gone on taking over 850 billion in social security funds and spending them on unrelated government programs 168 days ago just over 5 months this house passed my social security lockbox legislation by an overwhelming 416 to 12 vote the passage of this social security lockbox legislation showed that house republicans and democrats agree that social security dollars should not be spent on programs unrelated to social security congress made the commitment to stop the raid on social security shortly later however president clinton joined our bipartisan effort and committed the administration to protecting social security that was over 5 months ago unfortunatelyv i am afraid today is a different story while house republicans are continuing to honor our steadfast commitment to protect seniors social security i have great concerns about the recent actions of the clintongore white house and congressional democrats the current budget situation requires that every increase in spending be offset currently if spending is not offset it is drawn directly from seniors social security dollars over the past few weeks president clinton has vetoed five appropriations bills because he says they do not spend enough yet the president has not offered a single solid proposal to pay for those spending increases it appears the president may be willing to spend social security dollars to pay for his spending projects congress and the president are faced with a very clear choice ask federal agencies to save one penny just one penny of a dollar in waste fraud or abuse so we can protect social security or give in to the big washington spenders and raid seniors social security dollars amazingly enough there are still people in washington that do not believe the federal government can tighten its belt by just 1 percent but the american people know the truth a recent poll conducted by the national taxpayers union revealed let me show my colleagues this poll revealed that over 84 percent of americans believe that there is not just 1 percent waste in government but they felt there was at least 5 percent of waste in unneeded spending in the federal spending surely if 84 percent of the american people believe that there is at least 5 percent of waste the president and the congress can work together to find just 1 percent or one penny of waste in order to protect social security dollars so many seniors so many seniors rely upon let me present my colleagues with some examples of waste fraud and abuse that we have found in the federal government the national park service spent 1 million to build an outhouse at glacier national park in montana the expense was explained by the outhouses remote location the outhouse is located nearly 7 miles from the nearest road and it took hundreds of horse trips and more than 800 helicopter drops to get the construction materials to the site another one erroneous medicare payments that waste over 20 billion annually another the department of education maintains a 725 million slush fund which it cannot account for the department of housing and urban development hud estimated it spent 857 million in 1998 in erroneous rent subsidy payments in fiscal year 1998 about 5 percent of the entire program budget let me close with this for a moment and that is delays in disposing of more than 41 000 hud properties cost taxpayers more than 1 million per day these are all examples of how congress and the president can find one penny 1 percent out of a dollar in waste fraud and abuse in the federal government we are all in this together we want to work with the president and vice president gore to find this 1 percent so that we can protect social security dollars we will not however under any circumstances allow the clintongore administration to dip into the social security trust fund to pay

medicare came into being there really wasnt a need for prescription drugs because prescription drugs were in their infancy and it didnt matter the vast majority of the time whether someone was going to live or die be comfortable or not now how can we the only superpower in the world a nation that is leading the world in research and medical products how can we have a medicare program a program for health care for senior citizens that does not include the prescription drug benefit we cant do that i also say to my friend the reason we are here is this morning a senator came over and gave this presentation and said what my friend from north dakota said sure we want to do something about medicare but i have gotten letters from my constituents saying im against the big government plan this is exactly what we hear on the radio advertisements and the television advertisements that are paid for by the health care industry they want the american people to think that the program the democrats are propounding is a big government plan there could be nothing further from the truth what does this have to do with big government a woman by the name of gail rattigah from henderson nv writes i am a registered nurse who recently cared for an 82yearold woman who tried to commit suicide because she couldnt afford the medications her doctor told her were necessary to prevent a stroke it would be much more cost effective for the government to pay for medications that prevent more serious illnesses and expensive hospitalizations these include but are not limited to blood pressure medications antistroke anticoagulants and cholesterol medications the governments current policy of paying for medications only in the hospital is backward get into health promotion and disease promotion and save money this is a registered nurse from henderson nv i want everyone on the majority side to know they are not going to be able to come over and make these statements as if there is no opposition to it what my friend from tennessee says is wrong he states he has gotten all of these letters saying i am against the big government plan that is because of the radio and tv advertisements from the powerful health insurance industry but the real people are like the 82yearold woman who wanted to commit suicide because she couldnt get medication also i want to spread across this record that my friend from tennessee who came and said we need the republican plan makes the statement that he wants to involve senator breaux in this the majority cant have it both ways they either support the bush plan the plan of the person running for the president of the united states on the republican ticket or they dont support the nominee it appears what my friend from tennessee is doing is trying to have it both ways because the senator from louisiana does not support governor bushs plan the majority realizes that their medicare plan simply can not work because of their nominees 1 6 trillion tax cut proposal senator breaux pointed this out quite clearly today my point is i say to my friend from north dakota people who come here and make statements on the floor need to have substantiation i say the senator from louisiana does not support the bush medicare plan i also say the majority has introduced a proposalso we understand it but it is a medicare prescription drug benefit in name only a new york times writer states all indications are that this plan is a nonstarter insurance companies themselves are very skeptical there havent been many cases in which an industrys own lobbyists tell congress that they dont want a subsidy but this is one of them i take just another minute or two of my friends time the gop plan subsidizes insurance companies not medicare beneficiaries health insurance companies continue to say the republican plan is unworkable the majority tries to give this to the insurance industry but the insurance industry doesnt want it because it wont work charles

prescription drugs no 2 we know there has to be something done with medicare to help senior citizens of this country be able to afford prescription drugs that is all we are saying and we want everyone to know the program put forth by the minority is a program that helps senior citizens it is not something that is means tested but a program that helps all senior citizens not people who make less than 12 000 a year it is a program that is essential it is essential because people as we speak such as gail rattigan who is a registered nurse who wrote to me write that people are considering

compromise onefifth of the earths fresh water resources but we still do not know the effects that bulk water exports would have on the great lakes system in an effort to examine the environmental economic and social impact of bulk water removals from the great lakes the united states and canadian governments asked the international joint commission to report on this matter last week the ijc released its final report the ijc reported that removals of water from the great lakes basin could reduce the resilience of the system and its capacity to cope with future and unpredictable stresses despite its vastness over 6 quadrillion gallons of water the system is also extremely vulnerable to disruption any hydrological changes to the water system even small changes could have devastating ecological consequences due to these environmental concerns the ijc recommended a moratorium on such exports should be imposed for 2 years to give the great lakes governors time to collect further data and assess the environmental impact of such removals most importantly the ijc recommended that decisions regarding bulk exports should remain in the hands of those that are closest to this great resource the state governments of the great lakes region i grew up in michigan and i know firsthand how important these lakes are to the states around them they are not just a water resource they are a way of life from shipping to hydro power to tourism and recreation our great lakes communities rely on these water resources to support vital sectors of their economy that is why i have introduced

number of steps along the path to the fluency our intelligence assets need to operate as we approach the next century and as we find ourselves with a desperate need for a presence all over the globe as a member of the permanent select committee on intelligence i have closely followed the issues that have made unusual demands upon the intelligence community and the problems that have produced headlines that we sometimes would rather not see much has been said about these problems that is to be expected and i think it certainly is in order but let me add a thought central to every intelligence operation is a balance between risk and benefit within the committee we are aware of the often unbelievable benefit our government derives from the operations of our clandestine service we are aware as well of risk and on occasion the damage that comes from some of our operations given the full picture of the benefits and of the risks we come to understand that we will inevitably hear a news report and see in the headlines the acronym cia and sort of wince at what we read or the report on the radio we will also appreciate as we hear this news sometimes on occasion not news we want to hear that intelligence officers are overseas scattered around the world putting oftentimes their very lives at risk to get the president and our policymakers the intelligence they must have to make responsible public policy i encourage members to put the unfortunate headline about the bombingand boy it was unfortunateof the chinese embassy in belgrade in that context i know as well as my colleagues that a mistake was made that was avoidable i also know and encourage my colleagues to consider that hundreds of intelligence officers are overseas hard at work as we discuss that we will never read about them we will never know much about them but they are doing something critically important for all of us each and every day we should recognize that this bill is an attempt to give them the resources they need as this dedicated talent is scattered around the world working around the clock often under very adverse conditions to assure a safe and secure america"],

an areathat includes the baltic region and the northwestern region of russia i have been concerned that the european union while acknowledging the extensive problems that exist today in its own backyard in northern europe has yet to take action to provide the kind of substantial aid that will be needed if those problems are going to be properly addressed my distinguished colleague from connecticut has graciously incorporated into his bill provisions i suggested that make it clear that the european union must take the lead in addressing those problems and must in particular provide the substantial aid that is going to be needed to deal with that in my view any assistance provided at this point by our nation should be clearly understood by the european union to be a supplement to its aid not a substitute for the substantial eu assistance that is going to be required i have no objection to our nation lending a hand on those problems in fact the gentlemans bill points out the unitedstates northern europe initiative already exists and has already been funded under our foreign aid program for 3 years at the present time since the president already has the authority to conduct the activities envisioned in this bill under the seed act of 1989 and the freedom support act of 1992 and the authority to provide funding for those activities and the president has used that authority i believe that the gentlemans intent with the introduction of this bill is however to highlight his concern about the problems faced by the countries of northern europe and i share his concern i hasten to take this opportunity to point out that the united states has provided considerable aid to support reforms and to address problems in the region and that the united states has also endowed several foundations in those countries of the region where its aid program has been phased out such unitedstates endowed foundations include the baltic american enterprise fund the baltic american partnership fund and the polish american freedom foundation in addition while our freedom support act aid program our nunnlugar demilitarization program our large food aid program our enriched uranium purchase program and other forms of aid all continue today in russia we have also set up an enterprise fund in that nation that i am certain will last for years to come we should not overlook all that the united states has done in eastern europe since 1989 and all that the united states is still doing in that region today it is therefore my hope that this bill if adopted by this congress will serve to signal our concern over remaining problems in the region of northerfi europe but will also serve as a clear call on the european union to take the lead in addressing those problems i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.0017705261707305908, 0.4982294738292694, 1, "i thank the gentleman very much and i thank him for holding this very important special order on september 29 of this year governor bush of texas attempting to reassure the public that there was no choice to make between oil production and preserving wilderness waxed eloquent on the subject of the arctic refuge we should open up a small fraction of the arctic national wildlife refuge for responsible oil and gas exploration the vice president says he would rather protect this refuge than gain the energy but this is a false choice we can do both said mr bush taking out the energy and leaving only footprints leaving only footprints a wonderful image is it not leaving only footprints in the arctic refuge like robert frost and his little cats feet or robinson crusoe discovering he was not alone when he spied the telltale footprints of friday on the shore of sand before the high tide washed them away an image of footprints in the arctic refuge that the petroleum industry would leave and would love to have linger in our minds these footprints of friday or cats paws in the sand children walking along the beach footprints it is against the law of course as we know to drill for oil in the arctic refuge and the only way that will ever change is if the industry manages to get congress to change the law they are very resourceful this industry they have put together a dream ticket in the person of an oilman for president and an oilman for vice president and now they are engaging in industrial strength poetry as they try to win a license to destroy the wilderness of one of the last places on godcreated earth that man has yet to try to improve so governor bush says his plans would only impact about 8 percent of the refuge well it turns out that what they want to drill is in the biological heart of the refuge where polar bears den and caribou give birth imagine your doctor telling you this wont hurt were only going to drill in a small fraction of your body only about 8 percent only around the region of your heart only that 8 percent of your body that is the only place were going to operate dont worry we wont touch the rest of you only that 8 percent the heart the heart of this refuge now let us take a look at the industrial footprints that have already been left on the north slope by environmentally sensitive oil companies which want to drill in the heart of the refuge these pictures are from dead horse and from prudhoe bay they are part of a vast industrial complex that generates on average one toxic spill a day of oil or chemicals or industrial waste of some kind it seeps into the tundra and becomes part of a new and improved north slope as it is viewed by the oil industry this energy sacrifice zone already spews mote nitrogen oxide pollution into the arctic each year than the city of washington d c that is all of the pollution created in washington d c is not as great as the pollution created by these sites already in this arctic north slope area as we can see the drilling for oil takes a huge amount of equipment for roads for pipes for wells for pumping all the trappings of a massive industrial undertaking have been hauled or flown or barged to the north slope around deadhorse and prudhoe bay the companies have been able to afford to bring everything in to such a remote location because today they are making money but guess what tomorrow it will still be there and tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow all this stuff never leaves the roads the pipes the dry holes the bulldozers the spent wells the gravel pits it all stays and together it makes up a footprint that can only be described as a worldclass mess and it is going to stay that way because once the industry starts making money up there the last thing they are going to do is to go into debt in order to clean it up the industrial footprint extends for miles when it is overlayed on the refuge we can see that it would end any notion of this treasured corner of god almightys earth remaining wild untrammeled and untouched let me finish by noting that this is federal land that has been set aside for all of the people of the united states it does not belong to the oil companies it does not belong to just one state it is a public wilderness treasure we are all the trustees as far as i am concerned we are going to have to work as hard as we can in order to make sure that this incomparable wilderness is not touched there are plenty of tther places that can be explored in alaska and as joe lieberman said in his debate if we just increase fuel efficiency of an automobile three miles a gallon it would produce more oil than all of this arctic wilderness let me conclude and compliment the gentleman from oregon for holding this important special order i think all of these issues have to be discussed"], [0.0030605196952819824,

it because i believe it is consistent with the goals of the national weather service but also expresses a sense of congress that they have to take into account the dangerous and lifethreatening nature

care system today prior to being a physician i managed a fairly large business and my first degree is in accounting as i look at the health care system in our country today it reminds me of a sovietstyle run health care system and here are some facts that people should know that hmos actually cost more for care than feeforservice a recent study 18 percent more also it is funny that that 18 percent that is the amount of money that comes out of an hmo for paperwork and profit so only 82 percent of the dollars that are paid in to managed care actually ever go for care if we could somehow in america through competition and efficiency make that 5 percent or 6 percent we would have 12 percent well we are going to spend about 1 1 trillion dollars this year on health care and if we take 12 percent of that what you can see is that we would have about 150 billion to 160 billion that would go to care well nobody would be lacking in this country we would be able to care for everybody that is not insured everybody that does not have care today if in fact we had a system that was not bound up in paperwork i have almost 33 employees in my medical practice with three great partners that have covered for me since i have been here of that group somewhere between 8 and 11 every day are doing nothing but chasing paper associated with health care it has nothing to do with getting somebody well it has nothing to do with anything except for us getting paid or sending something to lawyers or sending something to insurance companies that is eight people that could be working to make somebody well to me i think that the fact that 18 percent of the dollars in the insurance managed care and hmo industry today are going for paperwork and profits rather than for care leaves a whole lot lacking there is no wonder that we are having difficulty keeping up with the rising costs the last point that i would make is that the fastest growing segment in the cost of health care this year is prescription drugs our economy will not work unless we have competitive markets there is no doubt if you just get on the unitedstates government ftcs web site you will find where they have four large pharmaceutical companies through the last year that have accounted for more than a billion dollars worth of price fixing a billion dollars in excess prices well that is 1 percent of the cost of pharmaceuticals this year are associated with price fixing that we know of that there has already been consent decrees against how much more is there the second thing that we know is that they are going to spend somewhere between 4 billion and 6 billion this year advertising on television who pays for the 4 billion to 6 billion we do what happens with that you see something oh i need that so i go to the doctor so number one we are increasing utilization what i have found in my practice is it takes me twice as long to take care of a patient that comes in because they want a drug from a prescription that they saw on tv because now i have to figure out is that the right drug for their symptoms and if it is not i have to convince them it is not the right drug so i spend my time working against the advertising to get the patient what they really need the third thing is the pharmaceutical companies spend 5 billion a year courting doctors and it ought to stop they spend 5 billion buying lunches in doctors office they spend 5 billion for golf outings for doctors they spend 5 billion on dinners for doctors it is time the american people said that is enough we do not need to pay 5 billion for benefits for doctors 6 billion for television advertising and let us get rid of the 1 billion to 5 billion in collusion if you add that up we would see a 15 percent reduction in pharmaceutical prices not a 15 percent increase"]]}
