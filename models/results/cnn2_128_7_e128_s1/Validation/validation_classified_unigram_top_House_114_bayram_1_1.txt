and selling the body parts of little babies they have so repeatedly proven themselves blind to the dignity of humanity they have always been at the forefront of the greatest human genocide in human history and planned parenthood is the number one advocate of killing more than 3 000 little unborn american babies every day these recent revelations are just one more heartbreaking reminder that the nations largest abortion provider has always had a legendary disregard for the sanctity of innocent human life it beggars incredulity that this congress continues to give hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer moneyagainst the taxpayers wishes mr speakerto a heartless organization like planned parenthood that goes to such grotesque lengths to promote the killing of innocent unborn babies through abortion on demand at any time throughout the 9 months of pregnancy for any reason or for no reason this body recently passed the paincapable unborn child protection act that would except in rare circumstances protect both mothers and their little paincapable unborn babies entering their sixth month of gestation from the unspeakable cruelty of planned parenthood and evil monsters like kermit gosnell if the paincapable unborn child protection act had already been law it would have saved the lives of thousands of lateterm paincapable babies every year and it would have made it much harder for planned parenthood to harvest and sell the organs and body parts of unborn children since they simply would not have had as many of the more mature organs and body parts of the older babies to choose from there is no question whatsoever that planned parenthood brazenly and repeatedly violated the law in the selling of these little body parts it is an unspeakable disgrace that the obama justice department will likely never launch a criminal investigation to look into these unconscionable acts but if this congress and the american people now also look the other way and ignore this kind of insidious evil we do so at our moral peril if the conscience of this nation is to survive it is now vital for the paincapable unborn child protection act to become law the house has already passed this critically important and timely legislation it is now time for the senate to do the same we must not let the continuous and repeated manifestations of this unspeakable evil of killing lateterm paincapable babies and selling their body parts go unanswered supporters of abortion on demand have tried for decades to deny that unborn babies ever feel paineven those they say at the beginning of the sixth month of pregnancyas if somehow the ability to feel pain magically develops the very second the child is born almost every other civilized nation on this earth protects paincapable babies at this stage and at this age and every credible poll of the american people shows that they are overwhelmingly in favor of protecting these children yet we have given these little babies less legal protection from unnecessary pain and cruelty than the protection we have given farm animals under the federal humane slaughter act it is a tragedy that beggars expression the voices who have long hailed the merciless killing of these little ones as freedom of choice especially the ones who profit from it will be very shrill and loud but when we hear those voices we should all remember the words of president abraham lincoln when he said those who deny freedom to others deserve not for themselves and under a just god can not long retain it for the sake of all of those who founded and built this nation and dreamed of what america could someday be and for the sake of all those who since then have died in darkness so americans can walk in the light of freedom it is so very important that those of us who are privileged to be members of this congress pause from time to time and remind ourselves of why we are really all here do we still hold these truths to be selfevident mr lincoln called upon all of us to remember that magnificent declaration of independence by americas founding fathers and their enlightened belief that nothing stamped with the divine image and likeness was sent into the world to be trodden on and degraded and imbruted by its fellows he reminded those he called posteritythat is us mr speakerthat when in some distant future some man some factions some interest should set up the doctrine that some were not entitled to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that their posterity that is us might look up again to the declaration of independence and take courage to renew the battle which their fathers began thomas jefferson whose words marked the beginning of this nation said the care of human life and its happiness and not its destruction is the chief and only object of good government the phrase in the fifth amendment capsulizes our entire constitution it says no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law the 14th amendment says no state shall deny any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws protecting the lives of all americans and their constitutional rights especially those who cannot protect themselves is why we are really all here not long ago i heard barack obama speak very noble and poignant words that whether he realizes it or not apply so profoundly to this subject let me quote excerpted portions of his comments he said this is our first task caring for our children it is our first job if we dont get that right we dont get anything right that is how as a society we will be judged president obama asked are we really prepared to say that we are powerless in the face of such carnage that the politics are too hard are we prepared to say that such violence visited on our children year after year after year is somehow the price of freedom the president also said our journey is not complete until all our children are cared for and cherished and always safe from harm that is our generations task he said to make these words these rights these values of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness real for every american never have i so deeply agreed with any words ever spoken by president barack obama as those i have just quoted how i wish mr obama and the rest of us could somehow open our hearts and our ears to his incontrovertible words and ask ourselves in the core of our souls why these words that should apply to all children cannot include the most helpless and vulnerable of all children are there any children more vulnerable than little paincapable babies before they are even born it seems that somehow we are never quite so eloquent as when we decry the crimes of past generations but oh how we often become so staggeringly blind when it comes to facing and rejecting the worst of atrocities in our own time as americans in the land of the free and the home of brave we now live in a day when monsters like kermit gosnell snip the spinal cords of born babies and planned parenthood that for financial gain uses partialbirth abortions to deliberately harvest intact body parts of innocent babies whom they have deprived of the chance to even be born what we are doing to these little children the least of these our little brothers and sisters is real the president knows that and all of us here know that in our hearts medical science regarding the development of unborn babies beginning at the sixth month of pregnancy now demonstrates irrefutably that they do in fact experience pain many of them cry and scream as they are killed but because it is amniotic fluid going over the vocal cords instead of air we cant hear them it is the greatest human rights atrocity in the united states today and for us to now stand by and allow it all to continue unabated while planned parenthood sells the body parts of these little murdered children is to desecrate everything that america was meant to be and for those noble americans who died to make it come to be abraham lincoln gave his contemporaries such wise counsel and it so desperately applies to all of us in this moment he said fellow citizens we cannot escape history we of this congress and this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves no personal significance or insignificance can spare one or another of us the fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the last generation these are indeed days that will be considered in the annals of history and i believe in the councils of eternity itself this bloody shadow has loomed over america for too long it is time for the senate to pass the paincapable unborn child protection act because in spite of all the political noise protecting little paincapable unborn children and their mothers is not a republican issue it is not a democrat issue it is a test of our basic humanity and who we are as a human family it is time to open our eyes and allow our consciences to catch up with our technology it is time for members of the united states congress to open our eyes and our souls and remember that protecting those who cannot protect themselves is why we are really all here it is time for all americans to open our eyes and our hearts to the humanity of these little unborn children of god and the inhumanity of

we dodged a bullet in the last session of congress about this very same issue that i will be discussing this evening but today again we are in serious jeopardy of having an important right of the american people neutered from them taken away from them by a power play here in washington d c being conducted by multinational corporations who have done everything they can to impact on this system while the american people do not know that there is an attempted move against their constitutional rights alerted by an aggressive yet an unsuccessful attempt to stop this rigorous and rancorous legislation in the house the senate was inundated last year about a similar bill that was supposed to be reform and it was very similar to the one that i will be discussing today there was so much opposition to that bill in the senate that they simply refused to bring it up to the floor for consideration the bill had already passed the house and as i say today a similar bill now is making its way through the house and will be on the floor and it is a great threat to the freedom security and wellbeing of the american people what was that issue that was rammed through the house and once it was exposed that the senate turned it back well it has been an ongoing fight over 20 years a classic case of crony capitalism that plagues our country the big guys are trying to diminish the rights of the little guys in order to make more moneysurprise surprise in this case however what we are talking about they will not only make more money and take that from the little guys but it will undermine americas prosperity and security in the long run i am certainly not opposed to the profit motive but first and foremost we need to ensure that powerful forces dont change the economic rules in order to enrich themselves unseen by most americans who are not paying attention but are paying attention to the important things in their lives their children their families their jobs their schools and their churches but they have been basically unaware that there is an attempt by megamultinational corporations to undermine and yes destroy a constitutional right of our citizensthis in order to fill their pockets at the expense of the american people who dont really understand and even know this power play is going on i am referring to an attack on the fundamental constitutional right of the american people to own what they have created this is a right that has been written into the law at the constitutional conventionit is in our constitutionthat is under attack in a clandestine legal maneuver that would neuter americas inventors the protection that they were granted by the constitution and permit powerful multinational corporations to steal what rightfully belongs to american inventors as granted to them as a right in the constitution thus ordinary americans of course are not as able to get their voices heard at times here in congress and big corporations are they have whole stables of lobbyists tonight we need to mobilize the american people and have them make sure that they contact their member of congress i will alert my fellow colleagues to make sure that they pay attention to what is happening in this piece of legislation that is now being rammed through congress it isnt just about of course dispossessing this issue isnt just dispossessing individual inventors it is a power grab that if they are successful in undermining the constitutional rights of inventors to own for a given period of time what they have created this change in our constitutional law will undermine the prosperity that we have enjoyed as americans the less than forthright attack on our patent system will undermine the economic wellbeing of our working people who depend on the united states to be technologically superior in order so that they can outcompete other peoples in other countries who come from poor societies who work just as hard but dont have the technological advantage that we americans have the american working people have always had the advantage that they can be more productive because our country permitted the technological development of the means of production that made our workers the most productive in the world people are working hard all over the world but it was the people of the united states who coupled that with freedom and coupled that with technology and it uplifted everyone our founding fathers believed that technology freedom and yes the profit motive was the formula that would uplift humankind they wrote into our constitution a guarantee of the property rights of inventors and authors it is the only place in the body of our constitution where the word right is used in article i section 8 clause 8 of the constitution of the united states the congress shall have power to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries this provision has served america well it has led to a general prosperity and national security and it has permitted average people in our country to live decent lives and to have good jobs but instead now we are putting all of that at risk because some multinational corporations want to steal the technology that has been developed by our little guys our small inventors our small and independent inventors are where the new ideas come from these big meganational corporations have huge bureaucracies that are not the source of the great discoveries that we have had over the last two centuries americans work hard as i say but so do all the other people in the world it is technology that makes the difference our technology has multiplied results of that hard work yes that is the secret of our success technology and freedom that was put in place not just because we talk about it but because we wrote that into our law our basic fundamental law the constitution and we have developed from that moment the strongest patent system in the world and that is what has made all the difference benjamin franklin and thomas jefferson were men who believed in technology believed in liberty and freedom and believed that we could uplift every human being not just the elite in our society thus they made sure that in our constitution we had this provision that we set our course toward uplifting all people through technology hard work freedom and the profit motive yet today multinational corporations run by americansand maybe by some multinational corporations that just have americans working for themwant to diminish the patent protection our founding fathers put in place want to diminish the patent protection that has served us so well and over the years we fought and turned back several efforts to weaken the patent system the american people are unaware of this they are unaware that for the last 20 years there has been this attemptand they call it harmonizing our patent system with the rest of the world when we have the strongest system and they were trying to weaken it how does the rest of the world respect the rights of the little guy they dont in fact our patent system has said that if a man or a womanan inventorapplies for a patent overseas that after 18 months anybody who applies for a patent over there has a different situation than our patent applicants an inventor who applies for a patent in the united states knows that his patent application will be totally confidential until the moment he is issued the patent when that patent is issued then it can be published but he then has the legal power to protect his patent rights for a given period of time traditionally that has been 17 years of guaranteed protection well that is not the way the rest of the world works the rest of the world wants 18 months eighteen months after you apply for a patent they publish it for the whole world to see even if the patent has not been issued thus any inventor in that case everything that he or she has invented and all of the research is now made available to ones competitors that destroys incentive and in fact that was the goal 20 years ago that marcy kaptur of ohio and i were able to stop that provision from being put in the law because of what they were trying to do in harmonizing this law was that every american todaythink about itevery american inventor today anybody who didnt get their patent in 18 months it would be published to the world and we would have a massive stealing of our technology and undercutting of our technological superiority i might add the other thing they were trying to accomplish was they saidand overseas they dont have this guaranteeand that is if you apply for a patent if it takes you 10 years to get your patent you still have 17 years of guaranteed patent protection from the time it is issued overseas they start the clock ticking at 20 years when you file if you file for a patent and it takes you lets say 10 years to get your patent in the united states you would have 17 years of protection overseas you end up with 10 sometimes 5 years of protection we have the strongest system in the world it has worked for us now we have people over the last 20 years who have tried everything they could to undermine it we won those early fights against the two provisions i just described well after a few years of this of course marcy kaptur a strong coalition and i managed to thwart those efforts but today we see anotheranothereffort to try to undermine and diminish the patent protection that we have been fighting to preserve for these last 20 years 31 2 years ago the house passed the america invents act which we warned fundamentally diminished the patent system weakening its protection for ordinary citizens the negative impact of that billand that is just 31 2 years agothe negative impact is overwhelming we changed for example the fundamental idea in that bill one of the ideas that was changed from our countrys founding it was always the first person to invent something and can prove they invented it they will get the patent well they have changed it to the first not to invent they changed that to the first one to file for a patent is going to get the patent so that smaller and independent inventors who cant afford to go over and over again and every new twist of their invention get a separate patent for these small inventors have been facing major corporations that then immediately will go in and file for patent after patent after patent because they can afford it what they have done now is these corporations are flooding the patent office with applications of course there are not more people working in the patent office thus they are feeling a dramatic reduction in their ability to get the job done because they are being flooded with patent application because we have changed the basic rules of the game and it has worked against technological development in our country the onslaught as i said of course is aimed at neutering the rights of the small inventor we have barely turned back this latest attempt which last year we passed through the house and went to the senate but when the senators of course got a message from their own colleges and universities as to what this would do and the damage that it would do to the universities we were able to stop it and stop the effort in the senate now we have the american innovation act that has been presented here this is yet the most recent onslaught over a 20year battle of trying to protect the interests of the little guy now we have the american innovation act let me just suggest that these big megacorporations over the years who have stepped up with these proposals that would diminish the right of the small inventor didnt say we are trying to diminish the rights of the small inventor that is not what was being sold to the members of congress instead what was sold in the first onslaught 20 years ago was the submarine patent that is why we have got to eliminate the ability for people to have a patent application that is secret until it is granted that is why at 20 years from filing you dont have any more patent protection well that was a derogatory term that was used to confuse the public in order to try to secure their goal of diminishing the right of all inventors especially small inventors they are insisting of course now that there is another threat and that we should pay attention to this other threat that has emerged that should motivate us to again diminish the rights of american inventors to protect their own patent because supposedly patent law is being abused by the socalled patent trolls now what are patent trolls let me note that we all understand that there are frivolous lawsuits that take place throughout the american system we have a system of justice you can sue someone if that person has damaged you yet there are frivolous lawsuits lawyers will do that and we know that that is something we have got to deal with judges need to be stronger in that case but they exist and yes there are frivolous lawsuits that are presented by lawyers over patent right infringement and sometimes these frivolous lawsuitsand many timesare just based on phony claims that they claim they have the right in the patent to this and they sue some businessman hoping he will just pay off that is indeed a problem it is not a major problem in the sense that it is a minor part of all of the litigation that goes on almost all the patent litigation that goes on and most of the lawyers who are involved in this who are called patent trolls are involved with legitimate claims against people who have infringed on the patent rights of especially small inventors they are basically getting involved with the small inventor who does not have the resources to basically defend his patent against some large megamultinational corporation but of course big corporations would have us believe that what we are really talking about are frivolous lawsuits against them no there are many many positive lawsuits that are totally justified the vast majority of all lawsuits that come into play against these major corporations are based on a legitimate claim by someone who owns a legitimate patent who these big companies have just tried to rip off and so what they are trying to do now is what they are trying to make it more difficult for those little guys even with any type of help from what they call a patent troll to be able to actually bring their case of infringement against large corporations what this basically is saying is we have got to change our justice system we have got to change the rules of the game for every lawsuit because some people have been manipulating the law and having frivolous lawsuits i dont think that that is what we want in america we dont want to take away the right the legitimate right to go and defend yourself in court because some people use the courts in a frivolous or a manipulative manner if the small inventor doesnt have the resources for example to enforce his or her own patent and if they have been granted this patent legitimately by the federal government that they own this technology that they have developed then there is nothing wrong with the fact that someone could come along and help them enforce it when a megamultinational corporation is basically stealing their rights i have consulted with a number of outside individual inventors and groups they have affirmed to me that the legislation now being proposed in h r 9 the bill that was already passed through the judiciary committee that that bill disadvantages the little guy against deeppocketed corporations and in fact every provision in the name of stopping patent trolls is a provision that would undermine the efforts of people who own legitimate patents and have legitimate patent claims and undermine their ability to enforce those claims so basically we are saying and what is being said about patent trolls yes there are frivolous lawsuits and trolls sometimes are involved with frivolous lawsuits but by and large that does not mean that the overwhelming number of lawsuits are not legitimate and they should have every right to call on someone to help them in their effort basically to defend their patent rights proponents of this legislation are covering the fact that what we really have here is a bill on h r 9 that makes it easier for big corporations to steal the technology secrets of the little guys they would have us believe that all lawsuits are frivolous and the frivolous lawsuits are throughout our system and instead of focusing just on frivolous lawsuits they want us to have an overall diminishing of the rights to our inventors to enforce their patents and make it more difficult for them to do so so tonight i draw the attention of the american people to h r 9 the innovation act as i say was introduced by chairman goodlatte and was passed through just a week ago or 2 weeks ago in the judiciary committee in the last congress the house judiciary committee held hearings on this bill and witnesses at that hearing included director kappos and others that was when we were discussing the america invents act and people said lets go slow on this why are we trying to push this through in such a hurried manner well they are trying to push it through in a hurried manner because once people understand the implications of diminishing the right of people to protect their patents they are going to find it has dramatic changes to the american way of life for example our universities now have discovered that if indeed h r 9 passes that it will have a huge impact on the viability of their own scientific research and their own patents that they own by these various universities it will diminish the value of patents across the board if we say that it is going to be more difficult to fight infringers and more costly for someone to fight someone who is infringing on that patent so according to sponsors of h r 9 this is as i say an attempt to control the trolls but in fact it is going to control the universities it is going to control other companies other than these big companies that as i say are multinational companies they are mainly in the electronics industry those people may want to take away some of these patent rights and let them sue but that is not true in many others you have got pharmaceuticals and biotech and many other industries that will be impacted in a horrible way because of h r 9 now what we need to do is make sure that the american people speak to their member of congress and talk to them about we do not want to make it more difficult for people who have developed new technologies to defend their technologies against infringers we dont want to make it more difficult for people who are the innovators to innovate to come up with the new ideas to basically make sure that america is on the cutting edge and leading the way and if we have harmonized with the rest of the world as has been their goal for a long timeand i might add one of the things that we have to be very concerned about when we look at the trade bill that is being shoved through congress is whether or not it will contain a provision that i helped defeat 20 years ago which i just mentioned that will make sure that our patent applications are published after 18 months now i have been told that that is in the trade bill and there have been all sorts of denials and some people are coming to me whispering yes it is in there well we know we are operating under secrecy we have been operating under secrecy here so it is impossible for me to tell the public i know absolutely because i read it because had i read about this in that bill i wouldnt be permitted to talk about it but that is another one of those things that you have got to be very careful what are you going to pass in this trade bill it might be exactly what i am talking about which is a diminishing of the patent rights of the little guy and who is pushing that megacorporations multinational corporations the same guys who are pushing this trade bill on us and not letting us even know what is in the trade bill which we are supposed to give up our right for an upordown vote not even knowing what is in that bill so what we need to do is make sure we go through all of those items in this bill h r 9 and people have to understand that every one of those provisions in this bill are aimed at making it more difficult for the small inventor to go up against a major corporation who is infringing on that inventors creation so how come we have got bills now that we can be bringing to the floor and that are aimed at helping the big guy steal from the little guy this is not what america is all about this isnt what our founding fathers had in mind the results of h r 9 will be increased patent infringement meaning the little guys will have more and more of what they are developing stolen from them and thus there will be less incentive for the geniuses in our society to use that genius to create the new technologies that keep us safesafe it is our technological edge that keeps us safe that makes us prosperous we cant be prosperous unless we are the innovators unless we are the guys with the new ideas rather than the people who are just copying other people our working people will not have a decent standard of living this will reduce the legal remedies for those who have been infringed upon it will reduce investment into small businesses that are aimed at technological development why would anybody want to invest with a small inventor or a small company that is developing technology if you are going to make it more and more difficult for that investor to get that money back if someone is stealing that technology and of course it will do irreparable damage to our research universities our inventors our entrepreneurs our economy and our nation every part of the socalled reform is detrimental to the patent owners and especially individual innovators will be damaged every provision bolsters the patent thieves the infringers at the expense of the legal owners all this done covered by the idea well we have got to get at the trolls i would like to share with you and with my colleagues just the story of exactly how that word troll came up there is a head of a major corporation who changed his mind on this bill who years ago was part of the clique pushing this sort of diminishing of patent rights he told me that he sat in a room with other corporate executives to come up with the strategy how are we going to get the american people to support legislation that actually hurts the little guy and helps the big guy steal from the little guy how are we going to do that well we need a straw man we need something to get attention that is going to make it look like that is really the goal is to take care of that evil sinister person over there they went around the circle trying to come up with a name that was so sinister that would help them accomplish their mission this is how cynical these people are who are offering this argument about trolls and finally the guy who was talking to me said i suggested patent pirate but by the time it got around patent troll sounded so much more sinister they decided they would accept that well this is absolutely absurd the fact is that if we are going to beat this onslaught of the big guys against the little guys we little guys have got to stick together we have got to make sure that we notify our members of congress and talk to other members we have got to pay attention because this is just another example of when we are not paying attention we lose our freedom we lose our freedom our rights are diminished you can count on the fact with the diminished rights of our inventors wages in this country will go down our competitiveness will go down we will not be secure we will not be prosperous this is an important issue yet they are trying to get this by with as little debate and as little attention as possible now how important is this well it has always been important to our country if we didnt have this patent protection that i am talking about our country would be totally different let me suggest this if you look back and see what our founding fathers had in mind they wanted the little guys to be protected and have legal rights this is what our country was all about and the innovation and the rights of ownership this was our innovation this is what benjamin franklin talked about and put into our constitution and that has worked so well for us if we cut off the little guys and if we make sure that they are not going to profit from their hard work and their struggle we will not have the new technologies we will not be the leader in technology in the world and we will fall behind and every one of us will be hurt by this one only needs to see how important technology was to our society one only needs to take a look here in the halls of congress there is a statue here in the capitol of philo farnsworth now who the heck knows who philo farnsworth was they have done a special on him on education tv i understand on the history channel philo farnsworth was someone who really was important to our country and there is a statue to philo farnsworth right here in the capitol he was a farmer in utah a man who was educated in engineering but who had very little resources in fact he was a farmer he set out between farming to try to find out and discover a technological secret that had perplexed some of the most powerful and financial interests in our country rca at that timethis was back at the turn of the century in 1910 and 1920was under a man named david sarnoff he was americas premier executive at the premier technology company of the united states a company that had vast resources and was deeply involved with trying to find out how to invent a picture tube they knew what the radio tube was but they didnt know how to make images on it how could they make that radio tube show images this is what they really were looking for and they had invested so much in it it was a huge challengean historic challengethat rca dumped millions of dollars of research into however they didnt discover it the one who discovered the secret of the picture tubeand it has had so much impact on the american way of life since everything we havecell phones computers you name itis based on a picture tubewas philo farnsworth this independent inventor this farmer from utah discovered the secret he wrote rca naively believing that this big corporation would honor his discovery and permit him to at least have the benefit of being recognized as the person who made this discovery then rca when they got the letter from philo farnsworth sent a representative to the laboratory there in utah which was in his barn i believe when he described to these top engineers from rca what he had found the scientists from rca went away saying oh yes we will be back in touch with you of course they never did get back in touch once they learned of his secret the thing that philo knew was his he ends up reading an announcement in a magazine of how rca had made this major breakthrough this discovery except philo knew he was the one who had discovered it and he was the one who had transmitted that information to rca this became one of the great jury and great legal battles of the 20th century philo farnsworth an individual personnot a wealthy person the little guywas up against the most powerful american corporation of the day rca which had one of the strongest and toughest leaders this corporate leader david sarnoff had a whole stable full of tough wellpaid lawyers all of whom vowed not to give one penny to philo farnsworth and not to recognize him because rca deserved to get the credit and the money philo farnsworth was able to mobilize support behind his claim people invested in philo farnsworths claim and it went all the way to the supreme court he was able to have people invest in his lawsuit slowly but surely they made their way through the court systemas i say all the way to the supreme court god bless the united states of america a poor single manan individual farmercame up against one of the most powerful corporations in america at the time because he had invented something the supreme court decided with philo farnsworth over this brutally powerful corporation in america rca was beaten by an individual farmer but he had people who had invested in him had the same laws they are trying to promote now in h r 9 been in place philo farnsworth and the other little guys who have invented things like this throughout our countrys history would have been betrayed there would have been nothing he could have done because h r 9 would have prevented him from having had people invest in his lawsuit that is what h r 9 does it says if a big corporation has stolen from you and if somebody has invested in helping you with your invention they then become liable if you have to sue to get your money if something happens where the big guys wineven if you are right and they win because they have better lawyersanybody who invests in you has to pay part of the legal fees of these big corporations which are millions of dollars of legal fees no one is going to want to invest in a little guy like that the philo farnsworths would be left out in the cold the nature of our system would have been totally different than what it is today if we were to have had the provisions of h r 9 which they are trying to foist on us now let me give you another example black americans happen to be some of the most inventive people in the united states a lot of people dont know that if you look back in the history of the patent office as i have been looking what you will find is while black americans were being discriminated against in general throughout our whole system the patent office was the one place that they had equal rights to come up with their ideas and to say this is what i have discovered because of that we have many great black inventors maybe that is the reason former chairman of the judiciary committee john conyers is taking my side in this debate on h r 9 he is opposed to that we have a black inventor for example who was the guy who invented the machine that permitted us to mass produce shoes before that time americans had one pair of shoes we started to mass produce them because this black american struggling on his own because he was discriminated against like all black americans were in that day managed to get his patent accepted and he changed not only himself but the whole country had shoes after that isnt that wonderful that is what happens when you have freedom for the little guy and not just for the big guys they come up with the new ideas they can uplift everybody and make sure everybodys feet feel better we are on the verge of losing that now we are on the verge of losing that when i go out in the hallway of congress here i see a statue to philo farnsworth that is where it is it is the statue of this utah farmer who invented the picture tube and who had to take on the biggest company and the biggest corporate powers in the world and he won i will tell you that there is his statue there and that there is no statue to david sarnoff the corporate leader who tried to beat him down and steal his technology i do not care how rich and powerful he was we respect the little guy in this country we want the little guys to be able to have rights that are protected by our constitution that is why our founding fathers put it in the constitution many of these megacorporations especially electronic corporations dont care one bit about the wellbeing of the american people because they are multinational corporations now we want to make sure our people maintain their rights that we keep being the leaders of innovation and that we are able to outcompete the world and not just take all of our jobs overseas and give them to cheap labor we want to make sure that americans benefit because this is what america is all about it is where the little guy has the same rights legally and they are protected that is what this fight is all about when it comes to h r 9 people need to talk to their congressmen and the congressmen need to talk to each other about what this is really all about it is easy to yawn when someone says i am going to discuss patent rights oh yeah patent law how boring it is not boring it is going to make all the difference as to whether our country stays safe because we have to have the technological edge to be safe in the world we are getting into now our people are not going to have decent housing or a decent standard of living because the wealth that is produced isnt produced just by hard work it is produced by technological efficiency and we have to be on the cut ting edge or we will be outcompeted by people overseas this is going to determine what america is going to be like i would ask my colleagues to join me in opposing h r 9 lets talk to the

words and it is very rare in that it costs nothing but i would argue that it is very important the men and women of the reserve component as you so eloquently heard by my colleagues who spoke prior

reserve but who have not served a qualifying period of title x active duty we honor their service with health care benefits and monetary benefits with one notable exceptionthey must call themselves military retirees and not veterans as the gentleman from pennsylvania noted i think most americans when i talk to them are unaware of this once they find out they are appalled that we dont do it this bill closes the loophole there are about 280 000 americans who fall into this category they have devoted their lives to our nationthey have served honorably for 20 or 20plus yearsand this bill will recognize their service it might be as simple as buying a hat that reads army veteran or getting a license place for your car it bestows no monetary benefits to these brave men and women merely the title again my colleague from pennsylvania i think said it right in that it is a pretty important titlea veteran of the united states military it also does something else very important in doing so we recognize the integral role our national guard and reserve play in our nations defense there is nothing quite so unifying or quintessentially american as the citizen soldier dating back to the founding of our nation or serving overseas at a time of fighting terrorism it is the mother who leaves her family and her law firm to serve her nation and it is the father who leaves his teaching job

h r 9 this bill is a grave threat to the rights of the american people to own the intellectual property rights that they have created with their own hard work and their own innovative skills the bill that is being marked up is called in fact the innovation act it is one of the worst misnomers that i have seen in my time in congress this should be called the antiinnovation act this is yet the latest of a decadeslong attack on the patent rights of the american people that were placed into the constitution by our founding fathers for decades now large multinational corporations very powerful economic entities that have influence on government have been trying to neuter the patent rights of the american people why have they been doing this why do they want to eliminate or to dramatically reduce the rights of our inventors to control what they have invented because these are big guys who dont want to pay the little guys when they steal from them the fact is that our founding fathers knew it was important for someone who has created something whether it is a writer or an inventor to have the right to control his or her creation for a certain period of time the time period has been 17 years traditionally since the time of our constitution our founding fathers knew this was important to our countrys wellbeing not just in terms of the rights of the individual which we agree with as americans and which were written into our constitution as part of the bill of rights only one place is the word right used in the body of the constitution and that is in the section dealing with providing our inventors and yes our writers with the right to control what they have created for a certain period of time in order to profit from it our big corporations and these multinational corporations that have no loyalty to the united states these people who are continually going overseas to china and elsewhere are trying to neuter this so that they can take any new innovation without having to pay the person who has actually been the inventor and created this that is totally contrary to what our country has been all about we have had the strongest patent system in the worldthe strongest in the world what has that given the american people it has uplifted our standard of living of ordinary people yes these folks in the multinational corporations they live very well well the american people have lived well because we have had the technology whether it is agricultural technology or transportation technology or any of the other type of energy technologies that we have these have uplifted us and created more wealth for our society americans security prosperity and yes freedom have been due to our technological advantages it is not that our people worked harder it is not that we had such natural resources there are countries all over the world where people work hard and have natural resources it is our freedom and our respect for the individual rights of our citizens

claimed rights that they werent given by the patent office and issued frivolous lawsuits to people to try to get them to pay money to them they are called patent trolls this excuse for changing our

aisle on that point to say that punishing viewshow about enforcing the law the last time i sat in my law classes we didnt enforce views we enforced laws i think that is what we are bringing up here i cant let it pass i talked about this before and as a member who believes that there are immigration issues that we need to address and as a member of the judiciary committeewhich by the way has held hearings dealing with this subjectin fact just last week the secretary of dhs was in i questioned him directly about this and it is amazing he has no real opinion about sanctuary cities as he told me in his testimony i find that rather amazing in that he would say that there would be a problem not enforcing these laws and when i asked about other laws that we want to enforceis it okay for cities to turn their back on those lawsthere is not an opinion there we have talked about this we have had immigration hearings we have begun the process of marking up legislation to secure our communities to secure our borders and to do those things but before we start throwing in the nature of saying there is all wrong with the republican majority on something that we have not done i just want to go back and remindi am still one who at the time was out there watching the proceedings from my home in the state of georgia where we were doing everything we could to balance the needs of our state and our economy during shutdown and during a depression recessionwhatever you want to call itand we were trying to balance budgets and we were watching this issue up here but what i saw was that we are told today we are waiting for republicans and the republicans have all this bad agenda at the same point when this body was controlled by my friends across the aisle when the other body across the waythe senatewas controlled by my friends across the aisle and when the administration was new and in their early stages of developing their strategy for solving all the worlds problems what they chose to do was wreck health care and to work against community bankers they chose that they chose not to do comprehensive immigration reform they chose to use it as a political issue and a political pawn they chose not to bring this up when you want to bring it up lets shine the light brightly lets bring it up and shine the light brightly on both sides the world was waiting you managed to get a lot of other things through you managed to do other things that you wanted to do but you chose not to do this you chose not to make this my question here is simply the bill that is being brought forward it says enforce the law i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.0029529929161071777, 0.5029529929161072, 1, "i rise to honor the life of vernon j alston a unitedstates capitol police officer

of bureaucracy it appears to be a good bill as a former mayor i fought to ensure that my city and other cities were not unduly impacted by unfunded federal mandates in michigan we worked cooperatively with our federal counterparts on proposed regulations that would generate obligations on local governments in fact as a local government official i supported the unfunded mandate reform act as it was a result of multiple years of effort by our state and local government officials to control the burden of many unfunded federal mandates along with the consequences i have previously mentioned this bill will also grant corporations special access to information about a rule and an opportunity to submit feedback to an agency before a rule is even proposed additionally the legislation would shut the american people out of this early review the bill would also require agencies to perform retrospective analysis at the request of any chairman or ranking minority member of any standing or select committee of the house or the senate the bill neither improves nor streamlines the regulatory process it expands agency roles and interjects politics into the process the office of management and budget is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the unfunded mandates information and transparency act this bill also expands ombs role and it requires them to guarantee that each agency

innocent people a third plane slammed into the pentagon and a fourth plane likely destined for this very capitol complex in which we now stand was brought down by a group of courageous passengers in a field in shanksville pennsylvania as i do today i represented ground zerothe world trade center areaon september 11 2001 in the hours immediately after the attack i left washington and took the last train back to my home in new york i will never forget the moment i first saw the ravaged skyline of lower manhattan from the train windows normally on the train while going between philadelphia and new york i would look to see the first glimpse i could catch of the twin towers now what you could see were not the twin towers but long tall billowing clouds of smoke that were going straight up and then were stretching down the jersey shore the twin towers had been replaced by the brutal glow of raging fires and of black billowing smoke the train that left at 10 oclock arrived at 6 we had been held up in baltimore while they walked the tracks looking for bombs coming out of penn station at 6 oclock was like a scene from the movie on the beach for those who remember that movie nothing was moving the city at 33rd street and eighth avenue seemed completely emptyno people no cars no buses there was nothing moving as if it were completely depopulated to get home i had to call a friend to come pick me up when i went down to the world trade center the next morning the scene was absolutely horrible there was fire smoke debris twisted metal human remainstotal devastation yet even then there were signs of hope firefighters police emergency medical technicians ironworkers and construction workers of all types rushed to ground zero from around the country to offer their help messages of support and comfort flooded in from all 50 states the american people were united and determined to help new york get back on its feet the attack may have occurred in my district but it was an attack on our nation as a whole and we all recognized that in the years since the attacks america has acted as a nation to help rebuild new york and to support the responders survivors and families of the victims last year congress reauthorized the james zadroga 9 11 health and compensation act so as to provide health care and support the 33 000 responders and survivors who now live in all 50 states and in 429 congressional districts by passing a permanent health program and reauthorizing the victim compensation fund congress provided peace of mind for tens of thousands of brave americans in addition to making our responders and survivors whole congress invested billions of dollars to help rebuild lower manhattan one world trade center now fills the hole that was left in our skyline when the towers fell and businesses that were shuttered after the attack are reopened and are thriving in what was once the shadow of the towers there now stands a comprehensive museum that is dedicated to sharing the stories of september 11th and the bravery of those who risked everything to protect their fellow americans on that day and on the days following in place of the smoking hole that congressman macarthur and i saw day after day in lower manhattan there now exists a somber and inspiring memorial it is a site of remembrance and hopea place for every american to come and reflect as to what happened on that september morning and to renew our promise to never forget the events of that day it is a national memorial for a national tragedy that is why i am pleased to cosponsor the legislation introduced by my colleague from new jersey to provide federal recognition and support for the memorial this legislation will help ensure the memorial continues to provide a sacred and inspiring spot for generations to come i appreciate the bipartisan support from the members of the natural resources committee and from the house leadership in bringing this bill to the floor today i look forward to working with my colleagues on the house appropriations committee every year to ensure that the national 9 11 memorial and museum receives appropriate levels of funding i will also work with my colleagues to maintain open communications with the department of the interior to ensure the money is spent wisely and achieves our shared goal of ensuring the memorial remains

act as it makes its way to the presidents desk it is important legislation that will make an impact in the lives of so many girls and young women around the world like last year i am an original cosponsor of the house version of the girls count act and i think that the version introduced in both houses this congress is even better than the one that the house passed last year as it explicitly recognizes the great work that so many faithbased organizations do around the globe there is a need for the legislation because in too many parts of the world girls are discriminated against simply for being a girl indeed this disregard for the value of the girl child often begins in the womb in countries such as india and china where we see the horrific practice of sexselective abortion this cruel practice in turn has led to a gender imbalance which has fed other crimes against women such as sex trafficking bride selling and prostitution i chaired a hearing two years ago on the problem of indias missing girls which addressed the problem of violence against the girl child in india sexselective abortion and female infanticide have led to lopsided sex ratios in parts of india for example 126 boys are born for every 100 girls perhaps the best figures we have concerning the magnitude of the problem come from indias 2011 census figures which find that there are approximately 37 million more men than women in india in china too we see the brutal effects of a onechild policy that causes baby girls to be killed before birth where only one child per couple is permitted in a society that has a traditional preference for sons the predictable resuit is that a disproportionate number of girls will be killed in the womb as mara hvistendahl recounted in a book i recommend to all of my colleagues unnatural selection choosing boys over girls and the consequences of a world full of men in asia alone there are 160 million missing girls roughly the same amount of women and girls as there are in the united states the result of this seximbalance is a world where there is greater political instability with violence inside the womb begetting violence outside as well todays legislation which seeks to have every girl counted and registered marks a small but important step toward a world where every child boy or girl is equally valued and cherished for her or his inherent godgiven dignity from the moment of conception"]]}
