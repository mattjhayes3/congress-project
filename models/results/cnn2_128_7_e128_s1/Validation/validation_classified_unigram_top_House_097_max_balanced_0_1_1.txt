wellthoughtout bill that addresses the important issue of protection of the foreign diplomats who work and live in the united states chairman howard and the ranking minority member the gentleman from california have provided firm leadership and worked in a spirit of bipartisan cooperation on this bill the chairman of the public buildings subcommittee the gentleman from illinois and its ranking minority member the gentleman from minnesota along with the gentleman from georgia and the gentleman from new york have worked to build a complete public record they have participated in the extensive hearings on this bill both here and in new york and have provided keen insight in strengthening and improving this legislation h r 6254 simply allows the federal government to meet an important responsibility it has always been recognized that the national host government is primarily responsible for the safety of foreign diplomats our ambassador to the u n jeane kirkpatrick testified before the house subcommittee on public works that in cities whose diplomatic communities are comparable to new yorks the na tional government provids a high level of diplomatic security in the united states the burden of providing this protection has fallen mainly on the backs of local communities in 1974 congress recognized the need to assume his burden and passed legislation which directed the secret service uniformed division to provide protection in areas with 20 or more missions to an international organization congress also recognized that local authorities might be able to provide protection more thoroughly and at less cost than an outside force such as the secret service ambassador kirkpatrick in testimony before the subcommittee emphasized the importance of using local police in her own words the advantage of primary reliance on local police for extraordinary services are obvious most obvious is that they know the territory they know the system they can utilize available personnel more flexibly and more quickly the most costeffective means of providing protection is through the new york city police in order to utilize the capabilities of local police and at the same time alleviate some of the localities burdens congress permitted the treasury to reimburse local authorities for efforts to provide extraordinary protection examples of visits by foreign diplomats that have required extraordinary protection include the 1975 visit by the late president of egypt anwar sadat and the 1979 visit of cubas fidel castro in addition to visits by controversial diplomats extraordinary protective efforts are also needed at u n missions due to random escalations in terrorist activity such as fighting between nationalist serb and croation factons or in reaction to international events the soviet invasion of afghanistan and civil wars in central america have led to terrorist threats or actions which required the posting of guards 24 hours a day at certain u n missions until the high potential for violence had subsided there can be no doubt that in all of the examples i have touched upon the extraordinary security efforts that were required were legitimate federal responsibilities after all if a mob or a terrorist group in the soviet union threatened the unitedstates mission in moscow we would hardly expect the soviet government to defer action on the grounds that it was the responsibility of the moscow city police just as we expect other nations to protect our ambassadors so must we be willing to provide their diplomats with freedom from terrorist acts new york city provides protection for the 32 000 members of the citys diplomatic community this is the largest diplomatic community in the world including washington d c the frequent and often impestuous demonstrations in front of the united nations building are kept within the bounds of peaceful and legitimate demonstrations by the efforts of new york city police who provide protection outside of the unitedstates mission to the u n and at the many embassies that are in the city as my distinguished colleague the gentleman from minnesota pointed out last saturday we had over half a millioi demonstrators in new york demonltrators against nuclear warfare yesterday we had approximately 2 000 more and there were 2 000 arrests yesterday there were acts of civil disobedience which were staged in front of several missions those acts of disobedience alone in manpower expenses has a dollar figure of 670 000 just for yesterday and that is most conservative it does not include bus costs court costs or any other costs connected with those arrests new york city has continued to provide this protection despite a onethird reduction in its police force which has caused a reduction in police protection for the people of new york in the face of this sacrifice it is only just that the federal government honor its commitment and obligation either to provide extraordinary protection when it is nec essary or to reimburse the city to provide the protection by the end of this year it is estimated that the treasury will have approved nealy 20 million in reimbursements for new york city that it cannot pay out due to a lack of funds i think that is an important point these funds are principally unavailable because there is an excessively low authorization level of 3 5 million year h r 6254 would authorize 17 7 million to pay off the governments debt which it already acknowledges that it owes to new york city and prevent future debts for escalating by raising the annual authorization limit from 3 5 to 7 million in additions to the equity arguments this bill is cost effective the federal government not the city of new york is under obligation to prcvide extraordinary protection if the federal government does not reimburse the city new york will be forced to turn over protection to federal agents the treasury department recently estimated that the cost of using secret service uniformed division agents instead of new york city police would be at least 20 million the first year and 14 million in each subsequent year far above the cost of this bill robert mcbrien the treasurys special assistant in charge of reviewing reimbursements to new york stated that if there were a choice between reimbursing the city and sending federal forces our choice it reimburse the city mr mcbrien went on to say that even if 400 federal agents were permanently deployed in new york city the federal government would still have to reimburse the city for use of city police in any largescale operation such as the protection of a head of state security along the route of a motorcade carrying controversial diplomats and at 24hour guard posts around threatened missions the fundamental issue addressed in this bill is that the federal government has recognized its obligation to provide protection to foreign diplomats and has delegated that responslbility to the city of new york without providing sufficient funding to cover the citys necessary efforts h r 6254 merely removes the inconsistency of congress recognizing a legitimate and necessary federal expense but not paying for it it also has the very pleasant side effect of saving the federal government money i urge my fellow members to support h r 6254"], [0.0002473592758178711,

few words about preserving the historic nature of camden the 18th century town of camden occupies an important place in the development of south carolina and the military operations in the south during the american revolu tion historic camdens location along major transportation routes and its relation to other settlements made it a trade center of considerable economic and commercial importance in the 18th century southern colonial development the townsite was laid out by 1774 on a rectangular grid pattern by joseph kershaw the major contributor to the founding and the growth of camden the settlement consisted of small frame structures with the notable exception of the kershaw house which was apparently patterned after a large charleston home the british occupied camden from june of 1780 to may of 1781 during the revolution they constructed five redoubts fortified the powder magazine and jail and palisaded the community and the kershaw house andrew jackson later to become president of the united states was imprisoned at camden from april of 1781 to the end of the british occupation the most intense military activity included the nearby battles of camden and hobkirks hill and the related battles at ninety six cowpens and kings mountain the colonial generals horatio gates nathaniel green baron johann dekalb and the british lord charles cornwallis are among the primary military leaders associated with the town the british retreated in may of 1781 burning the palisaded town in an effort to minimize the sites strategic value the fall of camden as a british stronghold was pivotal to the eventual defeat of the british few vestiges of the once active town remain after the british departure and the town rebuilt to the north after the revolution today the main features of the historic camden area include the site of the 178081 revolutionary war community and several reconstructionstwo redoubts a powder magazine a wooden palisades and the cornwallis
