be here tonight i am grateful for the words of our colleagues earlier congressman gohmert and congresswoman schmidt i appreciate what they have said and you i am really proud to be a part of the official truth squad and while i did not hear all of the comments that were made just prior to our beginning our session here i did want to respond to one thing that you said that is that we all are entitled to our opinions but the facts are the facts and it is important that we get the facts straight here and i think many bf the things that we are responding to are things that have been purported to be facts which are not facts at all and i think it is important that we set the record straight i also noted tonight in the presentation by the blue dog coalition that they are very concerned about the deficit but they want to do away with the tax cuts and spend more money the problem with the deficit is that we are spending too much and we need to cut back on the spending and that is a fundamental issue i think it is pretty much a fundamental law of economics which i do not think can be done away with simply by talking about it i think that we are going to have to come to grips with it as our colleague from ohio was saying it is such a great honor to be able to serve in this house and i want to say that i grew up in a house in western north carolina with no electricity no running water about as poor as anybody you will ever meet and it is a true miracle that someone with my background could come here and represent the 5th district of north carolina and i am in awe every day of the fact that i have this great opportunity and am grateful for it and i think about the way this country was formed and i think it is impor tant that we talk a little bit about that i am troubled that so few people even know the basis of our government people do not know the constitution they do not know the basis of our laws they do not know the historyv of this country and i want to talk some more about that but i know we are not going to have as much time tonight as we had thought we would originally so i am going to make a recommendation of a couple of books which i think are wonderful books to read anything by david mccullough is great i know that he was being quoted earlier i had a chance to read 1776 recently which is the story of the first year of the revolution and it is wonderful and tonight i was reviewing the founding brothers by joseph ellis and he talks a lot about the things that came together to make the united states possible to make the revolution possible and i do want to quote one piece from ellis or maybe a couple of pieces from the book founding brothers i do highly recommend it as something so easy to read but he said no one had ever established a republican government on the scale of the united states and the overwhelming judgment of the most respected authorities was that it could not be done well here we are over 200 years later proving that it can be done butit is our job as representatives of the people to make sure that this wonderful experiment in liberty is sustained and as again our colleague from ohio said it is a great honor to serve here and some people may not know this and i think it is important to know that the only way anybody can serve in the united states house of representatives is to be elected people can be appointed to every other office in the united states but they cannot be appointed to serve in the united states house of representatives one must be elected and we are elected every 2 years and i hope in this course of time as we talk about the principles of this country that we will do something that i do not think people do often enough that is read the constitution i think it is helpful for us to reflect on the constitution and as we talk about the truth squad i want to read two pieces from the constitution tonight and then turn it back to you mr price to conclude our time here but i think so often even the constitution itself is not quoted accurately and i think that part of our job should be to remind the people what the constitution says and how it is the basis for everything else that we do now i am going to read just the preamble to the constitution and by the way i borrowed this from the parliamentarian and i find it interesting that we tie back to mr jefferson and the founding fathers this is in one manual the constitution jeffersons manual and the rules of the house of representatives as i understand it in almost every elected body in the united states they go back to jeffersons manual when there is any dispute on whether the rules apply or not and so i think the fact that we do that is a great tribute to again our founding fathers and particularly mr jefferson and the care he took with these things let me read the preamble we the people of the united states in order to form a more perfect union establish justice ensure domestic tranquility provide for the common defense promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity do ordain and establish this constitution for the united states of america i think that the key words for me here are provide for the common defense that is the role of the federal government that is the number one role of the federal government we do want to promote the general welfare but that is not the primary goal of the federal government it is to provide for the common defense promoting the general welfare can be done in lots of different ways and i have heard some people on the other side say we should change those words around and say provide for the general welfare and promote the common defense i think that that is one of the problems that we are having in our country these days and the other piece of the constitution that i want to read tonight that i think is a part of tying back into our being the official truth squad is amendment 1 to the constitution congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom ofspeech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assembly and to petition the government for a redress of grievances i find that in most days when people want to quote the first amendment they often quote that first phrase and leave out the second phrase and i think that that is so important i think it is a part of tying back again to the truth squad many times you hear people quote congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion that says we should take the words in god we trust off of our money the words under god out of our pledge but what is so important is the second half of that sentence or prohibiting the free exercise thereof unfortunately those who would take away our freedoms are the ones who so often leave off the second half of that phrase and it is extremely important that we not distort the words of the constitution and it is important i think that our truth squad remind people of those words so often and i think we need to do that i hope we will in our sharing things with the people talk more about the constitution and how the truth of the constitution itself has been distorted by some of our colleagues"], [0.9994512242847122, 0.0005487757152877748, 1, "i appreciate

lot of time in subcommittee in full committee and in conferring between our committee on transportation and infrastructure and the energy and commerce committee and with the responsible committee in the other body and we have finally ironed out the details and have a very sound framework for the future the office of pipeline safety has had a very checkered history it has not worked effectively for a very long time and then it had an awakening and it got on the right track again we got the number of inspectors increased funding for the system increased we straightened out the cooperation the coordination between the federal office and the state offices then there was a period of decline now this administration to their great credit has designated the best person in the history of this program to head up the office of pipeline safety though it has a longer title now and that is admiral tom barrett who brings coast guard discipline and a coast guard organization structure and a coast guard safety mindset into the work of this agency which is its principal mission safety admiral barrett from the time he walked on to the property had conversations with me as i am sure he did with chairman young and instilled great confidence in his ability to lead the agency implement the law to give us suggestions on how we can improve the legislative product and give him the tools that the agency needs to carry out its mission effectively and that has certainly been undertaken and to his great credit admiral barrett has done a superb job of leadership for the office of pipeline safety the first hearing i held as chairman of the investigations and oversight subcommittee in 1987 was following a pipeline break and an extraordinary explosion that killed two people in moundsview just outside my congressional district when a gasoline pipeline leaked for days and at 2 oclock in the morning a car passing through with a loose tailpipe hit the pavement caused a spark ignited the whole street and a mother and her daughter were incinerated in the process why because the office of pipeline safety and the pipeline operator were not doing their jobs that is not going to happen casually at least in the future there may be some catastrophic failure of some kind but in place now and with this legislation and thanks to admiral barretts oversight there is a system of safety in place in this agency for that i thank our subcommittee chairman mr petri the ranking member mr defazio our committee staff on both sides and chairman young this may be our last opportunity on the house floor

and i know that everyone that gets up here starts the same way but this is a particularly important issue one that the three of us wish to discuss as scientists or those who have a great interest in science tonights topic is going to be energy you have heard a lot about energy recently worried about the gas prices worried about the energy policy bill that we have worked on in the house and the senate is now studying energy is extremely important but what is most important to me when we are talking about energy or any other issue is to talk about the longterm effects because that is what the people hire us for they elect us to come here and discuss and debate the future of this nation and it is very easy to forget that because we are always caught up in the instantaneous things we do the stuff we have to get done today but the people of this land struggling every day to make a living keep ends together do not have the time to do the longrange thinking corporate leaders are bound by their requirement to produce profits every quarter to get the stock price up it is up to us to really think about where this nation is going and what is really important and what is likely to happen to it so i wish to approach this topic this evening to talk about our energy future where are we now what is energy like what is going to happen in the future and between the three of us discussing this this evening i hope that we can enlighten our colleagues and others who are interested in the topic let me begin by an introductory way just talking about energy and the nature of energy i happen to be a scientist a physicist to be more precise and i have been involved in energy studies for some 30 years but also because of my background in physics i have learned a lot about energy and i would like to tap some of that knowledge to talk about some of the issues and point out some of the characteristics of energy first of all energy is unique unique means there is nothing else like it it is unique in several ways energy is our most basic natural resource e 2100 for one simple reason without it we cannot use our other natural resources now let me give an example of that and to prove my point that energy is our most basic natural resource if you would like to build something out of iron suppose it is a car or a can or whatever the first thing you have to do is dig the iron ore out of the ground that takes energy then you have to transport the ore to the smelting plant and recover the iron out of the ore transportation takes energy smelting it takes energy when you are finished with that you transport it the rolling mill that takes energy and you roll it out into sheet steel so it is easier to work with that takes energy then you transport it to the factory that takes energy finally you fabricate a car or something else out of it and that takes a lot of energy finally you transport the finished product to the consumer which once again takes energy notice that every step of the way you were using energy in order to use other natural resources i could have picked any other natural resource and the same thing would be true so energy is our most basic natural resource you must always remember that but secondly and perhaps even more important energy is a nonrecyclable resource once you use it it is gone now if we use up our iron we could go mine our landfills we can recover scrap iron as we do already to a great extent and we can recycle it over and over and over there is only so much iron on this planet but we can keep using it over and over and over and we are not likely to run out its cost may go up but it is still there but when you use energy it is gone when you fill your tank with gasoline and you drive it for a week and the tank is empty the energy is all gone it is used up where does it go we know energy is conserved but it can change form all the energy from the petroleum you put in your car from the gasoline you use gets consumed and turned into heat energy largely unusable heat energy and eventually that gets radiated out into space and it is gone for us forever so these two important features define a great deal about energy and how we should treat it and how we should handle it finally because of this the price of energy affects our economy more than the price of almost any other resource simply because when the price of energy goes up that price gets added on to every step of the manufacturing process which i mentioned let me mention some other characteristics of energy energy is intangible to most people to me as a scientist it is very tangible i have worked with energy so long i can almost touch it feel it taste it et cetera but to the average person you cannot touch it you cannot see it unless it is light energy you cannot feel it unless it is heat energy you cannot smell it and you cannot taste it so energy is intangible to most people the only tangible aspect of energy is the price at the gas pump or the utility bill at the end of the month because energy is intangible people tend not to understand it they do not know how to use it properly i have a saying i often use and i even have a tie to match the color i am talking about i wish energy were purple because if energy were purple and people could see it their behavior would change when they drive home from the store or from the church and drive up to their house in the middle of winter and see a purple haze oozing through the walls because of poor insulation or purple rivulets around the windows or doors because they are leaking heat they would say man that is terrible i have to insulate this house better i have to seal up the windows and doors more because they do not see it it is not purple so they cannot see it they are not aware of this if you were driving down the highway and a little toyota prius or some other hybrid car goes by something like the gentleman from maryland drives and he may discuss that a little later this evening and this little prius goes by and there is just a little purple around it because it does not use much energy but then a hummer or a large suv goes by and there is a purple cloud around it if people could see it they would say hey i am going to get a prius or some other hybrid car and use less energy so i wish energy was purple so it would be tangible to everyone i think behaviors would change very quickly to show the importance of energy i would like to point out that energy affects civilization in a very direct way because energy represents the ability to do work that in fact is the definition of work in physics energy represents the ability to do work with the first use of nonhuman energy in other words using animals to plow the fields and so forth we had the agricultural revolution beginning we talk about these big revolutions in the hurflan history and the agricultural revolution is a large one there is no contention about that but the agriculture revolution occurred only after we started using nonhuman energy because people were not strong enough to really do a good job of pulling plows before they had plows that they could pull people tried agriculture and it never really succeeded until they discovered they could domesticate oxen or other animals and have them do their work and then the agriculture revolution succeeded the next big step was again related to energy you have heard of the industrial revolution where we began using industry to manufacture things and to replace human labor what did we use fossil fuels coal first and then oil and eventually natural gas so the first use of nonanimal energy led to the industrial revolution once again this indicates how important energy is to life on this planet and to civilization and to our economy i have drawn here on this chart a model for responsible energy use trying to relate it to something that everyone understands when you talk about your money you go out and get a job because you need to eat and you would like to have a house and a car so you get a job and you earn money that is income and most people in this country have to live within their income that is what everyone aspires to sometimes there are special needs and you dip into your savings and some are fortunate enough to inherit some money so that is the model of individual use of money now you can look at energy the same way if you look at the income of energy on our planet most of it comes from solar energy we talk a lot about using biomass that is energy from the sun captured by plants and we can try to retrieve the solar energy from that wind energy lots of efforts to build windmills and use wind energy once again that energy comes from the sun because the sun differentially heats the atmosphere and that causes the wind to blow how about hydropower huge dams generating lots of electricity for us once again that is solar energy because the sun evaporates the water off the oceans and the lakes gets into the clouds and comes down as rain collects behind the dams and we use that energy waves are also related to solar energy because that powers the wind which generates the waves and people have tried to extract that energy the only one on this list that is income energy but not from the sun is from the moon and that is the tidal energy and efforts have been made to tap that but it is pretty tough to do and you do not get a lot of energy out of it what about the savings our savings account are all the fossil fuels coal oil and natural gas those are stored solar energy that comes from plants which grew many many many many years ago those plants eventually got covered up and over the years decayed and turned into coal petroleum natural gas then there is wood which is also a shortterm savings account again it is plant it really could go up in biomass here but trees live a long time so i put it down here in our savings account because normally we do not use all that energy in our lifetime finally our inheritance that is energy we inherited with this planet our universe and our planet were so beautifully created and there are energy sources within the planet there may be more than i have listed but certainly geothermal energy heat energy within the earth can be used to drive power plants and already is in certain parts of california and other parts of the world and nuclear energy nuclear energy is so long term and it is basically there from the creation of the earth so nuclear energy i would also classify as an inheritance now i would propose that when we are using energy we should treat it the same way we do our money try to live within our income in other words try to use as much as we can of the solar energy lunar energy and so forth recognize we have to dip into our savings account and so we can use the fossil fuels and wood for that but not to the extent we are using it now so that we use it all up unless we use that to develop new energy resources for our children and grandchildren and finally the inheritance that is a longterm thing but we do not want to depend totally on it but certainly that is there and that is a very promising thing to pursue finally i hope as a result of the discussion we have tonight that all of us in this congress and all the people of this country will come to appreciate energy it is my hope that a better understanding of energy will lead to a wiser use of it by our citizens and so that is the theme of this hours discussion we are going to have tonight i have been joined by several colleagues and next i would like to yield to my colleague the gentleman from maryland"], [0.00030410289764404297, 0.500304102897644, 0, "i thank the gentleman for yielding everybody has been thanked on the floor

our forests we do need the funding for firefighting and so forth but i will tell you that taking it out of the nea is the wrong place in the bill they have done a tremendous job under the chairmanship of gioia they have brought the nea back to what we originally intended it to be and that is a means of getting the arts out to the rest of america to rural america particularly and if you will look at some of the programs that they have their masters program and the shakespeare program and others they have done a great job of getting the rest of rural america exposed to those types of things that is what the nea is all about and yes there is private organizations that fund a lot of these but oftentimes it is in conjunction with private and public financing sometimes they just finance a very small portion of it so i think that while i agree with the gentlemens intent in terms of fire protection taking the money out of the nea which is substantially below what it was in its high peak as was mentioned i think is the wrong direction to go and would set this program back when it is moving in the direction that we all hope it will go i appreciate the gentlemans amendment but i will be

country so incredibly well we are a nation of freedom because of the hard work and sacrifice of veterans everywhere and every day of my life i think of my father and others who have served this great country with distinction we are a free nation and we are winning the battles because of the bravery of our active duty reservistd but it is the veteran who has brought honor to the flag behind the speakers well and it is the veteran who has made it possible for us to be the free and proud nation we are today at 12 45 i will go to the board of veterans appeals on a case that is vitally important to a person in my district and that is almon scott i have never personally gone to the board of appeals level for any veteran personally my staff has worked tirelessly diana robins in my district fighting for veterans but this is a unique case almon scott served this nation during vietnam he was asked to guard a base where we believe there were potential radioactive materials almon scott is dying now of cancer a cancer largely linked with radioactive material almon scott has been shunted aside if you will by a system that suggests somehow his ailments are not related to his tour of duty unfortunately he is notentitled to his records they have been sealed so mr scott cannot even prove his case which is why i have taken this extraordinary opportunity to testify on his behalf he is in stuart florida today and cannot travel because of his illness his illness is serious and it is possibly close from what i understand to the end of his life what we are hoping to do today is to give al scott justice we are hoping that they recognize his valiant efforts at service and that the final measure of devotion to this nation is he did what he was told now they will not tell him what he was guarding subsequent facts have indicated there may have been nuclear or other kinds of biologicaltype weaponry stored at the site he was requested to guard at the end of his tour of duty he was told to go home and remain silent about what he did at that time he honored that contract with america now i am hoping today as i approach the board of veterans appeal not as a lawyer not as a congressman but as a fellow american that almon scotts plea for justice will be heard and that those hearing his appeal will look at his case specifically and recognize that the right thing to do for this veteran

are seeing here is a basic difference between the two political parties ten years ago almost to the date i stood in this well as well as members from the other side of the aisle coming to this floor to speak and the subject at that time was welfare reform and what split us at that time what split us was because the republicans had faith in the human spirit we heard time after time speaker after speaker came to that podium right over there to my right and said women and children were going to be sleeping on grates the reason is you had no faith in the hupan spirit you had no faith that those that were poor wanted to do better as a result we created jobs we created many many jobs now you are showing that same skepticism with regard to what is going to happen if you let people keep more of their own money nearly 60 percent of those who are going to benefit by the capital gains rate being at 15 percent and also the dividend tax on dividends at 15 percent almost 60 percent earn incomes under 100 000 and what are these people doing what is happening they are reinvesting it in american business because they believe in the capitalistic system it is working we have one of the lowest unemployment rates in the entire world the rate of 4 7 percent is lower than it was throughout the 1970s 1980s and 1990s when i first came to congress 26 years ago we thought between 5 and 6 percent was a target for full employment we have shattered that myth now it is 4 7 why because we have faith in the system of capitalism which we embra6e through this bill people will reinvest their money

up a unified force in this country we are aiding and abetting the enemy when we stress our division of course we are going to disagree that is healthy that is what democracy is all about but on some

electoral sysitem and we need to prosecute to the fullest extent of the law anyone who does violate that and we have to make sure that we base our laws on the evidence and documented facts that are out there the reality is that while we know that there are isolated cases of voter abuse it does not amount to what this majority is trying to make us believe that we must now disenfranchise thousands if not millions of american citizens from the ability to vote simply to tackle what we hear are anecdotal stories about people who may have abused the process it may not be an intended consequence but it certainly is an inescapable consequence that this bill will disenfranchise many americans who are citizens and wish to vote it will also amount to a poll tax as we have heard nearly 75 percent of americans do not have a passport it costs about 100 to get one in many parts of our country especially in the south we have many elderly african americans and a number of native americans throughout our country who were born at home or under the care of midwives who never received a birth certificate approximately 6 to 10 percent of the american electorate does not have any form of state identification african americans are four to five times less likely than whites to have photo identification and finally in georgia 36 percent of its voters over the age of 75 do not have governmentissued photo ids isolated cases of abuse must be addressed but this bill does not do that it takes a meat axe to try to deal with the problem and if you do not believe me then talk to the folks who were victims of the katrina hurricane who lost everything including any type of personal identification how do they tackle the problem of trying to go vote and only being given 48 hours to
