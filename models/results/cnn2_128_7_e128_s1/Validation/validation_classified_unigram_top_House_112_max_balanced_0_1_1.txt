which still leaves that fund above its fiscal year 2011 funding level let me point out to you why this is the wise thing to do in response to the deepwater horizon explosion and the resulting oil spill last year in may the administration issued a temporary moratorium halting permits of oil and gas production on the outer continental shelf the moratorium was lifted in october of last year but since then the issuance of permits has been slow president obama directed boemre to reorganize itself into two independent groups one that handles revenue from oil and gas leasing and the other that regulates the oil and gas industry this is all a change that most of us believe is necessary and wise however the speed of permitting activity has not returned to predeepwater horizon levels there is a significant and growing backlog of drilling plans pending approval the number of pending deepwater exploration and development plans has increased by more than 250 percent this is up from a historical average of 18 plans pending to now nearly 65 pending approval also theres a drastic decline in drilling permit approvals deepwater exploration and development drilling permit approvals have also declined by approximately 80 percent down from an average of nearly 160 per year to a pace of only 30 per year shallow water exploration and development drilling permits approvals have also dropped by nearly 50 percent from an average of 390 per year to a pace of fewer than 180 a year i will tell you that there was a recent study that showed that increasing the pace of permitting and subsequently the pace and scale of investment in the gulf would create 230 000 domestic jobs in 2012 as well as more than 44 billion in unitedstates gross domestic product i just want to focus on that number for a second because as we have been here for the 112th congress the american people have been demanding that we use the money we have efficiently so that we can invest in the american people

of the tennessee senate for probably an inordinate amount of years before i graduated to this august body it took me 24 years to matriculate but during those 24 years i worked on much important legislation to help the people of tennessee one of the things i helped the people in tennessee with is i wrote the right to carry bill in tennessee the fact is this was a difficult bill to pass it was a difficult bill to craft there were people with different opinions of what should be in the bill and we debated it we went back and forth on what should be in it we took votes and certain things passed and certain failed and we came up with a bill we thought was a good bill i always felt that people who could take a gun and have enough vision and calmness of hand and hit a target at some pace not have a criminal record and pass a written test of limited challenge should have a right to carry a gun in fact in tennessee very few people with the right to carry a gun have committed crimes and used their guns improperly but the fact is we worked on this law and we had certain restrictions and one of the restrictions is you had to be 21 years of age the same age that you have to be to buy a beer or to drink and 36 other states came to that same decision that you should be 21 before you can get a permit to carry a gun eight states have differed alabama delaware indiana iowa maine montana new hampshire and south dakota so youve got a southern state in there youve got an eastern state a couple of big tens a couple out in the big sky world and some in the east and they decided you only had to be 18 those eight states this bill if passed would tell the citizens in those 37 states and the legislators in those 37 states that argued and determined that 21 was the right age that it would be the right age in your state for the people who are residents of your state but if somebody from one of those other eight states came into your state and was less than 21 they could carry a gun when your citizens couldnt because their state decided 18 was sufficient your laws made no difference and youd have teenagers carrying guns in states that had determined that it was not the appropriate age twentyone is the right age to drink and im not submitting that it should be less at this time but the fact is the brain doesnt really develop to a certain extent until youre out of your teens and that is why much of the crime and the violent crime is committed by people 18 to 20 they are only 5 percent of the population but 20 percent of the homicides in violent crime are committed by people from 18 to 20 and if you pass this bill youll have people 18 to 20 going into states and having a right to carry a gun when the citizens of that state wont have it that makes no sense in 2007 the most recent year in which we have data there were 13 000 people who lost their lives in this country to accidents involving alcohol but there were 31 000 people over twice as many who lost their lives because of gunfire it doesnt make sense that we would not only trample on the laws of the different states but also the work of the legislators such as me who worked hard within the legislative bodies within the giveandtake of senate and house and conference committees to come up with what we thought was the policy of our state to have that overridden by the folks here in this united states house of representatives the senate would be concurring to pass a bill to say your laws make no difference and 18 and 19 and 20yearolds from alabama and south dakota and maine and new hampshire are going to be able to come in your state and carry a gun when your citizens wont be able it should be up to each of the states to decide that and what were getting to is the lowest common denominator which isnt right so the fact is these laws should be left up to the states the states right now can have reciprocity agreements tennessee didnt have one when we passed our bill in 1996 but in 2003 they got one but the state of tennessee decided on its reciprocity not the united states congress and states have reciprocity agreements and theyre all going to be overridden some are more liberal than otherstennessee is the most liberalbut other states have got restrictions theyre all going to be set aside because of this i would hope that the members who come from the 37 states that require your citizens to be 21 would not allow people under 21 to come into your state and have teenagers who are most likely to commit crimes with guns to come into your state with a concealedcarry permit"],

were key in carrying out this operation thats something that theyre very proud of that the communication that thewe use the word synergy a lot but people came together on many different levels and quite honestly its something that probably would not have been possible quite a number of years ago but it is today and i think that its something i hope that our enemy is paying attention to because

balanced budget amendment i came down to the floor of the house this afternoon with some prepared comments spent some time putting it together and wanted to make sure that it was right had help from my staff but im going to go a little bit off script today as ive listened to my colleagues speak on this very important issue theyve covered much of what we want to say with the historical context with what thomas jefferson our founder said what abraham lincoln talked aboutabout government being by the people instead i think im going to talk about my experience here in congress as my friend just mentioned im a new member as a matter of fact right around this day today ive been here 10 months ive never served in congress before never served in an elected capacity before i ran a small roofing company in kaukauna wisconsin i have to tell you that im struck that were at this place in history when i look at our national debt and you look at it on a chart and on a curve from 1787 to 2011 from about 1787 to 1940 1945 that line is almost indecipherable from zero then as you go on and you get to the late 2000s that line begins to turn up and now in the last 3 years that line is nearly vertical as our national debt continues to explode and that debt has to be paid ive told high school students and college students back in wisconsin where im from that theres a reckoning coming for them there will be a date and time certain that this bill will have to be paid and yet as ive worked here ive just discovered that for whatever reason whether its partisan bickering or pure ideological differences that we cannot it seems find agreement on controlling our national debt and our deficits annual deficits just a few years ago the deficit was only 160 billion as we heard from my colleague from alabama the last 3 years its been over 1 trillion each and every year something clearly has changed and we would like to say that its changed in our economy i would propose to you sir that maybe it has changed in our government at some point i call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle my friends that are republicans and democrats alike it is time to put the sword down we cannot in fact we must not allow this type of spending to continue so that our children my grandchildren your children and grandchildren will have to pay this bill a bill that they did not make and a bill that they should not owe so i stand before you today challenging my colleagues to consider a better path forward one that we use in our families one that we use in our businesses one that 49 states use in their state governments and that is a balanced budget amendment to the united states constitution just the other day i was standing right over where my colleague was and is standing right now and i had a copy of the internal revenue code its nearly 10 000 pages of fine print an amendment to the constitution will be just a few words and its a simple thing but most importantly the amendment to the constitution that would call for a balanced budget allows the american people not just through their representatives here in congress which we clearly have seen is not going to solve the problem but allows the american people to finally have a say through the ratification process i had a telephone town hall recently with 15 000 americans on the line i did a poll and i asked them how many of you would support a balanced budget amendment to the united states constitution requiring the government to live within its means over 80 percent of those respondents said that they would support this i want you to know that millions of families and businesses every day live under the constraint of a balanced budget as a father as a former small business owner and now as a member of congress i have a different perspective on this whole thing and the perspective is that we must must move forward with this as a father i tried to teach my children the value of hard work the importance of saving for the future and not spending more than they earn as a business owner i operated my company that same way and now as a member of congress i recognize that these ideas that many of us i would dare say the majority of americans hold true is just as good for their government and so if a balanced budget in your family in your business in your church and in your community and your state makes sense it clearly makes sense here the reckless spending will never stop i believe without it there will neither be the political will nor the courage to do so since washington has proven itself incapable of doing this job its time that we let the people the citizens of america have a voice so that they can force their government to act responsibly i call on my colleagues to pass a balanced budget amendment to the united states constitution through this chamber the united states senate and then send it back to the people where they will finally have their voice heard"],

important to note what this bill does not include during conference negotiations unnecessary provisions limiting the work of military chaplains were dropped now the bill will allow the repeal of dont ask dont tell to proceed so that troops who defend our values will have protections that they have fought to defend working with the white house our committee achieved a final compromise on detainees that does not grant broad new authority for the detention of unitedstates citizens and does not establish a new authority for indefinite detention of terrorists the bill strikes a reasonable balance between protecting our nation from terrorists like those who attacked our nation on september the 11th and protecting our american values it demonstrates that we do not need to sacrifice our civil liberties to be safe finally i urge members to support this legislation because it also includes a pay raise for our troops and provides funds for the care needed to recover from the wounds of war the

hear that the necessity of it from all transportation officials all over the country including my own state and in my own district without the ability to plan over the course of several yearsnot 3 months not 17 monthsthat lack of certainty has increased the operating costs it increases cost uncertainty and that is the death knell for critical infrastructure projects in this economy as my colleagues have noted transportation reauthorization bills are typically bipartisan affairs unfortunately we dont have a bipartisan bicameral agreement on a viable longterm reauthorization yet but the passage of this brief extension gives us the opportunity to once again bring both sides to the table to try to work out a collaborative effort and a collaborative solution to this problem i think
