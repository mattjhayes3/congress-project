question bafore us today is do we want to cut taxes for the ultrasuperrich or instead do we first want to give hardworking americans a raise do we want to live in an aristocracy or do we want to live in a democracy do we want to perpetuate wealth or reward work the estate tax is central to our democracy it is rooted in our commitment to create a strong and vibrant middle class and to give every american the opportunity to achieve the american dream after the gilded age in which the elites of the time held power and wealth that far far far outstripped what the average american had america decided to go in a new direction one of americas great republican presidents theodore roosevelt made the argument for an estate tax saying that the really big fortune the swollen fortune by the mere fact of its size acquires qualities which differentiate it in its kind as well as its degree from what is possessed by men of relatively small means therefore president theodore roosevelt said i believe in a graduated tax on big fortunes properly safeguarded against evasion democrats believe that we must create wealth we recognize that that we must reward entrepreneurship and risk and we must encourage hard work that is why democrats supported a targeted estate tax relief for small businesses and farmers and fami lies that would ensure 99 7 percent of all americans dont pay any estate tax this is in the spirit of theodore roosevelt targeting the vast fortunes that differ not only in the quantity of wealth but in the kind i salute congressman earl pomeroy for his leadership in giving congress an alternative that is morally and fiscally responsible unfortunately once again the republican leadership just as they have blocked a vote on the minimum wage are blocking mr pomeroys option to bring his proposal to the floor which is responsible which is paid for and which is fair to all americans under mr pomeroys proposal only the top 3 percent that means 99 7 percent of americans most people in america would not pay any estate tax but it would leave that 3 percent the very very superwealthy to pay their fair share there are very few people involved but a great deal of money we will have a chance to vote on it in the motion to recommit unfortunately we will not have the time to debate it as an alternative we have these questions that have come before us when we are talking about this we are talking about giving 800 billion to a few families in america democrats stand for fiscal responsibility payasyougo budgets and no new deficit spending republicans instead have put forth the bill that will cost the american people again almost 800 billion 800 billion that we dont have that we are going to have to borrow our national debt is becoming a national security issue countries that now own our debt it is over 1 trillion already and this doesnt include this 800 billion those countries that now own our debt will not only be making our toys our clothes and our computers they will be soon making our foreign policy they have too much leverage over us with this bill today the republicans are giving tax cuts to the wealthy and asking the middle class to pay for it by writing checks to china and japan for the interest payments on the debt and ultimately the payment on principal it isridiculous it is ridiculous let me get this straight we are at war in iraq many of the same people who wanted to support the staythecourse that the president is on in iraq which has around a 400 billion price tag on it that is off budget they dont want to pay for that and that is a huge figure and now the republicans are saying not only that not only are we not paying for the war it is off budget we will just heap that debt on to future generations they are saying we are going to give twice as much as that to a few families in america it is so unfair this same week that we are taking this up as i said earlier this is the ultimate values debate how can a person of conscience say to the congress we do not support an increase in the minimum wage instead we are going to give 800 billion to the wealthiest people in america the minimum wage is 5 15 an hour it hasnt been raised in 9 years this is a shame it is a disgrace it is unfair and what does the leader on the republican side say about the minimum wage mr boehner says i have been in this business for 25 years and i have never voted for an increase in the minimum wage i am opposed to it and i think the vast majority of the republican conference is opposed to it so thank you mr boehner for making a differentiation for us you are for 800 billion for the wealthiest families in america and not an increase of over 5 15 an hour for americas working families so instead of giving 7 millionamericans a raise by increasing the minimum wage again the republicans are proposing 800 billion that is nearly 1 trillion as a gift to the wealthy this is robin hood in reverse we are stealing from the middle class to give to the wealthy pope benedict just recently put out his new encyclical god is love and in his encyclical he quoted saint augustine when he wrote this is in the popes encyclical you can find it there he talked

this budget is dishonest by omission and dishonest in how it portrays the overall budget projections the president claims that the steep budget cuts he advocates are necessary to cut the deficit in half in 5 years this is simply not true and the budget the president proposes fails to accomplish his stated goal first the budget is dishonest by omission nowhere in the fy06 budget does the president account for significant costs including fails to account for the enormous costs of privatizing social security as proposed by the president a whopping 6 trillion over the next 20 years 754

wound the president inherited a record annual surplus of 236 billionwhich now 4 years later has tanked into a deficit in excess of 400 billion any attempt at honest accounting suggests that we are looking at a decade or more of similar deficits the reason we are faced with an unethical budget is because the president refuses to acknowledge the fiscal irresponsibility of his choices and will not entertain even the most moderate suggestions such as repealing only the portion of the tax cuts that benefit the top 1 percent of taxpayers unfortunately this budget builds on a disturbing trend this administration and the leadership in congress appear to be intent on valuing wealth over work thereby placing working families at a distinct disadvantage the tax policies the president advocates disproportionately advantage the wealthiest to the detriment of working americans and working families will continue to bear the brunt of the rising inflation spurred by the rising interest rates the bill gates of the world pocketed their tax cut at the insistence of the president however this president sees no problem eliminating funding for perkins loans in his budget even though the cost of tuition is rising and will continue to rise as the administrations policies force inflation as a result of the decision to eliminate perkins this year more than 670 000 student borrowers could lose out on loan forgiveness if they become teachers law enforcement officers or if they serve in the military this is just one of many examples of valuing wealth over work in my district the budget scales back and eliminates several longterm shore protection projects important to the safety and economic security of long island the president has no problem zeroing out the fire island to montauk point

of his promise under the no child left behind bill even though this means that taxpayers will have to foot the bill at the local level to pay for education finally the president does not seem to mind

i have spent 30plus years assisting clients in dealing with our very complicated very convoluted federal income tax code whether it is individually or corporations or other businesses any system that is based on a fair concept is flawed because what is fair to one per sons view is not necessarily fair to somebody elses point of view when you base a public policy this broad and expansive and quite frankly invasive on fairness then you set yourself up for a constant argument and constant battle about what is and is not fair clearly your chart shows a differential between the wealthiest folks in this country and the folks that are on their way up to hopefully becoming the wealthiest in this country certainly they have got that opportunity with hard work and applying themselves to that so i would just like to point out that maybe we need a different system maybe sometime next year let us have this conversation about a different way to collect the minimum amount of money needed to fund this federal government and we will have that conversation i would like to comment though on health care and individual responsibility i think it is universally recognized and that is a hard thing to state with a straight face but i think it is universally recognized that americans enjoy the finest health care delivery system in the world you yourself have been an integral part of that as an orthopedic surgeon and your wife i believe is an anesthesiologist members of the delivery system that this country enjoys we have got a flawed payment system and i am not sure how we got to this point and place but we are here we have got a system that if you ran your car insurance program the same way we run health insurance then each time you needed to change the oil in your car or new tires you would file an insurance claim that is not how we work our cars we figure out a way to operate our automobiles out of our normal monthly budget we budget for that and take care of those incidentals we do have car insurance for the catastrophes for wrecks for destruction and theft those kinds of things those catastrophic deals our health care system is flawed in that quite frankly i get the services you provide me the services and someone else pays for those services in that scheme i am not as concerned about the cost of those services as i ought to be because i am not writing a check to help out with that so i have no incentives so to speak to ask you are there alternatives to what you have proposed is there another way to do this or cheaper way can we do it at some other hospital that can be a little less expensive than the one you typically practice at because i am writing those checks getting personal responsibility back into the health care system getting a system in which i have a viable interest in asking that question we may ask that question on every other single thing that we do how much is that going to cost we may not ask it out loud but we make a costbenefit analysis each time in our head each time we make a purchase on something such as how do i want to pay for that we do not do that in medicine and it needs to be communicated to all of us that that is okay to do in medicine there are some things in medicine you do not ask emergency or catastrophic kinds of things you go get that thing there is an awful lot of medicine that i think is subject to a circumstance where we can ask what that costs and i think just doing that would begin to drive down those costs as the example i went for an annual checkup a year or so ago and had an issue the physician said well i can prescribe a course of antibiotics that is about 300 a month and 3 months from now that condition will clear up i have got a prescription drug card so it was going to cost me 15 or whatever i said 900 he said yeah i said well what happens if i do not do that he said in about 3 months it will clear up i made a costbenefit analysis and decided that i would forgo the antibiotic treatment and go with the professional judgment it was my decision i need to stand behind that decision and if 3 months later my condition had gottenworse and i had other problems that may have been fixed if i had taken a different tack i cannot go back on the doctor or should not and sue the doctor or the pharmacy or whatever sue anybody that is still breathing because of a decision that i made personal responsibility is not only taking responsibility for paying for health care but also reclaiming your health care decisions because those are yours you are responsible for that and you yourself know there will be the occasional bad outcome to any procedure to any field and that is just nature doctors are not perfect or hospitals none of us are those legitimate just bad outcomes is just the system and we ought to take personal responsibility for that i had several doctor clients and to a person if they did something wrong if they created an issue or made something that aggravated something with a patient they were going to fix it period no matter what it was but in many instances they used their absolute best professional judgment to treat a patient and they just got a bad outcome that is life so this personal responsibility issue that i am talking about is decisions for what health care you do get or you do not get and the costs i think the health savings accounts that we have instituted in certain instances will help us do that so that putting away money in a health savings account if you have a normal monthly kind of an expense come up i have to decide do i take that money out of my health savings account that is growing or do i figure out a way to do it out of this months budget or my normal operating budget so bringing that personal discipline back to the table in the arena of health care is not the absolute overall magic bullet but it is a piece of the fix that is health care costs i appreciate this opportunity to share this hour with the gentleman and i

the opportunity to visit langley air force base in virginia and spend time with the commander of the air combat command lieutenant general william fraser and many dedicated indeed dedicated members of the united states air force as part of the air force caucus trip we had almost 50 people participating in the trip much of this trip focused on the f a22 raptor and its importance to the future of the united states air force after visiting with general fraser and seeing the raptor up close i am more convinced and i think the participants who went on this trip are also convinced that the f a22 will become an integral part of future military successes during my visit i was briefed not only about the warfighting capabilities of this plane but about the maintenance program as well the air force uses cuttingedge technology to maintain this plane and this of course leads to more efficient maintenance it is the first jet to use an entirely paperless maintenance program allowing new parts to be ordered or changes to be made significantly faster the engine also utilizes new technologies its design allows it to be worked on while still on the plane that is the engine in the past engines often needed to be removed in order to be maintained this is not the case for the f a22 these new technologies mean less time in the shop and of course more time in the air also the maintenance training program has been improved no longer are there these big bulky maintenance manuals the training is digital in realtime with realworld conditions it leads to more effective and efficient training maintainers spend less time in training and more time actually working on the plane this of course leads to faster maintenance and thus the f a22s are not grounded for longer than is necessary in the past and particularly in the postseptember 11 environment homeland security has been our top priority here in congress and our nation the f a22 plays a large role in protecting the homeland according to the air force 238 legacy fighters would be required and needed to protect this homeland while only 150 f a22s would be needed the bush administration unfortunately has proposed cutting 10 billion from the f a22 program over the next5 years leaving enough to buy 183 of the 381 planes the air force says it needs simply put in my judgment this number is just not sufficient the air force will not be able to guarantee air superiority without a sufficient quantity of f a22s the unitedstates has not lost a soldier due to an air attack since 1952 the air force has made air superiority look so easy that we have begun to take it for granted but maintaining this air dominance is not easy for now the united states air force is the best trained the best equipped in the world but russia china india have made huge strides in achieving parity and in some cases have even surpassed unitedstates capabilities our current but badly aging fighters no longer enjoy technological or aerodynamic superiority when compared to the modern aircraft of potential adversaries there have been some recent exercises pitting the f15s which the f a22 raptor will replace against one of russias primary export fighters resulting in kill ratios favoring the suin contrast on a recent training mission where a single f a22 went against five f15s the raptor killed all the f15s within 3 minutes additionally due to a lack of stealth assets the ability of our aircraft to operate in environments where hostile threats exist is inadequate the only way to address these shortcomings which will only worsen i tell my colleagues is with sufficient numbers of the f a22 raptor we cannot fight tomorrows war with yesterdays equipment that is why america needs the raptor with a variety of internal weapons the raptor can destroy or negate the most capable future threats advance fighters surfacetoair missile systems and highvalue mobile ground targets the f a22s combination of speed stealth and integrated avionics bring unmatched capabilities to cope with the 21stcentury threat environment air dominance gives the joint force freedom from attack freedom to maneuver and of course freedom to succeed no substitute exists for the f a22s unique capabilities with the international proliferation of sophisticated aircraft and air defense systems unitedstates fighters are losing their ability to leverage access for unitedstates forces in hostile regions the f a22 changes this equation with its revolutionary design and potent array of systems that is why we need to fully fund the f a22 raptor over the next 5

the majority leader senator frist csponsored by senator reid the minority leader senators lugar and biden and a bipartisan group totaling 32 senators and adopted unanimously on january 27 our colleague representative roslehtinen of florida has worked with me and other members of the house committee on international relations including our distinguished ranking democrat the gentleman from california mr lantos on this resolution she has updated the text of the senate resolution in the light of recent events and in the light of the understanding that we in the house have about irans actions and intentions this house may be divided on precisely how to respond to every aspect of the iranian challenge but we are certainly united as our vote will show in our support for the current efforts to bring the weight of the security council of the united nations to bear against irans continuing violations of its formal and informal obligations concerning its nuclear activities these efforts are not only american efforts but ones which involve many responsible members of the international community the administration deserves credit for coaxing some of the reluctant states to this point the international atomic energy agency iaea has indeed reported to the security council on the iranian nuclear program although the iaea may make additional reports during the next month the die is cast the security council is in a position to take action and it should do so it should respond to what is clearly a threat to international peace and securityand making such responses in a collective way is precisely the purpose it is meant to serve the administration deserves credit for having brought along the iaea board of oo ernors and in particular all of the permanent members of the security council to this stage in the process the signal to iran could not have been more stark critical to arriving at this point was the support extended by the bush administration for the socalled ed3 process in which britain france and germany conducted negotiations with irannegotiations that ultimately failed to contain irans efforts to be sure but which succeeded in keeping the international community moving forward in unison at this point we need to continue to keep the pressure on but let us keep the pressure on the recalcitrant partythe iraniansand not begin internecine warfare among the western powers it is only with the cooperation of other states that we can truly pressure iran as we consider other legislation in the next monthsand the consideration of this resolution does not in my mind prejudice the ability of the house to consider other legislationwe should bear in mind that we need allies in this struggle sticking our finger in the eye of other states which are in general terms on our side will do nothing to bring iran to heel another reason to work with our friends is that if the security council does not achieve consensus on how to deal with iran we will need to work with them to arrive at a plan b as an alternative that plan should consist in all likelihood of a series of comprehensive economic and diplomatic sanctions those sanctions should be designed to serve several purposes first they should make it clear to the iranian people that their leaders course of action needs to change second they should serve to inflict some pain on the iranian leadership in an effort to coerce those leaders to behave in a responsible way finally they should reduce the resources availableto the iranian state to continue their nuclear weapons program in summary this is an important resolution it indicates quite clearly that we are behind the administrations approach i hope that we will continue to support it in the days ahead"],

probably more than a third of them have some kind of a disease that might be able to be benefited by embryonic stem cell research that is true of the figures in the country we have 110 million people who have illnesses out of the 290 million people who are living here they have visited my office they have visited your offices there is not a person in this room who has not had many many visits by people who have very very serious needs whose lives are going to be shortened i am all for the first bill we debated today because i think it might help somewhat but i have also looked at some statistics and i have come to realize that of the 15 leading diseases adult stem cells cannot do anything about 14 of them and can do a only little bit about heart diseases as they deal with only blood diseases in terms of what they can do embryonic stem cell research has the ability perhaps to do much more than that people are going to get up and they are going to say well it hasnt done anything yet they were only discovered about 62 years ago if you read the vast body of research in the united states of america on this subject by people who are truly knowledgeable you are going to learn there is more potential here than anything that has ever happened in medicine in the history of the united states of america congress should never ever turn its back on this opportunity how are we going to get there how are we going to do embryonic stem cell research i do not have time to go through the whole in vitro fertilization process except to say that we create embryos in that particular process they are then frozen they are generally used and well used the 400 000 embryos which are out there to help give birth to people who might not otherwise be able to have a child but at the end of the process a decision is made by the individuals that may be involved with that if the decision is they no longer want that particular embryo they may do a variety of things with it they may as has been discussed here give it up for adoption they may decide to have it discarded as hospital waste that is where the vast almost all of them actually go as hospital waste we want to give them the opportunity to say within that embryo there are stem cells which could help other people live better lives and give them the opportunity to be able instead of having it put in a bag for hospital waste sitting at that table to be put over here and the state to be able to do the research that is what we need to do we need to be able to develop that as rapidly as we possibly can for the benefit of all mankind i rise today im support of h r 810 the stem cell research enhancement act i have been in public office for over 30 years and throughout my career ijust like all of youhave had the opportunity to change and improve public policy so this country may continue to flourish on the principles it was founded and the 820 000 people i represent in the state of delaware are a constant reminder to me of this responsibility i am their voice in the congress of the united states some of you may be wondering why i have become so interested and involved in embryonic stem cell research and frankly the answer is simplethose 800 000 constituents we estimated that aboutonehalf of all visits to my office are about health care and about onehalf of those visits are by delawareans who are suffering themselves or whose family members are sufferingfrom juvenile diabetes alzheimers cancer parkinsons hiv and hosts of other dredge diseases year by year the groups would grow in number and soon we would have to get bigger rooms for our meetings in the early years we would discuss the necessity of funding the national institutes of health and i was proud to be able to support newt gingrich and the republican partys drive to double funding for the nih and that funding has gone toward the basic science needed to find cures and treatments to our most debilitating diseases but in the past few years the number one topic on these groups minds was embryonic stem cell research one little girl stands out in mind i met her a few months ago at an event back in delaware olivia was two months old when she was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes her parents were first time parents so it is no wonder that the practice of testing her blood sugar and giving her insulin shots was extremely heartbreaking olivia is now 6 and has never known life without diabetes she is the person we are fighting for on the floor today she is one of 110 million people who are suffering that may be helped by stem cell research i remember very clearly the difficult decision president bush made on august 9 2001 and i know how careful he was to balance the needs of science with his own moral concerns at the time the compromiseto allow federal funding for research on embryonic stem cells lines that had already been derivedseemed quite reasonable but as we know unfortunately the number of lines eligible for research once as high as 78is now only at 22 with the nih saying the number of lines will never get above 23 so when diana degette and i began discussing how to expand the presidents policy in an ethical manner i went right back to the speech he gave to the nation in 2001 we wanted to be as consistent as possible with the ethics he laid out in his speech as we worked to update the policy the legislation we are going to vote on today h r 810 the stem cell research enhancement act which has the backing of the medical groups the scientists the research universities and the patient advocacy groups mirrors the presidents ethical requirements i will read them to you and ask that you think about them very closely 1 embryos used to derive stem cells were originally created for fertility treatment purposes and are in excess of clinical need 2 the individuals seeking fertility treatments for whom the embryos were created have determined that the embryos will not be implanted in a woman and will otherwise be discarded and 3 the individuals for whom the embryos were created have provided written consent for embryo donation and without receiving financial inducement you may ask what is differentwe simply lift the arbitrary august 9 2001 date it is also critical that we are clear about what this legislation does not do 1 no federal funding for the destruction of embryos or human life this is prohibited by law 2 no federal funding for the creation of embryos for research under our legislation it is up to the couple to decide what should happen to their embryos embryos can be adopted or donated embryos can be frozen for future family building embryos can be discarded after that initial decision is made and if a couple decides to discard the embryos our legislation would allow those couples to make a second choice do they want to donate them to research an embryo or blastocyst is about 250 cells and the inner cell mass is about 100 cells and that is where the stem cells come from they are created in a petri dish are about 5 days old and are the size of a pine head of the 400 000 frozen embryos in in vitro fertilization clinics throughout the unitedstates about 2 percent are discarded annuallythat is about 8 00011 000 embryos that could be slated for research allowing the option of donating these excess embryos to research is similar to donating organs for organ transplantation in order to save or improve the quality of another persons life the bottom line is when a couple has decided to discard their excess embryos they are either going to be discarded as medical waste or they can be donated for research throughout this debate you will hear about adult stem cells and more about umbilical cord cells and how these types of cells are sufficient for scientists this is simply not true umbilical cord cells are adult stem cells and they are limited adult and umbilical cord cells are already differentiated into the types of cells they are they are difficult to harvest and grow and they do not exist for every tissue type on the other hand embryonic stem cells are master cells they have the potential to grow into any type of cell in the body they are easier to identify isolate purify and grow and they are capable of cpntinual reproduction listen to what the nih has to say on this topic human embryonic stem cells are thought to have much greater developmental potential than adult stem cells this means that embryonic stem cells may be pluripotentthat is able to give rise to cells found in all tissues of the embryo except for germ cells rather than being merely multipotentrestricted to specific subpopulations of cell types as adult stem cells are thought to be in 2003 1 6 million people died of heart disease cancer diabetes alzheimers kidney disease liver disease and parkinsons of the 15 leading causes of death adult stem cell research only addresses one adult stem cells have been around since the 1960s embryonic stem cells were only isolated in 1998 we must explore research on all types of stem cells but the reality is the only policy that is restricted is the federal embryonic stem cell policy the nih is the right place to oversee this research because it can regulate the ethics it provides for scientific collaboration and peer review and promotes publication so all breakthroughs are reported and all scientists have access to the latest research discoveries without nih oversight there are no guidelines as to how this research should be conducted the united states has always been the premier leader in biomedical research in our country and around the world as science continues to move rapidly forward we need to continue to lead the way but we are not why should we waste one more year one more day forcing millions to suffer because of a policy that is outdated and unworkable does this congress really want to look back 10 years from now and say that we were the ones holding the treatments up or do we want to be the congress that says we back science we want research to flourish and we played a small role in making that happen support h r 810 the stem cell research

become so popular they have become a movement growing like topsy the congress when newt gingrich was here as an alternative to vouchers helped jumpstart public charter schools in the district of columbia and in the nation by passing the first public charter school bill right here in the congress for the district with the agreement and total home rule involvement of the district of columbia that was in 1995 what did the schools do they helped us jumpstart a movement that has produced in the district of columbia the largest number of public charter schools per capita in the united states as i look down the list the district has more charter schools this one city than most states they have really taken off for some years now as an alternative to d c public schools when a child does not have a school that is offering that child and that family what the child deserves then the child must have an alternative it can be going out of its neighborhood and the best alternative and the only acceptable alternative it seems to me would be some other kind of public charter school that is what has happened in the district of columbia that is why the people of the district of columbia resent deeply that despite the growth of the charter school movement despite the fact that we have some of the best charter schools in the country and the largest number per capita that congress imposed on us something it would not accept for the rest of the country and that is private school vouchers well our people have voted with their feet they want a neighborhood school near them these schools are very important most of the religious schools are in northwest most of our kids who need or want alternative schools live in southeast so congress did vouchers for itself it did not do it for us and it did it against our will when in fact we had demonstrated that public charter schools were in fact working in d c and working very well a child must have an alternative but that alternative cannot be one where the public dollar is not accounted for where there is no oversight by the public and i am the last one who wants oversight for example of religious schools or anything involving religion it follows that religious schools must not be that alternative the thriving public charter school movement is in fact and should be that alternative all kinds of innovations are happening in the district of columbia that i invite people to come and see shared facilities in large buildings instead of getting rid of the building between public and charter schools collaboration now between the best of our charter schools and some public schools which are not doing so well public schools public charter schools unlike many public schools even under no child left behind are a case of the survival of

come from religious schools they have their own way they have had it for hundreds of years if you want innovation in public education if you want an alternative to your public schools the best bet are

they do fund our law enforcement officers who are in our communities who serve and protect us every day have asked repeatedly that we not cut this one vital program which gives them discretion at the state level on where to put these justice grants these byrne grants if you will and how to use them in their states unfortunately this program is grossly underfunded in the bill that we will have up this week and it is going to cut funding from 634 million that was provided last year to 348 million for this fiscal year that is about a 40 45 percent cut so tomorrow i look forward to joining with my colleague the gentleman from nebraska and the gentleman from minnesota my other cochair of the law enforcement caucus and others to offer this important amendment our amendment will ensure that our local law enforcement has the resources it needs to control and eliminate drug threats keep our court systems up and running smoothly and provide funding for antiterrorism training as a former city

hearings in the law enforcement caucus earlier this year about what these byrne grant cuts would mean to law enforcement and law enforcement from maryland illinois and all over the country came and testified the devastating effect it would have so what odr amendment would do to tomorrow is restore the 286 million that is being cut out of the byrne grants by making a 448 percent cut that is less

choose the programs where funding would be most useful to them back at home the byrne grants also fund programs important to our court and prison systems it provides funding to improve the operational effectiveness of the court process by expanding judicial resources and implementing courtdelay reduction programs such as automated fingerprint identification systems the byrne grants provide longrange corrections and sentencing strategies and fund programs that teach inmates to acquire marketable skills and to make restitution payments to their victims byrne grants can also be used to implement antiterrorism training programs enforce child abuse and neglect laws improve the criminal justice systems response to domestic and family violence and finally the grants can also be used to establish cooperative programs between law enforcement and the media such as the amber alert system which we use when there is an abduction or a missing child or young adult we flash it across the highways the byways the tvs and radios that is all funded by the byrne grants so why would we put a 40 45 percent cut in that system that we seem to be relying upon unfortunately more and more each day as most of us have been hearing from our local drug enforcement teams back home and the gentleman from nebraska certainly articulated those needs we have to provide the funding so our drug enforcement officers can do their jobs we can do this only by fully funding the byrne grants we have a list we are putting out and the gentleman from nebraska has worked on this and all of us who are supporting this amendment tomorrow if you look at california our largest state it has 58 drug enforcement teams task forces if these cuts go through they will be down to 32 they will lose 26 drug task forces georgia 16 louisiana 17 new york will lose 34 of their 76 teams ohio will lose 14 of their 32 texas will lose 21 of the 46 drug enforcement teams and wisconsin my neighboring state will lose 15 of their 34 basically of the 828 drug enforcements teams we have across this nation we will lose 373 or 45 percent of them so really if we are to keep our communities safe and drug free we really have to fund this local drug enforcement teams are crucial to keeping our communities drug free if the byrne grants are funded at the level currently in the bill as i said our teams would not be able to hire the officers they need to sustain drug enforcement teams in my home state of michigan we would lose 11 out of our 25 drug enforcement teams losing the task forces would have a devastating and farreaching effect on michigan especially in rural communities like i represent let me be clear when it comes to drug abuse no community urban or rural in this country is immune from the problem thd methamphetamine problem alone as the gentleman from nebraska just spoke of is destroying families and taking lives in rural america to highlight how important these drug enforcement teams are there was a recent article in one of my little local newspapers in the first congressional district of michigan which cites that back 2 months ago on april 13 hunt the huron undercover narcotics team hunt as we call them seized 3 000 oxycontin tablets from one home in rural presque county this critical seizure is just one example of the work our narcotics teams do each and every day to keep our communities safe these local agencies like hunt who do so much for our local communities will take the brunt of the byrne grant cuts it is a scary thought considering that 90 percent of the drug arrests nationwide are made by states and local law enforcement ninety percent of all drug arrests are made by local and state and where do they get the bulk of their money the byrne grants our countrys drug problems are not going away in fact with the emergence of prescription drug use methamphetamines and oxycontin some would argue our problem is only getting worse so my question is why would we as a congress cut the funding that enables teams like the hunt undercover narcotics team to exist and combat this problem that is only becoming more severe i know we have other members who wish to speak but i am hopeful as members take to the floor tonight they will keep in mind and urge their colleagues to support the terrystupakramstad amendment tomorrow to restore the funding to this critical program again we talk about drugs tonight but there are 29 different programs it is one of those few programs where we say to the states here is some money we want you to do it for law enforcement and do what is best for your state we do not mandate it but here is a pot of money you can take it from and we hope you do what is best in your state after all you know what is best the state and antidrug task forces are just one example that we all deal with day in and day out and i would hope people would support our amendment by cutting less than 1 2 of 1 percent from the other agencies in this bill to fully fund the byrne grants i yield back to the gentleman and thank him once again for his leadership on this issue and i look forward to arguing this amendment with him

the subcommittee and the ranking member there are not two members of the house for whom i have greater respect this is a good bill i intend to support it but i have an amendment which i think will make it a better bill my amendment is simple and it is straightforward it would take 84 million in funding for missile defense that is not needed and add it to an area where it is woefully in need to the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear materials everyone here remembers the first debate between senator kerry and president bush last year they agreed on one thing for sure that the gravest threat facing the united states is that of terrorists armed with nuclear weapons our front line in the defense of this threat is variously called cooperative threat reduction nonproliferation or nunnlugar whatever we call it its object is to stop secure and dispose of nuclear weapons and nuclear materials at the source if at all possible i referred to the president just this past february he met with the president of the russian federation and together they cited the fact that nuclear nonproliferation is a matter of compelling importance for both countries five years ago we appointed a bipartisan commission headed by howard baker and lloyd cutler they came back after 11 2 years of lengthy study and recommended to us that we take these accounts dealing with nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and increase them to 3 billion over the next 10 years li 1430 here is how they sized up the threat 4 years ago the most urgent unmet national security threat to the united states today is the danger that weapons of mass destruction or weaponsusable materials in russia could be stolen and sold to terrorists or hostile nation states and used against american troops abroad or citizens at home that was 4 years ago and dods nonproliferation budget together with the doe budget and the state department budget today all together come to 1 9 billion way short of what was recommended 4 years ago by howard baker and lloyd cutler the dod program called cooperative threat reduction ctr nunnlugar was launched in 1991 to secure to deactivate to dispose of weapons of mass destruction in the former soviet union and in other countries since then it has racked up quite a scorecard since 1991 the ctr program has deactivated 6 564 warheads destroyed 570 icbms eliminated 543 slbms retired 142 bombers and i could go on with a host of other potentially threatening missile and nuclear components which this program has eliminated despite these successes the ctr program has been virtually flatfunded since its inception at around 400 million a year this year the budget request of 416 million falls 27 6 million below the level at which this program was funded on 9 11 26 million less than 9 11 my amendment makes a modest correction to this shortfall it allocates an additional 84 million to cooperative threat reduction to bring total funding to 500 million it pluses up the ctr budget allowing dod the department of defense to do something it has urgently wanted to do upgrade security at russian weapons storage sites dod has indicated that to get all of the upgrades needed at russian sites to secure nuclear weapons and nuclear components it will need funding each year that is about 150 million more than the budget provides for the next 5 to 7 years my amendment puts up about half of that shortfall we make this funding possible by an offset that i think we can all accept my amendment reduces the groundbased missile defense budget by 84 million now here is how it does it it would do so by limiting the funding for silos at fort greely alaska to 26 silos this year and vandenberg to four silos in other words my amendment would permit would fund 30 groundbased gbis and silos the missile defense agency is planning to provide 34 silos for the first 30 gbis the extra four silos are referred to as swing space additional nice to have but this is a cost nearly 16 million that we can avoid per silo that we can avoid for now and spend more wisely elsewhere so my amendment does just that it withholds funding for these four extra swing silos and saves 63 million the fiscal year 2006 budget also includes 20 7 million as an advanced payment on 10 additional silos even though the chairmans mark cuts the funding for the missiles that would actually go in these silos my amendment therefore eliminates this funding at least for 2006 if the interceptors work 30 silos should be sufficient for defense against a rogue nation like north korea and 30 silos should be sufficient for now for the groundbased interceptor until testing has finally shown that it works"]]}
