would punish people for earning and working hard a system that would be obstructive of capital formation we could not have done a better job our tax system is the largest impediment to people moving from the first rung of the economic ladder to the second because the harder you work the more you save the more you invest the more we take it is a system that is inefficient we have seen testimony from the kemp commission to harvard studies that says for a small business man or woman to comply with the code and to collect and remit 1 in business income taxes it costs them anywhere from 4 to 7 the current code is not understandable our own irs tells us that if you call the irs for help in filling out your own tax return 25 percent of the answers they give you will be given in error over 50 percent of americans have to pay others to decipher the tax code and do their taxes for them in an effort to show how complex the irs code has become money magazine created a fictional american family and asked tax professionals to prepare an irs tax return incredibly every one of the tax professionals came up with a different tax total and not one of the tax professionals calculated what the editors of money magazine believed to be the correct income tax the current code invades the privacy of every single american citizen there are 100 000 people at the irs who know more about us than we are willing to tell our children i want them out of our lives these are not bad people they are people doing the job that this congress by statute has directed them to do but we should not have any agency of government that knows how much money you make or how you spend it that should be none of our business we should not have anybody who can look into your records and know your history the

national commission on tax reform and simplification that is required to report to congress on a new fair simpler tax code the overall intention of this bill is to do three things one sunset the

native hawaiians the office of hawaiian affairs administers programs and services with revenues derived from lands which were ceded back to the state of hawaii upon its admission into the united states the dedication of these revenues reflects the provisions of the 1959 hawaii admissions act which provides that the ceded lands and the revenues derived therefrom should be held by the state of hawaii as a public trust for five purposesone of which is the betterment of the conditions of native hawaiians the admissions act also provides that the state would assume a trust responsibility for approximately 203 500 acres of land that had previously been set aside for native hawaiians under a 1921 federal law the hawaiian homes commission act four weeks ago the house resources committee and the senate indian affairs committee held five days of joint hearings in hawaii on h r 4904 and its companion in the senate s 2899 more than 150 people presented oral testimony to the committees and several hundred others presented written testimony the testimony received by the committees was overwhelmingly in support of the bills in addition to witnesses from the native hawaiian community representatives of the departments of justice and interior the president of the national congress of american indians the president of the alaska federation of natives and the president of the central council of tlingit and haida indians presented oral testimony in support of the bills with the passage of h r 4904 the congress will provide a process for the reorganization of a native hawaiian government and the recognition by the united states of that government for purposes of carrying on a governmenttogovernment relationship this bill provides that the indigenous native people of hawaiinative hawaiiansmight have the same opportunities that are afforded under federal law and policy to the other indigenous native people of the united statesamerican indians and alaska nativesto give expression to their rights to selfdetermination and selfgovernance it is also important to note that the united states congress has enacted over 160 laws designed to address the conditions of native hawaiians these federal laws provide for the provision of health care education job training the preservation of native languages the protection of native american graves and the repatriation of native american human remains thus the reorganization of a native hawaiian govemment would not necessitate a host of new federal programs to serve native hawaiians nor would the reorganization of a native hawaiian government have any impact on programs or the funding for programs that are authorized to address the conditions of american indians and alaska natives for the last 90 years native hawaiian programs have always been funded under separate authorizations with separate appropriations some have asked whether the reorganization of a native hawaiian government might also authorize that government to conduct gaming the answer to that question is a simple no the indian gaming regulatory act authorizes indian tribal governments to conduct gaming on indian reservations or indian lands held in trust by the united states and the scope of gaming under the act is a function of state law but there are no indian tribal governments in hawaii nor are there indian reservations or indian lands and the state of hawaii is one of two states in the union that criminally prohibit all forms of gaming in developing and refining this measure we have worked not only with the a community but with representatives of the federal and state governments with leaders of the alaska native and native american communities and with the congressional caucuses the bill that is before the house today has been revised as a fesult of the testimony received at the hearings in hawaii and in washington d c our objectives are simple and straightforward as a matter of federal policy and federal law

myself such time as i may consume i think first of all we should look at this motion to instruct there are several levels of clearance that are required for a motion to instruct to be in order and it has to deal with funding obviously in this motion to instruct it says that in resolving the differences between the two houses on the funding level for program management of the social security act so it meets that test level but then it goes on to say that through the funding mechanism they are supposed to choose a level that reflects a requirement on medicare choice organizations to offer a minimum contract period of 3 years there is no funding mechanism that would require or even allow a 3year contract under medicare medicare choice programs are funded for 1 year under the health care financing administration the amount that a medicare choice program receives is based upon a number of factors where it is located the cost of medical services in the area and most importantly the makeup of the beneficiaries that have signed up for that medicare choice program that is what is their age what is their medical condition all of these factors are taken into consideration when the level of reimbursement to the medicare choice plan is determined the difference by the medicare choice program of offering the statutory mandatory benefits is what the health care financing administration has determined to be its payment level if there are dollar differences between those two areas by law that plan must either offer additional benefits or that money has to be refunded back to the health care financing administration but it can only be done on a 1year basis under current law beneficiaries can sign up for a medicare choice program and leave the program that is the patient profile of a plan can change from year to year to year so it is nonsensical to think that a level of funding can produce a 3year contract it is also nonsensical to think that it can produce a set benefit package for a 3year period one of the reasons some of these plans are pulling out of areas is because they can no longer offer the benefits they had offered under their shrinking profit structure dictated and determined by the health care financing administration so make no mistake not only does this motion to instruct have no legal binding requirement but it is nonsensical it is

debate i am a little disappointed to see the cynicism and skepticism creep in and there is some sort of contest here about who is most in love with americas small businesses i suspect all of us appreciate and acknowledge the importance of americas small businesses my colleague who just spoke is not the only member of congress who is a small business person nor is it unique among our colleagues here to have a small business experience in their past before they came to this body so i would hope we start with the assumption that all of us are here intending to do what is best not just for small businesses but for america and for our population including our consumers and including all of us who have a concern about the environment and law enforcement and all of the other agencies that are involved in making our quality of life at a high level or as high a level as possible i rise in opposition to this bill having been somebody who has a long experience with small business and with their regulatory affairs having represented numerous small businesses as they dealt with regulations and their application but i look at this bill madam chairman and i see it has some good points and it has some deficiencies the problem that i see is in the efforts to work with the other side to correct some of these deficiencies and we are met with sort of a challenge that any correction of the bill in a bipartisan manner will take away the opportunity for somebody to be the champion and somebody not to be the champion i do not think that is the way we ought to proceed in moving legislation through this body there is much in this bill that in fact can be supported i think that we all agree that businesses should not be burdened or overburdened by overzealous application of the law the proposal in this bill to publish in the federal register an annual list of the requirements that pertain to small business makes sense we ought to do that the establishment of an agency point of contact a liaison for small businesses to work with should make compliance easier that too is something everybody should be able to support as is the proposed task force that would examine how the requirements for information collection can be streamlined everybody here wants to make sure that small business gets a break when it is deserved we just want to make sure that we do not provide a disincentive for filing reports that protect our health and our safety i believe we should be able to achieve that goal if we put aside the concept of winners and losers here we all agree with my colleagues comments about small business being the backbone of america creating the majority of new jobs the fact that small business owners work hard in their communities to help build them and that we should make sure that everybody in small businesses is encouraged in creating jobs and new jobs that is something we definitely want to do but we know that most small businesses do in fact obey the law there is no question about that they are good americans we were all good americans when we were small business people we salute them and we are sure members on both sides of the aisle do however there are problems with this bill because not all of us are angels in fact some of the small businesses we find in this bill are not in fact small businesses by our normal account of how that word might be defined in this bill i might note madam chairman there will not be any requirement for the filing of one less piece of paper when this bill passes every small business will be filing just as much paper the day after as i mentioned there is nothing actually in this bill that reduces paperwork if this legislation is enacted no individual will file one less piece of paper tomorrow or the day after than they would have filed before but this h r 391 would bar agencies from assessing civil fines against those who violate a large variety of laws even those when the violations were intentional i do not think that is someplace where small businesses want to go or the american public wants to go the administration is strongly opposed to this bill for obvious reasons as it is currently written there is a statement of administration policy on the bill which states that if presented to the president in its current form the attorney general the secretary of labor the secretary of transportation and the administrator of the environmental protection agency would recommend that the president veto this bill all of those people madam chairman cannot be against small business in america they do however see that this bill needs some remedial action and they are going to suggest that i think when we talk to the amendment the gentleman from ohio is proposing it takes that action it allows and requires in fact the agencies to look at the nature and seriousness of a violation the good faith efforts to comply that might be there and other relevant factors in determining whether or not there should be a waiver i think the american people want to lessen the burden of paperwork everywhere they want to lessen the burden of regulation but they want it done in a reasonable way they want it done with common sense and in a way that still provides for protection of our health and our safety in all counts so i would ask madam chairman that everyone reconsider their hardened positions and their concept that people are going to be better than others or more a champion of small business and settle in on what is best not just for small business but to help small business keep maintaining the health and safety of the american public simply allowing agencies to waive when appropriate but to retain the ability to check all different circumstances
