which prompt action is vital in effect the committee amendment for convenience incorporates two separate bills ordered reported by the banking corxmittee on november 5 into a single bill containing two titles title i of the bill contains the text of a bill introduced on november 2 as h r 4879 by my colleague from new york mr schumeri dealing with international banking facilities on december 3 1981 pursuant to regulations of the federal reserve board international banking facilities will be permitted in the united states 113fs may be established by unitedstates depository institutions by edge and agreement corporations and by unitedstates branches and agencies of foreign banks the board issued proposed rules last december and adopted the final rule june 18 1981 with an effective date of in brief an ibf may accept deposits from and extend credit to foreign residents or other ibfs all such funds will be exempt from reserve requirements and from interest rate limlitations of regulation q the purpose of ibfs at unitedstates banking offices is to enhance the international competitive position of banking institutions in the united states consistent with this basic purpose it now becomes necessary to review thle february 18 1981 interpretation of fdic to thle effect that ibf deposits are subject to fdic insurance assessments under the federal deposit insurance act the subcommittee on financial institutions supervision regulation and insurance of thle house banking committee heard testimnony that if unitedstates ibfs are required to pay the fdic premium amounting to onetwelfth of 1 percent of their deposits then they will be comnpetitive y disadvantaged this premium is considered especially important because as the testimony indicated many ibfs may operate on very narrow margins title i of h r 4879 would eliminate the insurance requirement for what in essence are deposits of extremely sophisticated international investors seeking the highest possible yields with the december 3 effective date nearing congress has an opportunity to prevent burdensome regulation and at the same time insure competitive equality between unitedstates and foreign banks by actinig in a manner fully consistent with the letter and spirit of theo federal reserve boards action in permitting the establishment of ibifs title i of the bill also includes an amendment adopted at full committee markup extending fdic deposit insurance coverage to branches of insured banks operating in the trust territory of the pacific islands currently fdics authority to insure deposits includes areas in the pacific such as guam and american samoa but under current law fdic cannot offer insurance in the trust territory fslics authority to insure thrift deposits does include the trust territory therefore title i of the bill would expand fdics authority to cover the trust territory title ii of the bill was introduced by myself mr stanton and mr gonzalez and was considered by the committee as h r 4515 this title deals with existing statutory limitations affecting mortgage purchases both by the federal home loan mortgage corporation and the federal national mortgage association present charter requirements limit the dollar value of loans which are more than 1 year old when sold to 20 percent of the total value of conventional mortgages in fhlmcs or fnmas portfolios this limitation will soon raise serious problems in connection with new programs under which fhlmc and fitma will use their currently unused capacity to purchase or place older mortgages and it is expected as a result provide improved liquidity to mortgage lending institutions this is november 17 1 981 the highly successful swap program of the federal home loan mortgage corporation this program in the short period it has been in effect has been popular indeed inasmuch as it permits the swapping of older lowyielding mortgage loans for mortgage corporation participation certificates pcs these illiquid mortgages responsible in large part for difficulties being encountered by the thrift industry are converted into highly liquid securities ultimately additional funds are freed up for new mortgage funding i have been advised by fhlmc that with its most recent auction fhlmc has virtually reached its 20 percent ceiling for all practical purposes and that absent this legislation now the program must be shut down until such time as purchases of new mortgages in the corporations other programs made it possible to hold another swap auction it is now clear that the value of new loans will be depressed for 1982 and as a consequence it seems unlikely that the swap program can be offered at anywhere near a level commensurate with the need and demand unless congress approves this legislation another provision of title ii would give the same seller service status to fdic and ncua as that fslic with respect to using fhlmc and f nma programs to aid troubled financial institutions

should be used as the primary debt collection mechanism it is better from the point of view of the government because it spares the government of the huge cost of seeking a court order in every case it is better from the point of view of the employee since the employee will have an independent official in front of whom the employee can argue about the existence and amount of the debt as well as

nuclear accident in history no one is certain about the extent of damage done cleanup at three mile island is expected to continue for another 7 or 8 years and cost more than 1 billion yet in spite of the potential for environmental and social devastation that could result from a nuclear powerplant accident we continue to rely on an antiquated provision the priceanderson act to make compensation available to those who might suffer in the event of such an accident i am today reintroducing legislation to amend the priceanderson act the 1957 law which limits liability for utilities in the possible occurrence of a major nuclear accident my bill would remove the acts 560 million compensation ceiling and would require all atomic plant licensees to arrange a combination of individual private pollcies and an industryfinanced insurance pool to cover the balance of claims resulting from a nuclear accident there are two primary reasons for these changes those people whose businesses homes and lives would be unalterably damaged by a nuclear accident currently could receive a total of no more than the 560 million limit as compensation but the nuclear regulatory commission has estimated that a serious accident could do as much as 14 billion damage the priceanderson act in its current form therefore prevents fair compensation for damages done priceanderson also results in an unjustified competitive economic advantage for nuclear utilities by protecting them from full financial responsibility for operation of their plants under the legislation i am introducing the true costs of atomic energy generation would no longer be artificially deflated through an arbitrary and inequitable cutoff of claim payments the current 560 million figure consists of first the amount of private coverage available t a particular plantabout 160 million second a formula based on the number of plants operating currently 71 which provides 355 million and third 45 million in federal payments the liability limit was set in 1957 and has never subsequently been adjusted for inflation my legislation would amend priceanderson in the following ways stipulate that each licensee must obtain the maximum coverage available from private insurers provide that in the event of an accident at a particular plant insurance on the facility would be the first source of payment state that if the judgment against a given facility exceeds available private insurance coverage the plant would then be liable up to the total of its assets require that if a court determines that the plants assets are insufficient to meet the full judgment the industry pool shall cover the balance of outstanding claims mandate that industry pool participants shall contribute to the cost of the judgment according to a formula based on each licensees generating capacity its degree of risk its total assets and other factors provide that should a court determine that a given utility cannot meet its proprotional share to the pool that plant would then become eligible for longterm federal loans to be secured against the plants assets make explicit that each licensee shall be liable for any incident at its facility resulting in injury to persons and or damage to property and waive the 20year statutory limitation on claims resulting from a nuclear accident unlike the current priceanderson act which mandates a federal subsidy for nuclear powerplant insurance my bill would entail use of federal funds only in the event of a major catastrophe where victims cims exceed a plants private insurance coverage the plants total assets and the proportional contribution toward an industrywide pool even then federal money would be used only to provide interestbearing loans this act was enacted as a means of encouraging private industry to accelerate nuclear power development that was 24 years ago and since then more than 70 nuclear plants have come on line in our country the time is long overdue for nuclear power to stand or fall on its own merits no other energy source enjoys this type of liability limitation and it is congress duty to end this unfair underwriting of the nuclear power industry proponents of nuclear power insist that it is a safe source of energy the nuclear industry certainly should be able to obtain policy coverage far in excess of the current 16q million

evaluate what we do not know when we consider the value of dense pack basing the dense pack theory postulates that in the hellfire environment of an atomic attack later incoming warheads would be destroyed by electromagnetic pulse or debris kickedup in the maelstrom of the blast through which our missiles can supposedly be launched this defense scenario is based on a hiroshima type blast in

conducting launch operations on the surface of the sun if only momentarily furthermore should the soviets be capable of simultaneously detonating warheads the dynamics of the blast environment changes

privilege of represent ing the people living in the town of highlands and the village of highland falls where the unitedstates military academy at west point is located of the several school districts in my former congressional district which participated in the impacted area program the highland fallsfort montgornery central school district containing within its borders the unitedstates military academy at west point has been particularly heavily impacted by reason of the fact that not only does it educate many federal students but also that its physical taxable territory is taken up almost entirely more then 90 percent by the academy due to funding cuts over the last few years in the department of education appropriations for impact aid this school district is hard pressed to pay its bills to maintain quality education for the children of local families and the families of west point employees because west point takes up over 90 percent of the land the property based on which this school district is dependent for the levying of property tax for assuring adequate eductation has been significantly reduced yet the payment of impact aid funds has been substantially cut this year and would be further cut by an additional 10 percent in fiscal year 1983 needless to say this has caused the relationship between the townspeople and the federal em ployees at west point to reach a breaking point the citizens of highland falls are honored to have the academy located there but we cannot ask these same citizens to shoulder the greater part of the burden of educating the children of the federal employees attending the public schools there this considerable reduction in impact aid funding has forced the highland fallsfort montgomery school district to pursue every avenue over recent months for petitioning for more funds all doors have been shut and as a last resort these citizens are considering action to bar west point families from sending their children to the local high school or as an alternate charging tuition to the students from west point the cuts have left the school district short some 200 000 with the resulting reductions in staff and programs that such funding shortages bring about in 1980 the villages impact aid allocation was approximately 621 000 for this year it is approximately 410 000 accordingly i urge this body to consider the importance of assuring the best possible education to the children of those who serve our nation through the military and the equally crucial need for fairness and justice in assisting the local school districts

up this safety by traveling to war torn hungary where he printed thousands of swedish passports of his own design and began literally pulling jews off the cattle trains bound for auschwitz claiming

on the budget for 1983 you are considering a third concurrent budget resolution for 1982 the year that we are still in we have got a supplemental that will be coming up for military pay and medicaid and student loans and all of the rest which are not funded adequately in the appropriation bill and then on top of that do you want to come to grips with a continuing resolution again why there will be so many figures floating around here in budget authority and outlays this year and that year and talk about confusion that is what we will have now we are going to have a lot better environment here within a couple of weeks if we only zero in on that one item and it would be my druthers at that time that whatever we come to the conclusion at that time it is through the balance of the fiscal year we have got that behind us then we do make that new approach in january when we do come back to deal with what has to be done at that time"], [0.002288997173309326, 0.5022889971733093, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume no one could be against full employment just like no one could be against motherhood no one could be against honesty no one could be against truth no one could be against children education or anything else but in 4 000 years of recorded history we have never had an economy that was predicated on the free enterprise system that had full employment oh we have had some dictatorships that had full employment we have an economy in the peoples republic of china that has full employment because everyone works for the government no one can get fired no one is challenged no onb is evaluated economically everybody gets so much a month and that is that so to stand here today and to suggest that i am not for full employment would be ridiculous everyone is for it just like everyone is for free trade motherhood and honesty but the economic realities are such that the only way we can put people to work in a productive free enterprise economy is to let business make those jobs on a longterm basis we have been pursuing the idea that government can provide jobs for 15 years and let me tell you what has happened over those 15 years over those 15 years the share of our economy controlled by the government state federal and local has crept up from about 35 percent to almost 45 percent that is the private sector has left only 55 or 56 or 57 cents out of each dollar to provide the savings to provide the capital to provide everything else that you need to provide jobs now to see if this type of economy works our evaluation should 1e a fairly objectively approached evaluation we could simply go round and look at other economies throughout the world to see if there is a viable and healthy economy controlled by government we could define that by simply saying an economy where the real increase in gross national product each year is say 3 percent is viable and healthy if in any of these economies we had government spending of more than 40 percent of the gross national product we could say fine then we can safely pursue the same end we can spend 24 percent of the economy at the federal level and let the state and local governments spend at 19 or 20 percent and everything will work out fine you see because country x is doing it but i challenge any of my colleagues supporting any of the three budgets labeled the bipartisan coalition budget the obey budget or the jones budget to point out to me an economy a healthy economy on this planet whcre government is controlling that much of the economy they are simply not there over the last 15 years we built a system that is incredible we built a military retirement system that now has 30 retired generals drawing more in retirement pay than the chief of staff of the unitedstates army and government retirees drawing more than their working counter parts all at the expense of the taxpayer let us examine the history of another government program supplementary fuel assistance a noble end back in 1977 when we enacted it the first time it was 300 million a oneshot appropriation because fuel oil prices went from 60 cents to 1 a gallon in 1977 well here we are five years later and what do we have now the appropriation is 1 8 billion which includes airconditioning because obviously we had to do something for the sun belt states to get them to continue to vote for this and we have an increased appropriation this year but what is economic reality economic reality is that the price of fuel oil is down 20 or 25 percent from a year ago yet we appropriate more money it has been said that reaganomics has not worked reaganomics has not even started reaganomic was more than offset that miniscule tax cut that working americans got last october was more than offset by the increase in their social security taxes which occurred january 1 so our only hope is to get a part of it in july of this year a 10percent acrosstheboard tax cut for every working american we ought to be concerned about those working americans out there because they are the people that have got to provide all that money we spend so freely up here now unfortunately we are entering this budget debate with two very emotional factors influencing our thinking one is unemployment and my heart goes out to those who are unemployed because they are suffering more than their share of the burden i submit that the people who are suffering the most are those unemployed who are involved in those industries where savings are most important and i refer to homebuilding and i refer to the automobile industry where in order to buy a home or a car someone must have saved the money so that other people can borrow it the other factor is the high interest rates dragging down the economy well i submit to the members that both of those are symptoms they are not the disease the disease is government it is government that grows year by year to where it takes over more and more of the productive wealth of this country the wealth that is produced by millions of american men and women just think about the last 5 years the gross national product of this country that which we all produce added together the total wealth produced in this country in the last 5 years has increased a little over 15 percent but what has government spending done in the last 5 years it has increased more than 60 percent government is growing four times as fast as the income of american men and women now the critical thing as we begin this budget debate is not the deficit in the short run sure in the long run it may be important it may be painful but the important thing is how we are going to cure this problem of how much of the economy we can take over the only way to cure that is by stopping our growth in spending to the growth of the economy this does not entail cutting anyone this entails simply being content to level benefits to say hey we have not got the money so we cannot give you an increase next year because if we continue to provide thdse increases that retiree who is now making more than his counterpart who is working will further increase his benefits and his share we have to have savings in this country we cannot save less than 4 percent our income each year and have a free enterprise economy it has not worked it is not going to work but the only way the american working people can save is to have less taken away from them by the government yet the spending proposals that are proposed in three of these budgets of 770 billion simply proceed on the assumption that we can take more from the american people in the way of taxes and deficits which will further impair their ability to save the fact is that the government under john fitzgerald kennedy was not spending the percentage of the gross national product than it is under president reagan why the government back then was spending only 18 percent of our economy now government is spending 24 percent of our economy can reaganomics possibly work with the government taking over the economy i seriously question it yet do we address the question of spending in three of these budgets no we simply promote an increase in government spending that once again exceeds the increase in the economy as a whole i do not believe like my colleague from california that government alone and i believe that is a direct quotecan provide employment i believe that this system grew great under an economic system that will have a certain amount of unemployment at all times as economic dislocations occur but it has given america the greatest standard of living from a material standpoint that this planet has ever known because it acknowledges that there are risks and there are rewards more control more manipulation of the monetary policy of this country is not what is in order monetary policy is a reflection of the sickness and the sickness is the share of this economy government is taking and we have got to address that more government spending has not worked as an economic system if it had worked this economy ought to be going great because now government is spending almost 45 percent of the total economy this ought to be theoretically a perfect economy under the humphreyhawkins full employment bill concept we ought to be just running away with jobs because year after year government spending as a percentage of gross national product has gone up and up and up it has not worked and unless the congress is prepared to address seriously and at some political risk the real question in this country how much of its economy can we take over then there is little chance that this budget will ever be balanced because as the economy grinds down due to overwhelming burdens of taxation and government spending there will not be any opportunity to restore it because the tax base simply will not be there we have got to control spending not increase taxes"], [0.002451658248901367, 0.5024516582489014, 0, "the gentleman from new jersey and i offer this amendment because of our concern over the level of defense spending being proposed in short the amendment would in all 3 fiscal years reduce defense budget authority by 16 billion defense outlays by 4 billion and revenues by 4 billion while i recognize the need for some increase in defense i think that it is clear that the level proposed is unreasonable also i think that the increases need to be primarily in the areas of operations and maintenance and readiness clearly we cannot afford and we do not in a strategic sense need all of the costly new weapons systems which have been broposed i personally do not see the need for the mx missile or the b1 bomber as examples when we add the 4 billion outlay cut in my amendment to the roughly 8 billion reduction the jones substitute already contains from the baseline and to the military pay provisions we then reach a total reduction of about 15 billion this level of reduction will force the armed services committee to make some very real and hard choices about weapons systems procurement such a reduction should not allow the committee to make easierand in my view less wisecuts in manpower spare parts and other readiness areas instead the committee will have to look at entire weapons systems and decide what we truly need and what we can afford further i am disturbed at the high level of tax increases contained in the jones budget particularly in the outyears i agree that some level of tax increase is justified as one component of or effort to reduce the deficit however i think that the jones substitute may be going somewhat too far consequently since my amendment cuts defense spending by 4 billion we do not need to raise taxes as much to achieve the same deficit level as is in the jones proposal thus the amendment also reduces the revenue level in jones by 4 billion i think that this is a reasonable proposal one which will improve the jones substitute and i urge my colleagues to support my amendment"]]}
