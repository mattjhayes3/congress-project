the inslee amendment is to in fact provide the kind of protection that is necessary to maintain the potential wilderness qualities of these areas by designating them as wilderness study areas and expanding the boundary i appreciate apparently mining is okay good enough for the wilderness areas inside the boundary study areas but it is not good enough for the areas outside the study let us be consistent here i would prefer we did not have mines in either one of them the fact it exists and that is why it is a study area to see whether or not it can meet the definition of wilderness wilderness is not something that we go back and we create wilderness either exists or it does not exist and we designate it we do not create it it was created by the creator if you will at this point the question is whether or not wehave the ability to recognize it and to protect it as i said it is a difficult and a tough threshold if one would read the definition of wilderness in contrast to

not remain and it goes on with the characteristics these areas are tougher and tougher to find the gentleman from utah raises a number of concerns that we obviously have as we look at these wilderness areas as a number of them probably will not qualify although that particular area may have great environmental value but when put into this definition it may in fact not qualify because of preexisting activities that are there that is why the current protection is so important because those activities will continue on they continue on with a lesser level of protection and then that is used as

support the obey substitute that will be offered today after the next amendment to this bill let me thank the gentleman from iowa for doing the best that he could inside his own caucus he is a member of our subcommittee and i know how deeply he feels these issues but truly i would say to his leadership this is not the way for america to deal with the crisis affecting unitedstates citizens our farmersfrom coast to coast west to east north to south why should we even consider an amendment here today which deals with such a teensyweensy portion of a massive problem as part of an emergency supplemental dealing with kosovo we considered this bill dealing with rural america in the house several weeks ago nearly 2 months ago and then something happened over in the other body and the leadership of both institutions were not able to get themselves together and i would have to say to my dear friend fromflorida this is not his fault either he has my sympathy because i understand a little bit about florida and that 175 runs between ohio and florida so a lot of our people go down there during the winter and come back and the gentleman has tried to do the best that he can under constraints that are being applied by the leadership of this house and the leadership of the other body it kind of reminds me of that old song by peggy lee when i look at this amendment is that all there is and when we look at the actual content of the amendment offered by the gentleman from iowa he has been cut back by his own leadership to only include a small portion of agricultural credit that is desperately needed by our farmers toget through this spring plonting season however even the administrations abysmal request to this congress included funding for the staff to administer that that is not in the amendment offered by the gentleman from iowa mr lathamx ag credit money that will unleash dollars in the private sector will not help farmers in this crisis because we need people to deliver the assistance and we know that because of the depth of this crisis in our country the disaster payments from last year have not even been fully processed and what has our secretary of agriculture been doing he has been robbing one account over there to pay for another account just to try to k eep staff people in place in these farm service agencies around the country and last week all authority ran out so the robpetertopaypaul mechanism that has been used because we have not been able to clear a bill because of the backwardness of the leadership of this institution now places the burden on the gentleman from iowa a respected member of our subcommittee who is trying to do the best he can but i would like to ask where is the leadership of this house and where is the leadership of the other body to give the farmers of this country that we owe such a debt of gratitude to for keeping this nation fed food security fundamental to any body politics peace why can they not get their day in the sun why do we get backdoored at the end in the last file in the cabinet in a bill dealing with kosovo and we cannot even deal with the enormity of this problem what kind of signal does the gentlemans amendment also give to farmers because in that particular amendment we basically have to offset the 109 million that he is talking about and why is the crisis in rural america any less of a crisis than what we are facing in kosovo in a foreign land or hurricane mitch what about the people of this country i do not think i am xenophobic i care very much about this country the people of this country elected me to be here andi think they should be at the front of the line not at the back of the file cabinet so i view what is happening in rural america a true

been introduced in the other body that could have the potentially destructive effects of cutting off important exchanges between american scientists and their counterparts from other countries the legislation in question offered by senator shelby would impose a moratorium on visiting scientists from socalled sensitive countries in american nuclear labs the senators proposal comes on the heels of recent reports of compromises to our national security with regard to the peoples republic of china while i agree that chinese espionage activities should cause us to be more vigilant with regard to that country i am concerned that this proposed legislation casts a wide net and would give too much discretion to officials at the department of energy the result could be a cutting off of positive scientific exchanges that do not affect our national security depriving all of us of valuable knowledge and disrupting the types of scientific contacts that actually promote security and cooperation one country that could be affected by this legislation is india while the senate legislation does not mention any countries by name a recent report in the newspaper india abroad quotes an energy department official that the list of seven sensitive countries includes in addition to china and russia india and pakistan the official indicated that different criteria were used for putting countries on the list and that india and pakistan were included because they are not signatories to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty i too am deeply concerned about the persistent pattern of chinas theft of our nuclear secrets i have come to this floor on several occasions to call for more safeguards against chinese espionage as well as to focus more attention on chinas documented actions with regard to nuclear proliferation which include providing nuclear and missile technology to unstable countries like pakistan but in the case of india we clearly do not have the facts to support the conclusion that india is involved in the same types of activities as china thus i would urge members of the senate and the house as well as the administration not to jump to any conclusions about india without the facts what we know is that unitedstates india relations have suffered in the past year because of the nuclear tests conducted by india last may but one key fact that is often overlooked is that indias nuclear program is essentially indigenous developed by indias own scientists export controls on supercomputers and other dual use technology have been in effect against india for years forcing india to develop its own highly advanced r d infrastructure another very important point is that india has kept its nuclear technology to itself out of the hands of rogue regimes and international sponsors of terrorism this is in marked contrast to china which has not only stolen our technology but has shared very sensitive information with unstable countries in asia and the middle east i fully agree that we need to be more wary of china this is an authoritarian country a oneparty state the communist party with a terrible record on human rights and a record of

organize and help spread the word about the benefits of increased trade with china that will bring benefits to the garden state and i would like to discuss for a few minutes a few of these items first extending permanent normal trade relations with china is a win for fairness this agreement forces china to adhere to our rulesbased trading system without an agreement there are no rules and we have no say whatsoever in how china conducts its business with the rest of the world secondly it is a win for unitedstates workers and businesses china is an incredibly important emerging market with more than a billion consumers thirdly trade with china is a win for american values inside china through free and fair trade america will not only export many products and services but we will deliver a good oldfashioned dose of our democratic values and free market ideas fourthly international trade whether it be with china or any other nation means jobs for my state of new jersey and that is the bottom line continued prosperity for all of us out of new jerseys 4 1 million member workforce almost 600 000 people statewide from main street to fortune 500 companies are employed because of exports imports and foreign direct investment currently china ranked as new jerseys ninth largest export destination in 1998 an increase from 13th in 1993 our garden state has exported 668 million in

reach out with respect to people of all faiths and most of all his commitment to the teachings of jesus christ provide a model of grace to all peoples of the world in his first letter to the corinthians the apostle paul wrote i have become all things to all to save at least some all this i do for the sake of the gospel so that i too may share in it last thursday john paul ii celebrated his 80th birthday and saint pauls observation is an appropriate summary of karol wojtylas extraordinary trajectory on this earth from the small town of his birth in southern poland wadowice through the war years in cracow leadership of cracows archdiocese during the difficult communist times finally to the ministry of peter in rome in this journey he has left an indelible mark on his church and the history of our times with the world watching john paul ii has begun to show burdens of age but he has lost none of the extraordinary vigor that has characterized the 212 years of his pontificate one of the longest in church history on new years eve for instance he celebrated a long formal te deum in saint peters basilica had dinner in his quarters with vatican aides and friends after which they all sang carols at midnight he appeared in his window and delivered his traditional new years greeting to an adoring crowd in saint peters square below h3544 co then he celebrated yet another mass his first of the new millennium in his private chapel his staff was exhausted but by 9 the next morning he was in another basilica in rome leading another mass from the moment he became a priest in cracow karol wojtyla has conceived his role as a pastor a representative of christ on earth who has to be seen by the faithful since he became pope in october of 1978 he has made 92 pastoral trips abroad to 123 countries and territories meeting more leaders and bringing the message of god to more people than any other pontiff before him this year alone he has been to mount sinai in egypt followed in christs footsteps in the holy land and prayed at the shrine of the virgin mary in fatima who he believes interceded to save his life when he was shot in saint peters square in 1981 as a leader of a billion members of his faith john paul h is generally considered the preeminent religious leader in the world but his moral authority goes beyond his church it extends to all who seek a message of love and compassion of dignity that defies materialism of freedom of thought unconstrained by political oppression above all he has urged people all over the world never to give up hope he likes to recall that his first words in saint peters square were an echo of christs exhortation be not afraid wherever he has traveled john paul ii has championed human rights and individual dignity both of which in his view include freedom of worship with this definition of liberty he turned the church in his native poland into a protector not only of catholics but of all citizens oppressed by communism no matter their religion if any in so doing he helped discredit the communist system in poland and bring about its downfall elsewhere in the world it used to be said in poland that while he was the archbishop of cracow the countrys communist leaders considered him their greatest threat likewise in moscow once he became pope it is no accident that chinas leaders have so far refused to allow him to conduct a pilgrimage in their country in traveling the world john paul ii has reached out to the other great religions last month he sought to bridge the historic divide between christians and jews in a gesture of breathtaking eloquence in its simplicity he placed a sheet of paper in a crack in jerusalems western wall god of our fathers he wrote we are deeply saddened bythe behavior of those who in the course of history have caused these children of yours to suffer and asking your forgiveness we wish to commit ourselves to genuine brotherhood with the people of the covenant to exemplify his personal compassion an elderly israeli woman came forth during this historic pilgrimage she recalled how she was one of the lucky ones who survived hitlers concentration camps upon her release in 1945 she was placed on a train to return to her home in cracow when she arrived barely able to stand with hardly any flesh on her bones she stumbled onto the station platform and there a strong young man in priestly garb picked her up in his arms and carried her two miles to a place where she could be nurtured back to health the priest was karol wojtyla in times singularly

who witnessed the event from outside peoples and nations of the entire world need to hear these words their conscience needs to grow on the certainty that someone exists who holds in his hands the key to death and the netherworld someone who is the alpha and the omega of human history be it the individual or collective history and this someone is love love that became man love crucified and risen love unceasingly present among men it is eucharistic love it is the infinite source of communion he alone can give the ultimate assurance when he says be not afraid john paul ii has sundered depotism

security and defense identity within nato the socalled esdi and the european unions common foreign and security policy or the cfsp to the degree that these initiatives are about european allies contributing more to our common defense within nato we applaud them after all most of us would have been delighted if our european allies had been able to handle the bosnian crisis on their own or if they could have contributed more to the allied operations in kosovo but many of us are troubled by indications that these initiatives may be the first step toward a divorce between the european and north american pillars of nato some of our european allies seem to long for an independent military capability one that is not just separable from nato but that is separate last december in saintmalo france the united kingdom and france issued a declaration calling for the establishment of a national or multinational european means outside the nato framework subsequent to the cologne summit last june the leaders of the european union declared that the union must have the capacity for autonomous action backed by credible military forces the means to decide to use them and a readiness to do so without prejudice to actions by nato for those of us who have long supported the transatlantic security bond that is represented by nato these are troubling sentiments if the european union develops a security mechanism on the continent that excludes not only our nation but also all the other noneuropean members of nato including such important allies as norway poland and turkey then very serious damage will have been done to the fabric of the transatlantic security bond and the logic of the continued unitedstates security commitments to europe that may be called into question house resolution 59 addresses this concern by pointing out that the key to a vibrant and a more influential esdi is not new institutions but the improvement of european military capabilities the resolution further causes our allies in the european union to elaborate tbeir cfsp in a manner that does not duplicate nato efforts and institutions is not decoupled from nato and does not discriminate against european allies like norway poland and turkey that are members of the eu these are important concerns that need to be discussed within the alliance accordingly for these reasons i urge the house to agree to house resolution 59 i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.00897759199142456, 0.5089775919914246, 1, "i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time being myself a cosponsor of this taxpayer bill of rights i like the bill we have but i believe we could make it much better with the amendment that i sought to offer and so does the joint committee on taxation which happens to be chaired by a republican member the chairman of the house committee on ways and means that joint committee this january called for disclosure of these 527 organizations and what has the house committee on ways and means or this house as a whole done about it until now absolutely nothing until i offered this amendment in the committee once again republicans were going to sit on their hands to oppose reform i just want the american people to know that when they turn on their television set and they begin seeing one attack ad after another probably from both sides spewing out hate and misrepresenting someone that today it was the house republican leadership that blessed that kind of conduct because they have denied us an opportunity to at least learn when the attack ads hit the airwaves who the attackers are as to the phoney claim made today that there is a need to find out more about this or that other organization all we are trying to do is to apply the same standards to these 527 organizations that already apply to every member of congress republican and democrat with reference to their individual campaigns i think that the american taxpayers who are subsidizing these organizations american taxpayers who are filling out their own tax forms right now should know that these 527 organizations usually get away tax free they are subsidized by the hardworking men and women of america and one of these groups is called shape the debate my colleagues can pull up that web page right now and they will see an advertisement on it to promote more hate ads it calls for the giving of unlimited amounts of contributions it says they can be from any source and i might note that that source while it can be a corporate treasury written right out of the corporate treasury it could also be china or iraq or cuba or any other country because it is all hidden money just focusing on this as one example which any american can pull up on the world wide web right now you will find an effort to solicit just that kind of money unlimited amounts of money that can come directly from a corporate treasury and what do they go on to promise those who give well these contributions they tell us are not reported to the federal election commission or any state agency and they do not count against contribution limits the whole idea is nobody will know this republican party has become so wed to secret money funding within the last week we have heard reports of a milliondollar contribution a million dollars of undisclosed money from one source we have heard they can spend it on a townhouse they can spend it on a truck they can spend it on sky boxes or they can spend it on hate ads and that is what these 527 organizations do they spew out hate and they want to be able to continue to operate under some pleasantsounding name like americans for better government when in fact the money that they are using is from some specialinterest group that wants to control the agenda of congress let me give my colleagues another example of the kind of organization that republicans are protecting many of us have heard from our seniors that they ought not to be having to pay twice as much as the most favored customers of pharmaceutical companies on purchases of their prescription drugs and so now we have some group out there called citizens for better medicare it is a 527 organization just like shape the debate citizens for better medicare can go around and attack all of us who want to end the price discrimination against our seniors on prescription drugs and claim they are on the side of the seniors and who is funding that organization well we will never know from the irs we will never know from the disclosure reports like i and every other member of congress must file but what we have learned in fact is it is the pharmaceutical companies themselves fighting to protect the discrimination they want to continue against our seniors"]]}
