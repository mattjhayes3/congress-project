policies of the budget resolution both the bush and republican budgets suffer from the same infirmities fiscal irresponsibility and selfserving and outoftouch priorities both are wholly inadequate to meet the needs of our nation and will pass along mounting deficits and debts to generations yet unborn first the 5year republican budget will result in a deficit of 376 billion in 2006 44 million over the presidents projection the republicans budget proposal also has many cost omissions because they know that their deficit numbers explode after 5 years as such this budget does not take into account the cost of fixing the amt which will cost at least 642 billion it does not take into account the 774 billion needed to pay for the presidents muchtalked about but yet unveiled social security privatization plan i suppose the republican budget proposal deserves a little credit for hiking its deficit projection as it at least includes 50 million in 2006 for the wars in afghanistan and in iraq the presidents budget proposal contained zero dollars as a matter of fact it reported that the costs could not be known however both figures are fantasy the realistic figure over the next 10 years in addition to the 80 billion that we just passed in the supplemental is likely to be 384 billion to pay for its misguided policies the house budget resolution cuts nondefense discretionary spending by 12 billion below the amount needed in fiscal 2006 just to maintain current spending levels and it cuts spending on mandatory domestic programs by 8 billion to add insult to injury the republican budget provides 18 billion in additional tax cuts these misguided tax cuts will actually cost much more when the tax cuts actually expire in 2010 in fact 97 percent of these tax cuts will benefit taxpayers with incomes above 200 000 i think most reasonable people can agree that these priorities are not americas priorities while little good can be said about the bush administrations budget it at least provides detailed information on the programs it seeks to cut the house resolution shrouds its cuts in darkness leaving the american people to wonder what vital programs will find their way to the ch6ppinig block next both the republican and bush budget proposals are travesties when the bush administration took office the nation was experiencing record surpluses it has managed to turn a 521 billion surplus into a 367 billion deficit in contrast the spratt alternative budget as well as the congressional black caucus alternative budget that we will consider tomorrow focus national spending on priorities that benefit all americans and get us on the road to economic recovery they do this by funding key domestic priorities which address the needs of working families while fully supporting the national defense and protection of our homeland and preserving medicaid social security pension programs and student loans let me speak particularly about the budget developed by the congressional black caucus which corrects the irresponsible fiscal and economic policies contained in the house budget resolution by supporting existing programs that are essential to closing disparities creating opportunities and helping our citizens build their future it will get our country on the road to recovery while funding meaningful national priorities for our children for our seniors for our veterans and for our communities importantly the congressional black caucus budget supports these priorities while also meeting our obligation to our troops in iraq and in afghanistan the cbc budget funds community development programs including restoring funding to the community development block grant program and supporting increased funding for elderly and disabled housing programs the congressional black caucus budget will also restore funding for veterans health care rather than imposing new copayments on them for essential services and prescription drugs importantly the congressional black caucus budget will reduce the budget deficit by 167 billion during the next 5 years below the deficit that will be produced by the house budget resolution theirepublican budget cuts educational housing and health programs for our children while bequeathing to them a public debt that has increased by 1 268 trillion over the last 4 years and that will exceed 4 6 trillion even

spirit of congratulating the people of iraq he said resolved that the house of representatives congratulates the people of iraq on the three national elections conducted in iraq in 2005 imagine in january in october and now in december three times courageously they went to the polls and his resolution spells that out his resolution would encourage all americans to express support for the people of iraq in their efforts to achieve a free open and democratic society and again throughout his resolution he makes that point and he expresses thanks and admiration to the members of the united states armed forces and the armed forces of other nations in iraq including the members of the security forces of iraq whose heroism permitted the iraqi people to vote safely that is the spirit of the resolution that we should be voting on today one that brings us together that is clear to the iraqi people that their courage is an example to the world but sadly this congress is not an example of democracy to the world when instead 6f using an occasion to unify once again the republican majority brings to the floor a resolution rejecting the good offers of the gentleman from california to come together in a bipartisan way and uses what should be a cause for celebration as instead a means to denounce those who disagree not kery democratic and also to insist that if you want to congratulate the people of iraq you must support the status quo more of the same in iraq is not making the american people safer more of the same in iraq is not making our military stronger more of the same in iraq is not bringing stability to the region so i think you will see democrats united in congratulating the people of iraq commending our men and women in the armed services and supporting that in a democracy we will have different views and that we will respect them i have said it before and i will say it again senator taft who would become the republican leader of the senate during world war ii he said disagreement in time of war is essential to a governing democracy and this was during world war ii why do the republicans think that we cannot have disagreement in time of war so as we go into this holiday season i know that we can come together and say to our men and women in harms way that we honor them for their service we are grateful to them for their patriotism their courage and the sacrifice they are willing to make for our country and in this holiday season we strive for peace on earth and goodwill toward man which would not be possible without our men and women in the armed services that should be the spirit in which we go forward not in the divisive manner the republicans have put forward that is really quite sad but i hope that in the vote that we have today that the

today under the guise of commending the people of iraq for yesterdays election the republicans present a resolution that spends more time trying to justify the continued presence of unitedstates troops in iraq than congratulating the iraqis if the majority wants to debate the presidents iraq policy then let us do that a war that is now more than 1 000 days old has cost the lives of more than 2 150 americans and has not made the american people safer or the middle east more secure certainly merits debate in this house but let us do so in a way that does not insult the intelligence of the

specifically tasked the p t committees in every medicare drug plan offered to our seniors and disabled citizens with the responsibility of assuring that the formularies were medically correct and not politi cally correct furthermore medicare and medicaid prescription drug plans have a number of tools at their disposal to ensure that ed drugs are not abused and could be covered only when prescribed for medically appropriate care further since they are not sold over the counter and must be prescribed by a physician control is not difficult medicare covers many benefits in some situations and not others and ed drugs would only be another such benefit as for sex offenders crosschecking with publicly available lists of these offenders is not difficult and could prohibit ed drugs from going to sex offenders at taxpayers expense while preserving access to these drugs when medically necessary for all disabled and senior men who are not sex offenders ed drugs are covered for federal employees

cancer diabetes multiple sclerosis parkinsons or spinal cord injuries men need these medications not to enhance their lifestyle but to return them to normal just like women need reconstructive surgery to return as close as possible to normal in fact wholeness is so important that according to a university of chicago study 68 percent of men were willing to forego treatments that were more effective

most important thing was the couple and the union theyformed one of the things that some of the newer members need to realize is that what occurs in committee and on the floor is business andpeople go about their business in different ways the reason we are going to hear a number of members talk about bob in the way that we will talk about bob is because if you spend a little time getting to know

despite the laws requirement for regular congressional authorization for the justice department until just recently doj has not been formerly authorized by congress since 1980 the committee on the judiciary took action to rectify the situation in the 107th congress and reauthorized the programs within the deprtment of justice we tried again last congress however the other body did not take up our bipartisan housepassed bill i am proud to be here today to provide congress with legislation to again give direction to the department of justice and the important programs it administers dojs grant programs are an important tool in the fight against crime in america programs such as byrne cops and stop provide grants to state and local governments to focus on current crime issues affecting our communities because there are limited resources continuous congressional oversight of these programs ensures that the taxpayers money is spent appropriately this bill will ensure accountability from the department with a number of provisions designed to ensure grant recipients are meeting the conditions established by congress for the programs the bill includes an office of audit assessment and management to monitor grants and a community capacity development office to assist grant applicants and grantees in meeting grant conditions in addition to the numerous oversight tools provided in the bill there are a number of important reforms to grant programs and provisions designed to improve those programs and offices within the department the bill consolidates the local law enforcement block grant program and the byrne grant program into one program with the same purposes to eliminate duplication and improve the administration of the grants the bill preserves the cops program but addresses concerns expressed by many members about the previous use of these grants h r 3402 also allows grantees greater flexibility in the use of these funds the authorization also reauthorizes doj programs that will expire or have expired such as the juvenile accountability block grant program and the sex offender management program it also includes some very important modifications to the criminal code such as extending the statute of limitations for human trafficking offenses and applying increased criminal penalties to prison guards who sexually abuse persons in their custody titles i through ix of this bill focus on reauthorizing expanding and improving programs that wefe established in the violence against women act of 1994 and reauthorized in 2000 the bill reauthorizes some important core programs such as stop grants and grants to reduce campus violence these programs have been successful in combatting domestic violence and changing attitudes toward violence in the family in america the reauthorization of vawa in 2005 will continue to change attitudes toward domestic violence and will expand its focus to change attitudes toward other violent crimes including dating violence sexual assault and stalking because these are crimes that affect both genders it is important to note that the text of the legislation specifies that programs addressing these problems can serve both female and male victims additionally this legislation specifies that the same rules apply to these funds that apply to other federal grant programs it is illegal to use grant funds devoted to these programs for political activities or lobbying it is the intent of congress that these funds be used to provided services to victims and trained personnel who deal with these violent

they were talking about they werent talking about you they werent talking about me they are not talking about any of my other republican colleagues here but you would literally think the world was ending i have to tell you mr king how refreshing it is to come to the floor and hear you give this beautiful speech without condemning the other party but simply outlining where you are coming from in a very careful thoughtful way i really truly appreciate your expression of your beliefs about where the country should go and what is happening without throwing rocks or mud or condemning anyone else but simply outlining very beautifully what you believe now if i may i would just like to add a few comments you live in northwest iowa i was born in southwest minnesota just a few miles from there i think we have come from the same framework maybe that is another reason why i appreciate so much what you have been saying you said when you were born your glass was half full mine actually was about oneeighth full simply because i grew up in a family with considerable poverty poverty of money but great richness of persons of my parents and my siblings great richness of faith frankly that has always meant more to me than money i am not a rich man i never had very high incomes the highest income i ever received is from the congress of the united states my point is that there is more than money to this life that is whatyou were illustrating as well my cup was oneeighth full also because i had serious illness and i wasnt ever able to go to school i was homeschooled before there was such a thing as home schooling through the love of my family the encouragement of my family and friends i survived that situation and i did well in college i did well in graduate school and i ended up getting a ph d in nuclear physics and teaching physics until i ended up in the political arena so even though the glass was oneeighth full it is overflowing and has been overflowing most of my life because of these circumstances if i may add one final thought in response to the comments you made about the dot com bubble there is no question about it that dot com bubble really was a tremendous economic boom to this country if you look back over the past 50 years most of the economic growth has come from our investment in science and in scientific research the dot com bubble is a good example of that development of the internet it is amusing because i was using the internet before the rest of the world knew it existed it was a wonderful thing but we were using it as scientists to transmit voluminous amounts of data back and forth around the world and then someone gets the bright idea hey i bet the public would like to use this too and that was the start of the dot com boom as a scientist i believe it is absolutely essential for our nation to continue supporting research the basic research in the old days of monopolies at t had bell labs they could do the research ibm had their labs they did research in todays globally competitive world that is not possible the government has to do the basic research and from that industry develops the products that become very very useful to us and so i appreciate the point you made about that i just want to emphasize lets support the research that will continue having this country be the leader throughout the world in developing these products i often find people saying what do you need that research for i remember when i was a graduate student one of my colleagues at berkeley developed nuclear magnetic resonance it was a wonderful thing to investigate matter with that is what he was doing but lo and behold that is the basis of the mri machine which has been the most powerful diagnostic tool that medicine has ever seen similarly with the cat scan developed out of some work we were doing at berkeley xrays discovered by a physicist all basic research with very direct practical implications for the world today i know this is a sidetrack from the point you were making but this is what makes america great the creative ability that we have we worry about losing jobs to other countries but our creative instinct is what is going to help us win that battle we dont have the low wages they do i am glad we dont but the point is because of our creative juices in this country we come up with these great ideas the greatest country that this planet has ever seen the greatest ideas of freedom for everyone and the creative ability to meet the challenges and meet the needs ofthe people of this world today

would rather exploit african americans shorter life expectancy to sell his privatization plan than actually do something to help african americans live longer if the president is truly concerned about african americans he should support legislation and funding to address the health disparities that contribute to shorter life expectancy sadly this is just the sort of cynical divisive move we have

opriations subcommittees decision to provide 4 million for a conventional earth penetrator in the fiscal year 2006 defense appropriations bill many rogue nations unable to face the threat of our awesome firepower and precision bombs are increasingly hiding their military assets under hard geologies making it more difficult for us to hold them at risk and undermining our ability to protect the nation i believe it is vitally important that we do all we can to provide our military with the right weapons to destroy these buried targets this however does not include nuclear weapons nuclear bunker busters advocated by the administration and by their allies in congress are the dangerous fantasy of a few who are desperate to find hew missions for nuclear weapons using a nuclear weapon to try to destroy a buried bunker or other target would produce significant civilian casualties and radioactive fallout a recent national academy of sciences report states that a nuclear earth penetrator could kill up to a million people or more if used in heavily populated areas in addition unitedstates military personnel operating in the area would be at risk of death and injury the presidents repeated requests for funding a robust nuclear earth penetrator undermines the united states leadership role in nonproliferation we cannot credibly ask other countries to restrain their nuclear weapons programs while we aggressively advance work on new weapons i applaud and share chairman young and ranking member murthas concern with defeating hard and deeply buried targets while reducing fallout and collateral damage it is vital that congress send a strong message that we reject the administrations rush to find new uses for nuclear weapons the appropriations committees decision to focus taxpayer dollars on perfecting conventional means of defeating hardenedtargets instead of investigating nuclear option is the right thing to do the head of the national nuclear security administration linton brooks has testified that a nuclear earth penetrator would cause massive radioactive fallout and our own uniformed military does not want a nuclear device that would put at risk our own troops even the defense science board that advises the pentagon recently stated that us interests are best served by preserving into the future the half century plus nonuse of nuclear weapons i agree until we have exhausted all conventional mean to defeat hardened targets and there is a true military requirement for an rnep it would be irresponsible for congress to rush to find new uses for what should always be a weapon of last resort i am pleased that the funds in this bill are only to be used to study the effectiveness of a conventional device to defeat hard and deeply buried

pending conference report and thank the chairman of the homeland security appropriations subcommittee mr hal rogers for his work on this legislation i appreciate the fact that this bill includes important provisions that consolidate the noble training center with the center for domestic preparedness establish a homeland security education program and ensure fi nancial accountability of the secure border initiative which is similar to a provision of my billh r 6162that the house passed yesterday in addition this bill includes funding to add 1 500 new border patrol agents in 2004 congress authorized 2 000 new agents be added each year to date the border patrol has added fewer than 2 000 new agents in may the president announced that the border patrol will increase its ranks by 6 000 new agents by fy 2009 at the current pace we will not meet this goal i look forward to working with members of the homeland security appropriations subcommittee to ensure that the border patrol will be able to make the presidents goal a reality while i support the overall conference report i am deeply concerned with one provision included by the other body this provision would require that all instructors at the federal law enforcement training centerreferred to as fletcbe federal employees this is a terrible provision that could prevent federal law enforcement agenciesnot just ohsfrom being able to quickly and costeffectively train their officers and agents particularly in emergency circumstances like we experienced immediately after the 911 terrorist attack omb director rob portman wrote to congress on september 6th regarding dhs appropriations and expressed his serious concem that this provision is too restrictive he wrote that by preventing publicprivate competition the provisionquote deprives the department of the operational efficiencies to be gained by competition and limits its ability to direct federal resources to support other priorities i have reviewed fletcs course list and find it indefensible that anyone would advocate that only a federal employee can efficiently and effectively teach some of these courses for example why is it that only a federal employee can teach 7 habits of highly effective people or archeological resources protection or self leadership through understanding human behavior all of these are courses taught at fletc facilities all of these courses could very easily be taught by a state or local government official a college professor or a professional from the private sector since the terrorist attacks of september 11th the need for fletc training has increased dramatically and fletc is under significant strain to meet these needs should an emergency arise tomorrow i am certain that this provision will make it impossible for the department to be able to meet any surge in demand for training that might arise i urge my colleagues to consider the serious ramifications of this provision and join me in working to lift this ban in the future to ensure our federal law enforcement agencies can meet all their training needs"]]}
