diffloulties of our health care system our nation as we talked about and have talked about for several weeks does have a national health care crisis there is no question every individual knows that is the case one of the facts that in my view cannot be repeated often enough is that amenicans spend more than 800 billion on health care that is what they spent last year and it is going to be more this year with that we see health care costs that are continually rising and the numbers of uninsured continue to grow i think that we need to applaud the president for taking on the health crisis and making health care a central focus and a central project of his presidency the final details are now being hammered onut in his proposal several weeks ago in this body and i will repeat it has been mentioned here tonight that there are six principles on which this health care proposal is founded security of coverage simplicity of administration savings in costs choice among health care plans and physicians qualty of care and individual and corporate responsibility for making that system work it has been what 50 or 60 years since anyone has had the courage any president has had the courage to

much time i yield myself 3 minutes i do not believe this will be a long drawnout process i think we have worked out the details of this amendment so that it can be accepted it is not controversial let me begin by thanking the distinguished gentlewoman from new york for working with me in cosponsoring this amendment because i think it articulates on a bipartisan basis exactly what we are trying to do many of you will recall that in the last reauthorization we struggled to deal with the controversies we did that by doing two things one of which was to reform the grants process the second was to literally increase the amount of money which went back to the states from 20 to 27 percent when we held the hearings on the reauthorization and i am committed to a simple extension to give miss alexander every opportunity to look at the agency and its programs before we do a more substantive reauthorization in a couple of years i was alarmed to discover however that a significant number of states had decreased state support for the arts at the very time that the federal government through this increased return of money to the states had increased our federal allocations let me give my colleagues an example in 1991 the nea basic grants to the states increased by almost 25 percent from 21 million to 526 2 million and yet 24 of the 50 states reduced their funding from the previous year in 1993 despite the nea basic grants increasing by 5 percent 35 of the 50 states cut funding for the arts recognizing that this was happening although we thought it was not the intent of our last reauthorization we felt it would be important that we would simply put into this legislation the simple reauthorization frankly a clarification that if a state cuts their support funding for the arts they are not going to receive an increase in federal funding in the next year we are trying to send the signal you cant supplant state funds with federal funds and we are frankly trying to send the opportunity for our state art commissions to leverage to the maximum degree possible their state funding we think this amendment accomplishes all of that without any kind of negative harm the amendment that im offering has a very simple and straightforward objective i do not think that the federal gov emient through the nfa should be increasing its contribution to state arts programs when there is evidence that the states thenselves are cutting back on their own commitment to the ails consistent with this view the amendment which i am offerng says that the nea wil not increase its direct grant to any state which has decreased its own funding for the arts from a 3year average base level i have worked with the democratic side of the committee on education and labor as well as with the administration to insure that this amendment is as fair as it can possibly be and that it does not punish states which have had to reduce their arts funding as part of overall budget cuts i would point out to my colleagues that when congress reauthorized the nea in 1990 i was sponsor of efforts to increase the percentage of nea funds going directly to the states we increased the basic state grant from 20 to 27 5 percent of the neas budget and made other changes which directed an additional 7 5 percent of nea funds to rural and underserved state programs i am a proponent not an opponent of federal support for state arts programs it was not my intention in 1990 or today however nor was it the committee on education and labors intention that these additional federal funds should be used to supplant existing state funding in fact the 1990 reauthorization act specifically prohibited states from using these additional federal dollars to offset reductions in their own funding for the arts nonetheless there is good reason to at least suspect that this is in fact occurring back in june during a hearing on this reauthorizatlo i heard testimony which suggested that the increased nea funding going directly to states and rural communities as a result of my efforts in 1990 was among other things compensating for reductions in aft unding at the state level i asked my stalf to look k~thar into the trend in state funding for arts pro grams as compared to the trend in federal support for those state programs vhle the data is not conclusive it certainly substantiated my initial concerns in the last 3 fiscalyears 24 38 and 35 states and territories of the unied states have reduced their own funding for state arts programs by an average of better than 12 percent during the same pe od federal grants to states for the ats have increased from a 1990 base of 21 5 to 27 3 millona 30 percent increase let me present some statistics which give evidence of the problem in fiscal year 1991 24 ofthe 50 states and territories reduced arts funding from the previous years level one state cut spending by more than 50 percent thirteen states cut spending by more than 25 percent overall spending for the arts was reduced by 10 5 percent among the 24 states which cut als funding the average reduction was 16 percent at the same time nea basec grants to states increased

representative of what is happening in a majority of states i understand that state budgets have been under extreme pressure over the last several years and i am not intent on punishing states for having made difficult budget decisions in order to make that perfectly clear to the committee i have revised the amendment which i introduced initially so that a states basic grant would only be capped in cases where cuts in a states arts programs were disproportionate to cuts made in other nonmandatory programs thus a state which made an across the board cut in nonmandatory programs would not i repeat not be effected by this amendment a state would only be effected if it were to cut nonmandatory spending over a 3year period by an average of 5 percent for example while cutting arts funding over the same period by 15 percent that it would be penalized i would point out further mr chairman that my amendment will not barring an overall cut in the nea budgetcut federal arts grants to any state it only says that we will not increase the federal grant to any state which haddisproportlonately cut its own arts budget i do not think this is either inappropriate or punitive given the budget crunch we are trying to deal with i am pleased to say that the administration agrees with me on this i have been called personally by the acting chair of the nea anna steele and she has told nhe that neither the nea nor the administration objects to this amendment the federal budget is under no less pressure than the states budgets and we are being asked to make decisions about priorities that are no less painful than those being made in statehouses we should not under the circumstances ask the federal government to make sacrifices in order to increase funding for state art programs

after a similar amendment to the nasa authorization bill was considered and failed by one vote the question is why should the committee on rules less than a week after we voted on this issue make it in order to vote on it again i think the answer is an important one and one that i hope some of my colleagues who voted against the roemer zimmer amendment on wednesday will consider carefully the fact is that a vote for a program in the context of an authorization bill is essentially a free vote because it is not competing against any other program as senator hatfield was quoted as saying in todays washington post legislative authorization is a hunting license because it allows a department or agency to look for funding actually to carry out the authorized programs in contrast when you look at the space station in the context of an appropriations bill as we will today you are talking about a zero sum game because every dollar spent on the space station is a dollar less spent on something else it is either a dollar less spent on deficit reduction a dollar less spent on veterans programs a dollar less spent on housing programs or as my colleague from florida has pointed out a dollar less spent on nasa itself the fact is that in ramping up space station expenditures in the appropriations bill in order to meet the request of the clinton administration the space shuttleprogram had to take a considerable reduction in its funding in the appropriations committee similarly there was a 40 million cut made in the hope program the home ownership program initiated by jack kemp in the last administration in order to free up money for the space station so this is a vote in the context of the real world a vote in the context of competing needs and competing demands for our budget dollars and in the context of an overall commitment that many of us have made for deficit reduction that is why many members who voted last year against killing the space station when the proposal was an amendment to an authorization bill shortly afterwards voted in favor of a similar amendment in the context of an appropriations bill that is why this year i anticipate that many

and in comments back and forth that these figures have been attacked but i just want to tell my colleagues that these hunting days that have been documented back in 1992 at 178 000 are predominantly in the east mojave area that would be protected under my amendment these estimates on the hunter days are based on the same accepted standards used by federal and state agencies throughout the united states the permits for the limited sheep hunting are auctioned and have brought in approximately 500 000 over 7 years to a dedicated account under the active management of the california department of fish and game this herd is actually growing i could go through the days of hunting that are attributable to various species for example dove it is 23 000 hunter days quail 37 000 chukar 5 000 jackrabbit 11 000 for coyotes 3 000 and for deer 19 000 hunter days a very significant and important part of my amendment that is in the bill or in the amendment says and i am reading from the bill here the secretary may designate areas where and establish periods when no hunting fishing or trapping will be permitted for reasons of public safety administration or compliance with provisions of applicable law so really what we are giving the secretary is the ability to suspend hunting in that area when he feels that in emergencies there should be a closure and this would be pursuant to a subsection that could be put into effect only after consultation with the appropriate state agency having responsibility for fish and wildlife in that area let me say to my colleagues that there are many groups that support this amendment the california department of fish and game the wildlife legislative fund of america the international association of fish and wildlife agencies the north american foundation for wild sheep the california outdoor sportsmens coalition the united conservation alliance the isaac walton league in california and other chapters around the country and the california wildlife federation the western association of fish and wildlife agencies and that is made up of all state fish and game agencies of alaska arizona california colorado hawaii idaho montana nevada new mexico north dakota oregon south dakota utah washington and wyoming i just want to say that the designation as a preserve points out that this is a 20yearold tool somebody may ask my colleagues may ask who came up with this idea the answer is that we did we in congress came up with this preserve hunting in certain areas where there were conflicts where we wanted to provide for the traditional uses in these areas and it works the national preserve designation was created by congress in the 1970s the fundamentals are identical whether it is a park or a preserve many people will attack this amendment today and say we have degraded the status from a park to a preserve but really it is not degraded and the park service protects this area and manages the area very much in the same manner as they would in a park we have provided for preserves in the creation of the big thicket national preserve in texas and the big cypress national preserve in florida since that time we

civilian b students work for a variety of employers located on federal government property in a normal community these local businesses employ workers and pay property taxes to the local school

yet received no further legislative action in this regard it is incumbent upon us to pass this measure in order to once again drive home the importance of achieving real budget process reform we are all well aware of the current practice in congress of bundling the thousands of federal spending programs we oversee into the 13 appropriations bills while this process helps to assure that federal funds are distributed equitably it is clear that this process has been abused by passing h r 4600 we have the opportunity to prevent further abuse all too often we hear reports of errant projects slipped into appropriations bills thereby circumventing the required scrutiny of the authorization process in other instances our fiscal needs simply change over the course of the year and we find there is room to reduce substantially or totally eliminate funding which has been included in appropriations bills h r 4600 recognizes these possibilities and provides a mechanism to effectuwte such spending reductions while still maint ning the constitutionally mandated balance of power between the congress and the president with respect to the appropriation of funds pursuant to h r 4600 the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 would be amended to provide for a fasttrack process for considering and voting on presidential proposals embodied in a bill to rescind budget authority provided for in an appropriations measure the bill also provides for a procedure for the congress to consider an alternative rescissions package drafted by the house or senate appropriations committees specifically the bill will give the president the authority to pick out of appropriations bills which he signs those items which he feels are wasteful or which should not have been included in the bill in the first place if the president submits his rescission proposal within 3 days after signing an appropriations bill a legislative process is automatically triggered whereby a house floor vote on the presidents rescissions package must take place within 10 legislative days of introduction if the presidents rescissions proposal is rejected by the house a vote on an alternative rescissions bill reported by the house appropriations committee must be taken by the close of business on the 11 th day following introduction of the presidents rescission package if the house does not pass either the presidents rescissions package or the appropriation committees alternative measure the senate would not act however if the house passes either the presidents rescission proposal or the appropriations committees altemative bill the senate would have the opportunity to vote on the presidents package as in the house if the senate rejects the presidents proposal the senate maj consider an altemative rescissions package reported by the senate appropriations committee the senate would only have 10 legislative days within which to consider the presidents proposal and the

will maintain congress constitutional prerogative to appropriate funds without unduly shifting power to the executive branch i strongly support the expedited rescissions process however it wouldbe a myopic view of the deficit problem we currently face to assume that merely passing h r 4600 will resolve this comprehensive fiscal dilemma rather the expedited rescissions process is a good step in the right direction toward restoring real discipline to the budget process in addition to this initiative we must continue to carefully scrutinize appropriations bills in order to identify spending programs which we dont need or cant afford moreover we must follow up on that scrutiny by continuing to make the tough choices to cut programs regardless of their popularity or political appeal h r

program we welcome these changes since latinos are severely represented in the health professions as the committee report notes the participation rates of latinos in this program and other programs authorized by this act are unacceptably low this legislation reauthorizes the community and migrant health center programs which are badly needed in latino communities latinos who live in urban settings face severely limited health care options because there are too few providers and the health care facilities are overcrowded many urban latinos are forced to delay care or receive disjointed care studies of latino communities in new york city like the one i represent reveal that existing health care providers could only meet 50 percent of the residents needs for primary health care visits latinos who live in rural areas also face a dearth of primary care facilities and health care providers many latinos communities on the unites statesmexico border do not have a single doctor many
