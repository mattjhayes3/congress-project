think that it is useful in reviewing this proposal to put it to two tests the first test is does the policy work on the ground in nicaragua and is it likely to succeed this is a military action by soldiers that we are supporting and i think that as we think about whether or not they could militarily succeed putting aside the cia reports and even our own defense reports that say they are unlikely to overthrow the sandinistas it is important to review a little history of our involvement in nicaragua the united states has invaded nicaragua 12 times in history if you go the 1920s and 1930s it sounds an awful lot like the congressional record of today and if you look at the old newspapers from those periods you will see that the headlines remind you of the headlines of today so to the people of nicaragua the people that were involved in those times this is nothing new 1 1700 i think a second fact we must recognize is that in the late 1970s when this country underwent a revolution 50 000 nicaraguans lost their lives this is a country of about 3 3 million and if we remember in the vietnam conflict we lost about 50 000 people on almost any day you can drive by the vietnam memorial here and get a sense of what that conflict and that loss of life meant in this country so we can imagine what that meant in nicaragua when we begin thinking about whether or not a military solution to the problem is something that can work on the ground in nicaragua so i simply submit on the basis of that anecdotal evidence and the evidence we see from our own military and our own central intelligence agency that having a military policy and a military solution to our problems is not likely to succeed i think the next thing we should look at is this does the policy reach the goals and the vital interests of the united states on this point i think there has been some confusion because we have many different goals that are enunciated by the administration i think we should try to better articulate what our goals are i think there are two i think we have two vital interests in nicaragua the first is to reduce the foreign military influences in that country certainly soviet cuban libyan whatever foreign military influence is in this country and the second is to keep the sandinistas from interfering with their neighbors with many of whom we have treaties and obligations if we put this policy against that testwhat are our goals and are we reaching them i think members would agree with me that we are not previous speakers on the other side have said that we just cannot negotiate with communists certainly there are people in our country who have that view i do not think the president has that view if he did have that view he would not be negotiating with mikhail gorbachev and the soviet union if he did have that view he would not be negotiating with the chinese on a variety of subjects and i believe that the president has even said that the contras are in the field in order to put pressure on the sandinistas so that we can get to negotiations to resolve and reconcile our vital interests if that is our goal then what are the people in the region who are leading the effort and working to make this effort come about saying about contra aid president arias who is the author of the live and viable plan of the moment said when he received his nobel peace prize that president reagan knows very welland i quote that the contras are the problem and not the solution and yesterday the people who have been active n the contadora process said this we urgently call upon the countries with ties or interests in the region to halt unconditionally unilaterally and immediately any actions aimed at destablization or any type of aid to irregular forces as is established in the san jose declaration for the attainment of peace and democracy n central america in conclusion i would say let us give peace a chance let us give the people in the region a chance we have been trying the military solution for 6 years now let us give the other way a chance let us give life to the words of a great american uttered about his brother when he said we see wrong and try to right it we see suffering and try to heal it and we see war and try to stop it we have tried the military solution let us try something else let us give peace a

reconciliation bill for fiscal year 1988 this vital piece of legislation will be an important element in sustaining this nations increasingly fragile economic health l want to take this opportunity to congratulate both chairman rostenkowski and chairman gray for their dedication to the process that has brought us to this point today i commend them for their leadership during the many hours of difficult often fractious debate on this reconciliation package now the time has come for us tomake an extremely difficult decision and the alternatives to this bill are simply unpleasant the consequences of this legislation are many are obvious and are considerable if we do not approve this bill what will be the reaction in financial markets around the world and how serious will our efforts to being down the deficit be viewed by the american public not very i fear if we fail to pass this bill the impact of automatic budget cuts under the grammrudmanhollings law will be devastating for every segment of our societythe rich and the poor white collar and blue collar whites blacks hispanics the northeast and southwestno one and no place can expect to be spared the consequences if we fail to act and given the recent turmoil in the worlds financial markets what we are trying to do today still may not be enough to reassure those markets the messages coming from wall street and from main street are crystal clear get the economy back on an even keel and do whatever is absolutely necessary to do it that means reduce the deficit now not later even if that means raising taxes president reagan has expressed confidence in the economy and contends that all the economic indicators are robust i have a distinctly different view of just how robust the economy is today consider these indicators the trade defiitin the month ofaugust the trade deficit was 15 7 billion bringing the cumulative total for the year to 114 1 billion thats 6 billion ahead of last years record setting trade deficit unemploymentofficially more than 7 million americans remain out of work despite the nearly 5 years of steady economic expension povertymore than 36 million americans are officially living at or below the poverty level many of these people hold jobs that pay minimum wage a level of income that has lost nearly a third of its value to inflation over the past 8 years and a recent study by the physicians task force on hunger in america reports that as many as 20 million children elderly and blue collar workers are undernourished and this in a country that has witnessed record grain harvests for 3 straight years if these are the good times as so many in the reagan administration assert i shudder to think what bad times would bring what if we do not pass this reconciliation bill we all know what will happen the automatic budget cuts as required by law will cut a large swath through every government agency and coincidentally just days before our national thanksgiving holiday lets take a look at where some of these automatic cuts would occur in housing the only federal program that provides specially designed housing for the elderly would be cut by more than 1 000 units we can scarcely afford to reduce the availability of these units considering that by 1995 one in three households will be elderly in addition public housing subsidies would be trimmed by 120 million in programs providing funds for desperately needed repairs and maintenance federal education programs would be slashed a whopping 1 8 billion deep cuts would be made i n programs for disadvantaged children and in financial assistance to lowincome college students more than 340 million would be lost to community development urban development and economic development grant programs these programs have served as the cornerstone of federal assistance to local governments striving to revitalize their cities drug abuse programs a major priority of the white house would lose nearly 12 million while the drug enforcement agency stands to be cut by nearly 43 million but among all this carnage there is one cut under grammrudmanhollings that seems to make a lot of sensethe 4 3 million reduction for the office of management and budget these automatic budget cuts simply make no sense especially coming as they would at a time when the united states is struggling to recover from a historic trade imbalance just a few short months ago the house passed a landmark trade bill among the bills provisions are programs to bolster education and job training programs as a means of improving our competitive position in world trade i cannot think of a better way to shoot ourselves in the foot on trade than to allow these automatic spending eductions to take place at this critical juncture jeopardizing these types of educational and job opportunities these is however a practical and workable alternative beforeus today we can and we must reassure the country and the world that we will not tolerate massive budget and trade deficits any longer we can take an important and long overdue first step in that direction by passing this bill while this bill makes an important contribution to reducing the deficit it also includes some important provisions related to health care and to pensions of particular interest to me is a provision that will permit medicare certification of infant heart transplants in conjunction with hospitals performing adult heart transplants this program will provide a crucial model to other health insurance programs and demonstrate what are needed criteria for establishing similar pediatric coverage i this bill also includes reforms in medicare payment practices that will save 650 million over 3 years by reducing allowable payments for eight procedures that the physicians pay ment review commission has determined are overpriced by medicare other various payments to participating physicians hospitals and other providers are also reduced for savings of approximately 9 4 billion over the next 3 years this represents greater efficiency and more accountability in the medicare program over the long term these reforms should vastly improve the quality of care the elderly receive the bottom line on medicare in this bill is that beneficiaries are protected from the deep cuts we have been required to make the bill also further protects participants from billing problems by now requiring that even those physicians not accepting medicare assignment must file claims directly to medicare under this change physicians would bill participants for only that portion of the bill that medicare will not reimburse the bill also instructs the department of health and human services to develop fee schedules for radiologic and anesthesia services and for durable medical equipment such as prosthetics and establishes new coverage for therapeutic footwear required for the treatment of severe diabetic foot disease this reform would produce a savings of 110 mil h9173 lion over 3 years by reducing the need for hospitalization and surgery finally this bill encourages states to voluntarily establish health insurance risk pools so that those individuals who cannot afford to buy private health insurance or do not have access to employersponsored plans will be able to have some type of basic minimum health coverage in the area of pensions new stiffer require ments ate included in this bill to ensure that retirees can count on the benefits they have been promised furthermore to ease the burden on the pension benefits guaranty corporation the cost of insurance premiums to corporations enjoying the protection of the agency has been wisely increased the higher premiums will make a significant contribution to the financial health of this overwhelmed agency other pension reforms wil hopefully discourage some employers from terminating pension plans and encourage others to maintain full funding of their plans in the end what this bill does is begin the process of restoring the peoples faith in our ability to deal with the deficit on a bipartisan basis there are no smoke and mirrorsin this package and we have not turned our back on the tax reforms of 1986 intended to benefit low and middleincome taxpayers the revenues raised in this bill are a careful thoughtful balance of fees proposed by president reagan on users of federal services various business taxes and extensions of current tax laws or closing some loopholes we cannot afford to miss this historic opportunity to turn the corner on the budget deficit i urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to consider the events of the past 2 weeks and vote in favor of this bill"], [0.0003587007522583008,

involved in the detailed process of trying to put something together that meets the test that we would all want to employ when dealing with any of our constitujune 30 1987 ents federal employees or anyone else i think that they have come up with a better approach than the senate and the executive order and i cite to areas first i would like to talk about the facilities that do drug testing the only regulations that drug testing facilities would have to meet under the senate language is applicable state license requirements in other words this means that 50 different regulations for our federal employees could well apply there is no consistency some states have stringent requirements many do not these guidelines have never received public comment and all of our constitutents who are federal employees who are exposed to this panoply of differences could easily provide for court cases litigations on violations of individual rights because of inconsistencies more importantly i would like to talk for a minute about the confidentiality issue that my friend from texas touched on just a minute ago if my colleagues look at the federal register it says agencies are not required to report to the attorney general for investigation or prosecution any information allegation and so forth the hoyer language instead of the senate language does not leave that issue up in the air for determination by the agency they provide confidentiality we do not want to prosecute people we want to counsel people we do not want to throw people out of their workplace we want to make it possible for them to rehabilitate themselves and maintain a job i think this is a preferable approach and i think it really does go to the issue that is stated and exists in the executive order i would point out an executive order is just that and it can be changed we need to have in statute the kinds of protections that the language of the gentleman from maryland would provide as a member of the joint housesenate conference committee on the supplemental appropriations bill h r 1827 i strongly support this amendment to the bill i agree that a drugfree workplace is essential to a productive and efficient government a career in public service isa point of pride for our federal employees they no less than ourselves demand a healthy and safe working environment in order to protect the constitutional rights of our federal workers it is essential that we develop uniform standards and procedures to protect the constitutional rights of these individuals without strict guidelines only abuses of the system will occur and individuals careers put in jeopardy such instances are not uncommon i would like to relate to you a few horror stories which only emphasize the need for strong regulations of drug testing a research biologist at a toxicolog y laboratory at an army chemical research center at aberdeen proving ground in maryland recently received a false positive on a drug test at that time aberdeen tested employees without having any standard operating procedures this woman was given a nonsterile cup and told to provide her sample with a witness observing because she had previously investigated the armys drug testing program she immediately took annual leave and went to two local hospitals and had her urine tested at her own expense both tests were negative since the armys program requires twostage testing of employee samples provided subjects have signed a consent formher sample had to be sent to another laboratory her second level testing sample arrived 4 days after the 3day shipping time required under army regulations she waited 21 days before receiving a negative result irom the secondlevel testing not only was this an unreasonable amount of time to wait for a result of such a crucial test this federal employee had to go to court to prevent the army from further testing until the secondlevel testing results came back negative another horror story recently came to surface when a chemist in charge of analyzing drug tests performed on airplane pilots and railroad crews involved in accidents pleaded guilty last month to charges that he falsified records in three cases to conceal the tact that tests were never performed as director of the forensic toxicology research unitoperated by the federal aviation administrationmr delbert j lacefield reported negative results on blood samples taken after three train crashes when in fact the tests were never performed since mr lacefield did not receive any financial compensation for his actions it is speculated that he did not want to admit that the lab lacked the expertise to conduct the tests or that the loss of a key contract with the railroad administration amounting to 200 000 was another consideration a further investigation of the incident uncovered reports that found that several employees complained about the quality of work done by the lab documents obtained from the investigation showed that questions about the laboratory performance had been raised a year ago and in fact the armed forces institute of pathology wrote last june 25 in a twopage memo to dr frank h austin then the federal aviation administrations federal air surgeon that at present quality control is performed in a very unstructured manner in light of this discovery and other related incidents i believe it is essential that the conference committees amendment remetin untouched if the senate provisions are acopted we will without a doubt see further deterioration of quality control the only regulations that drug testing facilities would have to meet under the senate language is applicable state license requirements this means 50 different regulations for our federal employees there is no consistency

to accept these provisions on which there have been no hearings no debate and no votes in the subcommittees and committee of jurisdiction in the house of representatives there are at least three key reasons why i think it would be a mistake to attempt to bring the s 790 issues to the floor of the house in the form of a conference report at the present time first the issues are too important to be acted on without hearings debate and votes within the committee and on the house floor the house should have an opportunity to work its wifl on each of these issues second the parliamentary procedure we would face with such a conference is so convoluted and involved to render the objective a virtual impossibility third the issues involved in the senate bill are so controversial that such a conference would almost certainly doom chances for early action on fslic something that has become very close to an emergency situation that has little room left for more delays let me just outline some of the parliamentary problems facing us if we tried to deal with the s 790 package assuming passage of h r 27 this approach would then require the chairman to ask unanimous consent to have the text of h r 27 substituted for the text of s 790 and request a conference there is no doubt in my mind that there would be an objection to this unanimous consent request assuming and i think it is a fair assumption the unanimous consent would be objected to one would then go back into committee and have the committee direct its chairman to go back to the floor and move to go to conference with the senate on their legislation i do not believe the committee nor the house would act favorably on such a request but lets assume the unanimous consent request is approved we then would go to conference with the senate banking committee the house containing a onetitle bill and the senate containing 10 titles 9 of which bear no relationship to the house bill as far as the house germaneness rule is concemed in conference the house conferees hands would be severely tied we could not seek to amend their 10 titlies to more adequately perhaps reflect the house views because we would run into very serious scope problems which would completely kill the conferencereported bill in the house and in fact force us back to conference on just the fslic titles in both bills the house conferees would be forced therefore to essentially adopt all of the language contained in the 10 senate titles without any substantive change whatsoever and report these titles back to the house under the house rules as members of the house know these 10 titles of the senate bill not germane to the house bill would all be subject to challenge under the germaneness rule and therefore subject individually to separate votes under this kind of scenario any reasonable person would have to conclude the house would reject any and all of these 10 titles simply because neither the house nor its banking committee would have had an opportunity to address these issues in a normal legislative fashion i have discussed these matters with a number of members of the house banking committee on both sides of the aisle and with the leadership of the house this morning i met with the democrats in a committee caucus there is a strong consensus in favor of dealing with the very important issue of fslic now and taking up the other issues in s 790 in regular orderwith hearings and the opportunity for the committee and the house to work its will it is therefore my considered opinion to proceed in regular order towit it is my intention a to seek expeditious action by the house on h r 27 the fslic recapitalization legislation and b to have s 790 referred to the house committee on banking finance and urban affairs for its consideration it is my intention to have the financial institutions subcommittee of the house banking committee proceed to full hearngs on the matters contained in s 790 as well as others i

i have sat on the committee on the budget and watched us cut many many programs some of which are very near and dear to me year after year and this year when we compiled the functions on the budget committee in terms of the increase that each of them had from 1981 to 1986 much to my surprise the highest increase was not defense was not medicare but was agriculture which had gone up more than 100 percent yet at the same time i saw around me the very farmers whom these programs were intended to help complaining that they were not getting the help they needed complaining that the government programs had not worked the gao study only points the way in describing how these programs have not worked but i think it is time to send a message to the unitedstates department of agriculture that they had better start cleaning things up so that the enormous amount of money we spend goes to some good it is my guess ladies and gentlemen that the kind of thing that happended to the defense department budget with the expose of 45 wrenches and 800 toilet seats the same thing that happend to the social service programs with the expose of welfare mothers driving cadillacs or using food stamps to purchase alcoholic beverages will indeed happen to agriculture if the kind of abuses pointed out in the gao study are indeed allowed to continue usda has allowed the 50 000 cap that the committee on agriculture placed in the law to become a total farce for the past 3 years large farmers have been reorganizing their farms on paper only and qualifying for multitudes of 50 000 payments so in the middle of a terrible family farm crisis the federal government has become the private subsidizer of large corporate farms while the us census shows a decrease in the number of farmers

there are many areas of usda failure their regulations are so vague under this 50 000 limit that they are meaningless let me read one any change in farming operations that would otherwise serve to increase the number of persons for application of the payment limitation must be bona fide and substantive vagaries have led to outrageous abuses in california 28 investors received 1 4 million collectively by leasing 6 600 acres of farm land from a parent company and then subleasing it to a management firm a rice farm in california was divided up 56 ways in 1984 with the farmers splitting 1

that in all honesty it has been a very painful process for all of us here who have a deep sense of commitment to israel who want to see her survive who want to see her maintain her special relationship with our country and who want to see her maintain the very special moral and ethical quality that has differentiated israel from all the governments in the middle east and most of the governments in the world it has been painful for those of us who care about those things to see what is going on and i hope very much that israel will cease the policy of public beatings breaking hands and breaking bones in response to arab violence i regret saying this publicly but congressman barney frank of massachusetts did bring up this subject and he treated it in a very thoughtful way so perhaps it is appropriate to comment on it i expressed these views privately in an hourlong meeting with the israeli ambassador to the united states about a month ago so here i am going public but let me just add a footnote that first of all these are very trying experiences under similarly trying experiences with comparatively untrained or insufficiently trained troops we had our kent state we had our my lai and we consider ours a moral and an ethical country but sometimes the training of troops and the training of national guard personnel is not sufficient for the extraordinary conditions under which they all of a sudden have to function and i suspect there was some degree of lack of training and lack of preparedness for these violent episodes on the part of the israeli troops they are trained soldiers and they are trained for combat they are not trained for civil disobedience and civil rebellion and it must be quite clearly recognized that these young kids these palestinian kids were not playing kids games they were not playing spih the bottle they were not playing mumbletypeg they were playing lethal games when you throw a molotov cocktail people get killed when you throw large hunks of rock and cement people get killed a young arab youth was killed by a hunk of cement that was thrown by a palistinian and we have seen pictures of both soldiers and television cameramen writhing on the ground in agony after having been hit by large rocks these are very serious lethal games that the palestinian youth are playing apparently these lethal games are not entirely spontaneous some kind of master hand is organizing them and guiding them and i think the israeli government has an absolute right in its own self defense to meet that kind of lethal violence with sufficient force to quell it and to control it it is very difficult to measure what kind of force is sufficie force as we have found out in our country let me also say that the israeli government for 40 years repeatedly has expressed the position that it is willing to sit down with the arabs and talk about all the issues the only arab chief of tate who took them up on that was president sadat and we all know regrettably the tragic history that ensured fi 9m his pattern of cooperation and hi openhandedness in dealing with the state of israel assassination has become an accepted means of political expression in the arab world and no doubt one of the reasons which gives king hussein pause at accepting a public posture of cooperating with the is aelis is the memory that he has frorm childhood of the vision of his grandflther being shot down in cold blood by arab extremists when there was suspicion that his grandfather was cooperating with the jewish agency of palestine of course this long precedes the establishment of the jewish state in 1948 and perhaps it was true that he was cooperating with the jewish agency for palestine in trying to bring some kind of common understanding some kind of consensus some kind of compromise and some kind of conciliation to the very troubled period in those days predating the founding of the state of israel tlpat policy of assassination for willingness to meet with the israelis halfway or even a quarter of the way has persisted there have been a whole string of political assassinations directed against the socalled arab moderate such as the massacre of syrian citizens in the village of horns by syrian troops those assassinations have no doubt had a very stultifying impact on tlhe willingness of arab chiefs of state or arab civilians andcivic leaders to express some willingness to meet israel at the conference table israel today has a clearly expressed position of being ready to sit down and negotiate with the arabs on every aspect of peace whether israel should agree to a process of trading land for peace is a decision that only the israelis are capable of making how much land for how much peace i could not define the land areas on the west bank or in gaza that israel could reasonably give up without having to face far higher security risks these are very sophisticated military and security decisions that i do not feel qualified to make i am not sure that many of the 535 members of the house and senate are qualified to make that decision either how much peace what does peace mean peace certainly means more than nonbelligerency israel gave up a very considerable portion of land in the sinai desert to establish peace with egypt yet they did not get peace what they got was a minimal level of nonbelligerency peace means far more than that peace means commerce peace means the exchange of students peace means the exchange of scientists peace means the exchange of business people peace means joint programs for development of all kinds peace meaiis joint telecommunications projects involving radio and telephone and television peace means joint projects affecting the environment such as the mutual joint exploitation of the scarce water resources in the middle east and peace means the exchanr e of cultural representatives even with egypt the one country in the middle east that has gone further than a status of total belligerency even with that country israel signed a peace treaty but did not get peace at the most they have gotten a begrudging arrangement for nonbelligerency that is a lot the absence of war is a heck of a lot better than a continuation of war but still israel paid a great price for peace and did not ever get what we normally think of as the full measure of peace and the blessings of peace they got a small measure of nonbelligerency nothing more so israel had to do some agonizing introspection on how much land will not jeopardize their security for how much peace how much can israel trust a signature an arab signature on a peace treaty i do not know the answer to that i suspect the israelis are far more sophisticated and far better equipped to make that decision of haw much land they are willing to sacrifice for a collection of arab signatires on a peace treaty i suspect that the israelis are far letter qualified to make the decision a to whether if the arabs ever had a viable military option they would not instantaneously take advantage of it no matter how many signatures were on how many peace treaties i cannot answer that question all of these issues have to be factored into the question of how much land for how much peace these are agonizing questions for all of us and i would state that our predilection for pushing israel against her better judgment into a posture of agreeing to make some sacrifices of land for some kind of peace is basically dubious proposition i know that president reagan and secretary shultz would desperately and urgently like to see some kind of resolution or at least the beginnings of some kind of resolution to these agonizingly complicated and emotion ridden anxiety ridden problems of the middle east it is only natural they would they would take legitimate pride in that accomplishment i give president reagan total credit for having been a friend of peace in the middle east and having been a stout and loyal friend of the state of israel i give secretary shultz credit beyond my ability to express in words he has been an extraordinarily talented thoughtful wise human being in his policies toward the middle east and i must say that when he was appointed secretary of state coming to that job from the vantage point of having been ceo or chief executive officer of the bechtel corp doing billions of dollars of business in the middle east i and some of my colleagues had some pretty profound reservations about him but they were quickly dispelled when we had a chance to hear him out discuss the issues with him and watch his performance he is an extraordinary man no matter what administration succeeds the reagan administration i suspect that secretary shultz will be sorely missed for his great qualities of heart his great qualities of intellect and his great qualities of integrity and decency that shine forth in every arena he is a remarkable human being but i suggest that we have to think about a whole long succession of presidents at least since world war ii almost every one of whom had the same conviction that they wanted to settle this agonizingly difficult problem of the middle east on their turf they have come up with one quick fix after another in the 40 years since world war ii the israelis have a long memory and they have to place all these individual efforts by individual presidents and secretaries of state to find a solution to the problem on their watch they have to view all of these successive efforts with a long and deep sense of history and perhaps they look around the world and see that some problems just cannot be solved by a quick neat solution we have problems with the soviet union that apparently although hopefully they are being reduced in order of magnitude now for 40 years since world war ii have been virtually intractable after all of the negotiations that have taken place over the 7 years of the reagan administration we and the soviets are each still spending 300 billionodd a year on defense hopefully we will gradually reduce that amount but we have not solved the basic problems between ourselves and the soviet union the british who are about as civilized a people as has ever populated this earth have still got agonizingly difficult problems with the irish the irish have agonhlingly difficult problems between irish catholics and irish protestants when you go to ireland and you visit with the protestant leadership in belfast and then you say what wonderful people they are they are intelligent they are thoughtful they are witty and they have got a rich history surely they can be expected to negotiate away these problems then you go to dublin and you meet with the irish catholic leadership and you say what marvelous thoughtful intelligent people these are why cant they get together well they have not gotten together these problems go back 400 years apparently they are virtually intractable there arc other places around the world the problems that the belgians have with nonbelgianspeaking groups and the problems the frenchcanadiansthe quebecquoise the levesque supportershave with the englishspeaking government in canada seem to be comparatively intractable as well so there are problems around the world which do not seem to be susceptible to a quick fix of easy rapid solutions it is just possible that the israelis thinkand i do not know this for a factthat there are not any quick fixes to the problems between arabs and israelis and that in all likelihood once they get into the business of territoryforpeace they are going to be under great pressure to make sacrifices of territory that are not in their best interests there are some israelis who have profound misgivings about the nature and quality of the land they gave back to egypt when they made a peace with egypt i think they expected a larger richer definition of peace than what they got so there may be some reservations about moving down that slippery slope of peaceforterritory or territoryforpeace i would respect their right to make those decisions and i would respect their right to tell us look we understand your tremendous eagerness your noteworthy praiseworthy eagerness to bring some kind of solace peace and reconciliation to the middle east but after the peace conference is over you all go back home and we are the ones who are left to live with these understandings we are the ones who have to evaluate over the years how much territorial sacrifice in terms of real security we made for how much of a peace what value do we place on that peace how much can we rely on that peace how much can we rely on the integrity of the arab signatures on that peace treaty there is no one who can make those decisions there is no one who can examine that calculus of factors other than the israelis themselves so i want to say how much i respect congressman frank for the very thoughtful way in which he treated this issue i want to say how much i respect the 30odd members of the senate for their bona fides and their real desire to contribute to world peace by the letter that they recently wrote to prime minister shamir but i think on the bottom line once we have made some suggestions and once as friends we have given whatever advice we choose to give the israelis on the way they have controlled the riotsand remember from their point of view it has to be considered gratuitous adviceonce we have given them our best judgment on adopting this policy or that policy or refusing to adopt this posture or that posture and explain that their decision may have a price tag and may cost them in good will military and economic aid and may cost them in credibility around the world then i think in all fairness we ought to let the israeli knesset the israeli military and security branches of their government make the hard decisions on into the actual process of reconciliation negotiation and compromise they have had the offer on the table ever since 1948 to talk what kind of preconditions we should impose upon them as to how and under what circumstances the talks get started is a very serious question i suggest that we should be very reluctant to force israel into any format into any system of negotiations that they feel may threaten their security they are a sovereign state we are a great friend of theirs we can give them advice and counsel and express the costs and the benefits to them of various alternative policies but when it comes to biting the bullet and making these critically important decisions involving the security of the region the peace for the region and the security of the state of israel i think we are going to have to let them think and decide for themselves i thank the speaker and yield back the balance of my time"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.9996508359909058, 0.9996508359909058, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i

glass i want to also extend my appreciation to three other house members of the unitedstates holocaust memorial council for their leadership our colleagues congressmen solaaz garcia and bill leuman the night of broken glass is an event in jewish history that will live in infamy on november 9 1938 the jews of germany and austria already subjected to tie persecution brought about by hitlers ascension 5 years earlier were terrorized by the officially sponsored firebombing of synagogues and businesses homes and property any jew found by nazi agents was beaten or murdered the night of broken glass or kristallnacht as it is known in germany is considered the one act of violence against the jewish people which precipitated the wholesale deportation of european jewry to the concentration camps and crematoria which later dotted the continent in 1938 though the results of kristallnachts violence yielded nearly 100 murdered jews the destruction of over 7 500 jewish businesses the utter obliteration of 275 synagogues and the deportation of 30 000 jewish men to the concentration camps of dachau buchenwald and sachsenhausen the knowledge that the liquidation of the jewish people in europe had begun was acknowledged by the new york times on november 13 1938 when it stated germany issued a new series of decrees yesterday to complete the liquidation of the jews history has shown us that no one in the international community responded to this statement which indeed was a horrifying prophecy as a result of global silence hitler escalated his persecution of jews wherever he could and authorized the creation of the infamous final solution by 1945 when the war was over the truth was there for all the world to see over 6 million jewish men women and children gone from this earth exterminated by the cruelest means ever devised and the one date that burns in the collective jewish memory is kristallnacht november 9 1938 the night of broken glass it

amendments followed by a series of sdi policy amendments the funding amendments will be considered in the normal kingofthehill fashion with the last adopted amendment carrying the day and if no

amendment because 3 7 billion is about last years funding level plus inflation finally mr bennetr at 3 2 billion represents about a 10percent negative growth compared to last years funding level i have in my possession a letter which i received today from secretary of defense carlucci he is very concerned about this program i would like to read the letter at this time it says drai mn dickinson last fall as assist ant to the president for national security affairs i was involved in negotiating the socalled budget summit agreement under this agreement the congress and the adninistration adopted an overall framework for budget reduction according to this plan the department of defense was required to reduce its planned program for fy 1989 by 33 billion to 299 5 billion this was well below the level that the administration felt was necessary for our security but in the interest of reducing the overall budget we agreed to accept greater risk in our national security posture since assuming my responsibilities as secretary of defense in november the task of making the very difficult decisions required to meet this agreement fell on my shoulders i cannot overstate how difficult these decisions were they involved cancelling a number of programs delaying others and making reductions in our overall force structure the budget i submitted represented the soundest overall defense program under these difficult budgetary constraints i am gratified that to date the congress has not reduced overall defense spending below the level agreed to in the budget summit agreement however i am very concerned about congressional reductions to a central element of our defense programthe presidents strategic defense initiative sdi program sdi is the cornerstone of our overall defense program it holds the promise of a more stable and effective deterrent posture based on a balance of offense and defense the hopes we had for a more stable and safe deterrent under the abm treaty regime have not been realized the soviet union has continued to modernize and expand both its strategic offensive and defensive forces in an effort to blunt the credibility and effectiveness of our deterrent it is time we recognized this and took the steps necessary to rectify an increasingly unstable situation the case for the sdi program is further strengthened by the disturbing proliferation of ballistic missile technology the administrations request for department of defense sdi activities in fy 1989 is 4 5 billion this figure represents a reduction of 1 7 billion from what we had previcusly planned to spend in fy 1989 i recommended this reduction to our request with considerable reluctar ce us congressional reductions in sdi funding to date have already resulted in substantial delays in the lwogi w n hoever i felt that i had made a conlitnient to present the minimum overall budget requ et thatwhile accepting greatcr risk wsns consistent with our security requ remvnts the request the president submied for the sdi program reflects a balr~ice between our legitimate sccuri~y requirerrnnts and existing budgetary constraints and it is a sound technical program i regret the redections recrnmended by the armned servires committee because they would cause major restructuring and delays in the program further reductions in funding or other restrictions on the program would have the gravest consequences i urge you in the strongest po sible terms to oppose any such amendments if the congress sends the president a defense bill that contains a funding level for sdi that is in my view inadequate i would have no choice but to recommend a veto of that bill while i would make such a recommendation with regret i would not be living up to my responsibilities to the president or the nation if i failed to do so the point is that we came into this budget cycle with a budget summit agreement providing total defense spending of 299 5 billion after this agreement the armed services committee took the funding allotted to us for defense spending went through a series of hearings and came out with recommended funding levels for research and development for procurement for sdi and for other defense functions the committee itself came up with 3 7 billion for sdi to reduce it further i think is reckless is counterproductive and is a breach of faith with the budget summit agreement the amendment that i will offer will be 3 7 billion which is simply a re statement of the committee position restated i would urge the members of the committee not to cut sdi further we have already cut the presidents request of 4 5 billion down to 3 7 billion that is enough of a cut"], [0.9995819926261902, 0.9995819926261902, 0, "i rise today to highlight a recent study which concludes that unitedstates multinational companies are operating at a significant disadvantage due to present unitedstates tax laws the report was compiled by arthur young inc one of the nations largest and most reliable accounting firms in comparing the tax policies of the united states with those of the netherlands japan and germany the disadvantage was quite apparent this competitive disadvantage in world markets is present today due to enacted federal tax policy over the past 20 years including the 1986 tax reform act the primary reason this has occurred is due to the fact that many other countries have adopted tax policies that to varying degrees encourage firms to do business overseas essentially the united states has adopted exactly the opposite policy it is no wonder we are experiencing record trade deficits with a tax policy that is complex vague and discouraging to multinational companies the simple fact is that congress has failed miserably when it comes to encouraging business to engage in the international market instead congress prefers the easier route of protectionism we must aggressively seek to change the tax structure so that it is fair and equitable to do business overseas which will then in turn reduce our trade deficits though his competitive disadvantage has been accumulating over several years of federal tax policy arthur young inc has pointed out three very obvious disadvantages of the unitedstates multinational companies first when exemptions or deferrals foreign tax credits and tax treaties are taken into account the unitedstates multinationals most often are at the highest end of the tax rate scale on foreign operations compared to other countries even though the 1986 tax reform act lowered the nominal corporate tax rate many unitedstates companies will face increased tax liability on foreign source income second the united states has no treaty in which it agrees to spare unitedstates tax on income that could have been but was not taxed by a lesser developed country many other countries have such a tax sparing treaty the main effect of this absent treaty is that it hinders the unitedstates ability to access the low cost labor and raw materials of third world countries in a way that would enable these companies to compete equally in world trade third the third reason that puts the unitedstates multinational companies at a competitive disadvantage is the extent to which the present federal tax treaties modify the two above reasons this study has made me aware of a very serious problem with our international trade tax system in the coming weeks i plan to solicit the views of top multinational corporations in america on how to address this situation only then can we begin to answer the

ago at a time during the process of special orders that the debate of the house raised itself to an unusual and tense level of partisan rhetoric from time to time in the house we find ourselves in confrontation in a partisan way almost for the sake of partisanship as a result of that the then speaker tip oneill i believe decided to flex his authority in a direction that went beyond that which is good for the house essentially we began a process known as panning and panning is to use our television cameras to pan the house during special orders when oft times we are discussing very important items of the house and yet there are relatively few members of the house present on the floor they are either in committee or they are indeed in their offices using their televisions to observe the work on the floor and clearing their other legislative business if we are going to have that sort of panning in the house indeed it would logically be argued that one should pan during the entire session of the house for under normal work conditions we may be carrying on very important legislative business and still members will be in their committees or they will be in their offices et cetera and at a time of critical debate nonetheless there may be few members relatively on the floor we know that is the way the work of the house goes forward the point that i want to make is first that such panning draws a negative kind of attention and misunderstanding to the work of the house it may very well serve to undermine the exercise of free speech of a person in special orders with whom you may disagree but indeed to pan the house without a further explanation does attack the credibility of the workings on the floor that reality was never brought to mind in more crystal clear fashion than recently when we found ourselves working in the house on a memorial in which during special orders we were paying tribute to two of our past colleagues who had served us long and wellsala burton and stewart mckinney having passed away they were being addressed by way of memorial tribute during special orders to go back and look at that tape and see the panning of the house which would imply that few or almost no members cared when indeed endless numbers of members participated in those memorial services with panning it would indicate otherwise it not only affects the credibility of our house indeed it greatly affects the credibility of the words that were given that day on their behalf i might mention the words of one of my colleagues speaking on the floor in behalf of sala burton the gentleman is standing on the floor at this moment the gentleman from new york speaking to the house indicated i think that the entire event from the beginning of moving from the capitol steps out to andrews and then three planes full of people members of the house and others former members included and staff people and the memorial service itself were a tremendous tribute in recognition of what sala meant to all of us and panning at that moment there were but few members on the floor and in the panning it undermined the trust of the comment of the gentleman from new york

subcommittee is correct that this is a difficult question that is before us he is also correct in that the provisions that were added by the senate to our bill are for the most part laudable i would like particularly to concentrate attention for just a moment on the provisions with respect to diplomatic immunity what is it that the people in the other body have asked us to add to this bill the heart of it the heart of the helms amendment is a provision that says whenever there is probable cause to believe that an individual who is entitled to immunity from criminal jurisdiction of the united states may have committed a serious criminal offense particularly a crime of violence the secretary of state shall request the foreign ministry of the country such individual represents to waive the immunity of that individual if such waiver is denied the secretary of state shall declare that individual non grata or insure the removal from the united states we are not talking here about just willynilly kicking out foreign dilomats because some representatives oi the opposition in their country points the finger at some diplomat in this country and asks us to remove him we are talking about probable cause we are talking about serious offenses there are many cases that we all know about where individuals in this country have been harmed by the actions of diplomats from other countries who are immune from our justice system and it seems to me that in that regard at least on this particular provision the senator from north carolina adds something that probably most members of this house would agree with i know that the state department is recommending a veto i am always anmzed by the things that prompt the state departments concerns but i would say that what is contained in this provision in regard to immunity is something that ought to be enacted by the congress i would be personally quite satisfied if the speaker of the house who is in the chamber at the moment and the majority leader of the senate would agree that we would be able to have a separate vote before we adjourn in both houses on the diplomatic immunity question the bill has been pending many leading members on both sides of the aisle have supported that bill and tried to get it to come to the floor so we could act on it that has not happened there are probably better ways to act than to have had this added in the senate on this bill i am as eager to finish the appropriations process as everyone else is i am no happier being here at 10 30 at night debating this than anybody else is

agreement before us today the conference agreement on h r 5 represents one of the most farreaching education bills of the tecade and i commend the chairn n mr hawkins mr jeffords rnd our colleague from pennsylvania mr goodlin0 for their forward leadership h r 5 makes good on the federal promise to join with states and local school districts in enhancing the quality of our nations elementary and secondary schools it does so by offering a package of prograins that collectively reaffirm the federal commitment to access to quality education for disadvantaged students and other students with special needs i come to you today as a former educator and local school board member i am acutely aware that we must encourage and reward excellence in education and provide assistance to children who might otherwise never catch up with their more fortunate classmates h r 5 accomplishes that goal however i must reiterate my belief that the role of the federal government in education should be a limited one beyond my philosophical opposition to sending tax dollars to washington only to see 60 cents returned it is undeniable that state and local governments are best equipped to know what their particular community needs most local governments can provide the kind of flexibility creativity and attention to detail that is impossible on the federal level the final version of h r 5 includes my amendments on youth suicide prevention the roukema amendments establishes authorized youth suicide prevention programs as allowable prograins under the antidrug abuse act and chapter ii block grant fund the chapter ii block grant which provides money for such programs as early childhood development at risk students schoolwide improvements now includes one more important program suicide prevention let me be clear this does not mandate suicide prevention education this allows suicide prevention programs as an option my amendment allows local schools if they desire to apply chapter ii block grant money to establish needed prograins in youth suicide prevention my own district in northern new jersey was the scene of a terrible tragedy last year we all remember so vividly that four young people took their own lives dramatic evidence of the rising incidence of suicide across the country in the aftermath the community sought funds to develop a program to counsel children teachers and parents however their only recourse was the lengthy difficult process of applying for a federal grant which in the end was denied now i do not want a national competitive grant program to be the only recourse for communities to receive money if they desire my amendment is constructed to give the authority solely to the local entity without imposing the federal qovermients will oi discretion on local agercies it is an eflort to supplement and help schools deal with a tragic problem within their communities if they choose that option the school is the one institution that is the common denominator for all these students the purpose of my amendment is to use the schools to identify highrisk students and to identify them before they drop out in addition our local option provides the opportunity for the community to decide if there is a genuine need principals school teachers and officials who are most sensitive to the specific local circumstances will have the opportunity to establish programs and train personnel there is no doubt that suicide among teenagers is among the most serious social problems in that age group suicide is the leading cause of death among persons between the ages of 15 and 24 second only to traffic fatalities the number of young people taking their lives has increased greatly in the la t few decades last year the subcommittee on elementary secondary and vocational education conducted hearings on teenage suicide prevention a panel of expert witnesses offered their advice on how to prevent these tragedies the experts confirmed that there is a well established relationship between drug abuse and youth suicide my amendment recognizes this connection between drugs problems and other problems facing our young people no piece of legislation can be perfect and this bill is no expection i have serious reservations about one program included in h r 5that is the bilingual education act i have long been a critic of the bilingual education program for its failure to recognize the need to teach english to nonenglish speaking children as early as possible experience during the life of this program has demonstrated that teaching students in their native language has not proven effective although this compromise allows additional funding for alternative teaching methods such as immersion and english as a second language i would have liked to have seen it go further while alternative methods provide some flexibility bilingual education programs should be geared toward getting school children assimilated into englishspeaking classes rapidly and effectively the inability to speak english can severely hamper a citizens ability to participate fully in the mainstream of america we should not hesitate to support educational methods that ensure such participation another issue of great concern to me was the program improvement provision program improvement requires states to perform evaluations of local education agencies to determine improvement or decline in school progress state and local jurisdiction must be clearly defined while locals deserve the freedom to determine their curricula and programs states have certain oversight authority to ensure that schools remain in compliance with basic program requirements the conference agreement carefully balances this relationship states will receive a percentage of program funds to be used at the local level for program improvement furthermore the compromise allows local agencies workable time frames for improvements and provides states with the needed funds to help implement such changes the dual federal and state commitment is clearly formalized in this compromise i commend my colleague mr goodling for his tireless effort in forging this solution in the spirit of compromise the house accepted the senate proposal on magnet schools but not without a fightl the senate proposal establishes a separate program identical to magnet schools yet without desegregation as the main objective i simply do not see the need for establishing a new costly program for alternative schools the current program is effective and commendable in its purpose yet underfunded magnet schools have established quality schools in areas with a high concentration of minority students these schools have excelled in their academic standards and vocational skills they offer a curriculum capable of attracting substantial numbers of students of different racial backgrounds but most noteworthy students are accepted on the basis of talent not wealth although magnet schools are one of the most effective programs in h r 5 in the last year only 48 of the 126 districts which applied for funds received them there simply was not enough money to be distributed there can be no questioning the impact and far reaching effects of this bill its scope reaches all ages from early intervention programs for our very young to dropout

of emergency planning the nrc reports that there is a significant chance of another reactor accident over the next 15 years former nrc commissioner jim asselstine is on record saying that the containment on certain types of our reactors have an 80 or 90percent chance of being breached in the event of a core meltdown the 1979 accident at three mile island demonstrated clearly the need for adequate emergency planning around nuclear plants and for state involvement in that planning in 1980 after much deliberaton in the wake of the three mile island accident the nation implemented policies to improve nuclear plant safety the nuclear regulatory commission issued rules requiring an applicant licensee to submit its energency plans as well as state and local governmental emergency plans to nrcthese rules provided states an explicit aid critical role in developing plans to protect the public in the event of a nuclear accident the nrc is now considering a rule to bypass the present emergency planning process if states do not approve emergency plans the practical effect is that state and local governments might have to implement plans they had no hand in designing and that are inadequate to protect public safety the result is this two densely populated areas where evacuation planning is most critical those around the seabrook and shoreham plants could end up with inadequate emergency planning what mr markey proposes to do is to maintain current regulations for two plants the shoreham and seabrook plants the legislation simply applies current rules to those two plants it doesnt say that congress will shut them what it says is that we arent going to let the nrc change the rules and override local concerns just so they can get two plants on line whatever you

offended by this bill is the arms control provisions which we have done before but he is so offended by that because he thinks it takes power away from him and we should be speaking with one voice to the soviet union the reason i think that is totally undercut is at the time the president is vetoing this message his own secretary of defense is in the soviet union he is undercutting his own

house to the president of the united states urging him to begin negotiations with the soviet union relative to its presence in nicaragua it is a most fascinating letter signed on to by a large portion of the democratic leadership including the people who brought the bill to the floor the othl day that had provisions in it whiei would have committed our military to central america and to the nicaraguan problem for the first time but in this letter to the president they say some very fascinating things that i think the american people should reflect upon for example in this letter they are saying quite clearly that the nicaraguan communist government represents a real threat to unitedstates security they say at present the greatest danger of such a threatmeaning to central america in this case and they above say that the united states has valid security concerns in central america and then they say at present the greatest danger of such a threat is in nicaragua under the government of the sandinista junta then they go on to say some very interesting things for instance they make the point about the massive amount of soviet aid that is there including as they put it mi24 hind attack helicopters and then they make this statement there are also rumors of the construction of submarine bases and airfields capable of landing the largest bombers we know that that is more than rumor unless of course pictures of those bases are simply rumor because on this floor during the debate my colleague the gentleman from california actually showed this house pictures of the airfields pictures of the submarine bases it is more than rumor it is fact that is the problem that we are faced with anyhow they go on and they suggest to the president that what he ought to do is to negotiate the soviet presence out of nicaragua the problem with this letter is that it does not seem to recognize that those negotiations have already been under way and that the soviet union is not responding in a manner which helps our security interests i have here another letter this one from colin powell the national security adviser to the president who has pointqd out to us he wrote it to one of our colleagues the chairman of the subcommittee on europe and the middle east and he says in the letter president reagan raised the issue of nicaragua with the general secretary pointing out that continuing massive soviet supply of military equipment to the sandinista regime aggravates the situation in central america and constitutes another instance in which soviet actions in regional conflicts made unitedstates soviet relations more difficult secretary schultz pursued the same topic with the soviets in postsummit consultations in other words what this letter says is that there is an ongoing process of discussions taking place on the very topic that the democrats are saying open negotiations about i am surprised that they do not know what is really going on but let us go on in the letter because this is the problem mr powell goes on and points out the soviet position on the question is clear they propose to limit military assistance to the sandinistas to only small armswhich the general secretary characterized as police arms in exchange for unitedstates stopping its military assistance programs to the other nations of central america and to the nicaraguan democratic resistance this proposal needless to say is not congruent with our commitments to the central american democracies nor with our national interest its acceptance would leave the present dangerous sandinista military preponderance over its neighbors entirely intact moreover it would have us legitimize a dangerous extension of soviet power onto the mainland of the western hemisphere now the only thing that i can conclude is either the people who signed on to this letter are totally ignorant of the negotiations that are ongoing or they intend for us to accept the soviet proposal because i can come to no other interpretation of what they are saying to the president if in fact what they are saying is mr president accept what the soviets offer let us understand what that means it means the soviets would continue to send the small arms in ak47s for instance automatic rifles while we would send no aid whatsoever to the central american democracies what that would mean is that the guerrilla forces that have been funded and have been supported out of nicaragua would be able to get those ak47s to use against el salvador to use against guatemala to use against honduras to use against costa rica and those countries would not have any help to respond the soviets are saying let us send small arms we wont send tanks but we are going to send small arms but you send nothing is

debate to try to trivialize the issue by making reference to the sun being the equivalent of methylisocyanate or something else that you will find in the workplace that ranks right up there with those who have said that there is not need for pollution control because trees are the ultimate polluters i think it is fairly clear that we have a serious problem it is appalling that we have waited too long to address it and this bill quite candidly is just a preliminary effort to try to deal with the key fact of notification it does not even deal with removing the problem it deals with mere notification identification and notification the rational expectation being that someone will be able to detect the problems earlier and then take remedial action to try to deal with the problem before there is a need for even greater expenditure from wherever they come to deal with health problems in a sense this bill represents a natural extension of the community right to know act that was overwhelmingly approved in a bipartisan way last year by this congress and signed into law by the president the right to know act provided essential comparable information to our communities living next door as they might to manufacturing and other industrial operations about the routine exposure that those communities may have to chemicals coming from those facilities that may cause shortterm or longterm injuries in a sense what we are doing is extending that same fundamental right to the workers who work within the facilities that we have already granted to citizens who live around those facilities i want to emphasize and perhaps focus in on an aspect of this that is being allegedly addressed by the substitute that is being offered the socalled liability crisis the suggestion has been made that this bill will lead to enormous litigation costs that is clearly not the case our committee the committee that i chair the subcommittee on commerce consumer protection and competitiveness has been holding a series of hearings on the whole question of the need for the scope of federal product liability reform and the issue of toxic exposure has played a critical role in our deliberations as i read this bill h r 162 this will neither add or substract from the rights of workers who wish to seek damages in the state court systems for occupational diseases by contrast the substitute will substantially radically and dramatically change and curtail the rights of workers to seek relief from injuries that are currently being provided now it is those rights that are currently provided in the state courts this will effectively preempt the state rules of evidence that exist we will be having the workmans compensation system changes the state tort laws will be changed and we will have the somewhat perverse result being that workers who are notified who have substantially differing sets of rights in the state tort law system than workers who are not notified i think that dual track system will be particularly strange likewise we will have a system where workers who are notified as contrasted with workers who are not notified as contrasted with someone out on a road who is exposed to the same chemcial as a result of the truck accident we will have three different sets of rights under state tort laws for those here who are interested in states rights for those few states that i know already have changed their states tort laws we are going to be undoing all that is going on at the state level as a result of this effective federal preemption in a sense
