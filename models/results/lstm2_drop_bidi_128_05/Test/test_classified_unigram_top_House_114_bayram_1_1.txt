appropriations bill to protect their conference from having to defend the display of the confederate battle flag on federal lands imagery long recognized as a symbol of hatred and intolerance as a result funding for critically important agencies such as the environmental protection agency whose programs protect wildlife the environment and public health continues to hang in the balance this rule first provides for consideration of h r 2898 the western water and american food security act of 2015 which republicans claim will alleviate the drought crisis currently unfolding in california and other western states but this bill is just another example of the countless partisan attempts made by the majority to roll back important environmental protections while also preempting state laws let me put a footnote right there preempting state laws these are the people that argue state rights and now would preempt them in western portions of our great country particularly california reducing water management flexibility this bill undercuts the endangered species act by changing the welldefined standard used to determine when an action negatively affects an endangered species and introduces an untested undefined standard as evidenced by this piece of legislation the republicans solution to the drought crisis is to provide handouts to big agricultural interests at the expense of the environment and everyone else i want to make it very clear that i represent agricultural interests as do my colleagues who are republicans we represent all of the specialty crops and sugarcane grown and we understand these dynamics very well not only will this bill scale back desperately needed environmental protections it will affect thousands of fishing jobs in california and oregon that local residents depend on given the changing standard of the endangered species act this bill will dramatically weaken protections for salmon and other fish and wildlife in californias baydelta estuary this bill claims to help california but even california doesnt want it californias own secretary of natural resources has said that this billand let me quote himwill reignite water wars move water policy back into the courts and try to pit one part of the state against another this bill will elevate the water rights for certain agricultural contractors over the existing water rights that benefit refuges and wildlife areas in short this bill circumvents californias groundbreaking equitable water conservation programs and puts the desires of big agriculture over everyone else this combined rule also provides for the consideration of h r 3038 termed the highway and transportation funding act of 2015 part ii because it is yet another shortterm temporary patch to ensure that the highway trust fund does not become insolvent it is a patch it is the ninth time we are patching if you had a tire and were riding down a highway and if every time you looked up you had to have another patch pretty soon you would recognize that you would need new tires what we need in this country is a 6year highway bill back in may congress passed and the president signed a bill we can now appropriately call the highway and transportation funding act of 2015 part i at that time we were assured by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle that a multiyear bill that would provide the longterm funding certainty and stability needed to keep transportation and construction projects operating was on the horizon that was in may we were promised that if we voted to provide funding through july 31 the comprehensive multiyear highway bill america so desperately needs would become a reality in time to avoid any insolvency unfortunately today we find ourselves in the same situation as we did in may i just heard my good friend from washington make the argument that in the next 6 months we will be able to work together to do the things necessary for a 6year highway bill i am paraphrasing what he said as we had in may today we have a rapidly approaching selfimposed deadline and are frantically seeking an interim fix like its predecessor this highway bill does nothing to address the longterm solvency of the highway trust fund there is one thing i have learned here about kicking the can down the road if kicking the can down the road were an olympic sport here in the united states congress we would win gold we would win bronze we would win silver and we would win aluminum for kicking the can down the road instead we are again being asked to vote for legislation that would keep the highway trust fund solvent through note the date of december 18 just before christmas so that we can play the game if you dont vote for this next patchif we dont do 6 yearsthen we will keep you here until christmas without the necessary assurances that a longterm bill will become a reality this is no way to govern our insistence on kicking the can down the road does nothing to protect american jobs or to invest in critical infrastructure that every man and woman in this house of representatives recognizes is desperately needed in this nation of falling bridges and pockmarked roads finally investing in our nations infrastructure and indeed in our nations future will require us to make tough choices instead of considering raising the federal gas taxi said the ugly words federal gas tax which is the primary source of funding for the highway trust fundand it has not been increased since 1993 peoplethis bill seeks to cut taxes on liquefied natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas at a cost of 90 million over the next decade any comprehensive highway bill must consider in part addressing the federal gas tax why dont we just face up to that go to our constituents and explain it to them so they will understand that this is a desperate need for this entire nation our failure to come together to pass a multiyear transportation bill year after year has resulted in 65 percent of our nations roads being rated deficient all you have to do is drive around washington to recognize that it has left 25 percent of our nations bridges in disrepair and it has left 45 percent of americans without access to transit this failure has farreaching and devastating implications and must be addressed with thoughtful and meaningful bipartisan legislation that will provide the certainty and consistency required to fuel jobs and keep the highways and other transportation infrastructure safe i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.000670313835144043,

extraordinarily qualified candidate highly esteemed within the legal community and highly accomplished as a prosecutor and appellate judge he was confirmed to the d c circuit court of appeals in 1995 by a vote of 7623 with a majority of republicans voting in favor of his confirmation indeed an even larger number of republicans said he was well qualified and i will speak to that under normal circumstances judge garland would now be sitting down this week for oneonone meetings with senators on both sides of the aisle in preparation for his confirmation hearings but senate republicans unfortunately have made it clear that they will not be operating under normal procedure instead they are refusing even to meet with judge garland let me suggest they are refusing to do their duty their approach is inconsistent with the expectations of our founding fathers and a disservice to the american people to the court to american justice and to the american people and their justification has no basis in fact justice anthony kennedy who sits now on the court was confirmed during the final years of president reagans second term in fact he is one of the 14 justices in our history who have been confirmed during a presidential election year including louis brandeis and benjamin cardozo so there is hardly precedent that a lame duck president must allow a supreme court vacancy to sit unfilled for months we do not allow that for the house of representatives and for the most part we dont allow it for the united states senate there is a timeframe indeed in every state to fill seats in the house of representatives so that the american people will be represented to politicize this process is irresponsible and jeopardizes the proper functioning of our supreme court in 1988 during the kennedy confirmation process president reagan said the federal judiciary is too important to be made a political football i agree and i hope senate republicans would too because we all know that their decision has nothing to do with judge garlands qualifications senator hatch a republican from utah in 1997 called judge garland highly qualified and said his intelligence and his scholarship cannot be questioned when put forward for the d c circuit court judge garland was cited by senator hatch as a fine nominee he ultimately voted to confirm judge garland to the d c circuit court while chairman chuck grassley who chairs the judiciary committee on the senatealso a republicanopposed judge garlands nomination to the circuit court it ought to be noted that it was only because he thought there were already too many judges on that bench not because judge garland lacked qualifications in fact senator grassley made this clear by saying i have nothing against the nominee mr garland seems to be well qualified and would probably make a good judge on some other court senator jeff sessions a conservative republican from alabama agreed with senator grassley about too many judges on the circuit court and said of judge garland i would feel comfortable supporting him for another judgeship although he didnt say it but another judgeship would be a justice on the supreme court of the united states now senator grassley and senator sessions have an opportunity to put judge garland on another courtone that has a vacancy needing to be filled our founding fathers set up a court of nine justices cognizant of the problem that would occur if there were a 44 tie that is the situation that exists today and it can be remedied by the united states senate now lets not play political games if republicans dont want judge garland on the court schedule a vote and cast their votes accordingly senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said just yesterday on abcs this week under the constitution we have a shared responsibility this is not something he referring to the president does alone he nominates we confirm that of course is absolutely accurate i would say to senator mcconnell that the president has met his responsibilities now it is time for the senate to do so as well some senate republicans agree senator mark kirk of illinois said on friday cast a vote the tough thing about these senatorial jobs is you get yes or no votes your whole job senator kirk observed is to either say yes or no and explain why that is democracy that is responsibility furthermore in february senator susan collins republican of maine said i think the obligation of the senate is to carefully consider any nominee whom the president submits the best way to do that in my judgment is public hearings senator collins was absolutely right under pressure from within their own ranks senate republican leaders can only stall for so long before they must face up to their responsibility to give judge garland the fair hearing he deserves and that the american people expect i believe judge garland will make a fine supreme court justice and i thank president obama for selecting someone so highly qualified intelligent and whose scholarship cannot be questioned a fine nominee all of those of course are senator hatchs words i hope that judge garland will be swiftly confirmed leaving the supreme court with the possibility of gridlock as we have seen the congress at gridlock is not good for our country not good for the american people and does not serve our democracy well senator mcconnell

republican point of view the positive thing about these bills is that they are yet another pander to big money fossil fuel special interests i urge my colleagues to follow the money because that is what this is all about here today it is not about serious legislating it is about fundraising s j res 23 and s j res 24 look to stop commonsense regulations that the epa has put in place that protect us from the harmful pollution emitted by power plants these joint resolutions are another clear message from the republican majority that they do not believe that climate change is real over 120 environmental faithbased and public health organizations have already come out opposing these two resolutions including the american lung association the allergy and asthma network the league of conservation voters the natural resources defense council the sierra club and public citizen i can stand here forever and repeat the other organizations that have a lot of public support in this country that have come out against these bills power plants account for 40 percent of our annual carbon pollution emissions they are the single biggest source of carbon pollution in the country yet the republican majority wants to take away the greatest step we have taken to try to curb that major source of pollution these two joint resolutions would permanently prevent the epa from ever ever limiting pollution from power plants in the future as well h r 8 is also a deeply troubling piece of legislation it favors the use of fossil fuels over renewable energy and favors consumption over energy efficiency it would ram pipeline applications through ferc in under 90 days even though most applications by the way are reviewed and approved in less than 1 year it all but removes individuals from the process allowing big gas companies to choose to build wherever they want regardless of the consequences for local communities it would even allow them to build through our treasured national parks it is an early christmas gift for big special interests at some point we must face the facts so i want to say something to my colleagues on the republican side i know it may make you feel uncomfortable but it is the truth climate change is real the overwhelming science says it is real yet a huge chunk of the republican conference is in denial they dont believe there is such a thing as climate change they dont believe we have any responsibility to our children or to future generations to combat climate change they are perfectly happy living in this fantasy world where you can rely on fossil fuels and rely on fossil fuels and rely on fossil fuels and can just make believe that it has no impact at all on the environment quite frankly if climate change werent such a serious issue it would be comical but climate change is a serious issue it is a real issue it is an issue not just for us it is an issue for future generations so their denial quite frankly is frightening we shouldnt be propping up coal and oil industries with taxpayer subsidies we shouldnt be using taxpayer money to destroy our environment when the scientific community reaches a clear consensus on an issue like climate change congress shouldnt undermine them with dangerous legislation like this when we receive credible peerreviewed study after study after study after study that tells us we are in the middle of a climate crisis and that something must be done about it we need to listen but the republican majority refuses to listen climate change is often referred to as the most pressing issue of our time we know that climate change is for real we know that we see it we live it the scientific community has verified it climate change is not a theory it is not a hoax and it is certainly not some silly fantasy when arctic ice is crashing into the oceans at record rates that is not a hoax when species are going extinct at accelerated rates around the globe that is not a fantasy when extreme weather events are becoming commonplace that is not a theory when the global temperature of the planet continues to increase every year for decades we should pay attention these are the exact same scare tactics that have been used for over 45 years in opposition to climate change it is the same old stuff opponents of clean air have been claiming for half a century that clean air regulations would kill jobs and hurt economic growth but they are wrong the truth is that the clean air act alone has created 57 trillion in benefits since it was enacted in 1970 the clean power plan will lead to a stronger economy a safer climate and better health for all of us why is this so difficult maybe it is because my friends on the other side of the aisle dont like the president so anything that he is for they have to be against you have got to move beyond your anger you have got to look at the issues and you have to evaluate them based on the evidence the evidence is that climate change is for real but you would never know that in listening to the majority they have no solutions only denial lets keep on down the road of the same old same old and their just say no agenda is a recipe for disaster as we gather here leaders from all around the world are meeting in paris to talk about how to deal with the issue of climate change what we should be doing here is providing some wind at the backs of not only our president but of all of the leaders of the world who are gathering to try to figure out how to deal with this challenge instead of doing that we are

people of america the full funding to address these quality of life issues from the various lands and federal parks and as well the historic trails of which i will talk about but museums urban

an even greater audience by bringing the smithsonian to enclaves of communities who otherwise would be deprived of the vast amounts of cultural history offered by the smithsonian our museums of the

multilingual store front and street signs etc has been a longstanding organizational priority of the smithsonian sites mobile museum is the only traveling exhibit format able to guarantee audience growth and expanded geographic distribution during sustained periods of economic retrenchment but also because it is imperative for the many exhibitors nationwide who are struggling financially yet eager to participate in smithsonian outreach for communities still struggling to fully recover from the economic downturn the ability of museums to present temporary exhibitions the mobile museum promises to answer an evergrowing demand for smithsonian shows in the field a single conventional sites exhibit can reach a maximum of 12 locations over a twoto threeyear period in contrast a mobile museum exhibit can visit up to three venues per week in the course of only one year at no cost to the host institution or community the net result is an increase by 150 in the number of outreach locations to which sites shows can travel annually and in addition to its flexibility in making shortterm stops in cities and towns from coasttocoast a mobile museum has the advantage of being able to frequent the very locations where people live work and take part in leisure time activities by establishing an exhibit presence in settings like these sites will not only increase its annual visitor

their arguments seem to be summarized this way that somehow if we just would all go bury our head in the sand that we would be better off i mean the reality is this our nation does have a 19 trillion

limits in recent years the department of the treasury has taken what they call extraordinary measures doing it under the law to try to lengthen the amount of time until we hit that debt limit this amendment is really a very modest one all the amendment says is if the department of the treasury is going to take extraordinary measures to avoid the limit on debt that has been set by congress that they ought to tell us all what they are doing they ought to define what it is they ought to define how much time we are going to buy with these extraordinary measures and they ought to tell us what it costs as we juggle all this money around because when you start juggling money around as everybody knows in their own life and in their own bills they have to pay it costs money that is all this

rule provides for 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and the ranking member of the judiciary committee and also provides a motion to recommit additionally the rule makes in order 7 of the 11 amendments submitted representing ideas from members on both sides of the aisle yesterday the rules committee received testimony from the chairman of the judiciary committee and the ranking member of the judiciary subcommittee on regulatory reform commercial and antitrust law subcommittee hearings were held on both h r 5063 and on the topic of the department of justices mortgage lending settlements with major lending banks in may of this year h r 5063 was marked up and reported by the judiciary committee the bill passed the judiciary committee after the consideration of several amendments the stop settlement slush funds act went through regular order and enjoyed thorough discussion at both the subcommittee and full committee level h r 5063 is supported by the institute for legal reform americans for limited government and americans for tax reform because it increases accountability for how settlement funds are spent and it helps to restore the balance of power between the branches of government the stop settlement slush funds act was introduced after the nearly 20month investigation by the house judiciary committee found that the department of justice was systematically circumventing congress and directing settlement money to activist groups this bill will help address that problem the power of the purse is one of congress greatest tools to rein in the executive branch and exercise oversight it is no surprise then that this administration would want to find a way around that oversight and grow its authority in fact in the last 2 years alone the department of justice has funneled nonvictim thirdparty groups as much as 880 million the department of justice does this by collecting money from parties who have broken the law and then use that money to create a slush fund rather than sending the money to the victims of the illicit activity the department of justice allows the donations if that is what they are calledrequired under the settlements to count as a double credit against defendants payment obligations interestingly credit for direct relief to consumers is only counted as dollar for dollar indicating the importance the department of justice places on directing these funds to nonvictim thirdparty groups for example the department of justice negotiated settlement agreements to the tune of millions of dollars with major banks for misleading investors over mortgagebacked securities well within what they are supposed to do then the department of justice said that banks or other parties it has settled with could meet some of their settlement obligations by making donations to certain groups the money goes to these groups partially under the guise that those groups would provide services to the aggrieved parties in reality this practice directs funds away from victims and allows the department of justice to steer money to nonvictim thirdparty groups usually administration friendly politically motivated organizations additionally the parties that receive these funds these nonvictim thirdparty organizations arent a part of the case they dont represent the victims and arent subject to congressional oversight for the funds they receive even if most of these groups werent activist groups this would be a concerning scenario the donations to thirdparty groups allow the department of justice to funnel money to friendly parties outside of the appropriations process and outside congressional approval many of these thirdparty groups are unquestionably political and certainly wouldnt be considered nonpartisan by mutual observers in fact the mortgage settlement cases groups like the national council of la raza received more than 1 million in department of housing and urban development grants under the settlements i dont know about you but i think that when doj requires a settlement the funds should go back to the victims involved in the case including victims back home in northeast georgia and if the victims cannot be found or if the problem cannot be directly rectified then the settlement funds should go on to the treasury so that congress can appropriately decide how to use them i dont think it is acceptable to shortchange victims to benefit special interests and politically friendly thirdparty organizations but that is exactly what the administration has been doing the administration is trying to usurp the power of the purse through these settlement slush funds and has only gotten more confident that they can get away with it maybe even more troubling despite repeated requests for more information the department of justice is refusing to provide it what little information has been provided indicates that groups that stood to gain from the mandatory donations actually lobbied doj to include them in settlements listen to what that says actually one of the things that we have gained from this is the fact that the groups that stood to gain from these mandatory donations were lobbying doj to get the moneynot a party to the case not a party to the victims but wanting their cut of the pie in at least one case the department of justice restored funding to a program that congress specifically cut congress cut funding in half for a housing and urban development program known as the housing counseling assistance program but after grant recipients of this program expressed their displeasure at the cuts they received a helping hand from who elsethe department of justice the doj mortgage settlements ensured that despite congressional action to the contrary eliminating funding for these groups would be restored doj didnt just stop at circumventing congress funding authority in that case instead they directly violated the congressional intent again a congressional oversight overstep misused because the agency decided it knew better than the elected representatives of the people it is time to reassert congressional authority over this process so that hardworking folks are protected from more executive overreach and the separation of powers is restored at a judiciary hearing in may on this bill heritage foundation scholar paul larkin testified that congress identifies precisely who may receive federal funds that is what we do i agree with him but the department of justices settlement process in recent years undercuts that critical function of the separation of powers that is why we have to act and why the underlying bill is so important the stop settlement slush funds act prohibits settlement terms that require donations to nonvictim third parties importantly the bill clarifies that payments that provide restitution for harm caused are not donations additionally h r 5063 restores the separation of powers by establishing that settlement funds remaining after victims have been compensated are overseen by congress rather than directing money outside the appropriations process the bill returns the funds to the treasury to remediate damages after victims have been taken care of i urge everyone here today to think about their constituents who one day may be victims looking for restitution i want to go home and tell those hardworking georgians that i represent that i am making sure they are put first not special interests i hope that others will share that

what i do have is responsibility as chairman of this committee five years from now we are not sitting up here talking about the same thing another chairman and another secretary of energy and another president the department of energy is famous for starting programs and getting halfway down and then spending billions of dollars and then walking away from them yucca mountain is the biggest hole in the groundthey spent 14 billion to buildthan anything i have ever seen and it is not the only thing that the department of energy has done but they come to us now and say hey we have a plan and it is going to be cheaper we think that mox is going to cost 30 billion other people say nah that is a stretch we are looking more like 20 or something like that nobody can get the numbers right so we ask them to rebaseline it they havent done that but they come to us and say we have a plan we think that what we ought to do is just dilute this stuff and then dispose of it okay great what is that going to take well first of all we have a treaty with russia have the russians agreed to this well no but we think they will well you know there are a lot of things i think that my wife will agree to that she doesnt in the long run so we are going to go out and we are going to stop construction of this on the hope that the russians are going to agree with us of course we have such a good relationship going on with them right now but the department says oh i think they will be okay and they have indicated they are willing to talk okay we are going to dispose of it where are we going to dispose of it wipp wipp is shut down right now but we are going to get wipp reopened is that where we are going to put it is wipp large enough to hold this are we going to have to do another land withdrawal in new mexico is the state of new mexico okay with this well we dont know we havent talked to them yet so what you want to do is stop this before you have a plan of what you want to do with it and that is just crazy and that is my problem if the department would come to us and say that the russians have agreed to amend the treaty and new mexico has agreed that they will take the stuff then maybe we could have a serious discussion but right now it is just all pie in the sky i will tell you that if you really dont care about the treaty and you really dont care about where they dispose of itdispose of it in new mexicothe cheapest thing to do is just store it but nobody wants to do that so all we are saying is lets be reasonable on this and lets recognize that you have a facility here that is 67 percent complete i think we ought to go down the same road although there are others i have to admit that look at 340 millionand probably it will be 500 million when it gets going as we continue as construction ramps upbut look at that as oh that is taking money out of my programs in my town and i dont want that to happen so lets stop mox and that means my favorite project will get more money i know there is a lot of that going on too so i understand where the gentleman is coming from there are other people that agree with him there are people on my side of the aisle that come up and ask why are we spending money on that boondoggle it is not a boondoggle the fact is it is supposed to create mox fuel while the department says there are no energy companies that want the mox fuel that is not true there are some who would sign longterm agreements the problem is they see this debate and are wondering whether we are going to have any or not but the problem is the department wont come to us

construction on that we have a problem with new mexico and the russians are on our back they wont do anything about the treaty what are we going to do lets think of something else so until somebody has a reasonable alternative that they could compare it to and the cost to we need to continue with this mox project and that is why the funding is in there for this bill and that is why we will fight for it in conference even though the senate i know wants to stop it and do other things so anyway that is why that is there i appreciate what the gentleman is doing i understand his concerns other

thank the gentlewoman for her comments and for her continued pursuit of making sure we pass this this bill was first introduced over a year ago reworked with a lot of bipartisan input members of congress from both sides of the aisle and also from many many organizations the other day some 23 organizations delivered a letter to some members of congress saying they want to see comprehensive mental health reform this is the first and the most comprehensive mental health reform our country has seen the last time some efforts were made it was the very last bill that president kennedy signed before he was assassinated to begin to make some change in our country to move away from the asylums and towards community mental health unfortunately that dream only came partially true because what happened is we closed those asylums back in the 1950s we had 550 000 psychiatric hospital beds in this country at that time the population of the country was 150 million now the population of the country is over 316 million 320 million and we only have 40 000 psych beds now some of that is because we have come up with more effective treatments better ways of identifying and diagnosing people better medications and quite frankly those asylums of yesteryear needed to close many times they were homes of abuse and given nicknames like snake pits cuckoos nests and other derogatory terms because they were so bad but then along came community medical health centers and that was supposed to pick up the slack as states found that they could close these asylums they looked and saw that they could save some money and they didnt put the money into mental health services nor did the federal government what happened instead was the people traded the hospital bed for the jail cell for the homeless shelter and for the morgue that is where we are today now it is not for lack of trying because indeed the federal government has spent a lot of moneysome 100plus billion a yearon this mostly through disability payments but some for federal programs what i want to do tonight is now talk about 10 things we can do as a nation to deal with this 10 things we must do first of all the general accounting office report that we commissioned from the energy and commerce committee we said tell us what programs there are in the federal government that deal with mental health and more specifically serious mental illness i was amazed to hear how many there were 112 agencies scattered across eight departments it is a dysfunctional and uncoordinated system it is a system that really does not have central control it is a system that has not even met among these agencies for years even though one of the agencies samhsa substance abuse and mental health services administration is supposed to be the lead agency to say get together and meet they hadnt even met since 2009 by the way when we had a hearing on this in the oversight and investigations subcommittee they said oh we will start doing that soon but this report that came out that excoriated the federal programs said that they are not only uncoordinated but nobody even checks to see if what they do works they are programs with the department of defense veterans affairs education health and human services hud the list goes on and on i think there are 20plus programs for homelessness there was redundancy and there was overlap but it is not coordinated we make it the most difficult for those who have the most difficulty so here is number one of what we want to do we want to have the office of the assistant secretary for mental health and substance abuse createda new office but not new money we do not need any money for this we take the current office of samhsa and elevate that title of the person who runs that agency to the level of an assistant secretary that persons job will be to create an annual report to congress to tell us the state of the states tell us how they spend their money that they get from the federal level tell us what are the best practices out there that can serve as models for other states collect that data right now what we do get is data on numbers of suicides we get some homicide data but we really dont get that much on homeless data we have soso quality of data for substance abuse what happens there but for the most part no one asks about these agencies and coordinates them this persons job is to do this more so this person is going to have to be a mental health provider someone who understands the field the last director of samhsa was an attorney perhaps wellintended but did not understand the field just like you would not appoint someone to head the joint chiefs of staff to run the army who is not a general or the navy who is not an admiral you need someone to run this who knows what they are doing in addition to coordinating these agencies what they would do is give a report to congress of which ones can be eliminated because they are redundant merge the money together make more money available and send more money out to communities let congress then act to revamp these multiple organizations to do what is most effective to get funding back to the communities and to the people where it is needed not to stay in washington d c i think president reagan talked about perhaps some proof of eternity is a federal program what we dont want to have here is the continuation of programs that exist just for the sake of employment programs should exist for the sake of doing the right thing for people out there and right now we have a failure the second item is to drive evidencebased care another general accounting office report which came out talked about some of the abysmal conditions here they were saying that agencies had difficulty identifying programs supporting individuals with serious mental illness because they didnt always track whether or not such individuals were among those served by the program again samhsa in the pastwhich is supposed to lead these organizationsdoesnt really track to say what are the evidencebased programs you are doing when we had a hearing on these issues samhsa told me afterwards they would change nothing they do list some evidencebased programs but the evidence base is oftentimes people who do programs and say take my word for it it works if it works why do we have millions of people with mental illness why do we have 4 million people not getting any care at all why do we continue to fill our jails homeless shelters and morgues with people with mental illness there are some excellent programs out there quite frankly but there are also many that need to be changed as part of this process it was stated in the gao report that many of the programs hadnt completed their evaluations many had no evaluations some were underway and 17 programs had no evaluation completed and none planned so the government was not even looking to see if what they were doing had any value we are going to change that we are going to make sure the programs that are out there have evidencebased care the national child traumatic stress network is an excellent program that does a great job another program is called raise response after initial schizophrenia episode it does a great job because they work in terms of getting care early in someones life when they first show symptoms it is called the prodromal stage when you get to someone early you improve their prognosis but a lot of these other programsand i will highlight some of the sloppy and irrational programs we have out here tonightcan make a difference if they are done the right way it is important to note that with regard to serious mental illness about 50 percent of those with serious mental illness it will emerge by age 14 and about 75 percent of the cases by age 24 every time a person has what the public popularly knows as a breakdown or we refer to it as a psychological or psychiatric crisis there is harm that occurs to the person psychological harm and neurological harm because it is a brain disease so it is important to get to people early on that is why we want evidencebased care that really and truly does that and not programs that are fluff we want them to have outcome measures and determine them by the way just the opposite of that some of the things that samhsa has funded in the past have also been programs specifically geared toward telling people to stop taking their medication when people have anxiety they have plans in telling you how to drink a fruit smoothie none of those are evidencebased care and none of those treat people with serious mental illness number three go to the mental health workforce we have a serious serious shortage here of providers even if you wanted to get care you cant get care in many counties i think perhaps onefourth or onethird of counties in oregon do not even have a psychiatrist in them many do not have a clinical psychologist or clinical social workers or peer support teams with the adequacy to meet the need it is the same across the nation what happens here is there are about 9 000 child psychiatrists in this country we need 30 000 precisely for the reason i said before that these problems emerge during those adolescent and young adult years if you dont have the right qualified people you cant treat them similarly clinical psychologists counseling psychologists clinical social workers and peer support teams specifically trained and available to be out there we have massive shortages part of the job of the assistant secretary is going to be to identify what do we need in communities and how do we get them our bill authorizes for the first time minorities to work with fellowships we also authorize people to be volunteers at community health centers this is one of the bizarre things that only the federal government can do if you want to work at a community health center you can work and your medical malpractice insurance is covered if you want to volunteer it is not there now think about this if there are some wellintended and compassionateas i know many aremental health providers who want to volunteer maybe an afternoon a week give of their time to help they are not allowed to do it because the center cant afford their malpractice insurance because they would have to pay the regular rate as opposed to a federal plan rate our bill also authorizes that they can volunteer we also authorize programs with telemedicine so that when a pediatrician or a family member identifies someone in need of care they can access them immediately if need be especially in rural areas and faraway areas where there is not enough support there the next one is the shortage of mental health beds i had mentioned earlier this grave shortage where we had 550 000 beds in the 1950s we have 40 000 today it is a serious crisislevel shortage in every community during one of our hearings senator creigh deeds a state senator in virginia testified many are familiar with his story he was a former gubernatorial candidate in virginia and he took his son gus with him oftentimes campaigning around the state of virginia gus played a musical instrument and they enjoyed their time together but sadly gus deteriorated when his father who raised him fed him and clothed him took him to a hospital for care the hospital said we dont have any psych beds as they made calls and tried to find more in virginia they couldnt find any young gus was sent home with his father they wouldnt provide many details but they sent gus home gus took a knife and attacked his father nearly killing him creigh escaped and gus then killed himself all because of a lack of beds there was a story last week in the washington post about another virginia man a 24yearold man who was arrested for 5 worth of shoplifting at a 7eleven in virginia he was taken to jail for shoplifting but upon recognizing that he had a serious mental illness they wanted to get him to a hospital again there werent beds available so he stayed in that jail i believe over 70 days often naked covered in his own feces refusing to eat and losing 40 pounds ultimately he died for lack of a bed now that is not the only problem that is out there understand that we dont want to bring back those asylums but when a person is in that crisis mode it is not appropriate to bring them to a jail it is not appropriate to leave them in an emergency room for hours or days or weeks sometimes waiting for a hospital bed to open up and it certainly is inappropriate to discharge someone without any wraparound services or care but what happens is when you have a bed shortage you cannot get care for crisis by qualified persons we dont have the providers we dont have the places it is important for someone to have a clean and calm and caring environment separate from other environmental stresses and problems so you can work with them and stabilize them perhaps get them on medication help them relax help organize things for home care or outpatient care for them sometimes that takes a few days sometimes that takes a couple weeks but the idea is you need a place for them without beds oftentimes a staff simply cannot do a thorough evaluation and they sometimes then will simply make an uninformed and premature release of the individual of the consumer saying well he doesnt seem that bad we will send him home not really understanding whether or not that person is a threat to themselves or someone else understand this that even with the brain diseases of schizophrenia and bipolar when questioned someone could be in a position where when asked if they are going to harm themselves or someone else they would say no i am fine really it is okay it was just a disagreement i had they can keep it together for a little bit and if a staff is already saying look we dont have hospital beds lets send him home they will be sent home without really knowing the seriousness of their illness or providing full services further if you want to evaluate if someone is a threat to harm themselves or someone else or in imminent danger of that many times the doctors and the courts are reluctant to go through that process many times they are looking for another out and many timeslike in pennsylvania it is called a 302 procedurethey will bypass that or they will say to the patient can you just voluntarily commit yourself or promise you will be okay and you will go out and get care i want to add this because it is very important while the president and other people are talking about access to guns and talking about background checks you cant do a background check if you dont have a background recordyou cant do a background check if you dont have a background recordand if there is no place to help people when they are in crisis and if doctors and judges are not going to have someone involuntarily committed there is no record there is nothing that can appear on the national list to prevent a person from purchasing a firearm there was no time spent in a hospital where staff can truly evaluate are these delusions and hallucinations which can be controlled with medication will the person be stabilized are they a risk threat you cant do that we need more beds and our bill says there will be more this is one of those areas of incredible prejudices and bigotry you see medicaid has this rule that if you are between the ages of 21 and 64 you cannot go into a private hospital that has more than 16 beds now think about that if you have money you can go in a hospital if you are low income you are out of luck you are on the street it is a different standard that is grossly unfair and incredibly prejudicial and again i go to this point that those who are minorities or low income are treated the worst a person is ten times more likely to be treated in a jail cell than in a hospital if they are seriously mentally illten times more likely and yet that treatment in a jail cell is not appropriate at all it is not treatment oftentimes they are put in isolation they may get in a fight with a guard what started off as a small charge may end up as a felony assault charge a person with serious mental illness oftentimes for the same crime will spend four times the amount in jail as a person who is not mentally ill and all along if we had the proper place to treat them we could have done that our bill lifts this 16bed cap this ridiculously absurd 16bed cap and says instead we would like to have an average length of stay of less than 30 days that can be achieved in about 98 percent of cases it can be achieved and by the way it is far less expensive to have someone in a psychiatric hospital bed than an emergency room by about four times some studies have gone as high as saying it is about 20 times less expensive to have them in outpatient care than in a jail cell we would save a lot more money if we fixed this crisis shortage worked on other outpatient care to transition people out and wrap them around with the necessary services so they could go out more stable point number five we eliminate the same day doctor barrier another one of those ridiculously prejudicial rules out there that medicaid has that harms those of low income i mentioned a number of times that the prodromal stages of adolescents and young adulthood is when serious mental illness begins to emerge those first symptoms that sometimes someone may think is a little bit strange there is something different about this person perhaps their grades are dropping perhaps they are not taking care of themselves the way they used to perhaps they are withdrawing from relationships and friends those could be early signs of a bigger problem but it takes between first symptoms and first professional treatment on average 110 weeks over 2 years of waiting time between first symptoms in part because people are not aware of what to look for in the symptoms but in part because they are not connected with other providers here and even when they are they are not allowed to do anything the same day doctor rule is a medicaid rule which says you cant see two doctors in the same day at the same location so here is the problem if a pediatrician says to a mother or father we are very concerned about your teenage son who is in the later years 17 or so i would like him to see a psychiatrist right away because i am very concerned about the behaviors you are describing to me and then when that doctor realizes that that person is on medicaid basically medicaid says we are not paying for it how cruel and abusive is that to say to someone just because you have low income we are not going to cover the services here when this is a critical time when you have that warm handoff in the doctors office there is a 95 percent likelihood that the person will follow up according to a study by childrens hospital of pittsburgh when you wait and you say here is the number call it another day that likelihood drops below 45 percent and when you miss that golden opportunity to help a person in times of need that person may be very reluctant to come back for care in the future we fix this by saying we are going to drop that same day doctor rule number six we have to empower parents and caregivers to be part of the solution twenty years ago hipaa laws came out that said in order to help your insurance be portable we want to protect the records good idea we wanted to make sure records had privacy good idea but hipaa moved from the place where we are supposed to assist care and confidentiality to the point where it impairs care it has gone too far let me give you a couple of examples right now a doctorand i am a psychologist if i know a family member brings someone in to see me i can listen to them in a very passive mode but i cant provide them any information that is helpful they are giving me vital information for history if i dont have the accurate history a provider does not have accurate history you cant accurately diagnose you dont know if the person has been on medication before does it work or not work who has this person seen before what sets them off are they doing better what are their symptoms if i dont have or a provider does not have that information they may miss making the accurate diagnosis and then not be able to provide proper treatment and followup when that occurs harm can follow now if i get the information great but what happens if that family member is not there the provider cant go out and seek other family members and friends to get that information because hipaa laws are seen as barriers to that because as soon as a doctor at a hospital calls and says your adult son is in the hospital i need to ask you some information about it that doctor has already violated hipaa laws by identifying the persons son is in a hospital now think about this though a parent the person who was caring and loving throughout a lifetime committed to their family member a brother a sister someones mother or father they are prohibited from being part of the care team by hipaa laws a stranger some appointed worker someone who may see them as they roll in and out of their job even if they care and they burn out they will be maybe sitting next to a family member in court and simply say i cant tell you anything about this family member you will have to find out for yourself here is another problem though not only are you impaired from getting diagnostic information you cant evaluate medications but understand that people with serious mental illness are often at high risk for other medical problems in part because their hygiene may be poor they may not take care of themselves may not see doctors et cetera but they also are in a situation where they may take some medications that make them high risk for diabetes or heart disease and without getting a family member to help them with that they do not have the ability to properly treat them my goal in this bill is to simply say that in cases where someone has diminished capacity to take care of themselves where in absence of treatment they become gravely disabled a provider may tell a known caregiverso notice i have already set the bar pretty highmay tell a known caregiver a few simple facts the diagnosis the treatment plan the treating doctors time and place of appointment and what are the medications they are on no therapy notes are allowed to be exchanged we specifically prohibit that in this bill but that is important and by the way i might add one other thing as i hear a lot of people talking about the concerns of why didnt a parent do anything why didnt they know anything in some cases like the young man at virginia tech who killed so many students or the gentlemen in oregon or at sandy hook elementary school in connecticut it is because providers cannot do a risk assessment they cannot contact a family member and say can you tell me if this person has any morbid fantasy and fascination with death with extremely violent video games with dark web sites do they have weapons that are unsecured do they talk about violent issues have they made threats before you cant do that risk assessment without that you end up not knowing the risk number seven states receive money for mental health services and substance abuse disorders those dollars are about 500 million for mental health and about 600 to 700 million for substance abuse the odd thing about this is states are not allowed to mingle that money they cant braid it together even worse is that many people with a substance abuse disorder have a mental illness and many people with mental illness will turn toward other substances to selfmedicate and yet the person will have to go to two different providers two different clinics to get care instead of one we drop that barrier and say federal grants should go to states in a way that help the states work this best number eight we want to bring accountability to the spending of federal funds now here is where we have seen in another gao report the absolute absurdity and cruelty of how money is spent a gao report done this last summer told us that many times documents and applications for many who receive grants were not reviewed they couldnt tell you what the application criterion was to get an award they didnt have programspecific guidance information was missing or not readily available they didnt even know where it was stored you couldnt follow the paper trail to see where it was and so what happens is no one knows how this money was spent but let me tell you some of the absurd things we have found money is spent on our tax dollars how about this a web site last winter was posted by samhsa for the people of boston to help them with their worries about snow that is right they posted a 1800 number you could call if you had snow anxiety these are people from new england for goodness sake they know how to handle snow but our tax dollars went to help them understand it there are web sites that tell you to drink a fruit smoothie if you are anxious programs that tell you how to make a mask programs that we fund to how to make collages a painting in samhsas headquarters that cost 22 500 of two people sitting on a rock surrounded by other people 22 000 when we asked the director of samhsa what that was for they said it is more mental health awareness the only thing i am aware of is it is a waste of money and that money could have gone to help pay someones salary to actually treat a patient well it gets worse a web site for 3yearold children the cost of 426 000 with animated characters and singalong songs the purpose we asked the director of samhsa prevention prevention of what we said well we think prevention is good well what does this prevent and what does it do and does it work and does it do anything we waited for weeks to get an answer and we still dont have it 1 month later by the way they took the web site down when we shined a bright light on it saying what does this do we want accountability to this spending there will be different grant programs nowdemonstration grants innovation grantswhere people will know what these grants are they can look at them as scientific studies in a blind review to make sure it is going to quality programs that really make sense no more of this behavioral wellness stuff but truly working at things that make a difference number nine develop alternatives to institutionalization and have real jail diversion i said already what happens to so many people with mental illness they end up in jail forty to sixty percent of people in prison have a mental illness and what this does is it helps provide some extra funding for states that have wraparound services for those who have this history of violent incarcerations arrests mental illness new york has a program called assisted outpatient treatment their program which means a judge will say you need to stay in treatment at an outpatient level has found they reduced incarcerations by 81 percent they reduced homelessness by over 70 percent they reduced admissions to emergency rooms by over 70 percent they had patient satisfaction consumer satisfaction at over 90 percent and they cut costs in half states have different programs here about 46 states have something on the books but many of these states do not put these programs in practice because of the big cost we know states will save a lot of money once they start doing this but what we want to do is take people out of this cycle this revolving door of jail and risk and more damage and say that states need to have programs where it wraps around services for that person dont just dump them from jail onto the streets and expect a problem because it will erupt again make sure those services are there make sure the person stays in treatment now some say well that is unfair some say that might be an involuntary commitment that it puts people there against their will and you impair their rights but i say this that a person with serious mental illness 40 percent of the time is not even aware they have a problem and so many times they refuse treatment or their past runins with the police and other hospitals because they dont want to be there they dont want to get treatment if we provide quality compassionate accessible care they may get that but not under the current system we want to make sure they have that care and we will provide the funding to do it number 10 advance early intervention and prevention programs a lot of what our government spends money on is what is called primary prevention the things we do for everybody like dont smoke wear a seat belt but what happens is in the area of mental illness those wellness programs like i described before that are out there the silly things that samhsa does are not an effective use of dollars secondary and tertiary prevention is valuable secondary is when you recognize someone is at risk but not with symptoms tertiary is when they have symptoms and you try and help them get better by focusing money on the programs i mentioned beforethe raise program or others the child and adolescent traumatic stress networkyou can move the dollars where they need to be funded and stop this silliness now i should say this while i am talking about samhsa that despite two gao reports that criticize themand one time afterwards i had the director of samhsa in my office and i said okay here is your opportunity would you change anything and she said no i wouldnt change a thing another time during one of our hearings one of my colleagues said on a scale of 1 to 10 how would you rate yourself on your programs and the director said i would give myself a 10 despite all these failures that is the reason why we need to have an assistant secretary of mental health that is the reason why we need to make these changes this is the current reason why we have so many of these problems before i wrap up here i want to yield a couple of minutes to the gentleman from

the comments that have been made by my colleagues to bring into focus the positive solutions that we have been working for with our budget i reluctantly oppose the motion to instruct as it compromises the ability of the conference committee to fashion the best possible solution i will say however that the distortions that have been presented i think they have gone past frustrating the american people they anger the american people about the distortion of positions here in washington the american people are smarter than that our side of the aisle we are interested in making certain that we assist all americans every single american so that he or she has the greatest opportunity to realize the greatest amount of success in their own dreams in their own lives in the way that they deem to be most appropriate not with washington dictating to them what they must do i want to touch on a couple of very specific issues that have been mentioned by my friend from maryland and others on the other side of the aisle our balanced budget proposal gets to balance within a 10year period of time it does so without raising taxes and it increases growth now the growth is important and our friends mentioned it on the other side of the aisle as if the policies that have been in place over the past 6 years had some magical solution that they increased growth in this country well the fact of the matter is that as we see it in this chartthis is from the congressional budget office the nonpartisan congressional budget office as my friend from maryland says these are the projections of growth that the congressional budget office has had over the last 4 years four years ago 3 0 percent the average as you all well know is about 3 3 percent over the last 40 years growth in this country that is in the economy growing every year 3 3 percent on average and the projection 4 years ago was that it would be 3 percent three years ago it was down to 2 9 percent 2 years ago 2 5 percent this year 2 3 percent this is lost jobs lost opportunity fewer dreams realized all because of the policies coming out of washington d c and our friends on the other side want to double down on those policies our proposal our budget that gets to balancewhich our friends on the other side of the aisle and their budget never does the presidents budget never gets to balance something that folks back home cant do they cant do it in their personal lives they cant do it in their businesses our budget gets to balance and increases growthincreases growthbecause that is what we have got to do we have got to increase growth in this economy so that more dreams can be realized more jobs can be created wages can be increased the way you increase wages is to increase the vitality of the economy not have washington dictate it to people and then this tired old characterization of our proposal to save and strengthen and secure medicare and the way that it is characterized is to voucherize it well this is nonsense and the american people know it what we propose to do is to save medicare not allow it to die on the vine which is what our friends on the other side of the aisle apparently want to do because when you read their policies they dont do anything to address the insolvency of medicare that is coming in a very short period of timenot according to me but according to the medicare trusteesand what that means is that patients seniors wont be able to get provided the services that they have been promised that is not the right thing to do our friends on the other side talk about all the tax loopholes and goodness knows we have been for cutting tax loopholes and closing tax loopholes before closing tax loopholes was cool we just cant get out and get folks to rally to the cause in a positive way from our friends on the other side of the aisle my friend from maryland knows that the way that that is fashioned is in the ways and means committee it is not in the budget committee the budget committee lays out the vision lays out the plan lays out the parameters that are able to be utilized as my friend from maryland knows the ways and means committee is actively working right nowactively working right nowon appropriate tax reform it was the tax reform proposal that was put forward by our side of the aisle last year that demonstrated our willingness and desire to close loopholes and to end special treatments through the tax code we believe everybody ought to be treated equally in the tax code not have washington picking winners and losers which is what our friends on the other side tend to desire then again this distorted notion about healthcare costs and where healthcare costs are going right now healthcare costs are down that is right who are they down for they are down for the federal government who are they not down for the american people that is who they are not down for what we have done with the presidents healthcare program is to shift huge costshuge coststo the american people if you are an individual out there you make 30 000 40 000 50 000 right now and the coverage that you are able to purchase right nowbecause obamacare has a deduction has a deductible in your health plan of between 6 000 and 12 000 which countless americans have right now let me suggest that you dont have health coverage because you cant afford the deductible but that is the proposal that our friends on the other side of the aisle embrace that is the one that they want to put forward and who are they harming they are harming the american people and the american people know it they know there is a better solution they know that there is a better way there is a positive way a patientcentered solution manner to be able to get health care back

held 30 hearings and briefings on iran since these negotiations began we have reviewed this agreement in depth but i can come to no other conclusion than not only does it come up short it is fatally flawed and indeed dangerous i will oppose the measure before us we should have gotten a better deal indeed when the house passed stiff iran sanctions legislationnow this was in 2013in the prior congress we passed this legislation authored by myself and mr engel by a vote a bipartisan vote in this body of 40020 the intention of that legislation was to put that additional leverage on iran and force the ayatollah to make a choice between real compromisereal compromiseon his nuclear program and economic collapse if he did not unfortunately the secretary of state and the administration worked to ensure that the other body never took that measure up this legislation would have put more pressure as i say on iran and might have led to an acceptable deal but instead of an ironclad agreement that is verifiable and holds iran to account we are considering an agreement that leaves iran in a few short years only steps away from a nuclear weapons program one that would be on an industrial scale under the agreement iran is not required to dismantle key bombmaking technology instead it is permitted a vast enrichment capacity reversing decades of bipartisan nonproliferation policy that never imagined endorsing this type of nuclear infrastructure for any country never mind a country that lives by the motto death to america while members of congress insisted on anywhere anytime inspections unitedstates negotiators settled for something called managed access so instead of allowing international inspectors into those suspicious sites within 24 hours it will take 24 days and that is to commence the process worse there have been revelations in recent days about an agreement between iran and the united nations nuclear watchdog this agreement sets the conditions in which a key iranian military site that is suspected of nuclear bomb worksuspected in the sense that we have 1 000 pages of evidence of that bomb workwill be explored as we have heard those details have been kept from congress we dont have those details in our hands but it is reported that instead of international inspectors doing the inspecting the iranians themselves will take the inspection lead iran has cheated on every agreement they have signed so why do we trust them now to selfpolice the deal guts the sanctions web that is putting intense pressure on iran billions will be made available to iran to pursue its terrorism indeed irans elite quds force has transferred fundsand this should bother all of usto hamas it has committed to rebuild the network of tunnels from gaza to attack israel mr engel and i were in one of those tunnels last year they have agreed in iran to replenish the mediumrange missile arsenal of hamas and they are working right now they claim to give precisionguided missiles to hezbollah i can tell you i was in haifa in 2006 when it was under constant bombardment by those types of rockets but they werent precisionguided every day they slammed into the city and there were 600 victims in the trauma hospital now iran has transferred eightfold the number of missiles and they want to give them the guidance systems they need money to pay for those guidance systems iran won late concessions to remove international restrictions on its ballistic missile program and on its conventional arms and that imperils the security of the region and frankly the security of our homeland for some the risks in this agreement are worth it as they see an iran that is changing for the better as one supporter of this agreement told our committee president obama is betting that in 10 or 15 years we will have a kinder gentler iran but that is a bet against everything we have seen out of the regime since the 1979 revolution already iranian leaders insist that international inspectors wont see the inside of irans military bases and that iran can advance its missiles and weapons without breaking the agreement it is guaranteed that iran will game the agreement to its advantage so we must ask ourselves will international bureaucrats call out iran knowing that doing so will put this international agreement at risk we are not calling them out now as they are transferring weapons will this administration which didnt even insist that four american hostages come home as part of this agreement be any tougher on iran in implementing this deal does this serve the longterm national security interests of the united states does it make the world and frankly the region more safe more stable more secure is there any other reason iranan energy rich countryis advancing its nuclear technology other than to make a nuclear weapon and why do its leaders chant death to america and death to israel the new york times ran a story on quds day which is the national parade it was some weeks ago there was president rouhanithe socalled moderatemarching in that parade behind him the crowd was chanting it was chanting death to america in front of them they

nsa lets move on to what is called ecpa we will talk about the irs a little bit this spring most americans are going to be filing taxes their tax returns and many americans including me are concerned about the irs ability to take information from americans without their consent or without a warrant sometimes that includes emails so lets talk specifically about the concept of government seizure of emails without consent of the person who sent it or received it and without a warrant current federal law is that if somebody has an email within 6 months of when that email was sent that email to be obtained by governmentnot just law enforcement but any government agencythey have to get a warrant to seize that but as soon as that 160 days runs past 160 days the government doesnt get a warrant because the law doesnt require it i think in the spirit of the fourth amendment the fourth amendment should require that email what is email that is an electronic message sent to another person lets go back to regular mail or snail mail which some people call it if i write a letter and i seal the envelope and i put the postage on there and i send it go put it in the mailbox one of those blue mailboxes and i drop that in the mailbox the government does not have the authority to go in that mailbox and take the letter out read the letter seize the letter without a warrant so it flows through the united states postal system from wherever to wherever and it lands in somebody elses mailbox that mail generally speaking is protected under the fourth amendment because it violates the fourth amendment if government seizes it and goes into the contents without a warrant the same should apply to emails it is communication it is just done electronically but the law does not allowlet me say it another way if emails are over 6 months old americans should be aware of the fact that government may seize those emails from a private company without your knowledge without your consent and without a warrant that is why i have introduced along with representative zoe lofgren from california that the law should be that emails are protected that it is a right of privacy and it is an expectation of privacy for americans that emails be protected and that government should be getting a warrant before they seize those documents because it is a violation at least in the spirit of the fourth amendment i hope that that legislation does finally come to the floor and we get a vote on protecting the fourth amendment the right of privacy for americans when it comes to emails the same applies not only just to emails but under the circumstances it would apply to geolocation devices that the government knows where you are i think the government to keep up with you needs a warrant to stalk you throughout the united states the third thing i wanted to mention in the remaining time is a completely different issue but it has to do with drones the right of privacy we are in the drone age it is estimated that by 2030 we will have 30 000 drones over the skies of the united states 30 000 of them drones are a marvelous invention they are highly technical they can be very small you can get one at a local store that you can put in the palm of your hand no question about it there are good uses for drones right now the law is that the faa regulates the use of drones throughout the united states it may permit some it may not permit may refuse to permit them it is a bureaucratic decision by the faa congress needs to weigh in on the issue of drones and set down constitutional guidelines people need to know the rules law enforcement needs to know the rules and private citizens need to know the rules about their use of drones and basically the fourth amendment ought to apply to the use of a drone except with the exigent circumstances that already apply to the fourth amendmenthighspeed chases disasters fires et ceterabut we need some guidelines on the issue of drones congress has the responsibility to protect the fourth amendment of the surveillance of americans by either law enforcement or by private citizens and develop a standard for both law enforcement and for private citizens to know what the standard is yes there are reasons why we should use them and the law should allow those but congress needs to make the decision not the faa i have a local sheriff or the sheriff in texas where i am from he generally says he doesnt want to use drones because he doesnt know what the courts are going to decide down the road as to whether or not that use of a drone was a lawful or unlawful violation of the fourth amendment so rather than wait for the courts to decide if this specific use is or is not a violation of the fourth amendment congress needs to come up with guidelines about the design and the protection of the fourth amendment that drones can only be used in certain circumstances otherwise they are not allowed to be used because they violate the fourth amendment of the united states so those are three issues that have the right of privacy that are being i think chilled today because there is more and more government intrusion into all of those areas into the massive data of phone information information that is put on your iphone for example that is being seized can be seized without knowledge without warrant the massive amount of emails that can be seizedwe really dont know how much is being seized because over 6 months your personal email is not protected by law government agencies not just law enforcement can seize thatand then the skies will have 30 000 of those drones there needs to be some regulations within protection of the fourth amendment and we need to work with industry and government to outline what those rules ought to be to protect the fourth amendment protect the right of privacy of individuals to be secure in their homes in their papers and their effects from government intervention and government intrusion congress should set the standard for what a reasonable expectation of privacy is especially in those areas that i mentioned and the one regarding drones as well so i hope that we see some movement in this legislation once again zoe lofgren and i have introduced legislation as well as others to protect the right of individuals to be free from searches of their emails after 6 months without a search warrant we have that legislation pending as well hopefully we can rein in what i call the stalking government about stalking american citizens america is not about keeping up and following every citizen in the united states by government that is what other countries do that is what countries like the soviet union used to do that is not what america should be doing and congress needs to weigh in on this to protect individuals right of privacy under the fourth amendment which was the spark according to john adams to the american revolution that concept of the fourth amendment

work the committee on homeland security has done over the past year i am honored to have the privilege to sponsor so many pieces of legislation that are helping to keep our country safe i would like to thank ranking member rice and ranking member thompson for their time and attention to this important piece of legislation i would also like to thank the gentleman from texas the chairman of the full committee for his continued support of the subcommittees oversight efforts and for ensuring important pieces of legislation such as h r 3584 are considered on the house floor the committee on homeland securitys legislative results under the leadership of chairman mccaul and ranking member thompson are proof that by working together in a bipartisan fashion not only can we improve the security of our country but we can demonstrate to the american people that congress can actually work together and deliver results i urge my colleagues to support this bill i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.06347742676734924, 0.43652257323265076, 1, "i thank my good friend from north carolina for yielding me this time i rise in strong support of the jason simcakoski promise act jason was a veteran who unfortunately saw his life end way too soon while receiving treatment at the tomah va medical center in the heart of my congressional district i want to thank first of all subcommittee chairman bilirakis for the leadership and support that he has shown this legislation he has been a real joy to work with i want to thank chairman miller for the leadership he has provided the committee and for the concern and the attention that he has given to all of our veterans throughout our country i want to thank representative butterfield and the other members of the committee for the strong bipartisan support that this legislation enjoys on the floor today jason was born in stevens point wisconsin in 1978 in my congressional district he is the son of marvin and linda simcakoski he is a graduate of stevens point pacelli high school shortly after his graduation he joined the marine corps where he reached the rank of corporal receiving the sea service deployment ribbon with one star a certificate of commendation the rifle sharp shooters badge and the good conduct medal he was honorably discharged in february of 2002 jason loved being a marine and he was very proud to serve his country he married heather in 2010 in stevens point and they had a beautiful daughter named anaya i am proud that many members of jasons family came out to washington this week to see the passage of this bill today his mother linda his wife heather his daughter anaya who are in the chamber with us today his father marvin who was also intimately involved in helping draft this legislation and see it through was unfortunately unable to attend but i commend all of them because this is how legislation is meant to work by reaching out to veterans organizations getting direct feedback from the veterans themselves their families healthcare providers we have known for some time that we have had a pain management problem not just in the va medical system but throughout our entire healthcare system this unfortunately came to light through numerous investigations at the tomah va medical center over the course of the last few years which ultimately helped and precipitated the legislation that we have before us today jasons familys guiding star in all of this based on the numerous conversations that i have had with them and that they have had with chairman bilirakis and even with speaker ryan was to ensure that the care and the treatment that our veterans receive be enhanced so that no veteran and no family would have to go through and endure what they did jason was receiving pain management and was under the opioid medication at tomah this legislation i think advances that goal i dont think anyone can be here with absolute certitude and promise a family or future veterans that mistakes wont happen in the future but i think what is contained in this legislation is a significant step in the right direction with the understanding that more work is needed the bill would require a review and an update of the vas clinical practice guideline for the management of opioid therapy for chronic pain it requires all opioid prescribers at the va to have enhanced pain management and safe opioid prescribing education and training it improves the realtime tracking of and access to data on the opioid use of veterans in order to prevent overmedication it provides additional resources to assist the vas ability to counter overdoses it expands the opioid safety initiative to all va medical facilities it updates the joint working group of the va and dod to focus on opioid prescribing practices the use of alternative pain therapy and the coordination when a servicemember transitions from the dod into the va care setting it also encourages the use of alternative and complementary forms of pain management lastly it requires the va to report on prescription rates so we can better assess the problem and find solutions this is a work in progress not just within the va system not just with the reforms that are currently being implemented at the tomah va medical center in my congressional district but throughout the entire healthcare system we as a nation have not done a very good job of managing pain at all levels i am glad and i am proud that this congress sees the need to move forward on a comprehensive opioid legislation bill hopefully we can get that to the finish line yet this year there is also a major va reform bill that we are working onexcellent vehicles in order to include some of the provisions of this legislation as we move forward if there is any hope and promise that out of the tragedy of jasons death good things can come of it i think the legislation that we have before us today the jason simcakoski promise act gives us that hope and gives us that opportunity i couldnt think of a more powerful legacy in jasons name than this legislation i ask all of my colleagues to give their support of this legislation today again i thank the leadership of the committee on veterans affairs for the help the assistance and the focus that they have provided on this important piece of legislation"], [0.07592856884002686,

crowded every day as the inmate population continues to rise with 216 000 individuals currently serving federal sentences our prisons get more and more crowded every day at the end of fiscal 2013listen to this25 percent of our medium security inmates and 85 percent of our low security inmates were triple bunkedtriple bunked considering that 8 out of every 10 medium security inmates has a history of violence this creates some very serious questions about the safety of the bop staff the public and even other inmates updating our prisons will provide greater efficiency and staffing and permits staff to safely oversee more inmates our medium and maximum security prisons house some of the worlds most dangerous and violent criminals the bill before us provides critical funding to the federal bureau of prisons in order to modernize and strengthen our nations prison infrastructure these funds will help protect the public as well as the men and women who work at these facilities it is imperative that we provide them a safe and secure environment within which to work the federal government has a commitment to keep the public and prison staff safe and these dollars are needed to fulfill that commitment so i oppose this effort to reduce funding for the bureau of prisons and urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment"], [0.08058276772499084, 0.41941723227500916, 1, "mr chair as a fellow washingtonian might i just observe that you make that dais look good i actually counterintuitively want to start out by thanking my friend the gentleman from missouri for taking this issue on we had a problem in a lot of communities around the country with businesses getting access to the banking system and i know he worked this very hard last year he investigated he talked to banks businesses and regulators and he actually negotiated a solution with the fdic that he had pushed and pushed until they actually adopted it it was a good solution in fact part of this bill would essentially codify that what it would say is you cant use firrea to go after whole sectors of the economy it has to be specifically and individually based you have to have a reason to believe that an individual business was engaged in fraud if you were going to use the banking system to get at them good solution constructive solution my hat is off to you sir unfortunately this bill as has been suggested earlier goes farther section 3 makes it a lot harder for the department of justice to investigate financial solutions because as has been suggested it takes direct and specific aim at the powers under firrea as the gentleman from minnesota had indicated it puts limits on them as to when subpoenas can be issued to me frankly that is a solution in search of a problem firrea has been the key statute in going after fraud that in fact helped lead to the great recession and the crisis and the wiping out of 13 trillion in net worth frankly i am one of those people who believes we need more prosecutions not fewer for all the damage and harm done to americans throughout this land i am very reluctant to embrace any language that substantially weakens or obstructs firreas ability to investigate fraud i do agree with my friend that investigations and our oversight of them could be improved by requiring a paper trail i worked with him to see if we could find a compromise that did that but we couldnt so ultimately we had to disagree and this is a disagreement that i will characterize as being a very strong one the truth of the matter is in the last two calendar years alone firrea was the operative statute which led to 40 billion in fines and recoveries being levied truth be told it is very very unlikely if not highly unlikely that any of those 40 billion in fines or restitution could have been recovered if the language of this legislation had been in effect 20 billion of which was restitution to harmed parties people who lost their homes inappropriately because they had had fraud perpetuated upon them i dont think that is what the american public wants right now i think the american public is still eager for some accountability for the actions and behavior that led to the great recession the acting chair the time of the gentleman has expired"]]}
