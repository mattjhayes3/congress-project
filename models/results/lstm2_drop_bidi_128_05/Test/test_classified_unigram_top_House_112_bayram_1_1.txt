bills to ever come to the floor of the house the authors of this bill are talking out of both sides of their mouth today i want to set the record straight in one breath the proponents of this bill say they are protecting female fetuses by preventing abortions based on sex and that we must pass this bill to protect women everywhere and show that girls are as valid as boys yet just last week these same members obstructed the passage of an expanded violence against women act that would have protected all victims of violence the same members who today espouse equality for women voted against the lilly ledbetter fair pay act which will help combat the discrimination against women that keeps them earning 77 cents for every dollar that men earn the same members who today talk about protecting female babies continue to vote to gut the prevention and public health fund which will be used to provide lifesaving breast and cervical cancer screenings to millions of the very women prendas proponents claim to care so much about heres the truth this is not about womens equality prenda is simply another attempt by choice opponents to obstruct womens access to reproductive health care i agree with the bills proponents that abortions based on sex are a problem around the world and i agree that we must take action to stop these abusive practices both at home and around the world but let me be clear that this bill will not prevent sexselective abortions heres why first criminalizing such practices simply will not work banning sexselective abortions has already been tried in various countries around the world and what expert agencies such as the world health organizationwhich operate in these countrieshave found is that these bans dont prevent abortions rather they simply result in a greater demand for clandestine procedures which fall outside regulations protocols and monitoring and basic safety these restrictions serve only to drive these procedures underground making them less safe our own history proves this point second criminalization of sexselective abortions would force physicians to question women about their reasons for seeking abortion it would likely compel physicians to target certain groups of women from cultures where sexselection abortion is more prevalent to avoid liability physicians may even cease providing such care to entire groups of women simply because of their race this bill would promote racial profiling and discrimination additionally targeting such motivations in practice would be nearly impossible according to an analysis by the world health organization and four other u n agencies prosecuting offenders is practically impossible and further proving that a particular abortion was sex selective is equally difficult these expert international organizations do offer a viable solution to address this issue a solution unmentioned in h r 3541 address the root causes which drive individuals to prefer sons over daughters the united nations through its work in nations where sex selection is prevalent has stated that the most effective way to address this son preference is by fighting the root economic social and cultural causes of sex inequality south korea successfully lowered its maletofemale ratio from 116 boys for every 100 girls in the nineties to 107 boys per 100 girls in 2007 they did this by passing laws to improve the legal status of women and by implementing a public education campaign emphasizing the importance of women if were going to consider this bill lets be honest about it its supporters are not promoting womens equality and they are not serious about preventing sexselective abortions if they were they would be promoting programs to empower women and girls to combat son preference instead they are criminalizing physicians profiling cultural groups and driving abortion services underground the truth is that this bill is another attempt to restrict womens reproductive

medications doctor visits and hospital care sixtynine percent of people over the age of 65 and they are both democrats and republicans oppose medicare becoming a voucher program seniors know that changing medicare to a voucher program means that they will no longer have access to a guaranteed set of health benefits that the value of a limited voucher wont keep up with rising health care costs

congress has the power to declare war and raise and support armed forces while the president is the commander in chief the congressional duties fall under article 1 section 8 and the commander in chief can relate his or her duties to article 2 section 2 it is generally agreed that the commander in chief role gives the president power to utilize the armed services to repel attacks against the united states but there has long been a challenge or controversy over whether he or she is constitutionally authorized to send forces into hostile situations abroad without a declaration of war or congressional authorization and so here we are today indicating that it is important for the commander in chief no matter how much respect there is to be able to respond to the call of the congress

approximately 500 million is spent every year in dealing with invasive species that clog municipal water systems and that damage infrastructure such as electric power plants levees and aqueducts in california over 7 million was spent to eradicate the mediterranean green seaweed from two small embayments in southern california and 12 million had to be spent in san francisco bay to control the atlantic cordgrass most of these invasive species arrive in our waters via the ballast water of commercial vehicles unfortunately in my viewand i believe in the view of a great many of my colleaguesthe bill before us does not do enough to protect our communities and businesses from the avoidable costs of dealing with invasive species this week the state of california sent members of congress a letter saying that title vii of the underlying bill will set a federal ballast water discharge standard that does not provide a significant improvement over existing management strategies

not add or change any technological requirements in the bill this is an issue of extreme importance for the industry understandably so and for that reason my amendment simply does not affect in any way the technological requirements it also does not give states carte blanche to prevent ships from releasing ballast water which is another important issue for the industry there is ample precedent for the amendment that i am offering and for the policy that my amendment would embody in 1996 the thenrepublicancontrolled congress amended the clean water act requiring the department of defense to work with the environmental protection agency to regulate ballast water from military vessels through the uniform national discharge standards program through this program the republican congress acknowledged a deep respect for the rights of states including a residual authority for states to establish no discharge zones which is similar to what my amendment would establish another precedent is that section 312 of the clean water act which is the closest analogy to ballast water discharges from commercial vessels establishes uniform standards for discharges of marine sanitation devices section 312 specifically reserves a role for states to create no discharge zones for important state waters provided that these zones will not adversely impact vessels from operating within the states in the past ballast water legislation has included a role for the states and industry was on board with those provisions 1150 theres an irony to what were doing here today and that is during this congress much of the debate has centered on how states should be allowed to take the lead on managing different programs within their jurisdiction be they educational programs or environmental protection programs or eliminating regulations and so on and yet in this instance we are saying the exact opposite we are saying that the federal government knows best how to protect local waters and states are not given any say in protecting their waters just a few months ago this congress passed h r 2018 the cooperative federalism act of 2011 which eliminates any federal role in setting baseline water quality standards giving full discretion for the setting of those standards to the states title vii of todays bill says that states should have no say in what happens in their waters whatsoever the exact opposite of what this congress passed with pretty broad support several months ago we also have heard a great deal from our friends in the tea party about the 10th amendment and how rights need to be reserved to the states under that amendment well i would contend that the ability to protect waters of the state and to set standards for waters of the state would fall within at least the spirit of the 10th amendment and i would hope that my colleagues would agree with that so i just want to say that i believe my amendment as the gentleman from west virginia referred to it is a surgical attempt to fix what i believe is a significant problem for states the gentleman from new jersey and i worked very hard to try to come up with a sweet spot where we could agree we were unable

congress to authorize americas going to war that has been the law in the constitution since it was written then came the war powers resolution and congress decided that it would give a little of that constitutional authority to the president for a period of days until he justified his action before congress we can argue whether the war powers resolution is constitutional or not but in any event congress has not led america to war in libya the president has the president made that decision as james madison the author of the constitution said in a letter to thomas jeffersonand i paraphraseit has been the history of peoples that it has been the executive branch that has led a country to war and thats why our constitution prevented kings and dictators and even presidents from leading this

maybe we should spend that 700 million in the united states building america rather than blowing up libya i think that would be a better use of funds we need to take care of america we shouldnt be

that are commendable first of all from a navy point of view we are maintaining the cadence of building two fastattack boats every year that has significant implications relative to our industrial base likewise we are going to be building two destroyers a year so we have made some changes to the presidents budget there were also requiring that the navy keeps at least 12 ballistic missile submarines that are an important leg of our triad i would also call attention to a couple of amendments that i have offered the first is that we have worked with information that weve gotten from overseas on the evacuation procedures that are being done and the speed with which our sons and daughters are being picked up on the battlefield there is nothing wrong with the great people who are working the medevacs we are concerned with dod policy howeverthat that policy may be resulting in unnecessary delays secondly this bill contains an amendment that i offered to protect first amendment rights of people in the service and chaplains in particular unfortunately it seems that this is against what the white house many democrats and the new york times all seem to want the heart of the amendment is to say that if you are a chaplain you are not going to be forced to perform ceremonies that you think are wrong it protects what we call free speech the first amendment and also the right of religious freedom it does the same thing for our servicemembers and it seems ironic that there is opposition to affording first amendment rights to our sons and daughters who are fighting for our first amendment rights so this seems like it should be very noncontroversial allowing people to follow the dictates of their own conscience but it seems to be meeting stiff resistance nonetheless lastly i

have not lead to the harassment of otters off the coast of california so the provisions to continue naval exemptions from the endangered species act esa and marine mammal protection act mmpa should be

fishermen working south of point conception california would be given incidental take exemptions from the esa and mmpa indefinitely this would remove any ability of the fish and wildlife service or any other agency to address problems that may arise with otter recovery as a result of interaction with fisheries esa and mmpa exemptions for specific industries undermine the principles of management

not rest on the shoulders of sea otters commercial overharvest and withering disease are the primary culprits to the decline of endangered abalone species the presence of sea otters and related

sure in 1960 it was a larger part of the budget that is before we had medicare before we had a lot of programs but when you ask yourself is our military structured to deal with the problems this country faces and to expect from other countries in the world their share of what must be done the answer surely is this is an unsustainable size this amendment was born out of a series of discussions among mr frank and mr paul and mr jones and some other members and i have had over several months recently we sent a joint letter that outlined our concerns about the state of our spending on national security we point out not only the excessive unquestioned overall size of military spending but also that this is a result of the military that is indeed a remnant of the cold war to go back to mr coles comments and it bears far more than our share of keeping the peace and is still structured to overwhelm the soviet union more than to deal with todays actual threats to our security to take one

in the press that england and france have been pressing the united states to resume its earlier role in libya because theyve been unable to assume it themselves the explanation is that only america has the capacity to respond our point precisely we have allowed other nations in the world to grow into an overdependence on americas military and americas tax dollars and the expenditure of american money and lives far beyond whats appropriate for our share of world peacekeeping all of us who support this amendment want to protect our country thats precisely why weve offered our proposal and this amendment to put ourselves on track for a better structured military spending money on cold warera weapons to wage undeclared wars of choice is clear evidence of misguided needlessly expensive priorities if the house cannot even pass an amendment that simply cuts the rate of increase in pentagon spending it will never pass amendments that actually make the kinds of cuts that are truly
