clevelandbased majorityblack district reluctant to enter the political arena stokes was persuaded to run for office by his prominent brother and by community members he had served for decades as a civil rights lawyer his accomplishments were substantive and of historic proportions the first black to represent ohio stokes chaired several congressional committees including the permanent select intelligence committee and was the first african american to win a seat on the powerful house appropriations committee he used his success to try to increase opportunities for millions of african americans saying im going to keep on denouncing the inequities of this system but im going to work within it to go outside the system would be to deny myselfto deny my own existence ive beaten the system ive proved it can be doneso have a lot of others stokes continued but the problem is that a black man has to be extra special to win in this system why should you have to be a super black to get someplace thats whats wrong in the society the ordinary black man doesnt have the same chance as the ordinary white man does louis stokes was born on february 23 1925 in cleveland ohio to charles and louise cinthy stone stokes his father worked in a laundromat and died when louis was young stokes and his younger brother carl were raised by their widowed mother whose salary as a domestic was supplemented by welfare payments louis stokes supplemented the family income by shining shoes around the cleveland projects and clerking at an army navy store he attended clevelands public schools and served as a personnel specialist in the unitedstates army from 1943 to 1946 he returned home with an honorable discharge taking jobs in the veterans administration and treasury department offices in cleveland while attending college at night with the help of the gi bill he attended the cleveland college of western reserve university from 1946 to 1948 stokes eventually earned a j d from the cleveland marshall school of law in 1953 and with his brother opened the law firm stokes and stokes on august 21 1960 louis stokes married jeanette jay francis and they raised four children shelly louis c angela and lorene he devoted himself to his law practice where he became involved in a number of civil rightsrelated casesoften working pro bono on behalf of poor clients and activists he was an active participant in civic affairs working on behalf of the cleveland naacp stokes helped challenge the ohio legislatures redistricting in 1965 that followed the supreme courts one man one vote decision the state legislature had fragmented the congressional districts that overlay cleveland diluting black voting strength stokes joined forces with charles lucas a black republican to challenge that action they lost their case in unitedstates district court but based on stokess written appeal the unitedstates supreme court agreed with the brief in 1967 from that decision followed the creation of ohios first majorityblack district later that year in december 1967 stokes made an oral argument before the unitedstates supreme court in terry v ohio a precedentsetting case that defined the legality of police search and seizure procedures at his brother carls behest louis stokes made his first run for elective office in 1968 he sought to win the seat in the newly created congressional district that encompassed much of the east side of cleveland stokes was hardly a typical newcomer to the political campaign first his brother mayor stokes put the services of his political network at louiss disposal stokes won by a landslide he won his subsequent 14 general elections by lopsided margins in the heavily democratic district taking as much as 88 percent of the vote as a freshman representative stokes received assignments on the education and labor committee and the internal security committee formerly the house unamerican activities committee he enthusiastically accepted the former assignment believing education and labor would be a prime platform from which he could push the agenda for his urban district job training economic opportunity and educational interests but stokes was less pleased with the internal security panel which had lapsed into an increasingly irrelevant entity since its heyday investigating communists in the 1940s and 1950s house leaders disbanded it entirely in the mid1970s during his second term in the house stokes earned a seat on the appropriations committee during more than two decades on the committee stokes steered hundreds of millions of federal dollars into projects in his home state he eventually became an appropriations subcommittee chair or cardinal for veterans hud and independent agencies stokes was the second africanamerican cardinal ever the first julian dixon of california chaired the dc subcommittee years later stokes said of the appropriations committee its the only committee to be on all the rest is window dressing in addition to chairing an appropriations subcommittee stokes is one of fewer than two dozen african americans ever to chair a house committee and one of just a handful to wield the gavel on multiple panels the permanent select committee on intelligence 100th congress the committee on standards of official conduct 97th98th congresses 102nd congress and the select committee on assassinations 95th congress the growing ranks of black members sought to create a power base realizingin the words of representative william bill clay sr of missouri they had to parlay massive voting potential into concrete economic results as freshman house members stokes and clay quickly developed an enduring friendship and became strong supporters of the formation of the congressional black caucus cbc to promote economic educational and social issues that were important to african americans this strategy dovetailed with stokess perception of his role as an advocate for the black community in his district stokes served as chairman of the cbc for two consecutive terms beginning in 1972 after chairman charles diggs jr of michigan resigned from the post a centrist stokes was widely credited with shepherding the group away from the polarizing politics of various black factions toward a more stable and organized policy agenda using his position as cbc chairman and his increasing influence on the appropriations committee representative stokes pushed a legislative agenda that mirrored the needs of his majorityblack district he earned a reputation as a congenial but determined activist for minority issues consistently scoring as one of the most liberal members of the house in the americans for democratic action and the american federation of labor and congress of industrial organizations vote tallies he advocated more funding for education particularly for minority colleges affirmative action programs to employ more blacks housing and urban development projects and initiatives to improve access to health care for workingclass americans in the 1980s stokes vocalized black concerns that the ronald w reagan administration was intent on rolling back minority gains made in the 1960s and 1970s he described conservative efforts to scale back school desegregation efforts and affirmative action programsas well as massive spending on military programsas a full scale attack on the priorities of the black community he also was an early advocate of federal government intervention in the fight against hiv aids from his seat on the permanent select committee on intelligence stokes was a particularly forceful critic of the reagan administrations foreign policy he gained national prominence as a member of the house select committee to investigate covert arms transactions with iran when he grilled lieutenant colonel oliver north in 1987 about his role in funding anticommunist nicaraguan contras through weapons sales to tehran at one juncture he reminded north i wore as proudly as you do even when our government required black and white soldiers in the same army to live sleep eat and travel separate and apart while fighting and dying for our country house leaders repeatedly sought to capitalize on stokess image as a stable trustworthy and competent adjudicatorturning to him to lead highprofile committees and handle controversial national issues as well as the occasional ethics scandals in the house when representative henry gonzalez of texas resigned as chairman of the select committee on assassinations speaker thomas p tip oneill of massachusetts tapped stokes to lead the panel which was investigating the circumstances surrounding the deaths of president john f kennedy and dr martin luther king jr in 1978 stokess committee filed 27 volumes of hearings and a final report that recommended administrative and legislative reforms while the panel found that the king and the kennedy murders may have involved multiple assassins james earl ray and lee harvey oswald have traditionally been described as lone killers it concluded there was no evidence to support assertions of a broad conspiracy involving domestic groups or foreign governmentsan assessment that has been upheld for the past three decades the committee did suggest that oswald may have had an accomplice on dealey plaza where kennedy was killed in november stokess chairmanship of the select committee on assassinations led to his appointment by speaker oneill in 1981 as chairman of the house committee on standards of official conduct often called the ethics committee stokes steered the panel through a turbulent period that included investigations of members implicated in the federal bureau of investigations abscam sting and a sex scandal that involved two house members and current and former house pages during the 1990s stokess seniority made him an influential voice on the appropriations committee in 1993 at the start of the 103rd congress he assumed the chairmans gavel of the subcommittee on va hud and independent agencies which controlled one of the largest chunks of discretionary spending in the federal budget stokes prodded federal agencies to hire and serve more minorities republicans praised him for his nonpartisan leadership of the subcommittee but when the gop won control of the house in the 1994 elections and stokes became the ranking member of the panel he often found himself fighting republican efforts to trim federal spending that involved cutting welfare programs including public housing in january 1998 stokes announced his retirement from the house noting that he wanted to leave without ever losing an election moreover a new generation of rising black politicians cleveland was displacing those of stokess generation among his proudest accomplishments as a representative stokes cited his ability to bring appropriations committee money to his district to address needs in housing and urban development and the opportunities that allowed him to set historic precedents as an african american in the house when i started this journey i realized that i was the first black american ever to hold this position in this state stokes told a newspaper reporter i had to write the book i was going to set a standard of excellence that would give any successor something to shoot for after his congressional career louis stokes resumed his work as a lawyer he was a great american heroto be admired and remembered by us all"], [0.0006583333015441895, 0.9993416666984558, 1, "i thank the gentleman from georgia for yielding me the customary 30 minutes and i yield myself such time as i may consume i rise in opposition to the rule and the underlying legislation today the house is convening to debate a matter that we all agree is critical for our national security our economic competitiveness our prosperity and the success of our private sector the recent cyber attacks on sony and anthem are but two prominent examples of cases in which american businesses or government entities have come under attack by hackers among many other instances that havent even been reported i want to recognize the work that the house intelligence and homeland security committees did on these pieces of legislation and their attempts to address these issues unfortunately in spite of their hard work and the work of those that went into crafting these two bills i regret that they fall short of their goals and would likely do more harm than good not only do both bills particularly the protecting cyber networks act raise enormous concerns about inappropriate sharing of personal information and surveillance on americans private lives but they are built on the premise that many security experts have warned is fundamentally flawed that sharing information with the federal government should be the central focus of our efforts to protect american cyber networks rather than simply one aspect to a multipronged strategy to defeat hackers foreign and domestic now before i address the substance of these two bills i want to discuss this unusual rule before us and how it treats two bills which contradict each other in significant ways ordinarily when two committees share jurisdiction over a matterin this case the homeland security committee and the intelligence committeethey collaborate one committee handles one portion of the bill reports it out the other committee handles the other portion reports it out and they work together to bring a single piece of legislation to the floor for members to debate amend and vote for or against this is what happened for example with the recent sgr repeal legislation which had components under the jurisdiction of no less than six different committees in this body but was presented before us as a single bill in this case however because there seems to be some kind of turf war between the intelligence committee and the homeland security committee we are actually voting on two overlapping bills that in several respects contradict one another for instance the bills have drastically different determinations of what kind of information may be shared what purposes the government may use the information for and what hacking countermeasures companies are allowed to take to protect their networks instead of having a meaningful debate on the merits of each bills approach this body if this rule passes would forego that and we would simply debate and vote on each bill separately and if they both pass the rule directs the clerk to mesh them together through something called conforming amendments not only would this leave businesses to wade their way through two separate contradictory regulatory schemes but it leaves it unclear which bills provisions would actually prevail in practice and under which circumstances it actually would create more uncertainty in the marketplace rather than less i dont think anybody could reasonably call this an open process we shouldnt be depriving our constituents of an open debate on important issues the major amendments of this bill that would have restored privacy many of which i was a cosponsor are not even allowed to be debated on the floor of the house not for 10 minutes not for 5 minutes not even for 1 minute my colleagues and i on both sides of the aisle are being denied a vote on the very amendments that we feel could address the concerns we have with the cybersecurity legislation and make sure that we keep american networks safe in the 2 years since the nsas shockingly broad data collection program prism came to light we have heard from many of our constituents the american people want an end to unwarranted surveillance they want congress to restore desperately needed accountability and transparency to our nations often outofcontrol intelligencegathering apparatus it is bewildering to many people that at the very time the american people have spoken out that we want more safeguards instead we are bringing forward two bills whose central objective is to facilitate the flow of more personal information to the federal government when we continue to put off the question of surveillance reform and bringing an end to the nsas bulk data collection without warrants it is especially disappointing in light of the fact that several patriot act provisions will sunset at the end of next month giving congress a crucial opportunity to reexamine and rein in federal surveillance programs by putting off that issue and bringing mass information sharing to the floor congress is asking the american people for a blank check congress is saying trust the president no president would allow this information sharing to infringe on your civil liberties even though we have utterly failed to pass a single piece of legislation to end the privacy abuses that we know have occurred under this administration and the prior administration the problem with these bills is that they go far beyond and they open up additional loopholes and potential abuses with regard to privacy abuses particularly h r 1560 the socalled protecting cyber networks act both bills open up americans private information to inappropriate scrutiny by the federal government now i expect we will hear proponents of both bills argue at length that the protections against sharing personal information are sufficiently robust for instance under both bills they will cite that cyber threat data is scrubbed twice for personal information once by private entities before they transmit it to the government and once by government entities before they store the information or share it with anybody else now that sounds good but unfortunately the devil is in the details and a close reading of the bill shows that there is an enormous loophole in the informationscrubbing component and that it fails to offer americans safeguards for the personal information under both bills any federal entity in receipt of cyber data threat information may store and share personal information it receivesunscrubbed informationif they believe that it is related to a cybersecurity threat now this standard isnt too vague considering that information related to a cybersecurity threat could be interpreted to mean just about anything but it is also incredibly broad it includes an implicit assumption that americans personal information should be shared unless federal officials have information that it is not related to a cybersecurity threat in many cases the burden is to show that the personal information is not related to a cybersecurity threat for it to be scrubbed rather than the other way around so yes companies and federal entities are required to scrub the data for information that can be used to identify a specific person but the loophole then calls on them not to remove any personally identifiable information unless they can show that it is not related to cybersecurity even if there is an off chance that something at some point might be pertinent to some kind of investigation it puts americans personal informationwithout warrants without due process including information about patterns of internet use location content of online communicationsat great risk we have seen before that the federal government has a poor track record of safeguarding our personal information when they are entrusted with it the last thing we should be doing is empowering federal agencies even more with a broad discretion to look at personal information unless there is clear evidence that doing so would combat a cybersecurity threat i introduced along with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle a number of amendments to both billsone with the gentlewoman from california representative zoe lofgren and one with representative zoe lofgren and the gentleman from michigan representative justin amashto impose a higher standard on federal entities who are entrusted with this personal information our proposal would simply require the federal government to remove personally identifiable information unless it is directly necessary to identify or mitigate a cybersecurity threatthe purported purpose of this bill these amendments would have imposed no additional burdens on private companies but they would have given our nations technology companies and the customers who keep them globally competitive more confidence that private information shared under these bills would not be subjected to inappropriate mass scrutiny by the government sadly our amendments met the same fate as nearly two dozen others put forth to add in important privacy safeguards the potential for abuse of private information under h r 1560 is even more farreaching the homeland security bill at least makes clear that the information companies transmit to dhs should be shared specifically with other agencies that need it to protect critical infrastructure but the circumstances under which information can be shared under the intelligence billand who it can be shared withare fuzzier and broader under the approach taken by h r 1560 every cyber threat indicator shared with a civilian agency of the federal government is immediately shared with a host of other government agencies including the nsa this increases the threat to cybersecurity by having repositories of information replicated across numerous government agencies creating additional avenues for attack by malicious hackers that means that private sector companies will not be able to participate in the program and promise their users they will not share information with nsa or other government agencies unless required by law furthermore it is true that the homeland security bill includes some troubling provisions that allow the government to use cybersecurity threat information for criminal investigations unrelated to cybersecurity fortunately the rules committee made in order an amendment by representatives john katko zoe lofgren and anna eshoo that would address this problem in the homeland security bill i hope that my colleagues adopt this amendment unfortunately no such amendment is being considered to address this issue within the intelligence bill h r 1560 where the problem actually runs much deeper h r 1560 permits cyber threat data including americans private information that is shared with the federal government to be stored and used for a raft of unrelated purposes unconstrained by congressional directive including investigations and potential prosecution of crimes completely unrelated to cybersecurity obviously all of us want law enforcement agencies to be equipped to prevent and prosecute violent crime but the inclusion of these matters completely unrelated to cybersecurity broadens the scope of the measure far beyond what it is purported to be a cybersecurity bill in fact it reduces the focus of our efforts on combating cybersecurity when you open it up to everything under the sun by including a vast array of other reasons the government can invoke to store and share personal information the authors of the bill essentially transformed the informationsharing initiative into a broad new surveillance program yes rather than a cybersecurity measure effectively these bills are a stalking horse for broad new surveillance authority by multiple agencies of the federal government without warrants without oversight h r 1560 empowers federal entities to hold onto any information about an individual that may be related to any of the many law enforcement purposes lumped into the bill that gives the federal government enormous incentive to retain and scrutinize personal information even if it is unrelated to a cybersecurity threat the scope of the use authorizations also undermines due process protections that exist to protect americans against unwarranted search and seizure private information about a person that was transmitted warrantlessly to the nsa under a program that was purportedly designed to combat hackers should not be admissible or used in court against them on an unrelated offensenot related to cybersecurity not related to hacking it would render all of our due process protections invalid simply because of the medium of the information that is used with regard to these matters in this case internet and cyberrelated mediums and communications through them i joined representatives zoe lofgren darrell issa and blake farenthold on an amendment to make clear that information sharing may only be used for the purpose of mitigating cybersecurity threats again the purported purpose of this bill if the proponents of this bill are serious about combating cybersecurity why did the rules committee deny members the opportunity to limit the provisions of this bill to cybersecurity rather than a whole host of unrelated offenses i also joined the gentleman from kansas representative kevin yoder to sponsor an amendment to address a longstanding due process issue that has plagued our nations legal system and our privacy rights while the government is required to get a warrant if it wants to search through a persons physical mail it is not required to get a warrant to search through somebodys old emails provided the emails are older than 6 months that contradiction and loophole was based on a 1986 law that was written before most people knew what email was representative yoder and i sponsor a bipartisan bill that has 261 cosponsors and yet when we offered a provision on this bill we were not given a chance to vote on it and pass it in spite of the grave due process implications that the underlying legislation has in addition to these privacy and due process concerns i am alarmed by the prospect that h r 1560 will actually invite attempts by both private and public entities to deliberately weaken the integrity of software systems in the name of cybersecurity h r 1560 for instance authorizes companies to deploy countermeasures that are called defensive measures in the form of hack backs that would otherwise be illegal a countermeasure operated on one network should never cause harm to another that is prohibited by the federal antihacking statute the computer fraud and abuse act but that is precisely what can happen when a company places malware on its own network because if that data gets stolen along with other valuable data it can harm or lead to unauthorized or backdoor access of other proprietary networks or information the gentleman from virginia representative gerry connolly put forward two amendments to address this issue in a very thoughtful manner regrettably neither one will be allowed to be debated or receive a vote on the floor of the house unless we can defeat this rule furthermore both bills present the risk that federal entities will use the threat information they receive from private companies to circumvent the security protections safeguarding those same private companies information systems effectively creating their own back doors which could later be exploited by malicious hackers as a matter of routine our intelligence apparatus already demands that private companies include defects in their encryption system for the purported purpose of conducting backdoor surveillance todays legislation only makes it easier for the nsa to find and exploit more of these back doors and therefore easiernot harderfor hackers to find and exploit these very same security weaknesses once again representative lofgren put forward an amendment that would actually improve cybersecurity by making it clear that federal entities could not use data obtained through information sharing to demand that private entities create new encryption weaknesses to enable backdoor hacking sadly once again her amendment will not be heard on the floor of the house and this bill will encourage and allow additional venues for the illicit hacking it purports to combat i dont doubt the intentions and the goals of my colleagues on the intelligence and homeland security committees but these bills simply represent a step backwards rather than a step forward present risks on too many fronts from privacy to due process to the threats that they add to the integrity of the very networks that these bills are designed to safeguard in addition the bills focus on information sharing negates an important conversation about more important mechanisms congress should be looking at to protect cyber systems mechanisms that are not as fraught with risks to our civil liberties and are more effective at protecting our networks we should be doing more for instance to educate businesses and governments about basic network security even here in congress we have seen evidence of how woefully lacking even elementary knowledge about cyber threats is helping businesses prevent cyber attacks doesnt have to mean that the government vacuums up endless amounts of personal data about how individual americans are using the internet and their personal communications in fact if we stop allowing the nsa to demand that unitedstates businesses deliberately weaken their own networks for the purpose of government surveillance that in itself would be a big step forward to strengthening our national cybersecurity sadly todays rule doesnt even allow for a debate or for a vote on the most significant concerns surrounding this legislation and denies members the opportunity to consider changes that would address the issues that we have raised and improve cybersecurity under this bill for these reasons i hope my colleagues join me in opposing the rule and the underlying legislation i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.0006586909294128418, 0.9993413090705872, 1, "i thank the gentlewoman from colorado for her leadership and i thank the gentleman mr pitts because in actuality this is not a debate on peoples conscience and what you believe in it is a debate and a question of the law first of all the underlying legislation that we have before us is likely to be ruled unconstitutional and it is likely to be so because it meets the very four corners of why the supreme court ruled the texas law to be unconstitutional and i venture to say that this bill was a copy of the texas law in 2014 and 2015 the texas legislators tried to stop reproductive healthcare clinics by requiring them to have a hospitalstyle surgery center building and staffing requirements leaving only seven clinics to provide health care the same thing where they threatened the same kind of thing which would only leave 10 healthcare providers guess what in 2014 and 2015 the supreme court of the united states ruled it unconstitutional and stopped the legislature in their tracks that is what is going to happen to this legislation as well let me be very clear planned parenthood does not engage in selling body parts yes as under the law they do deal with fetal tissue research which has saved millions of lives under the 1993 nih revitalization act it is unlawful for any person to knowingly acquire receive or otherwise transfer any human fetal tissue for valuable consideration if the transfer affects interstate commerce they do not do this the reason i know that is there has been no department of justice investigation no health and human services investigation and in actuality mr daleiden who is not the fbi and not the department of justice has in fact engaged in a deleterious dastardly and deceitful investigation even stealingstealingthe id of one of his fellow high school students so i am against this bill and i am against it for the good things that planned parenthood does for example in my state there are 38 clinics 150 000 young women are being served 108 000 on contraceptives and others are sti let me finish by saying mammograms are not done in your doctors office you get a referral and you go to a place where you can get a mammogram with a radiologist if we would only discuss facts we would know that the underlying bill should be opposed i oppose it and i ask my colleagues to oppose it i rise in strong opposition to the rule and the underlying bill i strongly oppose this latest attempt by the republican house majority to undermine womens rights despite its title the womens public health and safety act h r 3495 is nothing more than the latest string of attacks on womens health instead of wasting time fueling politicallycharged attacks on health care services for women and attempting to roll back womens constitutionally protected rights this house should be advancing legislation that will reform our broken immigration and criminal justice systems and as we approach yet another deadline for piecemeal fiscal fixes we should be focused on passing a comprehensive and costsavings budget yet we are here today debating a bill that threatens millions of americans access to preventative care and could end up costing taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars if enacted however we know this bill will not become law given the presidents clear statement of administrative policy issued yesterday to veto this measure as such hr 3495 is simply being offered here today as a shameless political decoy to attack the legal rights of women if enacted h r 3495 would give states unchecked power to exclude womens health care providers from participating in medicaid hampering womens health and safety this bill would enable states that are hostile to womens right to abortion and to planned parenthood to freely target womens health care providers for exclusion from medicaid the united states supreme court ruled over 40 years ago in roe v wade 410 unitedstates 113 1973 that a womans constitutional right to privacy includes her right to abortion since this landmark decision abortion rates and risks have substantially declined as have the number of teen and unwanted pregnancies however politicians continue to try to sneak around the constitution and four decades of supreme court precedent with sham laws that do nothing to improve womens health care and only make it more difficult if not impossible to obtain safe and legal abortion restricting all access to reproductive and womens health services only exacerbates a womans risk of an unintended pregnancy and fails to accomplish any meaningful overthrow of roe v wade in recent years state policymakers have passed hundreds of restrictions on abortion care under the guise of protecting womens health and safety fights here in congress have been no different in my state of texas a law that would have cut off access to 75 percent of reproductive healthcare clinics in the state was challenged before the unitedstates supreme court in 2014 and on october 2 2014 the supreme court struck down as unconstitutional a texas law that required that all reproductive healthcare clinics that provided the full range of services would be required to have a hospitalstyle surgery center building and staffing requirements this requirement meant that only 7 clinics would be allowed to continue to provide a full spectrum of reproductive healthcare to women any woman facing an unintended pregnancy needs to be able to make her own decisions and weigh all her optionsand these laws take those options away texas has 268 580 square miles only second in size to the state of alaska the impact of the law in implementation would have ended access to reproductive services for millions of women in my state in 2015 the state of texas once again threatened womens access to reproductive health care when it attempted to shutter all but 10 healthcare providers in the state of texas the supreme court once again intervened on the behalf of texas women to block the move to close clinics in my state it seems every month we are faced with a new attack on womens access to reproductive health care often couched in deceptive terms and concern for womens health and safety and in fact we are here today supposedly to talk about the safety of womenbut we know thats not really the case if my colleagues were so concerned about womens health and safety they would be promoting any one of the number of evidencebased proactive policies that improve womens health and wellbeing instead they are proposing yet another attempt to ban abortion that is their number one priority this is certainly not about protecting womens health its about politics we must separate the personal views of abortion from the legal issues and fundamental constitutional rights undisputable every woman has the constitutional right to make personal health care decisions so basic that it must be equally protected for all yet this bill provides an outright pathway to discriminate against poor and minority women h r 3495 would give states broad discretion to exclude any person institution agency or entity that performs or participates in the performance of abortions from participating in medicaid according to policy experts and advocates such as the aclu and national partnership for women and families this extreme measure would mean that not only would all such womens health care providers be cut out of medicaid but states could also attempt to use it to eliminate a wide range of other health care providers with serious and devastating consequences for lowincome patients restricting access to womens reproductive health care providers makes it increasingly difficultand sometimes impossiblefor women who have decided to end a pregnancy to get the safe legal highquality care they need the result is not the elimination of abortions but higher costs longer delays and extra steps for women seeking abortion care and in the process punish women for their decision to exercise their constitutional right to end a pregnancy history tells us that unsafe and lateterm abortions did not cease to exist without adequate access to clinical service rather the exact oppositeas we know limited and restricted access only leads to unsafe and dangerous practices today countless women in states like texas and mississippi wisconsin alabama tennessee and louisianawhere state laws are already gravely impacting womens access to health care providerswomen are being forced to travel upwards of hundreds of miles or cross state lines to access their constitutional right to an abortion these restrictions create sharp disparities in access to care that are troublingly reminiscent of the time before roe v wade when access depended on a womans social status where she lived or her ability to travel to another state in an effort to undermine what they could not otherwise overturn politicians are attempting to turn back the clock to the preroe era by shuttering reproductive health care clinics and cutting off womens access to safe and legal abortion care yet far too many women who cannot afford to travel elsewhere will face an impossible choice between carrying an unintended pregnancy to term or seeking drastic options outside the law a right that only exists on paper is no right at all simply restricting a womens right and access to legal abortion services discriminately endangers the lives of women congress should be doing everything it can to ensure that women have access to preventive care not eliminating it this is a legislative assault on all progressive health care service and advocacy organizations who aim to provide vital care and services to women and men across this country hundreds of thousands have already spoken up including leading groups and communities such as the growing voice of our millennial generation for instance the nearly 60 000 obgyn physicians and partners in womens health warn that this bill would scare providers away from providing comprehensive compassionate care to women in a time where america desperately needs more obgyns participating in medicaid programs physicians and experts in the field have long argued that these damaging measures serve no medical purpose interfere in the doctor patient relationship and do nothing to promote womens health my colleagues should not be closing the door to health care services rather my colleagues should be doing more to connect our youth and women to services that help them reduce their risk of unintended pregnancies and stds and improve their overall health through preventative screenings education and planning and not restricting their

boost to the local economy by creating hundreds of jobs for the residents of my community the employees will be able to give back to the economywhich is so greatby spending money in the city of miramar now we have an opportunity to create an even stronger personal connection with the local community we are naming the building in honor of special agents benjamin p grogan and jerry l dove members of the federal bureau of investigation who died valiantly on friday april 11 1986 in what is still considered the bloodiest gun battle in the storied history of the fbi most men and women in law enforcement leave their homes for work knowing that there is a possibility that they may not return but i dont know if that was on the minds of agents grogan and dove as they left their homes on april 11 1986 i do know that it was an unusually cool and breezy spring morning in south florida i do know that miami in the 1980s was plagued by crime and graphic violence this period has been chronicled in media reports and dramatically portrayed on the tv show miami vice and in movies like scarface i know that agents grogan and dove knew about this violence when they said goodbye to their families picked up their badges and guns and left home on the morning of april 11 1986 yet they still answered the charge to protect their community in the face of this danger i know that agent grogan was a company man i know that he had 25 years of dedicated service to the bureau and was 1 year from retirement his wife was also an employee of the bureau i know that agent dove had only 4 years of service in the bureau after completing law school but he was living his boyhood dream according to his family i have their photos displayed here so that you can see the men we are proposing to honor i wanted to have their pictures so that you can see the bravery in their eyes i know that their bravery was the motivation for their joining a team of fellow agents on the morning of april 11 1986 to tail a vehicle with two suspects on board whom they thought were connected to a string of violent bank robberies the agents attempted to hail the driver of the vehicle to pull over and when that failed the agents strategically cornered the vehicle which came to a crashing halt by hitting a tree a gun battle immediately ensued there was a barrage of bullets i can only imagine how the crackle from the guns cut through the normally peaceful morning of that south dade neighborhood yet our brave men of the federal bureau of investigation returned fire their fire hit the suspects several times but unfortunately those weapons were not powerful enough to stop them on the other hand the weapons that were used by the suspects were so powerful that the agents were injured by misses that tore pieces of metal from their vehicles however those agents continued to battle on those agents knew that this could be that day which they prayed to avoid as they said goodbye to their loved ones and left their home but they still battled on i can only imagine the frustration of special agents richard manauzzi gordon mcneill edmundo mireles gilbert orrantia john hanlon ronald risner and grogan and dove as they shot dozens of bullets into the suspects direction and the highpowered rifle continued to return fire but they still battled on in a desperate attempt to flee the suspects tried to commandeer grogan and doves vehicle when they came around to the side of the vehicle grogan and dove were on the ground in a defensive position they had taken to battle the suspects it is reported that the suspects shot both agents with a highpowered rifle at close range shortly after the suspects were themselves fatally shot by agent edmundo mireles agent mireles made a very impressive statement about his role in that tragic event he said i knew that i was going to die but i was going to do my best to make sure that the suspects didnt get away when the dust cleared two agents lay dead on that spring morning and five were seriously injured i know one other thing that if for no other reason we are here in congress to honor commend and decorate those americans who live up to the ideals upon which this great country was founded i implore you and my colleagues in congress to join me the transportation committee and my florida colleagues and lift up special agent benjamin grogan and special agent dove from that street in south miami and place their names high where the world can know that we are proud of their sacrifice for their nation it is only fitting that these names should be placed on the same mantle with the letters fbi because special agents grogan and dove embody the motto for which the agency has become known fidelity bravery and integrity god bless the fbi

americans who ultimately will retire i am tired of blocking good measures that protect them such as the labor departments efforts to strengthen protections for working families and retirees by requiring their financial professionals who provide retirement investment advice be treated as fiduciaries under erisa laws it is important to note that this is a simple requirement it does not undermine the responsibilities or the profits of brokerdealers and others it just simply says that they must be held to a standard to protect those retirees who have worked so very hard i oppose the underlying bill h r i am also glad to stand on the floor and support however h r 597 the exportimport bank reform reauthorization act finally to open the bank and create jobs and opportunities for so many again let me say that i am standing with those workers who are not here retirees who have worked hardworking americans who will have their investments protected by making sure that those who give them advice are regulated and held to very high standards i rise in opposition to h r 1090 the retail investor protection act i oppose this bill because it would undermine efforts to curb conflicts of interest in the marketing and development of retirement investments particularly for retail investors i support the efforts of individuals and businesses to succeed in the american economy unfortunately for too long the success of some is coming at the total disregard for the rights of workers and their families investments in a home savings placed in retirement accounts or into 401ks are ways for working people to ensure that they will not live in poverty when they retire this bill would prevent the department of labor from addressing disparities in how the rights of investors are protected brokerdealers trade securities for themselves or on behalf of their customers and they typically charge a commission fee for each transaction and may also be compensated with a commission from the company whose securities they trade in making recommendations to clients and conducting transactions they must adhere to suitability standards that ensure that their recommendations are suitable to the clients financial situation and objectives investment advisers meanwhile who manage the employee retirement and benefit plans for private companies must under the employee retirement income security act erisa pl 93406 adhere to higher fiduciary standards and take actions that are in the best interests of the participants among other things such investment advisers must act solely for the interests of participants and beneficiaries and for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits and paying plan expenses they also must act prudently and avoid conflicts of interest investment advisers are paid through an annual flat fee for managing the investments which is based on the size of the plan brokerdealers are regulated by the securities and exchange commission sec and the financial industry regulatory authority finra under the suitability standard while investment advisers are regulated more directly by the sec under the higher fiduciary standard while employee retirement benefit plans are managed by investment advisers individuals also invest on their own for retirement and other purposes and often use either investment advisers or brokerdealers to help them decide on investments and to perform the trades in stock or investment instruments the 2010 doddfrank act required the sec in section 913 of the act to report on the standards of care applicable to brokerdealers and investment advisers and it authorized the sec to issue rules to extend the fiduciary standard now applicable to investment advisers to brokerdealers when providing any advice about securities to retail customers according to the financial services committee in 2011 the sec released a staff study recommending that both brokerdealers and investment advisers be held to a fiduciary standard no less stringent than currently applied to investment advisers this past april the labor department acting under erisa proposed new rules regarding who is covered by erisas fiduciary standard and how that standard would be applied saying that more needed to be done to protect individuals who are trying to invest and save for retirement the proposed rule would treat all financial advisers who provide retirement investment recommendations and make trades on behalf of clientsincluding brokerdealers dealing with individual iras 401 k plan and other retirement investmentsas fiduciaries under erisa under the proposal financial advisers would be required to provide investment advice that is in the best interest of the retirement investor without regard to the financial or other interests of the financial institution adviser or other party the sec rule allows retirement advisers to be paid in various ways as long as they are willing to put the interests of their customers first in certain cases allowing advisers to receive common types of fees that fiduciaries otherwise cant receive under the law such as commissions and revenue sharing the labor department is currently reviewing public comments received on its proposed rule and has not indicated when the final rule will be issued supporters of the bill argue that it is needed to prevent a potentially harmful rule from going into effect the proposed labor department rule would be very costly to brokerdealers requiring them to meet two separate standards when advising clients the fiduciary standard when advising on retirement issues and the suitability standard for other investment matters the resulting high compliance and potential liability costs they say could drive many smaller brokerdealers out of the market for providing retirement advice or lead them to service only larger dollar accounts thereby limiting access to professional retirement planning and guidance for those retail investors who need it most and likely resulting in a reduction in the overall level of retirement savings for american workers they note that the united kingdom in 2013 implemented a similar rule which has created an advice gap for 60 000 investors with smaller accounts the doddfrank law they say gave the sec the lead role in setting the fiduciary standards and they argue that the sec not the labor department is the better choice for developing those rules because it is much more familiar with investment markets in fact they contend that the proposed labor rule is confusing and actually conflicts with existing rules and securities market trading practices and that it could disrupt the carefully considered regulatory regime applicable to brokerdealers and investment advisers that is administered by the sec and finra brokerdealers and others operating under the lower suitability standard often have a direct conflict of interest directing their customers to highercost investments that have hidden fees or from which the advisers get backdoor payments we say this behavior in the predatory lending activity that led to the economic collapse in 2008 home purchasers who could qualify for lower fixed rates for new home purchases were only shown loans that had high interest triggers that would double or triple mortgages a few years after they were purchased the conflicts of interests in investment programs the white house council of economic advisers estimates result in annual losses for affected unitedstates investors of about 1 percentage point or about 17 billion per year in total the labor departments proposed fiduciary rule would require all retirement investors to instead put their clients best interests before their own profits blocking the labor department from issuing its rule until the sec acts on a standardofconduct rule for brokerdealers could effectively kill the critical consumer protections that would be provided by the labor rule since the bill does not require the sec to ever issue its rule while the sec should similarly update its rules governing investment advice related to securities they argue that congress should not hinge the labor departments efforts on the secs ability to do so labors rule was thoughtfully developed and would not cause disruptions in the market they say noting that the department worked with the sec in developing the rule and that it has taken into account the concerns of stakeholders this bill prohibits the labor department from implementing a final rule on fiduciary standards for retirement investment advisers until after the securities and exchange commission sec conducts a study and issues a final rule setting standards of conduct for brokerdealers specifically the labor department could not exercise its authority under erisa to define the circumstances under which an individual is considered a fiduciary until 60 days after the sec issues a final rule regarding standards of conduct for brokerdealers pursuant to section 913 of the doddfrank act the bill would not however require the sec to issue a rule prior to issuing a rule the sec must complete a study and report to congress on whether retail investors are being harmed by the lower standard of care under which brokers and dealers operate and offer alternate remedies to reduce confusion or harm to retail investors due to that different standard it also must investigate whether the adoption of a uniform fiduciary standard would adversely affect the commissions of brokers and dealers the availability of proprietary products and the ability of brokers and dealers to engage with customers as well as whether a uniform fiduciary standard would adversely affect access by retail investors to investment advice the conclusions in the report must be supported by economic analysis in developing a rule the sec would be required to consider differences in the registration supervision and examination requirements applicable to brokers dealers and investment advisers and publish formal findings that the rule would reduce confusion or harm to retail customers caused by the different standards of conduct i urge my colleagues to join me in opposition to this bill and protect the little that workers have from their shrinking wages to protect against falling into poverty once their work years

people feel that more guns and fewer protections is the solution obscuring the fact that the overwhelming majority of the american public agrees that there are things we can do and that it is irresponsible and cynical not to try for more than 24 hours last week my democratic colleagues and i discussed many of these solutions on the floor of the house demanding action on three for instance over 90 percent of the american public and a majority of gun owners agreed that there should be no anonymous secret purchases of weapons there should be a universal background check people who cannot buy firearms at a gun store should not be able to buy guns over the internet or at gun shows anonymously the american public supports us in our efforts to make it harder for people the government has deemed too dangerous to buy a plane ticket to purchase assault weapons and it is past time to eliminate the outrageous prohibition against the centers for disease control to even study the epidemic of gun violence that kills three or four americans every hour these solutions are not really that hard they would be a signal that we are serious about trying to change the gun violence equation that kills about 90 people every day i returned to oregon last week and had encouraging meetings with dozens of people who have been leading the charge in my home state who are redoubling their efforts they have demonstrated that steps can be taken through the political process and are committed to building upon their commonsense actions for example they led the charge to prevent people with a history of domestic violence and restraining orders from purchasing guns the oregon legislature finally enacted universal background checks like we are seeking at the federal level and the oregon house of representatives even passed legislation last session that would have closed the socalled charleston loophole where law enforcement has a 10day delay for a purchase if the police are unable to determine that purchasers qualifications i was impressed and encouraged that these ordinary citizens so devoted to this cause are committing to taking on the issue further at the state and local level

congress can be so challenging h r 3791 would direct the federal reserve to raise the asset threshold under the small bank holding company policy statement allowing small banks and private equity firms to take on additional debt for mergers and acquisitions the threshold would be increased to 5 billion in consolidated assets from 1 billion let me stress that this would be 5 times as much as the current threshold and 10 times as much as the initial level that was in place before a bipartisan compromise was enacted last congress the small bank holding company policy statement is important because it allows small institutions like community banks and minorityowned depositories to access additional debt so they can continue serving their communities however it is important that this threshold is carefully calibrated so it cannot be abused by speculative investors if the threshold is raised too high it will have the opposite of the intended impact it will lead to mergers and acquisitions riskier banking activities and a reduction in banking services and credit availability to rural lowincome minority and underserved communities indeed democrats and republicans on the financial services committee worked together just a little over a year ago to provide relief to almost 5 000 community banks by doubling the asset threshold under the policy statement to the current level of 1 billion from 500 million in assets we did so after working closely with regulators and determining that 1 billion was the most appropriate threshold to help community banks grow without making them targets for mergers and acquisitions at 1 billion the policy statement covers 89 percent of banks in the country providing relief to the vast majority of community banks and minorityowned depository institutions i am trying very hard to understand why my colleagues are reneging on that compromise and undermining the careful considerate policy that we enacted the administration has threatened to veto this measure because of the potential danger to our smaller banks and to the communities they serve they have called this bill an unnecessary and risky change because we know what will happen if the federal reserve has to make this change for one raising the threshold would have a serious impact on the consolidation of community banks the majority purports to be concerned with consolidation in the banking industry and the disappearance of community banks this bill will all but ensure that larger banks and investors come in and purchase smaller banks and then cut branches in the communities that need them the most we have already seen this happen with banks across the country both large and small that have been forced to shut down hundreds of branches because investors and shareholders demand higher and higher returns i supported the change we made last year to 1 billion because it would help ensure that small community banks are able to continue serving their communities that is the point of the small bank holding company policy statement we must help our communities retain access to local banks that know the specific needs of their consumers and small businesses this bill would do the opposite even those that did survive wouldnt be able to provide the same personalized service because of their size i am particularly concerned about how this would impact our underserved communities another problem with this legislation is that it would allow banks with as much as 5 billion in assets to operate under lower standards and less oversight by regulators many community banks failed during the 2008 financial crisis because they became overleveraged certainly if a bank makes bad decisions in the amount of risk they take on then it is appropriate to let it fail but the failure of any bank and especially a bank with up to 5 billion in assets has a tremendous impact on the community it serves and on the deposit insurance fund at the end of the day more bank failures will increase premiums for all the banks protected by the deposit insurance fund we cannot allow reckless behavior that benefits investors and bank shareholders at the expense of small banks and the communities they serve h r 3791 is not a small change it is a risky move that threatens both bipartisanship and these already polarizing times as well as the safety and soundness of our community banks and the customers they serve i urge my colleagues to join me in voting no on this bill mr speaker and members allow me to reiterate the point we worked very hard in reaching across the aisle in making compromise in making commitments to each other and in agreeing that we would raise the asset limit from 500 million to 1 billion we had that agreement and before the ink was dry on the deal here we have a bill that says so we really didnt mean it we want to raise it to 5 billion ha ha ha people wonder why we dont compromise more why we cant get together more why we cant understand what is in the best interests of all of our constituents to put aside our differences and work on behalf of those people we say we care about the other side claims it cares about community banks then why would it renege on this agreement if it cares about community banks why would it put them in the position of being bought up by private equity firms and special money interests which only want to find a way to make more money and more profit by closing down branches and firing people that is what they do when these private equity firms come in they borrow a lot of money in order to make these kinds of purchases then guess what they have to take the money back so guess who are the victims of this kind of agreement they are the small banks and the constituents while my chairmana gentleman whom i like very much and get along with very wellopens with statements that have nothing to do with this bill and while he talks about the plight of those in our communities who are suffering let me tell you why they are suffering not only in his community but in communities across this country it is because in 2008 we had a subprime meltdown and a crisis that was created by these kinds of reckless public policy attempts we discovered that because of all of the exotic products and all of the recklessness of some of the big banks and others we put our people at risk and we put our constituents at risk guess what they lost their homes many of them are homeless and are on the streets now many of them cannot afford the rents that have risen because of the

long overdue and i am happy to be here today with my energy and commerce colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this landmark reform legislation what brought us together is the failure of the current statute to keep the american public safe and to provide confidence in the safety of american products toxic chemicals can be found in the products we use every day and are steadily building up in our bodies and the environment consumers are worried about chemicals like bpa and triclosan but they dont know how to avoid them it seems like every day there is a new study about how chemicals are negatively affecting our health and something needs to change the energy and commerce committee has held many hearings over the last 6 years to understand why tsca isnt working some critical flaws were built into the statute like the grandfathering of over 60 000 chemicals in 1976 without any safety review other flaws came to light only through litigation like the impossible analytical burden of the statutes least burdensome clause even though we have recognized these flaws forward progress has been elusive when chairman shimkus and chairman upton approached ranking member tonko and myself about working on a streamlined approach to address the essential components of reform i was hopeful the result is a bipartisan bill that will remove major obstacles to epa action and give the agency new authority and new resources it will offer more protection and more implementation than current law it is a strong compromise and i urge all of my colleagues to support it h r 2576 will empower epa to regulate the universe of chemicals that were grandfathered in 1976 by removing the requirement that epa impose the least burdensome regulatory option and by establishing a riskbased standard for risk management instead of a costbenefit standard for the first time the decision of whether a chemical needs to be regulated will be based purely on the risk it poses h r 2576 will improve epas access to information about potentially dangerous chemicals by allowing epa to require testing through orders and consent agreements not just rulemakings and by authorizing epa to seek data when needed for a risk evaluation without first demonstrating risk h r 2576 will provide expedited action for the worst chemicals those that are persistent bioaccumulative and toxic under this bill we can expect quick action to get these chemicals out of our environment and out of our bodies h r 2576 will explicitly and directly protect vulnerable populations like children workers the elderly and hotspot communities the bill will provide more resources for epa to carry out this important program by removing outdated caps on user fees it would also ensure that those fees are deposited in a dedicated trust fund for tsca implementation under the bill all future confidential business information claims by industry would have to be substantiated preventing abuse and ensuring greater transparency h r 2576 would ensure that states maintain their important role as partners in chemical regulation under the bill preemption of state laws would be more limited than current law and other proposals no state law would be preempted until federal requirements are in effect many state laws would be protected from preemption including existing state laws new state laws adopted to address air and water quality or implement other federal laws state tort claims and state laws regulating uses not evaluated by epa in response to concerns raised by stakeholders and members a few additional important clarifications have been made following committee markup and i thank the chairman for working with us to make those changes there is now clear authority for epa to set a schedule if manufacturerrequested risk evaluations exceed epas capacity ensuring that such requests wont overwhelm the program the grandfathering provision for existing state laws has also been clarified based on feedback from state attorneys general strong committee report language further clarifies the limited role of costs in risks management the preservation of state monitoring and reporting requirements and the expansion of epas testing authority i know that tomorrow we will get back to disagreeing on the importance of environmental protection and the essential role epa plays

gas taxes to fund highways to fund infrastructure what does this do this isnt a gas tax increase so you are moving away from the user fee principle yourself in your own rhetoric lets speak to the substance of this particular proposal this proposal will do a couple of things number one it will encourage foreign companies to buy unitedstates companies you might as well say this is the buy american company act of 2015 number two it will encourage unitedstates corporate headquarters to move overseas dont take my word for it that is the characterization of this bill by the senate democratic policy chair the senior senator from new york who has said this policy will encourage unitedstates headquarters to be moved overseas inversions are bad we want to stop inversions but to quote the treasury secretary of the other sides party the way to stop inversions is tax reform why are we here doing this patch so that we can give ourselves the time to do tax reform to do international tax reform so that we can prevent inversions that is the whole purpose of this episode that we are having here so not only is this really bad policy it doesnt work it wont affect what they are trying to do if you want to stop inversions you have got to do tax reforms adding more obstacles to unitedstates companies doesnt stop unitedstates companies from moving it simply says that they are more ripe for takeovers by foreign companies there is a very dangerous trend of foreign companies buying unitedstates companies it is happening at an alarming pace if this were to pass it would accelerate that pace and the way that this is written it would say if you have your headquarters in america as an american company you had better move them overseas why would we want to do that the real solution is tax reform make america more competitive and make america the place you want to have your corporate headquarters lets have american companies buy foreign companies instead of the

cherished natural spaces and historic landmarks this groundbreaking program created and reauthorized on a strong bipartisan basis has protected and expanded iconic landscapes in every state and is responsible for more than 40 000 state and local outdoor recreation projects from playgrounds and baseball fields to urban parks and nature refuges by reinvesting revenues from offshore oil and gas development in communities across america the land and water conservation fund has become americas best parks program in my home state of arizona the fund has provided approximately 223 million in funding to help preserve iconic places like the grand canyon buenos aires national wildlife refuge and the san pedro riparian national conservation area recently i had the pleasure of joining national park staff and students from cholla high school desert view high school and pueblo high school for a day of appreciation at saguaro national park west for many of the students that joined us on this visit this was their first visit to saguaro despite it being a 15minute drive from tucson saguaro officials have leveraged the land and water conservation fund funding to benefit arizonans the desert tortoise gila monsters and other desert wildlife that call saguaro home without it our students would have had a smaller national park to experience less to learn and less to enjoy the land and water

fund unfortunately the funds authorizing legislation expires on september 30 2015 six legislative days remain before the clock runs out the stakes are high if the land and water conservation fund is not renewed special wild areas will be at greater risk of overdevelopment and our nations ability to conserve lands for future generations will be severely undercut congress should build on the land and water conservation funds legacy we should stop playing political games and do what the public clearly wants us to do we should permanently reauthorize and fully fund the program it is that simple the house republican leadership has not acted to extend the land and water conservation fund they seem perfectly content to let it expire rather than meeting with their fellow legislators and reaching a compromise as senate republicans have done the house republican leadership once again has shown an inability to do what is best for sportsmen the outdoor industry recreation enthusiasts and wildlife

protects public land for future use there is no more an american goal than that but it is held up by a leadership team that would rather do nothing past congresses have reauthorized the land and water

legislation which is what the colleagues of this chamber are asking for it is time for action we are calling in a bipartisan way on our colleagues to permanently reauthorize the land and water

bipartisan manner on a bill that has compromises within it that were reached at the senate level as well it appears to me that not to do this fund is to set up this fund for failure to set up this
