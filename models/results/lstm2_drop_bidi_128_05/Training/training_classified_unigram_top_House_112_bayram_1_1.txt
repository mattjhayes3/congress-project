definitely wrong with the process while the opponents of this legislation are saying that this bill guts the clean air act thats just not true because all this bill does is match epas outer continental shelf permitting process with the air permitting process employed by the department of the interior in the gulf of mexico a clean air act air permitting process that has been successfully used for decades by doing so we can rest assured that we have a strong offshore air permitting process but that these projects are not left in limbo like we have seen with the environmental appeals board in recent years i also want to remind my colleagues that this bill just addresses permits for exploration wells where activity typically only lasts for a few days not production wells where activities last for months i have long been a supporter of safe and responsible drilling on the outer continental shelf as these resources are a vital source of energy for the united states with

bearing an overwhelming and unfair burden of sacrifice while so many of us go on with our daily lives an alarming number of troops are coming back home with posttraumatic stress disorder suicide cases are rampant and sadly each day we continue to hear more and more about our veterans and the terrible toll this has taken on their lives the costs of this war are unacceptable particularly when we ask what the added benefit is of keeping our troops in afghanistan through 2014 the war in afghanistan has already taken the lives of over 2 000 soldiers injured tens of thousands more and drained our treasury of over 500 billion and those costs will only go up as we spend trillions of dollars on longterm care for our veterans which of course we must and we should do instead of spending over 85 billion in afghanistan this next year we should restrict funding to the safe and responsible withdrawal of all of our troops and use the tens of billions of dollars in savings right here at home

place of the district of columbia in our structure it is an anomalous place and when members come to the house of representatives they must find it very peculiar that anything having to do with a local jurisdiction comes here at all the most important thing to remember as i speak this afternoon is that that anomaly got to be too much for the congress and 39 years ago the congress sent back to the district the power to legislate for the district of columbia so if you hear members say congress can legislate for the district of columbia you must point them to the home rule act of 1973 it is true that on some matters the district cannot legislate for itself those matters involve things like imposing a commuter tax or changing the limits on how high buildings can be in the district because we dont want to obscure the great monuments but i assure you that the enumerated congressional powers over the district are quite small and that none of what i have to say this afternoon is among those areas where congress has said only congress itself should be able to legislate yet my good friends on the other side insist upon imposing their own views on the district of columbia quite undemocratically against our will even if you assumed that congress could enact laws for the district of columbia no one would assume that congress couldwithout any democratic accountabilityenact laws that went counter to the laws the district had enacted where are the smallgovernment tea party members the ones who are trying to teach the house of representatives a lesson about pulling back even from federal matters you cross the line very seriously when you involve yourself in local matters where you yourself cannot be held accountable do you believe in democracy or not it seems to me that the entire notion of passing a law and imposing it on people who have no say about it is a kind of authoritarianism that we ourselves criticize on this floor every single day in one fashion or another twice this week republican members disregarded their own basic principles and sought to interfere with the local government of the district of columbia and its citizens against their will in the most undemocratic fashion there was no respect for democracy no respect for federalism no respect for their own principles they moved forward to say that this was the way we would like it no matter what you would like as you might expect we took exception i am very pleased with the outpouring of support we have received from all over the country regarding the way the district was treated in the attempt by representative trent franks to impose his views on reproductive choice for the women and physicians of the district of columbia and i appreciate the support i have received when many were shocked that i was not granted the courtesy of testifying at his hearing on his bill which affects only my district let me say a word about that bill representative trent franks is from arizona the sponsor of this same bill in the senatea bill to impose a 20week limit on abortions for women in the district of columbiais from at least as far away senator mike lee of utah senator lee had hardly hit the groundi think had filed all of nine bills when he filed a bill that would impose a 20week limit on abortions in the district of columbia not on utah but on the district of columbia representative franks bill wouldnt impose this on arizona its only on the district of columbia there is nobody in this house that would not have taken umbrage at such undemocratic audacity and so we did as for senator mike lee he realized what he was doing wasnt exactly kosher because he introduced the bill and though he is a new memberand every new member puts out a press release about what hes donehe didnt put out a release on this bill so we outed him we put out a release on his bill and then his newspapers began to talk and so then he put out a release i think what i am talking about will be understood when you see how this occurred one thing that most americans have learned to do is respect the differences on very controversial issues and one of the most controversial is abortion an issue that really turns off independents in this country but captures the verve of the right wing to this day even though the right of women to reproductive choice was declared decades ago in roe v wade and of course when they come at women democrats respond under roe v wade a woman is entitled to seek an abortion at 20 weeks of pregnancy in fact the supreme court was at pains to say that it would not put a time limit on the number of weeks that thats a matter of viability and a matter between the woman and her physician yet senator mike lee and representative trent franks sought to set the number of weeks on their ownin violation of course of the constitutional mandate in roe v wade what are we supposed to do sit down and take it i asked to testify at the hearing on rep trent franks bill representative trent franks as chairman of the subcommittee denied me the right to testify even though the bill related only to my district he said that it was because the rules say that democrats could have only one witness and that they had chosen a woman whom we had recommended professor christy zink who had an abortion in the district of columbia at 21 weeks on the recommendation of her physicians and her family when the fetus was discovered to be hopelessly deformed of course we would want the committee to hear from such a person and the rules may well be what representative franks says they are but he clearly has no sense of common courtesy or comity of congressional courtesy where as a matter of right any such rule would be waived particularly if the members own district were implicated its bad enough to introduce a bill that has to do with somebody elses district where nobodynot the physicians who are implicated not the women and families who are implicatedcan reach you because they cant vote for you hardly an act of courage if this is so importantand i have to believe it is to themwhy wouldnt senator lee and representative franks introduce a 20week bill for all the nation why does their courage stop at the district line this should be a matter of principle how could you possibly want to stop abortions after 20 weeks only in one district of course representative franks is in the habit of denying me the opportunity to testify when his subcommittee considers bills that affect only my district he considered a bill that passed here in the house but was stopped in the senate that would have permanently kept the district of columbia alone from spending its own local taxpayer funds on abortions for lowincome women what in the world does a member from arizona have to do with how we in the district of columbia spend money that he had nothing to do with raising having been denied the right to testify on that bill no wonder i was denied again yesterday except this time it went viral and all over the united states they are talking about how a member introduces a bill relating to another members district and she doesnt even get a waiver so that she can say something on behalf of her own constituents on the bill he has introduced which will only affect those constituents and not his own and im supposed to like it well i dont like it and im not going to sit still for it i went to the hearing yesterday and everyone was polite representative franks invited me to sit on the allmale member panel but without being able to speak to hear about how women in the district of columbia should have their right to reproductive choice cut off by him i didnt give him the opportunity for that optic to have me on the panel unable to say anything invite the member from the district to sit on the panel to integrate it so that there is at least one woman and tell her to keep her mouth shut while they talk about her district hear from one of her constituents and talk about denying the women and families in her district what women and families are entitled to everywhere in the united states no sir thank you what i want is the same rights everybody else has i grew up as a secondclass citizen in this town twice oversecond class because we didnt have a member of congress until the 1970s and second class because i was an african american and therefore as a child had to go to segregated schools and im not going to have my constituents now that i am a member of congress treated any differently from the way representative trent franks constituents are treated or senator mike lees constituents are treated we are free and equal americans we pay federal income taxes just like everybody else and yet we have no vote on the house floor the nerve of members introducing a bill that they expect to go to the house floor and i would not even be able to vote on the bill and yet it would apply only to my constituents where is the sense of decency there is none i dont know about a war on women but when you keep coming at the district of columbia women thats a war on them and if you want to declare war im here to do the best i can to fight back first it was our lowincome women by barring d c from spending its local funds on abortions they have succeeded in getting that rider reembedded in our local budget now they want to do that on a permanent basis and now they want to go to a 20week limit and no womanlowincome highincomeno woman in the district of columbia could get an abortion and our physicians who care for women from all over this region and all over the country who found what professor zinks physician found which is that she should not carry that fetus to full term would have to somehow ask her to find someone outside of the district of columbia to perform an abortion under such tragic circumstances a woman who had a child and wanted another child who would put somebody through that it is an insatiable hunger that the smallgovernment tea party republicans are showing for interfering with the democratic rights of the people i represent and im going to call them out youre not going to get away with doing it in private youre not going to get away with not having me testify were going to shout it to the hilltops that all you talk aboutsmall government and that the federal government should get out of everybodys livesand now youre hopping over those principles into the lives of 600 000 americans who you are not accountable to after the congress said in 1973 that governing for the district of columbia now 1973 belongs to the mayor and the council of the district of columbia only no were not going to stand for it youre going to hear from us the bill is patently unconstitutional these very courageous republicans gotten it passed in seven conservative states they want a federal imprimatur on this bill so they say lets get the district of columbia what kind of courage do they lack do you believe in it introduce it introduce it for the women of america what are you afraid of wheres your spine do you only have a spine when it comes to 600 000 people who have a representative who you continue to disempower by denying her a vote on the house floor including a vote on her own appropriation and a vote on the very bill that youve introduced to take away rights guaranteed under the constitution that her citizens are entitled to the bill is patently unconstitutional roe v wade indicates that women are entitled to abortion care until viability but do you know what else the bill is its a violation of our 14th amendment right because you are treating our women and our physicians differently than women and physicians are treated elsewhere in the united states dont come at us with unequal protection and expect the people i represent to say okay mr congressman just do whatever you like keep doing it and we will keep calling you out we will never let you get away with a costfree undemocratic intrusion into our lives last night here comes representative phil gingrey with a resolution nonbinding saying that active duty military personnel in the district of columbia on personal time should not have to abide by the gun laws of the district of columbia here we go again with our gun laws we have stricer gun laws than some so be it some states have strict gun laws too are we less american than others that enact their own laws at whose altar am i supposed to kneel who are my constituents supposed to bow down to nobody in this house or senate well i opposed that resolution because if representative gingrey of georgia thinks that active duty military personnel in their private capacities should not have to obey the gun laws in d c then he ought to wank it for every state in the union youre not going to put on us bills for the district of columbia that clearly have nationwide import in order to make your ideological points in a cheap and cynical way because thats what it is its on the cheap its a defiance of democracy and it expects us to just let it go on the contrary it gets our dander up to be treated as less than full american citizens it gets our dander up sure the resolution passed it was nonbinding but the fact is that if you want to do a nonbinding resolution that says that gun laws shouldnt be applicable to active duty personnel in their personal capacities there is no possible reason to limit that to one jurisdiction we will not have it we are not vehicles pawns or instruments to be used at will we are fullfledged american citizens who fought and died in every american war including the war that created the united states of america we are the only taxpaying citizens of the united states of america who have no voting representation in this house and none at all in the senate get off of your high undemocratic horses its bad enough that you allowed that kind of a situation to go on for 200 years but when you pile on and want to enact legislation that you dont have the nerve or the guts to enact for the entire country but do such bills only for the district of columbia expect the district of columbia to come back at you we may be only one jurisdiction but we will never allow ourselves and our citizenship to be degraded and we will not allow ourselves to be demeaned as the frankslee bill did and as the gingrey bill did go home and make your own constituents understand why you are legislating for somebody elses district and you tell me whether your tea party friends will say well done i doubt it this was a week when twice in the same week republicans tried to roll over the district of columbia once was too much twice i simply could not abide so i issue fair warning its only me here i cant hurt anybody i cant even vote against you but i can tell you this much im not going to allow the unequal treatment of the taxpaying citizens i represent to go unaddressed ever not for one single moment i yield back the balance of my time"]]}
