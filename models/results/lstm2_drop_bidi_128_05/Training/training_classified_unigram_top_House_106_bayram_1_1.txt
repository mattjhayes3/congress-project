gentlewoman from california the gentlewoman from california and the gentlewoman from maryland for their bipartisan amendment earlier today the gentlewoman from hawaii told me that of all of her many achievements in her long career she was most proud of having authored and enacted weea we must restore gender equity language that helps girls succeed in schools weaa is the only federal program dedicated to gender equity that has provided teaching materials projects programs to schools to eliminate gender bias if the weaa center is not funded all the classroom records program materials anthology of womens voices and years and years of research will be lost more than 55 organizations wrote me in support of this program and i would provide that list for the record there are those on the other side of the aisle that say this program is not needed whether it is the medical profession or engineering these fields continue to change and evolve just like these fields gender equity needs to be continually updated with new research and techniques the appropriators just funded weaa for 3 million for fiscal year 2000 even with the tight budget caps they recognized the importance of this program but today some want to throw away over 25 years of research assistance and expertise weaa helps our nations girls but some people think girls no longer need assistance in overcoming barriers yes women have made great strides however these strides have not happened by themselves it has been programs like weaa that provide the training and the materials and the support for girls in education in the last 6 months alone weaa has received over 700 requests for information on gender bias glass ceilings still exist in the classroom in universities and in the marketplace women still only make 72 cents to every dollar a man earns when girls are exposed to math and sciences they tend to choose nontraditional female careers careers such as bankers and engineers that have lifetime earnings of more than 150 percent above their peers who choose traditional careers such as nursing and sec retaries this glass ceiling still exists and we will not break out of it until we break out of this pink collar ghetto last year more than 65 percent of all jobs will require technology skills but girls make up only 17 percent of the students taking advanced placement computer science tests even in basic computer usage girls repeatedly rate their computer skills as far lower than boys yes our underserved populations girls and boys need to have equal opportunities for success yet girls in underserved populations have two barriers before them they not only lack access to math and technology but they still have the disadvantage of being a girl in a society that often treats them differently from boys more than 60 percent of new teachers when shown videotapes of their classroom instruction were unaware of the disparity between how they treated boy and girl students weaa provides teachers with training and materials to help them adapt their teaching techniques to provide more equity in the classroom this essential unique service provided by weaa helps our teachers administrators and other school staff work with the learning needs of both boys and girls studies have shown that girls and boys learn differently newer teaching techniques can help boys excel in greater numbers in the social sciences and with communication skillsan area typically favoring girls weeas training material help teachers address these issues issues special to boys in their classrooms too as we head into the next century we cannot turn our backs on women and girls as the educational needs of our society change and grow at math and technology continue to become prominent skills of our everyday lives gender equity in our education system is more essential than ever girls must catch up with boys when it comes to math and technology to the critics who say there is no longer a need to assist girls and young women in americas education systemi say this a quote from a former weea director if we as a nation had decided to stop funding research on heart disease after we made the first mechanical heart we would have wasted our initial investment like medicine equity is an evolving process and needs to be continually examined revised and supported there is still a lot of work to do and it changes over time but gender equity is a real issue that needs to be addressed anew ever year even though only 12 percent of the house of representatives are women i hope the

to the members of the staff who are so diligently working here with us and for us at this very late hour as well we are gathered tonight at a time of unprecedented peace and power for our country because of the enormous dedication and sacrifice of americans who have served in our armed forces throughout history around the world in the past and at present our country is stronger and more secure than it has ever been and that is a blessing for which we are truly thankful certainly that thanks is directed at those who wear the uniform of our country tonight around the world and those who have so nobly worn it in the past it is truly a gift and a legacy that we enjoy tonight our relative strength in the world does not mean that we live in a purely safe world a world without risk we must endeavor not to repeat the mistakes of history where very often at times when we felt most safe we were most vulnerable there are clearly three areas of major threats to our countrys security as we gather tonight the first is the threat of an emerging competing global superpower in the peoples republic of china the second is the continued virulent presence of regional negative hostile dictatorial forces such as saddam hussein in the persian gulf president milosevic in the former yugoslavia those two threats the threat of china and the threat of those regional dictators are very severe threats indeed i trust that in the coming weeks and months we will consider as a congress along with the executive branch and the military ways to confront those threats this evening i want to spend some time talking about a threat that is not so easily detected is not so obvious but a threat that i believe is truly lethal and deadly a threat that is unlike any threat that we have faced in the history of our republic and that is the silent but deadly threat of cyber terrorism the quiet but lethal assault on our countrys systems and people which i believe will be one of the major issues in the new century the new millennium in the defense of our country unlike the growth of a large superpower army unlike the proliferation of arms from a hostile nation state we cannot readily or easily see the development of the cyber threat i pray that we may never feel it and tonight i would like to talk about how we can prepare for it i would like to begin by talking about what has already happened to make it clear that our subject tonight is not an imaginary one it is all too real listen to george tenet the director of the central intelligence agency speaking a few months ago he said and i am quoting an adversary capable of implanting the right virus or accessing the right terminal can cause massive damage to the united states of america the right virus or the right terminal in 1998 two youngsters in california directed by a hacker in the middle east who was later described as the analyzer launched attacks which disrupted our troop movemefits in the persian gulf these two young hackers based in california and directed by the analyzer in the middle east disrupted troop deployments to the persian gulf in february of 1998 from california launched attacks against the pentagon systems the national security agency and a nuclear weapons research lab the deployment disruptions that is the disruptions in the deployment of our troops around the world and the persian gulf from a computer terminal in california were described by deputy secretary of defense john hamre a real leader in this field as the most organized and systematic attack on unitedstates defense systems ever detected in fact they were so expertly conducted that president clinton was warned in the early phases that iraq was most probably the electronic attacker two teenagers steered and directed by a master hacker halfway around the world launching what our number one defender has called the most organized and systematic attack on sophisticated defense computer systems so sophisticated that in the early hours of the attack the president of the united states was told by his most wise and knowledgeable advisers that iraq was the electronic attacker it was not iraq it was two unitedstates citizens directed by a hacker in the middle east on march 10 1997 another teenager this one based in massachusetts invaded a computer system run by the bell atlantic company in massachusetts knocked out telephone communications among them telecommunications telephone service for the worcester massachusetts air traffic control system at that airport in western massachusetts the tower was knocked out for 6 hours let me read from a report from the boston globe of march 19 1998 the computer breach knocked out phone and radio transmission to the control tower at the worcester airport for 6 hours forcing controllers to rely on one cellular phone and battery powered radios to direct planes one teenager hacking into a computer system of a major regional telephone company knocking out for 6 hours the telecommunications capacity of an entire area and including an airport and as people flew through the skies above worcester massachusetts the air traffic controllers relied on one cell phone and battery powered radios to direct the planes joseph hogan who manages the control tower at worcester and 26 other airports for the federal aviation administration said this we relied on our backup systems and thank goodness they worked had we been busier the potential for a serious incident with dire consequences was there six hours in 1997 our intelligence community conducted what was called operation eligible receiver a war game playecdin cyberspace an intelligent and farreaching attempt by the unitedstates military and intelligence community to game out what would happen if a hostile foreign power tried to attack our systems around the country a socalled red team put together by the intelligence community pretended to be northkorea thirtyfive men and women specialists 35 people using hacking tools freely available on 1 900 web sites any of our listeners tonight could access on their home computer right now these 35 men and women accessing those 1 900 web sites in the public domain managed to shut down large segments of americas power grid and silence the command and control system of the pacific command in honolulu the defense information systems agency disa launched some 38 000 attacks against its own systems to test their vulnerabilities only 4 percent of the people in charge of those targeted systems realized they were under attack and of those only 1 in 150 reported the intrusion to the superior authority we had a war game and the good guys lost the smartest and most capable people that we have were rather easily outwitted by this war game a pentagon report goes on to say that probing attacks against the pentagon there are tens of thousands of them a year are routed and looped through half a dozen other countries to camouflage where the attack originated information warfare specialists at the pentagon estimate that a properly prepared and wellcoordinated attack by fewer than 30 30 computer virtuosos strategically located around the world with a budget of less than 10 million could bring the united states to its knees such a strategic attack mounted by a cyberterrorist group either substate or nonstate actors that is to say either terrorist groups that are not part of any state or terrorist groups that are sponsored by a rogue state would shut down everything from electric power grids to air traffic control centers a combination of cyberweapons poison gas and even nuclear devices could produce a global waterloo for the united states in 1999 the pentagon tracked

to the floor for the first time i just wanted to spend about 15 or 20 minutes talking about why the patients bill of rights the bipartisan norwooddingell bill is the right measure and why every effort that may be made by the republican leadership over the next few days to try to stop the norwooddingell bipartisan bill either by substituting some other kind of hmo socalled reform or by attaching other amendments or poison pills that are unrelated and sort of mess up if you will the clean hmo reform that is necessary why those things should not be passed and why we should simply pass the norwooddingell bill by the end of this week i do not want to take away from the fact that the republican leadership has finally allowed this legislation to come to the floor but i am very afraid that the committee on rules will report out a procedure that will make it very difficult for the bill to finally pass without having poison pill or other damaging amendments added that ultimately will make it difficult for the patients bill of rights to move to the senate to move toconference between the two houses and ultimately be signed by the president a word of warning to the republican leadership this is a bill the norwooddingell bill the patients bill of rights that almost every american supports overwhelmingly it is at the top of any priority list for what this congress and this house of representatives should be doing in this session i think it would be a tragedy if the republican leadership persists and continues to persist in its efforts to try to stall this bill damage this bill and make it so this bill does not ultimately become law i just want to say very briefly because i have mentioned it so many other times on the floor of the house of representatives the reason the patients bill of rights is a good bill and such an important bill basically can be summed up in two points and that is that the american people are sick and tired of the fact that when they have an hmo too many times decisions about what kind of medical care they will get is a decision that is made by the insurance company by the hmo and not the physician and not the patient that is point number one point number two is that if an hmo denies a particular operation a particular length of stay in the hospital or some other care that a patient or physician feels is necessary then that patient should be able to take an appeal to an independent outside review board that is not controlled by the hmo and ultimately to the courts if the patient does not have sufficient redress right now under the current federal law that is not possible because most of the hmos define what is medically necessary what kind of care an individual will receive themselves and if an individual wants to take an appeal they limit that appeal to an internal review that is basically controlled by the hmo itself so the individual cannot sue if an individual is denied the proper care they cannot take it to a higher court to a court of law because under the federal law erisa preempts the state law and makes it impossible to go to court if anindividuals employer is in a selfinsured plan which covers about 50 percent of americans who get their health insurance through their employer who is selfinsured and those people cannot sue in a court of law we want to change that the bipartisan norwooddingell bill would change that it would say that medical decisions what kind of care an individual gets has to be made by the physician and the patient not by the hmo the definition of what is medically necessary is essentially decided by the physicians the health care professionals and secondly if an individual is denied care that that individual and their physician thinks they need under the patients bill of rights the bipartisan bill what happens is that that patient has the right to an external review by an independent review board not controlled by the hmo and failing that they can go to court and can sue in a court of law now those are the basic reasons this is a good bill there are a lot of other reasons we provide for emergency services we provide access to specialty care we provide protection for women and children there are a lot of other specific provisions that i could talk about but i think there is an overwhelming consensus that this is a good bill this is a bill that almost every democrat will support and enough republicans on the other side of the aisle will join us against their own republican leadership in support of this bill but there have been a lot of falsehoods being spread by the insurance industry over the last few days and the last few weeks and will continue until wednesday and thursday when this bill comes to the floor and i wanted to address two of them because i think they are particularly damaging if people believe them and they are simply not true one is the suggestion that the patient protection legislation the norwooddingell bill would cause health care premiums to skyrocket that is simply not true if we look at last weeks washington post september 28 there was an article that surveyed hmo members in texas where there is a very good patient protection law that has been in place for the last 2 years that survey showed dramatically that in texas they could not find one example where the texas patient protection law forced texas hmos to raise their premiums or provide unneeded and expensive medical services the texas law which has been on the books for 2 years shows that costs do not go up because good patient protections are provided in addition we are told by the insurance companies that costs are going to go up because there will be a lot more suits and that will cost people more money and their premiums will have to go up well the 2year texas law that allows hmos to be sued for their negligent medical decisions has prompted almost no litigation only five lawsuits out of the four million texans in hmos in the last 2 years five lawsuits which is really negligible it is really interesting to see the arguments that the insurance companies use the other one they are using and they are trying to tell every member of congress not to vote for the patients bill of rights not to vote for the norwooddingell legislation is this myth that employers would be subject to lawsuits simply because they offer health benefits to their employees under erisa what they are saying is if we let the patient protection bill pass employers will be sued and they will drop health insurance for their employees because they do not want to be sued well that is simply not true senior attorneys in the employee benefits department in the health law department at some of the major law firms and i will cite a particular one here from gardener carton and douglas which basically did a legal analysis of the norwooddingell bill claim that this is simply not correct section 302 of the norwooddingell bill specifically precludes any cause of action against an employer or other plan sponsor unless the employer or plan sponsor exercises discretionary authority to make a decision on a claim for covered benefits that results in personal injury or wrongful death so the other hmo myth is that an employers decision to provide health insurance for employees would be considered an exercise of discretionary authority well again that is simply not true the norwooddingell bill explicitly excludes from being construed as the exercise of discretionary authority decisions to one include or exclude from the health plan any specific benefit two any decision to provide extracontractual benefits and three any decision not to consider the provisions of a benefit while internal or external review is being conducted what this means is that we precluded all these employer suits the employer basically cannot be sued under the norwooddingell bill and i would defy anyone to say that that is the case that an employer can be sued effectively i wanted to mention one last thing about the poison pills and then i would like to yield to the gentlewoman from texas because she is representing the state of texas and she knows firsthand how this law has worked so effectively in her home state of texas and this is a law i use over and over again as an example of why we need the federal laws so i would like to hear her speak on the subject let me just say though that the other thing that we are going to see over the next few days here in the house is an effort by the republican leadership to load down the patients bill of rights the norwooddingell bill with what i call poison pills i say they are poison because they do not really believe that these are good things but they think if they pass them and add them to the patients bill of rights that ultimately that will defeat the bill they cannot defeat the bill on its merits because they know that that will not work so they try to add some poison pills basically what they are trying to do and this is the same stuff we have had in previous years a few days ago the gop leadership announced its intention to consider a number of provisions it claims will expand access to health insurance along with managed care again this is a ruse there is no effort here to really expand access for the uninsured it is just that they have no other way to counter the growing momentum behind the norwooddingell bill but based on the statement released by the gentleman from illinois"], [0.005319535732269287, 0.9946804642677307, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may consume h r 1887 would make it a violation of federal law to knowingly create sell or possess with intent to sell a depiction of animal cruelty at the subcommittee markup we added a provision which exempted possession and distribution of such materials for scientific political historical educational artistic religious or journalistic purposes although this narrows the application of the bill considerably i am not convinced that the bill meets the provisions of the first amendment to the united states constitution which prohibits reinstructions on speech including speech that most find disgusting or unpopular in unitedstates v eichman a 1990 case the supreme court said and i quote if there is a bedrock principle underlying the first amendment it is that the government may not prohibit expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable it is without question that the conduct at issue today is offensive and disagreeable and it is also clear that we can constitutionally prohibit cruelty to animals however it is clear that we cannot prohibit the communications regarding such acts including the film communications done for purely commercial gains all states already have some form of animal protection laws which would likely prohibit the crushing of animals in a manner depicted in the socalled crush video films and prohibiting the crushing of animals in the manner suggested in the bill raises no constitutional issues but the communication through film is speech which is protected by the first amendment of the united states constitution films of animals being crushed are communications about the acts depicted not doing the acts in fact the content in these films is no different than the content of a closedcircuit film of actual robberies or other crimes which are used on the cops on the beat tv shows in order to compete for rates and advertising revenues that they bring in in those videos human beings are intentionally killed or pistol whipped by criminals and those videos would not be affected by this bill the supreme court has consistently refused to carve out new exceptions to the first amendment although one cannot endanger the public by yelling fire in a crowded theater and one cannot traffic in child pornography speech has been restricted in precious few examples obscene speech is one type of speech which has been restricted first to be obscene it has to appeal to prurient or sexually unhealthy and degrading interest second it has to violate contemporary community standards which are judged on a statebystate indeed communitybycommunity basis not a national basis and third when taken as a whole it must be entirely lacking in redeeming literary artistic political or scientific merit while h r 1887 would apply to some obscene material many videos covered by the bill are clearly not obscene we have other supreme court cases which indicate that speech can also be restricted when there is a compelling state interest to do so however such restrictions must meet the strict scrutiny test which requires that it is necessary to serve a compelling governmental interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that end although it is clear that the governmental interests in protecting human rights may be sufficiently compelling to justify restrictions on rights otherwise protected by the constitution the question posed by this bill is vhether protecting animals rights counterbalances citizens fundamental constitutional rights it would seem from the case in 1993 city of hialeah that the answer to that question is no in that case the city of hialeah enacted various ordinances to prevent cruelty to animals by prohibiting animal sacrifices which were part of the santerian religion one of the asserted bases for the ordinance was protection of animals although the district court found a compelling governmental interest in protecting animals the supreme court invalidated those ordinances as an infringement on the first amendments free exercise of religion clause although the supreme court recognized the governmental interest in protecting animals from cruelty that interest did not justify violating the rights of citizens to freely exercise their religion therefore on balance animal rights do not supersede fundamental human constitutional rights so while the government can and does protect animals from acts of cruelty making of the films of such acts are unlikely to constitute compelling state interest sufficient to justify rights which are otherwise protected by the constitution now one argument to justify this as a compelling state interest is the suggestion of the correlation between serial killers and the indication that they often begin by torturing animals yet the suggestion is that the serial killers actually torture the animals themselves not just watch videos and certainly there is no indication that a store clerk selling videos is a danger to society therefore it does not appear that there is a compelling state interest to violate the freedom of speech constitutional right but even if there were a compelling state interest it fails the strict scrutiny test because it is not narrowly tailored although the bill is tailored to avoid some of the more obvious first amendment issues it leaves so much of what it is purportedly aimed at is in fact uncovered that it falls into the problem encountered by the hialeah case there the ordinances prohibited the practices of the santerians in a way of protecting public health but it did not prohibit practices generally or pursue less offensive ways to accomplish the goals such as requiring the same sanitation activities throughout the city here the bill prohibits the commercial use of videos in a way to prohibit the cruelty to animals but does not prohibit personal creation or use of the videos the bill also exempts serious political scientific educational historical religious artistical or journalistic uses of such films as legitimate purposes for disseminating them it is also apparent the bill does not prohibit maiming mutilating wounding or killing animals in connection with food preparation or for clothing preparation such as bashing heads of baby seals and skinning them sometimes alive and those kinds of videos for hunting and fishing or for pest control on the other hand the bill makes illegal depictions of activities that are not illegal when or where made and if those activities are illegal in the state where the depictions are possessed for example bullfighting may be illegal in virginia so possessing for sale of a film in virginia depicting a bullfight in spain would violate the act thus as in the hialeah case the bill purports to prevent animal cruelty by stopping the creation and distribution of films but only when it is used for commercial purposes a more narrowly tailored way to get at such cruelty would be to prosecute those who are actually engaged in the activities considered cruel so although i commend the author of the bill the gentleman from california"], [0.0055013298988342285, 0.9944986701011658, 1, "i rise today to

political culture most importantly downtown d c is coming back and is increasingly alive with people taking advantage of new reasons to go to downtown despite these great strides however the districts recovery remains in its infancy district revenues are significantly dependent on tax receipts from downtown businesses moreover these revenues have been flat partly because of the effect of the gift ban small retail businesses have been particularly hurt however the most prominent example of the effect of the gift ban is the new mci center the centerpiece of the revitalization of downtown d c abe pollin the owner of the washington wizards capitals and mystics did the unheard of when he invested 220 million of his own money into the construction of an arena in downtown d c when the district was insolvent and at its lowest point in making this commitment to the city pollin relied in part on the gift rule in effect at the time that allowed tickets to be accepted as gifts the mci center is an unusual example of a sports arena that has been built with private rather than public funds it is unfair and unfortunate to have an abrupt change penalizing a private entrepreneur who has willingly taken on what in most jurisdictions is viewed as a public responsibility private economic development is the key to maintaining the solvency of the district harmonizing the house gift rule with the senate rule does not cost the congress anything but this change can mean millions to the city if the congress cant help us at the very least it should not hurt us there is more than one way for the

to address the problem for over 40 years when they controlled the house this is a critical concern for seniors throughout the country and it should not be reduced to merely a political issue or to one of spite i am reminded of a debate in the 104th congress when we worked successfully to save medicare from bankruptcy at that time the democratic leadership exploited the crisis facing medicare by engaging in demagoguery for political gain the washington post editorial board rightly labeled them medagogues now they are playing politics with seniors in desperate need of prescription drugs in the words of the great communicator ronald reagan there they go again many of the latest drug and biological therapies are targeted at preventing or curing diseases that affect senior citizens and persons with disabilities however the federal health insurance program serving these individuals medicare currently as we know lacks coverage for most prescription drugs and biologicals as a result onethird of medicare beneficiaries have no drug coverage at all the twothirds of beneficiaries who have coverage have to obtain it through a variety of sources often at considerable expense last year i

carriers stating that medicare part b would not reimburse for any drugs that were administered incident to a physicians service if the drugs were capable of being self injected this memorandum which reversed a previous policy of 30 years does not take into account the health status of each patient many beneficiaries including cancer and ms patients are not able to selfinject their necessary medications even if the drug is normally able to be selfadministered the provision included in h r 4680 guarantees the medicare beneficiaries who are receiving lifesaving injectable drugs and biologicals will continue to have access to those therapies under medicare part b it is also important that this reimbursement continue under medicare part b because the physicians service must also be reimbursed the bill before us will ensure that patients who cannot selfadminister injectable drugs will be able to have those drugs administered by their physician and receive coverage under the

clinton when he took over decided to cut that blueprint by 102 billion so now he is coming up slightly in this years budget with a 12 billion increase i say it is 12 billion even though they averaged a 112 billion increase because the last half or twothirds of that increase is not during his presidency that means that he is giving us a recommendation that defense be increased by some other president some other time that means some president who is elected who is out there in the year 2004 2005 is according to the recommendation of president clinton going to increase defense but i do not think the american people nor the men and women who wear the uniform of the united states can count on that increase all we can count on president clinton doing is what he is capable of doing and has the legitimate right to do under his presidency so let us focus on that if we look at ronald reagans defense budgets back in 1986 and compare them with todays our defense budget today is well over 100 billion less on an annual basis than it was in 1986 it is way under what it was in 1986 let us look at what has happened as a result of these defense cuts first mr speaker let me speak a little bit about what is happening with respect to mission capable rates the mission capable rates are the rates at which your aircraft can fly out fly from their carrier or from their home base do their mission and return to the united states or return to their home base that rate in 1991 was 83 percent for the air force it is now down to 74 percent it was 69 percent for the navy it is now down to 61 percent for the marine corps it was 77 percent and it is now down to 61 percent that means that under the clinton administration the ability of our aircraft for some reason whether it is lack of pilot training lack of pilots lack of spare parts lack of fuel our aircraft are not able to rise off their carrier deck or rise off of their air base go out and do their mission and return home like they were just a few years ago that is a very serious problem with our ability to project military power let me talk about our equipment shortages a little bit i am the chairman of the subcommittee on military procurement i looked at the presidents military budget for this year that budget calls for a sixship building program this year now navy ships have a life of 30 to 35 years so that means that the presidents budget is building toward a fleet of only 200 ships when he came in we had 546 naval vessels now we are down to about 325 if we keep building at this low rate we are going to be down to 200 ships in our navy with respect to ammunition we are 1 600 000 000 short in basic ammunition for the unitedstates army we are 193 million short in ammunition for the marine corps with respect to equipment our ch46s are 40 years old our aavs average about 26 years old we have many many pieces of equipment right down to jeeps and trucks and tanks that are extremely old basically we are living on what we had during ronald reagans presidency and we havent replaced that equipment now the interesting thing is that most americans have looked at the old pictures on television of our air strikes during desert storm and they have the impression that we are able to wage a war like we waged in desert storm just a few years ago but we are not able to do that the reason we are not able to do that is because we do not have the equipment and the force structure that we had just a couple of years ago we have cut our military almost in half that is we had 18 army divisions in 1992 we are now down to 10 we had 546 ships during desert storm we are now down to about 325 we have 346 on this poster they have actually retired more ships since we made the poster active airwings were down from 24 airwings to only 13 if we include reserve airwings we are down from 36 to only 20 what we have done under this administration is we have cut americas force structure of our armed forces almost in half the tragedy is that while we have cut it in half the half that we have left is not ready it is not ready to fight let me get to another very critical area we are 18 000 sailors short right now in the navy that means that the few sailors that we have left and this is manning a very very reduced fleet the few sailors that we have left now have to shift back and forth between ships it also means that when a sailor comes home to be with his family he may be called the next week and told instead of getting that 1 or 2 or 3month reprieve and being able to stay home with your wife and family you are going to have to head out again because we dont have enough people to man all of our ships you are going to have to go back out and join the fleet again and go back into these strenuous operations without seeing your family that is called personnel tempo that is the amount of timebasically it reflects the amount of time that a soldier or sailor or airman or marine spends away from his family that means that for example with the marine corps we are seeing a higher personnel tempo marines away from their families more than they have ever been since world war ii that is important to us as a unitedstates congress that is in charge of raising the army and the navy and the marines and maintaining it because we have an allvolunteer service if people will not join we cannot draft them so we have to have a service that is attractive enough to get people to join one aspect of that attractiveness has to be quality of life quality of life can mean a lot of things it can mean having a nice home for your family if you live on base if you are an enlisted person for example or an officer it can mean having a good barracks if you are a single enlisted person or a good bachelor officers quarters if you are an officer it can mean having enough of a housing allowance to live in a fairly nice place in the community that your base is located in it can mean having decent pay we will talk about that in a minute but it also means having some time with your family that means not being constantly deployed the interesting thing about the clinton administration is they have deployed their people more often than any other president while they have deployed these people more often than any other president they have out thenumber of people that we have that is the force structure the number of ships the number of sailors the number of army divisions the number of marines they have cut that force structure so much that we have this thin line of american defenders literally running around the world running themselves ragged what does that mean it means that people are not reenlisting i think in our marine aviators we have 92 percent of the pilots not reenlisting which is remarkable for us because they have always reenlisted in record numbers in much higher numbers up in the forties it means that we are the 18 000 sailors short that i spoke of it means that we are going to be 700 pilots short in the air force this year it is very very difficult to keep these people in the service and it is very difficult to build people in these technical skills if you do not have a lot of time and a lot of money it costs as much as 1 million 2 million to buildsomeof the technical skills to give these folks all the schools they need and once that person walks out the door he takes with him that enormous investment then our other problem is once a person walks out the door we now have the problem of going out and recruiting another person to take his or her place that person is looking at a domestic job market which is quite good right now looking for example if they are a pilot at the prospect of going into the airlines if they are a mechanic looking into going into an automotive industry if they are an electronics technician looking at going into one of those areas on the outside in the civilian sector it is more and more difficult to bring people into the military once again this congress does not want to have to be faced with the prospect of having to draft people that means we are going to have to treat our people better that means we are going to have to slow down optempo and personnel tempo not stretch our people so thin not run them so ragged pay them better money that means get them up in a much higher bracket so that they cut into what is now a 13 percent pay gap between people who are in the service and people who arein the private sector when ronald reagan came into office in 1981 we had a 12 6 percent pay gap and we closed that pay gap in a very short period of time well today we have a 13 percent pay gap the clinton administration is offering a 4 4 per cent pay raise but that is not nearly enough to pay for that major gap that has people leaving in droves and at the same time bring up the modernization the spare parts ammunition and all the other things that we need to make ourmilitary work let me go to one other aspect of national security that i think is very important the president now realizes that we have indeed a problem with missile defense we know and we knew ever since those scud missiles hit our barracks in saudiarabia that we had a problem with not being able to stop those missiles coming in those are very slow missiles those were the model ts of ballistic missiles today many years later we still have very little capability in terms of stopping missiles there are several classes of missiles we hear about the intercontinental ballistic missiles those are the missiles that can be launched from russia or china and presumably hit a city in the united states it is a longrange missile that goes very fast one also has shortrange missiles and those missiles go a little slower but what they can hit are our troop concentrations in korea or saudi arabia or other places we have to build and maintain a missile defense so far we do not have that defense this budget is not going to allow us to proceed fastenough to build that missile defense before our adversaries build the offensive missiles that canoverwhelm that defense when i talk about that what i am saying is we need to look at the north korean missile that was just launched over the sea of japan we realize now it is a twostage missile that it could hit some parts of the united states if it took in its full flight builtby north korea we know that china is moving ahead on its strategic weapons program we know that we have to place our troops in concentrations all over the world just like we had troops in saudi arabia we had troops in kuwait we have troops right now in south korea we have to be able to maintain those troops if missiles can be launched from long range to hit those troops with concentrations of chemical or biological weapons then it is going to be very very difficult to convince americas moms and dads that we should be allowed to keep their youngsters in the military move them into foreign theaters which are very very dangerous and expect them to stay in the uniform so it is going to be very very difficult to recruit people unless we have a way to protect them in foreign theaters that means we have to have missile defense this administration in slashing the defense budget dramatically has not put enough money into missile defense so this president hassaid that he is increasing defense dramatically let us put it in perspective most of the 112 billion that he has proposed to increase is supposed to be done by some other president at some other time it is like handing a blueprint of a house to our neighbor and saying after i am gone from this neighborhood i want you to build this house on that lot over there and our neighbor says do you have any legal right to make me build it and you say no but it is my recommendation that you build this house over here after i am gone the president is recommending to some president who has not even been named yet has not been elected yet that he build this defense rebuild national defense on his watch afterpresident clinton is gone so the president cannot increase defense 112 billionin 2005 because he will not be the president then and he has no control over the president at that time all he can do is offer a suggestion of course if the future president looks at what this president did rather than what he says with respect to defense he will not increase defense at all because this president has not increased defense at all what we have to do in the unitedstates congress democrats and republicans is listen to the joint chiefs of staff that is the services the army the air force the united states marines and the navy and give them the equipment that they say they need the army says they need 5 billion worth of equipment per year they need 5 billion worth of increased funding per year for equipment and for people the navy says they need an additional 6 billion a year the air force says they need 5 billion the marines say they need 1 75 billion and that excludes this pay raise that we all agree our service people need of 2 5 billion per year if we add those numbers together that is 20 billion this year that we need the president has only offered 12 billion we have to come up with the difference so then as republicans and democrats put this budget together it is incumbent upon us to listen to our armed services listen to the men and women who serve in the military and make sure that they are well equipped and that they have quality of life and that they have decent pay i ask unanimous consent to yield the

strongly held bob is a person for whom all members have great regard there is sometimes some concern if he happens to be on the other side of the issue because you know he is going to be very persuasive and i can speak from direct knowledge on that subject i can also say that as an ally one cannot have a better friend rather than to talk about a lot of things i would simply point to one important project that i worked on for 3 years in this congress with bob livingston as chairman of the committee on appropriations all too often the chairman of the committee on appropriations is viewed as the person who has to do the tough things cut the budget tell people no but there is another side to that responsibility which all too often is ignored there was a facility within the sixth district of louisiana that really was in deplorable condition it had ministered to people in a certain health condition for well over 100 years and was under significant budgetary pressure to close it was historically significant a facility that was built in the mid1800s and had served a great and long mission of caring for people who otherwise were viewed as social outcasts i went to bob with the problem and told him what we wanted to do with that facility which was to create a new education and job training program for atrisk youth young people who were out of high school had not gotten their ged who were not yet in trouble with the law but were likely to end up in a life of social dependency or worse yet in the criminal justice system it took 3 years but bob livingston would be pleased to know that this april the first class of young adults will enroll in the carville academy these are people who are going to be given a chance not just to get a ged not only to get job training but at that facility they will be guaranteed a job upon the completion of their successful course work that is not something many of bob livingstons constituents would have the opportunity to see but it is commitment to doing something right that makes a positive difference for people who otherwise may never even know bob livingstons name that is the kind of fellow he is he has commitment purpose and

this legislation will significantly improve the health and safety of health care workers by reducing accidental needlesticks and other sharps injuries it is estimated that there are between 600 000 and 800 000 incidences of accidental needlestick injuries among health care workers every year as a direct result more than 1 000 of these workers will contract a serious potentially lifethreatening disease such as hiv or hepatitis c studies have shown that as many as 80 percent of these accidental needlesticks can be avoided through the use of available safer medical devices the occupational safety and health administration osha has already taken action to reduce accidental needlestick injuries in november 1999 osha issued a revised compliance directive on enforcement procedures for occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens the principal purpose of the new directive is to emphasize the requirement that health care employers identify evaluate and make use of effective safer medical devices h r 5178 builds upon oshas efforts specifically h r 5178 amends oshas 1991 bloodborne pathogen standard to clarify and reiterate the requirement to use appropriate commercially available and effective safer medical devices designed to eliminate or minimize occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens h r 5178 provides definitions of engineering controls sharps with engineered sharps injury protections and needleless systems in order to provide greater clarity of the requirements of the standard the legislation ensures that employers regularly monitor and assess the development of appropriate commercially available and effective safer medical devices it ensures that health care workers who must use the equipment will have a voice in its selection and will be properly trained in its use finally the legislation promotes greater awareness and more active vigilance through the use of a sharps injury log the primary intent of h r 5178 is to protect the safety and health of health care workers one of the principal ways the legislation accomplishes this is by encouraging the development of safer medical devices under the bill it is the responsibility of health care employers in consultation with their workers and subject to oversight by osha to determine for themselves what are the safest devices on the market that meet their individual needs as newer safer devices come to the market employers are required to consider and implement appropriate and effective safer medical devices since the bill anticipates and encourages technological development the bill intentionally does not define any specific medical device as a safer medical device per se to do so would be selfdefeating while reinforcing the requirement that safer medical devices be used where they are commercially available this legislation does not mandate the use of engineered controls where such controls are not commercially available neither this legislation nor the underlying standard it amends requires anyone to use any engineering control including a safer medical device where such use may jeopardize a patients safety an employees safety or where it may be medically contraindicated this legislation leaves intact all of the affirmative defenses available to employers related to the use of engineered controls under the bloodborne pathogen standard this is

1942 however arsenic is now understood to be much more toxic than we thought it was even 10 years ago in addition to more evidence on skin cancer sufficient evidence has been found to link arsenic to
