which also merits our attention on december 7 plainclothes french police raided the residence in and around paris of a number of antikhomeini iranian refugees who are sympathizers of the mojahedin resistance movement in iran several dozen of the refugees were arrested and some were reportedly roughed up in the process overnight 14 of them were deported against their will to the west african country of gabon the french government says it arrested and expelled the antikhomeini iranian exiles for pressing reasons of national security reportedly however these people have lived peacefully for years on french soil they have not caused disturbances and as i said most are political refugees a couple of them are married to french nationals and had enjoyed special residency rights among them also are two refugees whose asylum had been granted originallyby britain and sweden it has been said that the deportation of these individuals is part of a complicated secret agreement worked out with the ayatollah khomeinis government in the first step two french hostages kindnaped by proiranian terrorists in lebanon were freed on november 27 two days later an unacciedited iranian diplomat suspected of masterminding a series of bloody bombings in paris in 1986 and wanted by french police was allowed to leave the country my colleagues will remember that the french police had surrounded the iranian embassy in an earlier attempt to obtain this individual after this diplomat was granted safe passage a french diplomat was released from tehran there had been reports that money and arms were also involved in the deal and this aspect of the deal had been criticized by the united states and by other countries our own experience has demonstrated that paying ransom to hostage takers encourages further acts of terrorism but aside from the inherent problems involved with armsforhostages deals with iran it should certainly not be a part of any deal in which the lives and liberties of refugees seeking escape from persecution should be endangered any compassionate person feels some empathy with the efforts of the french government to obtain release of french hostages the taking of hostages is a matter of grave concern for al the countries whose citizens become victims of such terrorist acts but the issue we must focus on is frencs approach to winning the release of hostages when lives are potentially being traded for other lives the price may be too high ironically the expulsion of the iranian refugees took place on the day that is set aside to commemorate the signing of the u n human rights declarationa document inspired by frances own epocal declaration in 1789 i would add that it has been only days since the u n general assembly condemned the iranian regime for the brutal torture and execution of its own citizens as representatives of a free people and as compassionate people i think we must do what we can to see that the lives of these people who oppose a regime almost every country in the world has condemned are protected the actions of the french government have aroused the protests of even frances closest allies who had expected france to adhere to the painful but ultimately effective policy of not negotiating with terrorists the unitedstates state department said in its statement we would regret any action which would enccourage more terrorism particularly if it also prolonged the agony of other hostages prime minister thatcher denounced this decision and other british officials said it created a dangerous precedent that could affect other countries attempts to recover hostages even the french secretary of state for human rights told a human rights commission at the national assembly he had doubts and reservations about the expulsions many other french dignitaries have described their governments decision as a shame for their country which has a tradition of providing shelter for political refugees who fight against fascism and terrorism the high commissioners for refugees has said that questions remain about the expulsions and his organization is seeking satisfactory answers from the french government france faced some embarrassment when it admitted that two of the expelled iranians were only visiting france they had been granted refugee status by britain and sweden these two have been released from gabon the very fact that the two have been welcomed back by their countries of original asylum brings into question the french governments original claim that they were threats to national security elysee palace has received thousands of telegrams and letters of protest from government representatives and from citizens since these events took place i circulated a letter here in the house and many of you signed on the text of the letter has been conveyed by telex to president miterrand i think the protest of the french actions has had some modest impact two of the expelled refugees as i said have been released from gabon but 12 remain right here i wish to invite those of my colleagues who have not yet signed the letter to join us the welfare of the refugees is now a matter of concern on two fronts there is the obvious concern that khomeini might get his hands on these people the refugees have also begun a hunger strike which is being joined now by others in the united states and france a physician who examined the refugees in gabon says their condition is critical according to international norms and standards the government of france is responsible for the safety of these refugees i would call on the french government to do what is necessary to see that these people are returned safely to france protests picket lines and hunger strikes are now going on in front of the elysee palace and here in washington outside the french embassy perhaps these actions are beginning to have an effect the new york times on december 15 stated that mr chirac has modified the explanation for the expulsions which was first h11661 voiced by his colleague mr pasqua a presidential representative has talked to the protesters in front of elysee palace although the requests of the protesters have obviously not been fully met no free country can afford to comply with khomeinis demands because by complying we turn control of the situation over to khomeini i invite my colleagues to pay special attention to this matter so that the lives of the expelled iranian political refugees may be protected and so that they might be returned to the protection of france"], [0.00028449296951293945, 0.9997155070304871,

make the hard choices necessary to reduce the federal budget deficit however the main rationale for restoring the trigger was to put pressure on the president to face the deficits which have accumulated during his presidency having restored the trigger we have also committed ourselves to producing a responsible reconciliationbill and appropriationbills which in the aggregate will prevent sequestration if the house passed the reconciliation bill which is now before us we will have taken a positive step toward giving the american people and the president a choice between acrosstheboard mindless budget cuts and a reasoned package which combines responsible spending reductions and prudent revenue increases let us be clear about the significance of todays vote a vote against this reconciliation bill is a vote in favor of sequestration a vote against this reconciliation bill will undermine the budget summit and send a very negative signal to our financial markets as chairman of the committee on ways and means i would like to describe the spending reductions and revenue increases which were developed by the committee and are contained in titles ix and x i the total deficit reduction reported by the ways and means committee is 14 billion in fiscal year 1988 and 62 billion for the 3year budget window the committee has more than met its outlay reduction instruction under reconciliation and has satisfied the revenue requirement placed on the committeeby the passage of house joint resolution 324 to avoid sequestration for fiscal year 1988 these totals break down to 1 6 billion in outlay reductions and 12 billion in revenues for fiscal year 1988 through 1990 the outlay reductions are 8 billion and revenue increases are equal to 53 bllion let me discuss each of these packages separately title ix of the recon ciliation bill contains the committees spending cuts the committee on ways and means was assigned savings in the medicare program of 1 5 billion in fiscal year 1988 and 8 7 billion over 3 years the medicare provisions of the committee package together with the provisions of the recently enacted debt ceiling bill reduce spending by 1 6 billion in fiscal year 1988 and 9 0 billion over 3 years the medicare provisions are carefully designed to achieve the assigned savings targets in a balanced fashion the committee distributes the reductions fairly amonghospitals and physi clans and does not affect beneficiaries in fact a committee provision that strengthens the participating physician program should reduce outofpocket health costs of the elderly and disabled by increasing the payment differential to 5percent the committee hopes to encourage more physi cians to agree always to accept the octber29 1987 h 9168 october 29 1987 coi medicare reimbrusement as paymentinfull partricipating physicians now provide over 40 percent of medicare physician services the medicare provisions of the reconciliation bill are immeasurably preferable to a grammrudman sequester under a sequester all hospitals would receive an increasein medicare payments in fiscal year 1988 equal to 0 3 percent under the committee package hospitals generally receive a 1percent increase and hospitals in large cities and rural areas receive a 2 percent increase moreover the reconciliation legislation blocks administration changes in capital reimbursement bad debt payments and outlier case policy all of which could reduce payments to hospitals significantly in order to improve the financial solvency of the pension benefit guaranty corporation the committee agreed to increase the annual insurance premium charged to single employer defined benefit pension plans and to impose a variable rate premium on underfunded plans the committee also agreed to recommendations relating to the minimum funding standards for underfunded plans employer access to plan assets in overfunded plans and the termination of underfunded plans the committee on education and labor has also reported recommendations regarding the pbgc while these provisions differ from those reported by the committee on ways and means the differences will be worked out in conference title ix also provides a 2year authorization of appropriations for the unitedstates international trade commission the office of the unitedstates trade representative and the unitedstates customs service at levels which will allow these agencies to effectively carry out our trade laws the authorization for the unitedstates customs service would not only restore the administrations proposed cut of 2 000 customs personnel but would add 800 new positions for commercial operations to be funded out of the customsuserfee account this increase in customs personnel coupled with the modifications in this bill to expand and improve the customs userfee account shoud result in a significant increase in revenue collections by customs title ix also includes 19

1, "i am pleased to join my colleagues in this special order to respond to charges made by some of our colleagues on the other side of this aisle regarding the way those of us in the majority have exercised our leadership during this congress in particular i am deeply disappointedand frankly perplexedby republican charges that too many commemorative resolutions are considered by the house as chairman of the subcommittee on census and population which has jurisdiction over resolutions designating commemorative periods it has always been my impression that the commemorative process represents one of the most bipartisan efforts we undertake in congress it is no secret that both democrats and republicans sponsor and cosponsor these resolutions and members from both parties eagerly request a few minutes on the floor to express their support of a commemorative in which they have a personal interest in fact the very nature of the commemorative process is bipartisan since the resolutions are brought up under unanimous consent obviously this is not an arbitrary exercise of the power of the majority in fact under unanimous consent it is the minority member who controls the floor time when commemoratives are considered if there is no objection on the floor to the resolutionand there is very opportunity to objectthen presumably every member of the house republican and democrat agree to passage of the bill and during my tenure as chairman in the 100th congress i have yet to have any member approach me to say they object to bringing commemoratives to the floor it seems to me that the republican leadership was so intent on finding fault with the majority leadership in the house that it decided to complain even about a legislative process which is clearly and unarguably bipartisan in both its approach and result the subcommittees distinguished ranking minority member mrs morelia and i have gone out of our way to accommodate both republican and democratic members who have sponsored these resolutions and to simplify the process as much as possible so that the maximum benefit is gained without placing an undue burden on any sponsors or cosponsors there may be faults with our current procedures for bringing commemorative resolutions to the floor but the democrats and republicans must take equal responsibility for any problems which exist it is simply ludicrous to suggest that democrats alone are to blame for the number of commemoratives considered by the house when members from both parties sponsor cosponsor and support these resolutions i should point out that proposals have been made to reform the commemorative process and i have not ignored them very recently the gentlelady from rhode island wrote to me regarding her legislation to establish a federal commission to consider commemorative designations i promptly wrote back on her legislation clearly democrats are not abusing any power they have as majority members to control the commemorative process to the detriment of minority members let me depart from my prepared text and cite another example the gentleman from pennsylvania a republican has introduced a piece of legislation to change the way in which the census bureau does its business the census bureau is opposed to the legislation tiie distinguished chairman of the subcommittee on constitutional rights the gentleman from california is opposed to the legislation the mexicanamerican legal defense and education fund is opposed to the legislation i am opposed to the legislation yet the gentleman from pennsylvania has been given not one hearing but he is going to get two hearings one in washington dc conducted by me and another one conducted by the chairman of the full committee on post office and civil service in the field the gentleman from pennsylvania will have ample opportunity despite the fact that we have serious constitutional problems about his bill to air his grievance let me also take a moment to address another point which i believe to be implicit in the criticism of commemorative resolutions the idea that the periods we choose to designate are not worthwhile columnist david s broder in his commentary on the republican challenge referred to commemorative resolutions as junk legislation and trivia but a closer look at the commemorative bills we have considered in the house during the 100th congress will reveal that the vast majority of these bills deal with topics of great concern to many of the people we are elected to represent and every resolution we consider is of interest to someone back home i for one have no qualms about spending a few minutes of my time each week as an elected official to honor former prisoners of war and women veterans visiting nurses and unitedstates inventors public employees and income tax assistance volunteers i see nothing wrong with recognizing the vast array of cultures which together make up the diverse society of which we are so proud the heritage of the jewish people greeks lithuanians germans polish americans and african americans i do not consider it a waste of my time to call more public attention to problems faced by the victims of crime to the importance of child care programs to the need for better health care in rural areas to the sad reality of child and elderly abuse to the environmental benefits of recycling and to the saving grace of hospice care for the terminally ill and no mr broder i certainly see nothing trivial in educating the public about diseases and serious health problems which often cannot be prope~ly dealt with due to a lack of public awareness a lack of adequate research funds or a general misconception about the nature of the illness not too long ago we knew little about the dangers of reyes syndrome lupus and high cholestorol levels the crippling nature of osteoporosis and tuberous sclerosis the availability of treatment for persons with eating disorders digestive diseases and tratuarelated symptoms it may be a little selfserving but i like to think that this nation has made great strides in medical care and promoting better health because of the many dedicated individuals including public officials who often volunteer their time to educate their communities about illnesses which may be rare but treatable or common but too often ignored no mr broder it is not a waste of my time to pass a simple resolution which calls attention to the alarmingly high and disproportionate rates of cancer among blacks hispanics and other minorities and to give some small measure of recognition to the tireless dedicated physicians who or ganized the first national symposium last year on minorities and cancer in an effort to reduce the incidence of cancer in minority communities that resolution which i sponsored prompted many local governments to pass similar resolutions and organize community sponsored events to pro mote improved awareness among nit norifles of the availability and nee lty of early treat miuint for cancer but equally tniaortent fromr my point of view lu that this resolimtviti passed by democrats and republicans in congress and signed by the presi dent said to a dedicated team of doctors that we are not ignoring their critical work and that we appreciate their efforts and sacrifices on behalf of their fellow human beings for the minimal amount of time it took for my colleagues to add their names as cosponsors of the resolution and the small amount of time it took for me to bring the resolution before the house it was the least we could do and hopefully only the beginning which leads me to my final point i get the impression that my repub lican colleagues believe the congress spends too much time on commemorative resolutions frankly i fail to see the problem here as subcommittee chairman it takes me no more than 10 to 15 minutes once a week if at all to bring the resolutilons up under unanimous consent after the business of the house is completed sponsors or supporters of the resolutions may take a few minutes to ad"], [0.000284731388092041, 0.999715268611908, 1, "i want to take a moment to recognize a monumental loss

the ideals and of the people who struggled for and gained independence however our education and the education of our children on the american revolution has been inadequate we and our children have not been taught the full history of our foundation as mr maurice barboza of the patriots foundation stated in his testimony before the subcommittee on national parks there were many blacks who made prominent contributions in the fight for freedom among them was james lafayette a spy who gathered vital information from general cornwallis that led to the final victory at yorktown yet the contributions of james lafayette and the estimated 5 000 other black patriots who fought in battle for their and their future nations freedom have ominously been missing from most of our history books but today we are in the process of rectifying our past neglect in recognizing the contributions of black patriots by establishing a place of honor to house the black revolutionary war patriots memorial by placing the memorial among the great monuments of lincoln and washington an area of frequent and large public visitation the memorial will serve to educate the public about the valuable contributions of black patriots and will be a catalyst for people to seek additional knowledge this memorial does not bring to light just black history but american history plain and simplel history

visionan america of opportunity without poverty and prejudicewas not an idle dream spun from wishful thinking and fanciful imagination rather it was built on a solid understanding of history lie understood how history in even its subtlest forms shaped his generations behavior in the declaration of independence the revo lutlonary war the constitution the underground railroad the civil war jim crow and the relationship between master and slave he found the answers these answers ie knewthrough the exertion of intellect nonviolent action and perseverancecould unravel the mistakes of history that bound america to bigotry we have the same opportunity to influence history but few of us today have dr kings clear vision of the future and his scholarly understanding of the past thoseparticularly childrenwho see only his dream may never come to understand the skills intellect and sacrifices needed to attain it dr kings dream grew out of an unshakable confidence in the principles upon which the nation was founded and in the capacity of all americans to change ie had faith in white people because he knew that since colonial america there always had been some sympathetic whites and that their ranks would swell if their brethren could be made to understand lie had faith in blacks because each generation for 300 years had made its own contribution to attaining this dream from slave ship to the summit of the supreme court the great poet langston hughes summed up the determination of the 12 generations that preceded dr kings birth in his verse the line of progress dr king said is never straight often it feels as though you were moving backward but in fact you are moving ahead since his death we have traveled 20 years down the road toward the promised land some may say little has really changed too many blacks still can trace their ancestry in an unbroken chain of poverty and lack of educational opportunity back to slavery incidents that occur periodically in places such as howard beach n y and forsythe county ga remind us of the sad fact that average black and white americans are by and large strangers to each other in their own cities and townscaptives of mutual ignorance distrust and the legacy of bigotry but the sounds of barking dogs shouted racial epithets crackling gunfire belching firehoses and shattering stainedglass win dows are merely echoes from a former time of unbridled racial hatred now the true cost of their meals and lodging may never occur to a black family traveling the highway that connects north and south lowever the agony over what appears to be a loss of ground has given way to the sound of silent despairno less frightening and a new generation of anguished black men live lonely jobless streetcorner existences on the avenues where dr king once marched and decried the lack of progress on jobs and education but there are hopeful signs that the crooked road can be made straight in a growing black middle class a reemcrgence of our cities maturing black political influence in congress and across the land a slowly expanding cadre of black professionals who move more easily in the business world and there is the periodic rise of a black person to prominence as the mayor of a large city tile owner of a major corporation as national security adviser or as a viable presidential candidate americans have become uneasy with injustice here and abroad even while some remain uneasy with living working and going to school with blacks and minorities and voting for political candidates who are not white however i believe that practically every american would like to rid himself of all lingering prejudices but getting to know and like each other takes time patience understanding and a different strategy than does a challenge to an unconstitutional law or discrimination in housing employment and education during the past four decades many barriers that kept blacks from realistically striving for economic and political wellbeing have been torn down yet still standing are mental barrierserected just after the mayflowerthat perpetuate prejudice and racial separation and dampen the urge to excel inaccurate images of blacks minorities women ethnic groups and even whites that may flash momentarily across a persons mind while meeting someone of a different background or sex are not the result of conscious thinking but of generations of conditioning the suppression of history was intended to keep certain people in their place subtle prejudice like lint on the soul is hard to get out of ones system and so it remains an unspoken influence on how americans view each other in order to change this we must begin to look inside ourselves to try harder to understand each other and what makes us unique as individuals as well as one people it will require educational programs starting earili er in our childrens development that stress accurate history it will require an increasing awareness in the television motion picture and publishing industries of our history as it actually was and black actors portraying the full panoply of human emotions so as to depict their complete humanity and in november secretary of the interior donald p hodel took an important step that a generation from now could change completely ihe way americans see each other

freedom the 180 000 black soldiers who were critical to the winning of the civil war and the fact that thousands of blacks had secured freedom for themselves and their descendants generations before

new healthy dialogue about americas past while helping to shape its future its existence on the countrys most important and visible land will help to liberate the nations spirit because in the words

more narrowly as a result many eligible individuals are not being reached in many states disabilities attributable to physical impairments such as cerebral palsy and epilepsy or developmental disabilities attributable to a combination of mental and physical impairments are not reached by the advocacy and planning of the state councils which administer this program the bill before us would require each state to develop a process to identify those individuals and report to congress on ways of fully serving the developmentally disabled population states would be required to hold public hearings to bring out the views and recommendations of developmentally disabled individuals and advocacy organizations the goal of the program is to assure that persons with developmental disabilities receive the care treatment and other services necessary to enable them to achieve their maximum potential through increased independence productivity and integration into the community the failure of states to properly respond to the definition of developmental disabilities now results in this program being an unfulfilled promise to 1 million individuals and their families it is certainly my hope

requested increases of that magnitude for the coast guard and for the faa it is within however the summit agreement because it is only 1 7 percent over last years bill and the summit agreement said that we could be up to 2 percent over last years bill there is a 15 9percent increase in money for the coast guard including that that comes from the defense appropriations subcommittee there is a 15

administration that makes for a very tight bill the bill includes 10 8 billion in new budget authority it is indeed 2 billion over the presidents budget request but that is because the president requested increases of that magnitude for the coast guard and for the faa it is within however the summit agreement because it is only 1 7 percent over last years bill and the summit agreement said that we could be up to 2 percent over last years bill there is a 15 9percent increase in money for the coast guard including that that comes from the defense appropriations subcommittee there is a 15 4percent increase for the federal aviation administration those are two very substantial increases 15 percent and 15 percent amtrak is funded and just under 3 3 billion is provided for the urban mass transportation administration it is as i have said within both our 302 b allocation and within the allowances provided for by the summit agreement as in past years the office of management and budget has objected to every instance in which we changed from the presidents budget request of course i think that it is important to recognize that this body has some right to set its priorities it may disagree in some cases with priorities presented by the administration but we have equally bright people here to try to examine the priorities for our national transportation system and to allocate funds based on our priorities as well as those of the administration the transportation appropriations bill is a good bill the subcommittee has worked hard i hope the subcommittee will stick together and the committee will stick together in continuing this bill on the floor i do not want to continue to filibuster here but i see that some conference may be taking place to my right i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from texas a member of the subcommittee"], [0.3546878844499588, 0.1453121155500412, 0, "i thank the gentlewoman from ohio for her comments i do not want to go over the same ground that the chairman has already gone over so ably he has laid out the bill accurately and in a form which i hope makes it intelligible to all the members of the house but i do want to make a couple of observations on the bill first anyone who thinks that the budget process is not grabbing us very tight at least when it comes to discretionary spending has only to look at this bill and he or she will see immediately that this is a very difficult process indeed and one which is very drastically constricting spending there is much that i would like to do that i am sure the chairman would like to do and that all the members of this house would like to do that we cannot do because there are only so many dollars i guess the no 1 example i have in this bill is the area alluded to by the chairman the national science foundation where we are not able to meet the full request of the administration i think the administration was right to seek to expand the national science foundation their target is over a 5year period to double the funding for the foudation that is an important investment for the future of this country and one that i think the administration is right to ask for there are only so many dollars to go around and we had to make some hard choices and that was one choice we made a second comment i would like to make is about the space station i think members of the house when they vote for this bill today ought to understand that they are undertaking a very serious commitment for the future i would like to read just a couple of excerpts from the transmittal letter of the report of the national research council to the white house on the space station the letter is dated september 10 1987 in that report the national research council states the space station program will be the most ambitious space project the nation has ever undertaken it will require tens of billions of dollars over a period of several decades and will absorb much of the energy of nasa for most of that period it will entwine for many years our space program with those of our international partners and it will be a highly visible symbol of the american commitment to remain a leader among spacefaring nations thus the space station program must have enduring stable support across administrations and this support must be generous enough to provide adequate hardware and testing provisions to ensure that it can be operated safely for decades and an adequate space transportation system for its deployment assembly and operation i think members of this house and particularly those who serve on the budget committee ought to understand that as we move past the definition stage of the space station with this bill and move on to its production we are undertaking a very serious very important and very expensive commitment we cannot have a situation where next year as the budget committee is trying to make ends meet suddenly someone decides that 1 billion can easily come out of the space program as the budget committee initially proposed this year we are undertaking a commitment here and when we vote for this bill we ought to know we are undertaking that commitment and we ought to be prepared to live up to it all of us in future years there is a lot more i would like to see done particularly in the housing area which is the area in which i have grown up in public life we have been able to make some modest increments in terms of public housing but certainly the program level we are proposing 5 000 units a year is very very modest indeed compared to what the program had been in some past years and certainly very modest in terms of the need that is out there as evidenced by the homeless problem in conclusion this is a very tough bill it is a very tight bill and i urge my colleagues to support it"], [0.3782971426844597, 0.12170285731554031, 0, "i am in support of the endangered species act i am in support of this refreshing open rule i am not here to ask for anything to be removed from the list of the endangered species in fact it is almost revolutionary but i am here to ask that my colleagues add to the endangered species list i have met with epa not too long ago and there is nowhere in the provisions of this act that will allow human life and the protection of human life to be considered in the formula or in the consideration of any program or highway project or projects human life and protection of human life has not been permitted as a consideration and they say the act does not allow them to consider human life i am simply asking that we be allowed under this rule to include the consideration and the protection of our children and our neighbors as a part of the formula in addressing our environment we have projects around this country that will save human lives and i have one in my district and yet we cannot consider the protection of our children and human life as a part of the formula that will allow us to protect our endangered species i want to express my thanks again for this open rule i commend those who have made it possible and i will support the bill and i will have

this bill is a collection of a number of different wildlife bills that have earlier been passed by the house these bills have been put together in one package in the senate and are being returned to
